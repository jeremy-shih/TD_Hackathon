[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Phil De Sousa, Vice President of Investor Relations.","Phil De Sousa","Thank you, Lori. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Xylem's Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. With me today are Chief Executive Officer, Patrick Decker; and Chief Financial Officer, Michael Speetzen. They will provide their perspective on Xylem's quarterly results and discuss the full year outlook for 2014. Following our prepared remarks, we will address questions related to the information covered on the call. [Operator Instructions] We anticipate that today's call will last approximately 1 hour.

Actual events or results could differ materially from those anticipated.","Now please turn to Slide 3, and I'll turn the call over to our CEO, Patrick Decker.","Patrick K. Decker","Thanks, Phil, and thank you all for joining us this morning. 2014 continues to be a critical year in the evolution of Xylem and the third quarter results we announced today reflect continued progress on our journey. By now, I hope you've all had a chance to review our press release and other earnings materials. So I'll provide you with some headline thoughts and perspective on the quarter, our progress and a look ahead, so let's get started. Our teams are squarely focused on execution and as a result, we are delivering the fifth consecutive quarter of revenue and earnings growth as well as margin expansion. Our ability, both to accelerate growth and continue to increase the efficiency of our operations is key to our success and ultimately, the key to increasing shareholder value. So let's get into the third quarter performance. Organic revenue growth was 1% while orders increased 8%. As a result, we exited the third quarter with record backlog up 12% versus the prior year. We're continuing to focus on building our longer cycle backlog, which will help extend our visibility and ultimately support a longer term growth profile. I am encouraged by these results but the fact remains that some of our end markets are still challenged and continue to be slow to recover. Furthermore, we are cautiously monitoring economic conditions in key geographic markets particularly in Europe. Operating margin expanded 40 basis points to a record third quarter level of 13.9%. This reflects continued progress on improving execution across Xylem.","Just a few more comments on our overall performance. We improved our year-to-date free cash flow by $104 million versus the same period a year ago. On the capital deployment front, we opportunistically repurchased an additional $30 million in common stock. This brings our full year repurchases to $130 million. And in the aggregate, the total return of capital to shareholders via repurchases and dividends increased year-to-date to $201 million, an increase of $94 million over the prior-year period, demonstrating our ongoing commitment to increasing shareholder value through disciplined capital deployment. To wrap up the third quarter results, volume growth and improved operating performance drove earnings per share of $0.53, up 8% over the prior year. On a year-to-date basis, we have generated $1.35 in earnings per share, an increase of 21% versus the same period a year ago.","We have delivered a solid performance in the first 9 months of the year. Importantly, our results show that we are moving the company in the right direction, and we remain on track to deliver our 2014 commitments.","Now turning to Slide 4. We announced this morning that we are tightening our full year EPS guidance, reflecting both our performance today and our outlook for the fourth quarter. Given recent volatility in the foreign exchange rates, we now expect to generate approximately $3.9 billion in revenues. In terms of operating income, we expect to improve our operating margin to approximately 13% and to deliver earnings per share growth of 15% to 19%. Shortly after I joined Xylem about 7 months ago, I discussed a number of focused areas that we identified as opportunities to improve our operating efficiency and accelerate growth. While there's not time this morning to cover in detail all the work that's underway, I did want to mention a few areas in which we continue to make good progress. All of our teams have been focused on improving execution and specifically, driving productivity for growth. For example, over the past couple of years, our Applied Water division has redoubled its efforts to get cost out of the system and streamline their processes. As a result, they have been able to reinvest some of those savings into R&D and innovation, which has led to new products that are hitting the marketplace now and there's much more to come. We are confident that this will ultimately return that part of our business to better the market growth. Importantly, they're accelerating innovation while continuing to improve their operating performance. In the third quarter, the Applied Water division delivered an all-time high operating margin and that was achieved in an environment of mixed market conditions. Now we are still in the early days of this work, but I am pleased with this measurable progress. We've also discussed the opportunity for Xylem to accelerate growth by integrating our front-end commercial assets and capabilities. In addition to the realignment of our sales organizations, we have also been working to develop a multifaceted IT solution that will better enable commercial excellence across the company. In other words, making it easier for customers to do business with us and for our sales teams to have the right tools to reduce quote preparation time, share customer leads from one business line to another and work within a more standard ERP system. This will enable our sales teams to accelerate growth and will be a fully integrated set of solution that is rolled out globally. Let me touch on 1 component of that work, deployment of a new customer relationship management or CRM platform. Over the last few months, a dedicated team has been designing and programming our new sales and marketing process. They have worked at a fervid pace and as a result, we recently launched our new CRM tool, salesforce.com, in several businesses across our Americas region and Australia. This was an important milestone. CRM allows us to present ourselves to key customers as one company, capitalizing on the unparalleled expertise we possess in multiple verticals, bring greater value to our customers, while growing our own business. This rollout will continue, and we expect to have it fully deployed by the end of 2016 and I do look forward to sharing some successes on this front in the coming months.","Finally, we're also continuing to execute our plans to accelerate growth by focusing our resources and efforts in faster growth regions, namely in emerging markets. For the quarter, revenues from emerging markets increased 10% and the team succeeded in winning some larger project bids that are increasing our backlog. We intend to intensify this focus and sharpen our strategy in order to capitalize on attractive opportunities we see in these developing regions. As we look to 2015, China and the Middle East will be the most important areas for us to accelerate further localization of our supply chain and building stronger local capabilities. Other fast-growth markets such as Brazil, India and greater Asia remain important to us, and we will be further assessing specific growth accelerators in those markets as well. I firmly believe that no company is better positioned than Xylem to lead in this industry. Our ability to leverage our global footprint and breadth of solutions and expertise to address our customers' most complex water issues and deliver strong results is unmatched. But we must execute aggressively and continue to evolve our organization and make the most of our global assets and strength of our team. With that, let me turn the call over to our CFO, Mike Speetzen, to walk you through the results and the company's financial position in more detail. Mike?","Michael T. Speetzen","Thanks, Patrick. Please turn to Slide 5. We generated revenue of $963 million, essentially flat to the prior year reflecting both the impacts of our divestiture and unfavorable foreign exchange translation. On an organic basis, revenue was up 1%. From an end market perspective, we saw strength in industrial and commercial, partially offset by declines in public utility and residential. Industrial was up 3% with growth in the U.S. and emerging markets, partially offset by weakness in Europe. As a reminder, Xylem serves a wide variety of industrial customers with applications from both our segments. As for the third quarter specifically, we generated industrial growth in the Water Infrastructure segment and had flat performance in Applied Water. I'll cover both of these in more detail in the next 2 slides. In commercial, strong markets across all regions helped us drive 6% growth in the quarter. Europe was exceptionally strong, up double digits with growth primarily attributable to the successful launch of new products. In the U.S, leading indicators have been generally positive for several quarters, and we are starting to see the impact of that recovery in our business. Wrapping up in commercial, we continue to see strong performance out of the emerging markets particularly in regions such as the Middle East and Asia and Latin America, where each delivered double-digit growth. Revenue from the public utility end market was down 3%, slightly below our expectations. The year-over-year decline primarily reflects the continuation of a soft CapEx order environment in developed regions that we experienced last year and during the first half of 2014. It's important to note that our order trends in this market have generally improved in recent quarters. We are seeing some positive signs in our long-term backlog, suggesting that the market has stabilized. OpEx activity remains stable with growth in both the U.S. and Europe. I'll cover up more specifics by segment but overall, we saw strong revenue growth from emerging markets, up 10% and modest growth in the U.S, up 4%, partially offset by a 6% decline in Europe.","Operating income of $134 million, was up $4 million or 3% over last year. As Patrick mentioned, despite modest top line growth, we delivered a record third quarter operating margin of 13.9%, up 40 basis points. We continue to deliver strong segment performance as margins expanded 110 basis points to 15.6%. This was partially offset by higher corporate expense. Corporate expense was $16 million reflecting a normal quarterly spend rate. Cost reductions totaled $46 million and included approximately $10 million of restructuring savings with the balance coming from sourcing and lean initiatives. Partially offsetting these tailwinds, was inflation of approximately 270 basis points and unfavorable price and mix in our Water Infrastructure segment. Wrapping up on the consolidated results, organic growth and solid operational performance coupled with strong execution against our cost-reduction initiatives resulted in EPS of $0.53, up 8% versus the prior year. Core operations drove the year-over-year EPS improvement contributing $0.03. Growth includes $0.04 of restructuring savings, as well as $0.03 of year-over-year corporate expense headwind. And finally, lower share count contributed a benefit of $0.01 in the quarter.","Now let me provide more details for each of our reporting segments. Please turn to Slide 6. Water Infrastructure reported revenue of $619 million, up 1% on an organic basis. Regionally, we saw the most significant growth come from emerging markets, which were up 13%. U.S. revenue increased 7% but Europe declined 7% overall. I further summarize our revenue performance as follows: Test applications were up 4%, posting growth for the fourth consecutive quarter. I'll note that based on performance to date and expected growth on fourth quarter, this platform is on track to achieve record full year top line performance; transport was up 3% overall with noteworthy regional differences. In the U.S. we continue to see strong performance in industrial transport applications, including mid-teens growth in dewatering; in Europe, the business was down low single digits primarily due to lower book-and-bill activity in France and the ramp down of the AMP5 cycle in the U.K. Finally, treatment revenue was down 15%. This decline reflects the lower deliverable project backlog in the U.S. and Europe that we had entering the quarter, and the timing of projects in emerging markets. While we delivered minimal revenue growth overall, perhaps a more important result was our strong orders performance. For the third quarter, we booked orders of $680 million, up $63 million or 10% year-over-year and 11% on an organic basis. During the fourth quarter, Water Infrastructure has a total backlog of $656 million. Of this amount, $380 million is scheduled to deliver in the fourth quarter, an increase of $27 million or 8% relative to a year ago. The balance is scheduled to be delivered in 2015 and beyond.","For the third quarter, we're reporting operating income of $97 million and operating margin of 15.7%. Performance was driven by the increase in organic volume and savings from cost reductions, which totaled $29 million, including approximately $7 million in restructuring savings with the balance coming from sourcing and lean initiatives. Partially offsetting these tailwinds was inflation of approximately 3% as well as unfavorable price and mix.","Let me now turn into Slide #7 to address our Applied Water segment. We delivered revenue of $362 million, up 1% year-over-year. Regionally, we saw growth come from the U.S. and emerging markets, which were both up 2% overall. Europe, however declined 1%. By application, building services grew 2% and industrial water was flat. Irrigation, which represents less than 10% of Applied Water revenue, was down 2%. I further summarize our revenue performance as follows: In the U.S, we generated broad based growth across both commercial and industrial water applications. Our emerging market performance was driven by mid-teens growth in China and was partially offset by weakness in Eastern Europe and Latin America. As I mentioned, Europe was down overall as weakness in residential and general industrial markets was partially offset by strength in commercial.","Operating margin expanded 240 basis points to 14.6% year-over-year, a record level for this segment. Cost savings from sourcing and Lean Six Sigma and to a lesser extent restructuring, increased margins by 440 basis points and more than offset inflation. We also saw a positive lift from volume and price.","Now let's turn to Slide 8 to cover the company's financial position. Xylem maintains a strong cash position with a balance of $529 million at the end of Q3, with approximately 90% held outside of the U.S. We remain committed to our balanced capital deployment strategy, which is to maintain and grow the business while also enhancing shareholder return through dividends and share repurchases. Over the last 3 quarters, we invested $77 million into capital expenditures and we returned $201 million to shareholders. This includes the 10% increase in dividend per share and $130 million under our share repurchase program. We also generated $176 million of free cash flow, largely reflecting higher income and lower CapEx spends. Relative to the prior year, our free cash flow performance improved by $104 million, with free cash flow conversion increasing to 77% from 45% last year.","Please turn to Slide 9, and I'll turn it back over to Patrick to cover our 2014 guidance.","Patrick K. Decker","Thanks, Mike. So let's start with the top line. We anticipate 2014 revenue of approximately $3.9 billion, which reflects organic growth of 2% to 3%. For Water Infrastructure, we expect organic revenue growth of 3% to 4%. And for Applied Water, revenues will likely be flat to up 1% organically. I'll remind everyone that the revenue range already reflects the reduction in revenue attributable to the U.K. Valves business we divested and now also reflects approximately $30 million of unfavorable foreign exchange translation that we expect to impact our fourth quarter results. Segment margins are anticipated to be in the range of 14.3% to 14.6% and operating margins are projected to be in the range of 12.9% to 13.2%. We are pleased with the execution of our broad-based restructuring actions this year from which we expect to achieve savings of $17 million. This adds to the carryover savings of $25 million from actions executed in 2013 and brings our total savings to $42 million. Excluded from our overall results is 2014 restructuring and realignment cost of approximately $40 million to $50 million, $11 million gain on sale of our U.K. Valves business and special tax items. So overall, we now anticipate delivering earnings per share of $1.92 to $1.98 and I would highlight that our mid-point guidance remains unchanged at $1.95. Mike is going to walk you through the full year and fourth quarter details in a few minutes but first, let me provide some additional highlights around our end market outlooks.","Please turn to Slide 10. This slide summarizes our expected 2014 organic revenue performance by end market. Beginning with industrial, our largest end market representing 45% of total revenues, through the first 9 months, organic revenue was up 3%, slightly better-than-expected driven by strength in the U.S. and emerging markets. For the full year, we expect revenues to come in toward the high end of a 1% to 3% range. This assumes continued growth in the U.S. and emerging markets and that conditions in Europe do not deteriorate further. Public Utility at 34% of total revenue is our second largest end market. Through the first 9 months, organic revenue grew 3%, reflecting strong emerging market performance and stable maintenance of repair activity in the U.S. and Europe. While we do expect some organic growth in the fourth quarter, there is potential risk for delays in some project schedule to ship before year end. With that said, we have adjusted our full year expectation for Public Utilities to 1% to 3% from our previous outlook of 2% to 5%. 1 final note on Public Utilities. Given the positive third quarter order performance and the current view on our project pipelines, we remain positive on this sector in 2015.","Moving to commercial, which represents approximately 11% of our revenue, we are maintaining our full year outlook, which calls for flat performance year-over-year. In addition to the flat year-to-date performance, this outlook reflects growth from new product launches and an improving outlook for our U.S. business offset by weakness in Europe. There is also no change to our residential market outlook. We continue to expect low single-digit growth, driven by the U.S. housing recovery, partially offset by continued weakness in Southern Europe.","And lastly, at just 3% of our business, we expect full year agricultural revenues to be flat year-over-year. So the takeaway here is that we continue to see mixed market conditions particularly by region. U.S. non-res markets have shown signs of improvement. Public Utility OpEx remains generally stable and the CapEx environment appears to be incrementally better. We are, of course, closely monitoring Europe.","So please turn to Slide 11, and I'll turn it back to Mike to cover some additional details on the guidance.","Michael T. Speetzen","I'd like want to spend a minute calibrating on the evolution of our full year guidance. In February, we issued a guidance range of $1.85 to $2.00 with a mid-point of $1.93. This past July, we raised the low end of our guidance by $0.05 and the related mid-point by $0.02 to $1.95 reflecting strong first half performance, slightly offset by the divestiture impact of the U.K. Valves business. Given the significant decline in the euro, we are taking into consideration a $0.01 headwind for foreign exchange translation on the third quarter and a $0.03 headwind from foreign exchange translation in the fourth quarter. Despite this headwind, we are maintaining our midpoint guidance essentially offsetting the negative impact from foreign exchange with additional productivity.","Now let's talk about the fourth quarter. We expect revenue of slightly more than $1 billion, with organic growth in the range of 1% to 4%. Let me cover some of the key assumptions we have made relative to our revenue projection. We have assumed the U.S. dollar to euro foreign exchange rate of $1.27. We expect low single-digit organic growth in the U.S, down low single digits to flat performance in Europe and emerging market growth of more than 10%. We entered the quarter with a total of $504 million of shippable backlog, which represents approximately 49% of our expected fourth quarter revenue. This highlights the fact that we still have a fair amount of book in term business to deliver in the quarter. There are 2 other items I'd highlight with respect to our guidance. First, fourth quarter operating tax rate is expected to be approximately 21%. And second, fully diluted share count is expected to be approximately $183 million. With that said, please turn to Slide 12 and let me hand the call back over to Patrick for some final comments. Patrick?","Patrick K. Decker","Thanks again, Mike. I'm pleased with our results this quarter and encouraged by our continued progress. Solid execution has us on track to deliver on our financial commitments for the year which includes generating record revenue and earnings per share. At the same time, we continue to focus on building those important capabilities that will enable us to extend our track record, deliver sustainable growth and increase shareholder value. Despite a year of tremendous change at Xylem, our teams have remained focused on the future, identifying ways to work more efficiently and more collaboratively to leverage our full suite of products and services to our customers. This work will continue and I firmly believe that will elevate our performance across Xylem and will help us to build our position as the global leader in water. Operator, we can now begin the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ryan Connors with Janney Montgomery Scott.","Ryan M. Connors - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","I wanted to talk a little bit about the pricing environment. It wasn't something that you covered in that prepared remarks there, but I know that's been a headwind recently, seems to be stabilizing a bit, especially in Applied Water, but if you can just talk to us about kind of the pricing dynamics.","Patrick K. Decker","Yes, Ryan, let me at least cover some of the financial implications. In the third quarter, we saw about 10 basis points, which is pretty similar to what we saw in the second quarter. In a way I characterize it is Water Infrastructure continues to see price pressure in the neighborhood of about 40 basis points negative year-over-year. Applied Water, we've continued to see positive progress. They are reflecting about half a point worth of positive pricing. I think many of the dynamics that we've talked about in the past are still there and I think they were evidenced by many of our peers who reported that sales are still not at the levels that they have been historically, which means that we've got excess capacity and that's putting significant price pressure across the marketplace, as we see it today.","Michael T. Speetzen","And I would only add, Ryan, that I think it speaks to what we saw in Applied Water and I think we're going to see it elsewhere, is all the more reason is critical that we continue to ramp up our new product development pipeline. We've brought a number of things to market. We've got a number of things in the pipeline but anytime you're able to do that, it gives you something new to talk about, it gives you a competitive differentiation and is very helpful on the pricing side.","Ryan M. Connors - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","I guess the related follow-up would be as you look at this nice order growth you had in the quarter, are we to assume that those orders reflect the kind of price dynamics you just mentioned, Mike, pressure in the Water Infrastructure side and some positive -- modest positive momentum in that order boards on the Applied Water side?","Michael T. Speetzen","Yes, I mean, think in general, those will be the general characteristics that we would see and as we indicated, the order growth is predominantly in the Water Infrastructure segment. It's not only the core pumping business, for example, but we're also booking more of the project business which is a more difficult one to give you commentary on the pricing side because each one of those tend to be unique in nature.","Patrick K. Decker","And I think it's important to call out, Ryan, that of the 8% organic orders growth that we had in the quarter, roughly 3% of that was from a couple of the big projects that we announced in the emerging markets over the course of the quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Halloran of Robert W. Baird.","Michael Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","So could we just talk about a little bit about what your visibility of the 2015 is right now? Obviously, you made some positive commentary on the 2015 environment for your Public Utility side. Maybe if you could just take us a little deeper look on what you're seeing from a customer base at the end of next year? What the commentary looks like and what gives you confidence in that public Utility side?","Patrick K. Decker","Sure, right. Let me open with a few comments here and then Mike can kind of walk you through specifically what we do know about '15. I mean, I'd say, first of all, it is tough in this environment to assume or make any specific predictions at this stage. Obviously, with the typical kind of slowdown in Europe in the third quarter, it's tough to kind of draw a read in Q3. It's really from September and October and as we close out Q4, so how we close out Q4 is going to play a much bigger part in how we determine or formulate our views around '15. I would say that we are certainly planning from an internal standpoint around a low growth environment, really want to make sure we keep our teams focused on driving the productivity for growth and the cost efficiencies. We do see some mixed bright spots that are out there. Certainly, the growing backlog that we've seen, some of the longer cycle projects that we brought into the pipeline are encouraging but I say it's too early to tell right now in terms giving you read on '15.","Michael T. Speetzen","Mike, and I gave you some of the specifics where we do at least have a beat on both headwinds and tailwinds as we head into next year. I think given where the foreign exchange rates are, and I'll use the euro because it's our biggest exposure. If it's at about $1.27, we think that's going to be about a $40 million top line headwind and pose about an $0.08 EPS headwind. The reason being is we have an awful lot of profit held in the euro currency that goes through our Switzerland headquarters over in Europe. Pension, we anticipate a couple of cents worth of headwind and that's anticipating what the discount rate could be, as well some of the mortality tables that have been updated. But the good news is we have carryover restructuring savings. So the actions that we've initiated in 2014, we're picking up some of that benefit that Patrick spoke to in his prepared remarks. We should pick up about an incremental $20 million worth of savings in the first half of next year.","Michael Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","That's very helpful. And then the follow-up is, if you look at the Applied Water margins, can you just talk about the sustainability of those levels whether or not there was any stocking benefits you guys saw from the new product launches and what the right run rate on a forward basis looks like?","Michael T. Speetzen","Yes, I'd say there's certainly would have been a little bit of a stocking benefit but not enough to really move the needle. I'd say we certainly do feel that the margins in that business are sustainable. I mean when you think about the fact that the team has achieved that level of improvement despite being in a no growth environment and in some cases, actually facing headwinds, that is a business that also levers nicely whenever we see some topline growth. I actually think with the new product introduction that we're bringing onto the market right now, that's going to return us to growth in that business and I think you'll see some nice leverage fall through. So we'd expect to continue to see margin expansion in that business as we return to growth.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones of Stifel.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","When we were down at WEFTEC this year, we heard some pretty positive outlooks from people there on the project side in the U.S. Can you talk about what you're seeing in that market and maybe a little bit about globally as well?","Patrick K. Decker","Yes, Nathan, I think we're seeing that show up in our results and I'll give you just a bit of a preview around our Americas region. We saw positive orders growth. In fact, they were one of the largest components of the 8% that we saw within the quarter. The treatment business, specifically, was up, call it in the low 20s, and that's, I think, indicative of the commentary that we've given in the past, which is we've seen that market has significant headwinds over the past couple of years. This year that dynamic appears to be changing. I think for us the question is how much is dealing with pent-up project demand versus new growth and projects coming online. I think that's the piece that continues to be in the forward look that we have. But overall, I think it's a big part of why overall, we remain positive on that sector.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Just focusing in on treatment there. Obviously, some pretty negative revenue comps in this quarter, which is from weak orders historically. When do we lap that and start seeing growth based on what's already in your backlog?","Patrick K. Decker","Yes, I would anticipate us -- there'll be some lapping as we get into the first half of next year. But if you think about the nature and the timing of these projects, these can be anywhere from 12 to 18 months. So it will be more of the second half of 2015 is what I would anticipate. We obviously still have a lot of work to do to build the details up. We're in the middle of our planning process right now, so we'll provide more perspective on some of those linearity details when we provide guidance in February.","Michael T. Speetzen","And the good news on this, Nathan is that in a number of cases, part of the reason for the revenue decline was push out of projects. So the projects haven't gone away. It's just the timing has shifted to the right. So that should help us as we get into '15 as well.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","And just a follow up on Europe. Down 6% in this quarter, outlook for down low single digits in the fourth quarter. What you see is the risk there to actually just achieving that low single-digit rate with what we're seeing in Europe at the moment?","Michael T. Speetzen","Yes, I mean, Nathan, if I look at what we had in the third quarter, the 6% down, there was a good portion of that, that related to projects that's pushed out of third quarter into fourth quarter and into first quarter of 2015. So we've got a pretty good idea of what the book-to-bill rates are. The backlog levels as we go into the fourth quarter support the range that we've given and we are anticipating that we will have a little bit of weakness in our book-to-bill business. What I can tell you is that we have been monitoring our results, obviously, on a weekly basis. October is lining up consistent with the assumptions that we have built into the guidance. So we haven't seen anything at this point that tells us anything different is going to materialize.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Giannakouros of Oppenheimer.","James Giannakouros - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Seems like you're a little bit ahead of plan as far as gaining traction on your cost take out or your better efficiencies versus your plan entering the year. Can you -- if I'm correct, can you kind of highlight where exactly you're, I guess, accelerating or the sources of that incremental margin benefit versus where we were anticipating the kind of cadence for 2014 or earlier in the year?","Michael T. Speetzen","Yes, I mean, there were few things that we did, Jim. One is we've obviously, taken the restructuring savings up. That is a direct reflection of the fact that given some of the weakness we saw earlier in the year, the teams move out more aggressively to make sure we were getting the actions in and picking up additional benefits. I would say that we continue to have a hard-pressed around areas like Lean Six Sigma and our global sourcing as areas of opportunities and that continues to play well for us, as the teams are working hard, given some of the ambiguity we've had in the top line and some of the jitters we've heard in the market. That's been the appropriate action response from the team. So we're seeing a lot of that play through.","James Giannakouros - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. And as far as M&A if you can give -- give us an update on how your pipeline is looking, valuation in the -- in your targeted areas and I guess, a timing update as we enter 2015 just a couple of months from now.","Patrick K. Decker","Yes, I would say that first of all, we continue to cultivate the pipeline. I mean, we certainly lifted the pause on M&A so certainly, the last few months, after my arrival, the teams have been fervid about developing that pipeline again. The good news is these are all targets that we had in the pipeline for a while that we've stayed close to, so the pause didn't hurt us there at all. We do expect to be active in 2015. Of course, the timing is less predictable in terms of when we would actually be able to pull off. We've said before and I would stand behind that, that we will be looking to target about 2% to 3% of our total revenue in terms of size of acquisitions. That's our target. We continue to actively cultivate that. The acquisitions that we would do through '15 would likely be bolt on, kind of close to the core and then really begin focusing on developing that pipeline into '16 on some of the larger scale, maybe adjacency type of acquisitions.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Maczka of BB&T Capital market.","Kevin R. Maczka - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Question on your comments about ramping in China and the Middle East. I'm wondering if you can say a little bit more there about what kind of investments you'll have to make to make that happen. How much you think that can move the needle for you and if you can give us any sense of timing on when we might start to see some of that?","Patrick K. Decker","Sure. Let me start by saying that even with the intensified focus on China and the Middle East, we certainly would not be looking to go outside of our CapEx range of between, say, $120 million, $130 million per year. So we've got opportunities by way of which we've kind of reprioritized our deployment of capital internally. Doing it much more as the one company approach as opposed to a collection of businesses and that's spurring up some capital to put behind some of these more focused plays like a China and the Middle East. In terms of the type of actions that we are already working on and putting in place and that will continue through '15, is a heavy focus on further localization of things like product design, our R&D capabilities locally, building out key account management capabilities. We've got some great relationships with customer there already that as we began to really market to them the full portfolio of capabilities that we've got beyond just the Flygt pump as an example. They're really driving a lot of demand for that. But in many cases, we don't have the localization requirements to be able to meet that. So it's really going to be a more a matter of investment of management time and attention than it is financial capital, per se itself. In terms of when we expect to begin seeing real benefits from that, I mean obviously, we're already growing nicely in these markets, but we're going to be setting a much more aggressive, ambitious kind of target for ourselves relative to market growth in those areas, and I would certainly expect to see the benefit of that begin to come through in late '15, into '16.","Kevin R. Maczka - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay. And just a follow-up, you also mentioned I think more of a general comment about rebalancing the portfolio in new product introductions. Can you just say a little bit more there, how much more aggressive are you getting there because that's been part of your initiative for some time.","Patrick K. Decker","Yes, see so we spend today anywhere between 2.5% to 3% of our total revenue on R&D and I don't envision that in the near-term, that number necessarily changes very dramatically. Obviously, over time, here you heard us talk about productivity for growth mindset, which is all about how we do get at the next 200 to 300 basis points of revenue of cost out of the system, so that we got the flexibility where we need to, to put that money back into innovation technology, system development, et cetera, but that's going to be over a multiyear time frame. In the immediate term, it's really been a matter of reprioritizing where the teams are investing their R&D dollars. We do believe with a heavier focus on emerging market growth as well and building local capabilities in the design standpoint. We'll actually get more bang for the buck in terms of every dollar that we spend and obviously as we grow the top line, by definition even holding our percentage constant in terms of R&D, is going to put more absolute dollars of investment into the system. The last thing I would say on that is one of the capabilities that we are focusing on building right now that we don't have consistently across the company is what we call industry vertical marketing capability, where we sit with our customers and really understand the full suite of what their water challenges are and then map that against what our current offering is and then fill those gaps either with new product development, could be business model innovation but it can also inform our M&A pipeline in terms of where we want to fill the gap.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chip Moore of Canaccord.","Chip Moore - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Another nice quarter for the dewatering business mid-teens. Can you just walk us through where you're seeing pockets of strength there?","Michael T. Speetzen","Overall, the business was up kind of mid-single digits. The U.S. is where we saw the significant performance in the teens. And it was really related to oil and gas. I mean all the underlying markets seemed to be doing well with the exception of the mining market, which is down kind of low single digits. But the oil and gas area has continued to be robust for us as we've expanded throughout the U.S. and that's really been the driver of the growth.","Chip Moore - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","And just as a follow-up, maybe you could talk about oil and gas exposures for the company as a whole, with crude coming down. Are you seeing any impacts there?","Michael T. Speetzen","At this point time, no. We've got about $200 million to $250 million of exposure and it's relatively broad and I would say on the natural gas side, that's where we've seen probably the biggest pickup, but even of the crude side, we haven't heard much in terms of pullbacks. So things have held relatively stable there.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Rose of Wedbush Securities.","David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","A couple of -- on the SG&A side, can you provide us a little bit of color in some of the headwinds you may have faced from the CRM and some of the other initiatives? I mean, you had great cost control but what were some of the offsets?","Michael T. Speetzen","Yes, I mean, couple of things, David. I mean, we're down year-to-date $32 million from where we were last year, almost couple of hundred basis points and it's been primarily around the G&A side where we've gone from being kind of mid-9% down to under 9%. The continue focus for us, is we try and drive the efficiency in the business, obviously, some of that's coming from the leverage of the top line and the balance is really coming from some of actions that we've taken. As it relates to the quarter, I would say that we saw a more typical corporate level spend. I assume that's kind of what's underneath the question that you have. There's really 2 dynamics there. One, if you remember last year, third quarter we were coming off of a pretty bad performance in the second quarter and so we had taken a significant number of actions to defer cost initiatives within corporate. Then you have on the other side of that, this year we had deferred things out of the first half. If you remember some of our commentary around concerns over the weakness we've seen in January and February related to the weather and we essentially green lit a number of those initiatives. So CRM a prime example. It's not a significant amount of outlay. You're talking about something that's in the $1 million, $1.5 million range, but in totality, we were essentially moving forward given that we've gotten more comfortable with the top line environment.","Patrick K. Decker","And I would just add to that, I mean, I think, as I look at where we are as a company, an organization right now, there's clearly an opportunity to continue to drive business simplification and drive operating efficiency and that same approach is going to be applied to our corporate cost. Now as we standardize certain things, integrate certain things, ERPs, et cetera, you may see some cost shift around between the segments and corporate but the goal is to reduce SG&A further overall as a company. I would also say that when I look at the capabilities as a company that we need to augment, ISS opportunities like simplification where we are going to be organizing differently here in the very near future where we'll be organizing our global sourcing and our lean deployment differently to drive better standardization across the company. Second of all, I talked about the need to improve our Xylem wide focus on innovation, really increasing our focus on disruptive technologies as well as better coordination amongst all of our different businesses, so we would be organizing differently around that. And then third, as I mentioned earlier, we need to do a better job of getting voice to the customer and really augmenting our capabilities around certain key industry verticals and so there will be some moves we're making on that front as well. All of those together in my view will be with the spirit of driving and approach as 1 company and drive operating efficiency and growth.","David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then one follow-up, if I may, on the inflation front. It seems relatively high versus what we're seeing on a global basis and maybe you can provide some color on where you're seeing the inflation?","Michael T. Speetzen","Yes, I mean, there's couple of things, David. One is you have to remember that we have the pay increases included, so we're not including just the material inflation, we're including labor inflation in that calculation, as well. And I would say that there are pockets where we're definitely seeing a reduction and we've seen inflation coming down. We're now sitting around 2.7%, 2.8%. I can't point to any specific item. I'd say things have, for the most part stabilized. We're not seeing any significant movements up or down at this point. And as we look forward into next year, we think the levels are going to be pretty consistent with what we're seeing today.","David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","So when do you start to lap the labor inflation?","Michael T. Speetzen","Well, we continue to give increases every year. So you've got third quarter -- I'm sorry, first quarter of lapping, but you're essentially lapping what you've done in terms of pay raises that go effective at the end of the quarter.","David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","I mean, so there isn't really any from your perspective a catch-up that you implemented early on, I mean you're just going along?","Michael T. Speetzen","No this is just typical merit increases that we do each year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Konigsberg of Vertical Partners.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Mike, actually the first one for you, actually just going back to FX. I was surprised as far as the impact you noted for 2015, $40 million of revenue and $0.08 of profit. I know you mentioned something about that, so little -- maybe a little bit color on that. I mean the $0.08 hit on $40 million of revenue, it's almost like a 40% margin fall through on that. It just seems extraordinarily high. I don't sense that we had that type of dynamic in the past. Is that new and is there something kind of changing the sensitivity to FX? Or is it -- maybe just touch on that a little bit more.","Michael T. Speetzen","Yes. Well, we definitely saw it play out in the third quarter and we anticipate it in the fourth quarter and the commentary around next year, again, using the euro is a proxy because we obviously want to see how rates settle out and bake that into the final guidance that we'll provide in February. But the long story short is as we've discussed in the past, given the structure that we have in Europe, there's a significant amount of our profit that goes through Switzerland and that is a euro-denominated functional currency. So when we translate that profit back, it is at about a 40%, 45% drop rate. So on that $40 million worth of revenue, again, assuming about $1.27 U.S. dollar to euro exchange rate, that's going to convert over and give you about $0.07 to $0.08 headwind from an EPS standpoint.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","And there's nothing to suggest that -- that's the same on both sides of the coin, correct? I mean -- either way, it's not that sensitive. If we see a strengthening of the euro, it's going to work the same way the other way. I just want to make sure.","Patrick K. Decker","Yes. Absolutely.","Michael T. Speetzen","Absolutely.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Okay. The other question I had was -- actually just around just more cost savings. So you're expecting another $20 million to carry over into '15. Maybe just talk about where you think we are, how much more low hanging of fruit exist if you want to put in innings, type of analogy, but how much more obvious restructuring is there to do versus just kind of growing the business and getting savings through leverage?","Michael T. Speetzen","Yes, I would say that the analogy of low-hanging fruit, I wouldn't suggest it's low hanging. So I think everything we do at this point in time is going to be have to be strategic around where we look to drive efficiency, redeployment of capital and cost, and so that's really the work that we're doing right now as we finalize our plans around 2015 is what more is out there for us to get in '15 and even in '16 and '17. So I would say -- I would characterize it that we are in the middle innings at this point. I think the teams have done a good job of executing the restructuring over the last year and a half. As I mentioned earlier, I do believe that there's another couple of - few hundred basis points of cost as a percentage of revenue that could be taken out of the system over time. But again, that's going to be a multiyear journey. I think you'll see some steady progress against that in '15 and '16. But again, we'll have more to say on that in the February earnings call.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","But just to be clear, I mean, that couple of hundred basis points, is that going to be driven by additional restructuring or is this going to be top line leverage to get there?","Michael T. Speetzen","It's going to be a combination of the 2.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano of Cowen.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Just wanted to talk about orders a little bit. So second consecutive quarter over $1 billion. That's a nice number. We've seen some big orders out of emerging markets in the last couple. So just wanted to get your sense on the sustainability of that kind of run rate in terms of orders and outside of those big project wins, kind of where have you seen the geographic breakdown of the remaining orders?","Patrick K. Decker","Yes, let me maybe touch on the geographic breakdown first. Definitely the emerging markets continue to be strong for us, places like China and greater Asia, specifically as we've seen continued project wins and those bookings have maintained robust. I would say that in the Americas per some of the comments that I made earlier, we've seen strength pretty much across all of our water infrastructure lines, primarily around treatment, so obviously a good indicator of some of the project activity and things starting to at least stabilize and pick up going into next year. Europe has been a bit mixed. The transport side of our business was positive in the third quarter. The other elements were essentially flat to down. And I'd say that's going to be the area that we're going to be spending a lot of time and making sure that we're keeping an eye on. The other areas seem to be holding up well and at this stage we think that the way we've got the teams aligned, the opportunities, the project funnel that are out there, they're getting a bite at all the appropriate opportunities.","Michael T. Speetzen","I would only add that when you look at our emerging market revenue today, roughly 20% of our revenue comes in the emerging markets and what I would say is that's obviously, a great area of opportunity for us. You've heard us talk quite a bit about. I would caution as you saw in the quarter that these larger projects that come through can be lumpy, in terms of timing. And we'll certainly do the best possible way that we can to make sure that we're keeping it clear and clean for you, so you understand what the base business is versus the larger project wins.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Great. So emerging markets about 20% of revenue. I'm assuming that they've been carrying bigger weight over the last couple in terms of orders, right?","Michael T. Speetzen","I mean, look the Americas were up double digits in the Water Infrastructure segment in the third quarter. So we certainly have seen in some of the developed regions. That said, emerging markets have been very strong for us.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jim Krapfel of Morningstar.","James Krapfel - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","So most of my questions have been asked already but just one question on future divestment opportunities and what potential you see for further areas to sell off some of your businesses to improve your overall business mix?","Patrick K. Decker","Sure. We've done a pretty exhaustive review of the businesses that we've got. The team has done a good job by the time that I was arriving early this year on mapping out the historical growth profile, the returns on capital of each one of the businesses, the incremental returns on capital, all the things that good allocators of capital look at when we're making investment decisions or divestiture decisions. And I would say other than the U.K. Valves business that we divested here recently, there's really nothing of any meaningful value there that I would say of size and scale that you should expect to hear from us on. I mean we'll continue to always take a hard look at some of the smaller businesses in the portfolio but there's nothing really there right now. I would say, right now we are very much focused on the acquisition side of the house.","Operator","Your final question is a follow-up from Brian Konigsberg of Vertical Partners.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Just 1 point of clarity. On Page 5, in a key performance drivers, you talk about volume price mix and other being 180 basis points headwind, yet in both the segments, both of those buckets are tailwinds in the quarter. Can you just explain the discrepancy between that? Am I just reading it incorrectly?","Michael T. Speetzen","I think the biggest part, Brian, is going to be the corporate cost. It's about $6 million, as I pointed out in my prepared remarks that puts us back at more of a typical run rate versus what was a very low level worth of spend last year.","Operator","At this time, there are no further questions. I'll now return the call to Patrick Decker for any additional or closing remarks.","Patrick K. Decker","Great. Well, thank you, everybody. I appreciate your -- we appreciate your continued interest in the company and in following us. Look forward to catching up with you in early February to discuss our fourth quarter results and provide our overview on 2015 outlook. So thank you, all and have a good day.","Operator","Thank you.

I'll turn the call over to our CEO, Patrick Decker.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Thanks, Phil, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us to discuss our fourth quarter and full-year performance.","2016 was a transformative year for Xylem, as we delivered strong financial results. We made significant progress on each of our five strategic priorities, delivering organic growth at a very challenging and mix market, at the same time, we accelerated capital deployment to change the mix of our portfolio, and in-market exposure, in order to grow faster, and deliver greater value to our shareholders.","Specifically, we deployed nearly $2 billion last year for acquisitions that collectively are reshaping the growth and profitability profile of Xylem. The additions of Sensus and the Visenti immediately expanded our portfolio of systems intelligence offerings, a key plank of our strategic agenda, and extended Xylem into higher growth sectors, such as, smart metrology.","And as the data scientists from Visenti and Sensus are now collaborating with Xylem's commercial teams, who bring deep customer knowledge and insights from a wide variety of water sectors, a host of possibilities are opening up to develop value-add solutions that address our customers' pain points. In addition to our inorganic expansion, we made excellent progress on our ongoing productivity initiatives to improve operational efficiency, and reduce our cost structure.","These efforts deliver more than $130 million in cost savings, surpassing our full-year goal, and underpinning 130 basis points of operating margin expansion. Importantly, with these changes we are better positioned to deliver increased growth and profitability over time. Throughout the year, our team stayed focused and delivered against our long-term objectives. I'm pleased with what we accomplished, but even more excited about what the future holds as we continue to extend our reach and leadership in the global water industry.","Now, let's turn to our results. Looking at the top one, we closed out the full year with 3% growth overall, and 1% organic growth. This was driven primarily by a robust public utility end market and a relatively stable commercial business. That said, there's no question that we were disappointed with our fourth quarter revenue.","While we knew we have a tougher year-over-year comparison, we did not foresee public utility organic revenue growth coming in flat globally, which have been up double-digits in the previous three quarters. The shortfall primarily occurred in Europe, where we anticipated a historical level of year-end customer spend out that did not materialize.","In the U.S., we continue to see a weak industrial market, primarily due to ongoing weakness in oil and gas, and lower demand in the light industrial sector. Clearly, we had a challenging fourth quarter and some of those headwinds will likely continue in the near term. On a positive note, we delivered a 2% organic increase in orders globally during the fourth quarter, which included 3% growth in our Water Infrastructure segment.","It is also worth noting that our treatment project funnel continues to grow, up double-digits to $2.5 billion from this time last year. This is another indicator of expected continued long-term growth in the water utility sector.","Mark will get into the specifics of our segment performance, but I did want to highlight that, Sensus delivered $132 million in revenue in the final two months of the year, which brought their full calendar year organic growth to 10% on pro forma basis. The addition of the Sensus business clearly improves Xylem's overall growth profile, and as we've identified significant revenue synergy opportunities, that picture is getting even brighter.","As I've already mentioned, we generated 130 basis points of operating margin expansion, excluding the impact of acquisitions, which is well-ahead of pace to meet the long-term financial targets we announced at Investor Day. We closed out the year with a strong fourth quarter, 220 basis points of margin expansion, driven by productivity actions and cost savings initiatives. This strong performance enabled us to continue to invest in strategic initiatives to drive future growth, while still delivering on our financial commitment.","At the bottom line, we delivered earnings per share of $2.03 for the full year, a 10% increase over the prior year. This performance reflects our continuing trajectory of improving financial returns, and demonstrates our ability to deliver solid earnings growth in a still-challenging global industrial environment.","In the fourth quarter, we delivered earnings per share of $0.66, also a 10% improvement over the prior-year period. For the full-year, we generated $386 million in free cash flow resulting in 120% conversion rate. Again, well-ahead of our original commitment for the year.","Looking back at 2016, we faced a mixed economic environment across our end markets and regionally. However, there was and continues to be consistency in key fundamentals and underlying trends that impact our business in very positive ways, now and in future years.","First, a steady increase in spending on water infrastructure across nearly all geographies. A growing understanding of the operational and cost benefits of systems intelligence solutions in the water sector, as well as in the electric and gas industries. Recognition of the power of big data to optimize business operations.","And finally, increased demand for solutions that address both the mitigation of and adaptation to the impacts of climate-related issues, such as extreme weather events. With our recent acquisitions, now more than ever, Xylem is uniquely positioned to be the partner of choice in capturing the opportunities that will result from these trends. That is why, I am still confident about our ability to drive sustained profitable growth, and create greater value for our shareholders and our other key stakeholders.","Our alignment on five strategic priorities brings focus to our efforts to capitalize on these macro trends and drive growth. We made measureable progress against each of them last year, and we expect that to continue if not accelerate in the year ahead.","Let me quickly address a few of them. Enhancing our commercial leadership is core to fueling our top line growth. We made a number of changes this year to further strengthen our One Xylem approach to serving customers. That is, making it easier for them to do business with us, and ensuring that we provide quick and easy access to our full portfolio of solutions.","Regarding Sensus, we're in the early stages of bringing our teams together to collaborate. As I've mentioned before, we are being very deliberate in our integration work to ensure that we do not disrupt the existing businesses. We are however cross-educating key teams on our respective portfolios and enabling lead sharing through Salesforce.com and other tools.","We intend to fully leverage Xylem's leadership position in the wastewater, outdoor and applied water sectors to introduce Sensus solutions. And conversely, we're leveraging Sensus' leading position in the clean water space to offer additional Xylem technologies.","As we previously announced, we expect this combination to realize substantial revenue synergies over the new few years, worth at least $100 million, and our teams are now working on those initiatives. I'll have more to say about those opportunities at our upcoming Investor Day in April.","Shifting now to our second strategic priority, driving growth in emerging markets. Our performance last year was mixed across our emerging market territories with 1% growth for the year. But we began to build more momentum as we moved to the fourth quarter, closing out the year with a 6% increase over the prior-year period.","One standout was India. We've generated high-double-digit growth in the quarter and the full-year. While still a relatively smaller business, the opportunities for growth in India are very attractive with strong government support for Water Infrastructure projects, and broader Smart Cities initiatives.","China returned to growth in the fourth quarter, as demand for infrastructure projects continued to build. A positive leading indicator for this business is the double-digit growth in orders that the team delivered for the full year. This sets us up for attractive growth in 2017 and beyond.","We arguably made the most significant progress this year, on our third strategic priority, strengthening innovation and technology. The acquisitions of both Sensus and Visenti are strong demonstrations of M&A serving as a proxy for R&D. The addition of these businesses enabled a step change in our systems intelligence and smart infrastructure capabilities.","Last month, we established a new Xylem Center of Excellence at Sensus' Research Center in Raleigh-Durham. There we will develop new integrated solutions that further differentiate our offerings and provide value that our customers are seeking, and are willing to pay for.","We're also expanding our India Technology Center with a new campus in Bangalore, that will focus on supporting our systems intelligence related work, as well as support our expanding product localization work in India and other emerging markets. I expect our expanded capabilities to accelerate our R&D progress, which will be a significant driver of value creation over time.","Building a culture of continuous improvement is another area, where we continue to deliver strong results. We've been on this self-help journey for some time now, but there is more opportunity than ever to derive greater value out of our productivity and business simplification initiatives.","And as we've noted before, these efforts underpin our productivity for growth mindset, as we redirect some of these savings to strategic growth initiatives. With each acquisition, we gained new perspectives on how to improve our operational efficiency in addition to realizing synergies through global procurement and footprint rationalization.","We intend to update you on our productivity plans and expected cost synergy capture related to the Sensus integration at our Investor Day in April. But for now, I will say that we are already ahead of our plan to achieve 300 basis points to 400 basis points of margin expansion by 2020 in our base business, and continue to expect to realize at least $50 million in net costs synergies, related to the Sensus integration.","As we build on this progress, we are well-positioned to accelerate our growth and value creation in 2017. We expect to generate full-year revenue growth of 20% to 22%, including the contribution from acquisitions completed in 2016. On a pro forma basis, organic revenue is expected to grow 2% to 4%. Our productivity initiatives will help to drive up to 130 basis points in EBITDA margin expansion.","We expect to deliver 2017 EPS growth of 12% to 20%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange translation. And we are aiming for another year of strong free cash flow conversion coming in at more than 110%. We increased our dividend to shareholders by 10% last year. Consistent with our commitment to return capital to shareholders in line with earnings and cash flow growth, today, we announced that we will further increase our dividend by 16% in 2017.","Now, I'll turn it over to Mark for more details on our results.","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Thanks, Patrick. Since you've already covered the highlights of the full-year results included on slide 5, let's turn to slide 6, where I'll discuss our fourth quarter results.","Overall, revenues were up 10% in the quarter. Acquisitions contributed 14% growth, which was partially offset by an organic revenue decline of 2%. Additionally, foreign exchange headwinds reduced the top line by 2%.","From an organic perspective, commercial was the only vertical market to generate growth this quarter up 1%. The public utility market was flat versus the prior-year period after growing 12% over the last three quarters. This deceleration primarily reflects a tougher prior-year comparison in the U.S., as well as weaker than expected revenue in certain European countries.","Industrial markets were down 3% overall with steeper than expected declines in our light industrial business. Rounding out our performance, revenues declined 3% in both the residential and agricultural end markets.","Regionally, the U.S. market drove most of the organic decline for the quarter, down 7% and Western Europe was down a modest 1%. And, as Patrick mentioned, our emerging market revenue was a bright spot, rebounding from a tough third quarter with 6% overall growth.","Before moving to our margin results, I'll address the Sensus revenue performance in the quarter. Revenue for November and December was $132 million and was short of our expectations, primarily driven by a delay in the shipment of scheduled orders to a customer in Saudi Arabia, due to letters of credit not being released. In January, we have begun shipping these orders as letters of credit are now being processed.","Despite weaker than expected revenue in the quarter, our teams did an exceptional job driving productivity, led to 60 basis points of margin expansion to 15.3%. Excluding 160 basis points of dilution from acquisitions, which is largely from the amortization of intangible assets from the Sensus acquisition, our operating margin expanded 220 basis points.","Given the market challenges we faced during the quarter, I'm pleased with our team's performance in delivering earnings per share of $0.66, an increase of 10% year-over-year.","Please turn to slide 7, and I'll provide additional details on our reporting segments. Before addressing revenues and earnings performance, I'll begin with our fourth quarter order activity, and backlog position as of year-end.","Water Infrastructure recorded orders of $572 million in the quarter, up 3% organically year-over-year. This growth was primarily driven by treatment orders, which were up 30%. While this is excellent progress and a sharp change in trajectory from the last several quarters, it is important to understand that the majority of these projects require longer lead times, and will not ship until 2018 or later. We exited the quarter with total backlog of $528 million, down approximately 2% organically year-over-year.","Of this amount, $210 million is due to ship in the first quarter of 2017, down approximately 8% on an organic basis, which will be a drag on revenue growth in the first quarter. Water Infrastructure revenue of $612 million represents a 2% year-over-year decline on an organic basis. Acquisitions added $7 million to the top line, while foreign exchange was a $14 million headwind.","In the U.S., this segment declined 6%, overall. The significant challenges that have impacted our dewatering business this year, including double-digit declines in the oil and gas market, continue to mute growth in the quarter. Our public utility business partially offset this decline with 3% growth in the quarter, despite lapping a 13% increase in last year's fourth quarter.","Western Europe decreased 2% overall, primarily driven by unexpected weakness, as municipalities in a couple of countries slowed their level of spend in the quarter. This was partially offset by solid performance in the UK, where our teams drove 6% growth. We continue to benefit from the expansion of the public utility investment cycle.","Emerging market results were mixed, but up 1% overall. The 10% growth in Asia was primarily driven by the timing of revenues on large projects in India and Laos. This was largely offset by ongoing weakness in the Middle East, where the level of government spend for infrastructure continue to be constrained, resulting in a 10% decline year-over-year.","Operating margin for the segment increased 80 basis points to 18.3% as productivity initiatives drove 420 basis points of margin expansion. This strong margin performance allowed us to more than offset inflation of 180 basis points, lower volumes and unfavorable mix, which was largely driven by the declines in our higher margin dewatering business. Acquisitions were 70 basis point drag on margins in the quarter.","Turning to the full year, segment revenue of $2.2 billion grew 2% on an organic basis. Acquisitions added $32 million to the top line, while foreign exchange was a $55 million headwind.","Organically growth in our treatment and wastewater transport businesses reflect a stable public utility market, where we had been gaining share. This was partially offset by headwinds in the industrial sector, particularly in our dewatering business, and to a lesser extent, our analytics business.","Operating margin increased 100 basis points year-over-year to 15.2%, benefits from our productivity programs and cost reductions, as well as a modest price realization more than offset inflation and funded investments during the year. Acquisitions diluted overall performance by 50 basis points.","Please turn to slide 8, Applied Water booked orders of $348 million in the quarter, which was flat organically over the prior-year period. Our book-to-bill ratio was 0.99 in the quarter, which is in line with our historical performance.","Overall, we exited the quarter with a backlog of $163 million, down 3% organically, compared to last year. Of this amount, approximately $100 million is due to ship in the first quarter of 2017, down about 1% on an organic basis.","Revenue was $351 million, down 2% organically versus the prior-year quarter. In the U.S., segment revenue was down 9% year-over-year in the quarter. This was primarily driven by the segment's industrial vertical, which declined 16%. The decline reflects continued weakness in oil and gas and in the general industrials markets.","Delays in projects drove 3% lower year-over-year revenues in the U.S. commercial building sector. In Europe, revenue increased 2% with particularly strong growth in the UK, where our investment in both new products and sales capabilities continues to drive solid industrial performance.","Finally, emerging markets revenue grew 15%, reflecting a strong return to growth from a stabilizing commercial building market in China, and recent strength in Latin America from industrial project deliveries. This growth more than offset declines of 11% in the Middle East.","Segment operating margin in the quarter increased 230 basis points to 15.7% year-over-year. Strong productivity drove a 540 basis point margin improvement, this result, more than offset 140 basis points of cost inflation, lower volumes, and 60 basis points of strategic growth investments. On a full-year basis, the segment recorded revenue of $1.4 billion, down 1% organically year-over-year.","Revenue declined 5% in the U.S., primarily driven by lower demand for light industrial applications. These declines were largely offset by growth in Europe and emerging markets.","Operating margin increased 70 basis points year-over-year to 14.6%. The outstanding execution from the team on the productivity side enabled the funding of our localization investment in the Middle East and also more than offset the impact of volume declines in inflation.","Now, let's turn to slide 9. We closed the quarter with a cash balance of approximately $300 million. As we mentioned in our third quarter earnings call, we utilized approximately $400 million of European cash to close the Sensus' acquisition.","To complete these transactions, we also issued a combination of short and long-term debt of $1.3 billion. We remain committed to maintaining our investment grade credit rating, which will require that we focus our capital deployment primarily on debt repayment over the next 12-plus months.","During the fourth quarter, we invested $34 million in capital expenditures and also returned $28 million to our shareholders through dividends. Free cash flow in the quarter was approximately $200 million, a 21% increase from the prior-year. Free cash flow conversion was 214% in the quarter compared to 145% conversion last year. This improvement was driven by better working capital performance, as well as higher non-cash amortization from Sensus. While working capital increased overall, the improvement as a percent of revenue primarily reflects the addition of Sensus during the fourth quarter.","From a working capital efficiency standpoint, Sensus positively impacts our profile as they have a very efficient model, while working capital as a percentage of revenue is approximately 10%. This is reflected in the 310 basis point improvement year-over-year in working capital as a percentage of revenue on a pro forma basis. And looking at the base Xylem business, we improved working capital as a percentage of sales by 70 basis points, excluding FX translation and acquisitions.","Please turn to slide 10, and Patrick will cover the update to our 2017 outlook.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Thanks, Mark. As I've said earlier, we're well-positioned heading into 2017 to continue to make significant progress on our long-term financial targets. Transformative changes we made at Xylem over this past year have shifted our portfolio towards advanced technologies and repositioned our future growth and earnings profile.","As we move through 2017, we expect our 2016 acquisitions to help accelerate our revenue growth. On a pro forma basis, we anticipate organic growth of 2% to 4%. This includes organic growth from the base Xylem businesses of 1% to 3%, and Sensus organic growth of 6% to 7%. We expect generally stable conditions across the majority of our portfolio, albeit mixed geographically.","I'll cover our end market outlook for 2017 in a few minutes. As we drive our continuous improvement work deeper into the organization, we expect our lean and global procurement initiatives to generate incremental gross savings of approximately $80 million.","Our adjusted operating margin is expected to grow in the range of 20 basis points to 60 basis points, excluding roughly 60 basis points of margin dilution from acquisitions. This dilution is largely driven by purchase price accounting impacts, relating to non-cash intangible amortization.","We anticipate generating earnings per share of $2.20 to $2.35, which excludes integration, restructuring and realignment cost of about $30 million. This projection also includes $0.08 of negative foreign currency translation impact. Excluding foreign exchange impact, EPS growth is expected to be in the range of 12% to 20%.","Finally, the Sensus acquisition adds a tremendous cash generating business to our portfolio. As we maintain our disciplined approach to capital deployment and continue to improve our working capital, I expect us to deliver free cash flow conversion of at least 110% this year. This also contemplates expected capital expenditures in the range of $190 million to $200 million, which is in line with historical spend of the combined businesses.","Please turn to slide 11, and I'll walk you through our end market assumptions for 2017. Now, please note that our commentary and growth estimates on this slide reflect organic revenue for our base Xylem businesses.","Public utility was 36% of total 2016 revenue. Following a year during which we delivered 8% growth in this end market, we are expecting 2017 organic growth to moderate, but still grow low to mid-single-digits. In the U.S., which represents approximately one quarter of our public utility base, we will have a tough comparison given the exceptional 17% growth we delivered in 2016.","As a result, we believe growth in this region will be in the low to mid-single-digit range. In emerging markets, we expect large project activity to drive mid to high-single-digit growth, particularly in China and India. And in Europe, we anticipate low-single-digit growth, largely driven by strength in the UK.","Our industrial end market, represents 44% of total 2016 revenue. In 2017, we expect full-year organic revenue to be flat to up low-single-digits. We believe the soft market conditions in general industrial, that occurred in the U.S. during 2016, will carry into at least the first half of 2017, with modest growth returning over the second half. We continue to assume that the oil and gas markets will be down modestly year-over-year, despite some pockets of uptick in activity. We expect emerging market performance to be mixed with some strength in China and Latin America, offset by continued weakness in the Middle East.","Moving to commercial. Here, we consistently saw a low-single-digit growth throughout 2016. We expect this level of growth to continue into 2017. Market data and input from our customers and channel partners suggest a low growth environment in the U.S., where we have a leading market position in more than half of our total commercial exposure.","Beyond the U.S. the global outlook is mixed. We believe, Europe will be closer to flat with lower construction activity and funding uncertainty in certain countries. Also, our business in Europe, faces a tough prior-year comparison of 10% growth. China appears to be stabilizing, and we expect our business there to grow in 2017, after a weak performance last year.","In residential, we also project full-year revenue to be flat to up low-single-digits. In the U.S., we expect a flattish environment, given the competitive landscape and replacement nature of the sector we serve. The European market looks to be modestly stronger, as residential building permits increase.","Now, please turn to slide 12, and Mark will walk you through more details on the outlook.","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","This slide provides the bridge from our full-year 2016 results to our 2017 annual guidance for revenue and EPS using the midpoint of our guidance range. From our $3.8 billion revenue base, we're adding 2% of organic growth from the base Xylem business. Sensus adds approximately 21% of incremental revenue growth, bringing total expected revenues to approximately $4.6 billion or 23% year-over-year growth.","Foreign exchange headwinds of 2% reduce our 2017 full-year revenue guidance to a midpoint of approximately $4.5 billion. In terms of EPS, we expect our core business to add $0.13, which reflects organic revenue growth, carryover restructuring savings and the benefits of our productivity programs partially offset by inflation, investments and a weaker mix of revenue.","Sensus is expected to add an incremental $0.20 of EPS. Note that we now expect the Sensus contribution be higher than our previous guidance range of $0.10 to $0.12. This results in operational EPS performance of $2.36, up 16% year-over-year on a currency neutral basis.","Based on our full-year foreign currency assumptions, which are summarized on slide 14, we expect $0.08 of currency headwinds to reduce our overall 2017 EPS guidance midpoint to $2.28 per share.","Please turn to slide 13. This slide reflects our 2017 outlook for our Sensus business. This year, we expect Sensus to deliver pro forma organic revenue growth of 6% to 7% versus 10% growth in 2016.","Last year, the business had a very strong year in growing both the water and electric utility sectors, significantly benefiting from a number of new product launches. This year, we expect revenue growth to be driven by mid-single-digit growth in water, a double-digit increase in the electric utility sector and another year of double-digit growth in Software-as-a-Service.","We expect revenue in the gas utility sector to be flattish. EBITDA margin is forecast to be approximately 19.5% for the full year, down 80 basis points from the prior year. Benefits from volume growth and net cost synergies will be offset by growth investments. These investments will provide for the expansion of R&D capacity, and the commercial capabilities that will be critical to enabling the substantial revenue synergies we expect to generate over time, as well as growing the base Sensus business.","I'd also point out that approximately 50% of the $15 million of net cost synergies from the Sensus acquisition are reflected in the base Xylem 2017 financial performance. The year-over-year operating margin decline also reflects 220 basis points of incremental depreciation and amortization from purchase accounting.","Please turn to slide 14. As the team has done in prior years, we're providing the seasonal profile of our business as well as highlights of our 2017 planning assumptions. For the first quarter, we expect continued weakness in the global industrial markets, coupled with a tough prior-year public utility compare.","We anticipate this will result in an organic revenue decline in the range of 1% to 2% for the base Xylem business. Acquisitions are expected to add approximately $230 million to $240 million of revenue, with the vast majority contributed by Sensus, which we expect to grow organically at 6% to 7% in the first quarter. In addition, foreign exchange translation unfavorably impacts revenue by approximately $20 million.","As for our first quarter segment operating margin, we expect margins to be down 70 basis points to 110 basis points, including a 30 basis point reduction due to the non-cash amortization of Sensus intangible assets.","The year-over-year operational decline is primarily attributable to lower volumes and a weaker mix of higher-margin revenue that we saw in the first quarter of last year, from very strong repair and maintenance revenues in the U.S. public utility market, and from lower dewatering revenues in 2017.","At the corporate line, we expect a quarterly run rate of approximately $12 million to $13 million per quarter. Interest and other expense is anticipated to be approximately $80 million, up nearly $30 million year-over-year, primarily reflecting the impact of incremental debt issued in connection with the Sensus acquisition.","Our full-year operating tax rate of 22% also reflects the mix impact of adding Sensus for the full year, and our share count assumption reflects a modest year-over-year increase. Please note that the 2017 outlook excludes approximately $30 million for anticipated integration, restructuring and realignment cost.","Finally, please note the summary of our FX assumptions on this slide, which includes our euro guidance assumption at $1.04. We believe this transparency is helpful given the recent volatility in currency rates.","With that now, I'll turn the call back over to Patrick for closing comments.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Thanks, Mark. So overall, I'm pleased with our team's strong execution in a still-challenging global market. Looking ahead, we expect our acquired businesses to be catalysts for accelerating our revenue, profitability and earnings growth. That, coupled with our ongoing commitment to continuous improvement and business simplification efforts, positions us well for outperformance in 2017.","Now, operator, we can open it up to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question is coming from the line of Deane Dray with RBC.","Phil De Sousa - Xylem, Inc.","Good morning, Deane.","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Deane?","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Operator, we can't hear the question.","Operator","Mr. Dray, go ahead.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","So can you hear me now?","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Hey, good morning.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah. Hey, good morning, Deane.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Can you hear me now?","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah, we can.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Sorry about that. Hey, I hope, we could start with the tone of the U.S. municipal market by geography and start with the U.S., so obviously tough comps, but do you still feel we're in a multi-year spending cycle by the utilities that started last year, and what's your visibility there?","And then, related is this all the intrigue about where and how the Trump infrastructure spending may find its way into the water infrastructure markets. I saw this week, a preliminary listing of States' wish list of shovel-ready projects and about 10% of them were specifically geared towards water treatment plants. So, let's just start on the U.S. side, spending cycle, visibility and maybe some comments about, Trump?","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Sure. Absolutely. Thanks, Deane. So, yeah, talking first on U.S. water utility sector. So we do very much believe that we continue to be in the midst of a multi-year kind of bull run there, Deane, and I think the \u2013 what you're seeing here in terms of the softness in Q4 was really driven by Europe, not so much the U.S.","Our guide in Q1 really is being driven by the tough comp we have versus the first quarter last year where we had exceptionally strong growth we had, that was really driven by, as you'll recall an unseasonably warm weather in Q1, so we had a lot of pull-ins from Q2 to Q1, so that's just strictly a tough comp that we're seeing in the U.S. piece.","In terms of visibility that we've got as we alluded to in our comments, the bidding, the big pipeline funnel continues to grow double-digits in the treatment business, which is the leading indicator for the health of the water utility sector. And so, again, my confidence is very strong there that we will see strength over the course of this year, as well as future years.","In terms of the Trump policies, I would say, let me take the opportunity to maybe touch on a few different policy agenda items that are out there, leading first with infrastructure spend. We certainly believe that it could be a significant catalyst in terms of spending in the water sector. Obviously, questions remain on timing, and as well as the funding.","We also think that there has been a little bit of uncertainty in terms of projects that are already shovel-ready as to whether the funding was going to happen at a local level, at a state level or federal level, and that's led to a little bit of a \u2013 a little bit of softness here in the short-term. But all indications that we get from other E&C companies that have reported as well is, they too are speaking fairly bullish about infrastructure spend here in the U.S. and they're seeing it in their bidding pipeline. The secondary would be around tax reform.","I know that there are a number of investors that probably assume that we may not benefit that much from any lower U.S. tax rates. But actually, our efficient tax rate is really driven by our European supply chain and tax-efficient structure there. Especially with the Sensus acquisition, we've got a sizable U.S. tax base here, and we would certainly benefit from any lowering of rates in the U.S.","And then third is, discussions around any impact on cross-border tax given that we import a fair amount of our products here in the U.S. The reality is, if you look at Water Infrastructure, while we are a net importer of products there, the reality is, most, if not all of our competitors are also global players that import as well.","And then for our Applied Water business and our Sensus business, most of those businesses are U.S., and they are actually supplied out of our factories for the most part here in the U.S. And so, we really don't think that's going to have any meaningful impact on us. So I thought, I'd take the opportunity, Deane, to go beyond just the one item from the top administration, but cover maybe three or four areas.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Terrific. And then, I hopefully still won't count that as one of my questions. Just to round out the side on the European municipal market, sounds like there were pockets of weakness, but it wasn't in the UK, were these election related at all?","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah, the UK was up high-single-digits in the quarter, and we would expect them to continue to grow at similar rates here in 2017 as we are really hitting the sweet spot of the AMP Cycle in the UK.","The softness there in the quarter, and what we're seeing in Q1, is really some slowdown in \u2013 we normally see a stand out of muni budgets there in a couple of key markets that we didn't see in the fourth quarter, and we're simply being cautious about that in Q1.","And to your point, Deane, everything we seen in here does lead us to believe that it's specifically related to France and Spain, and that's certainly is related to some uncertainty around the upcoming elections, but we did that temporary.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yeah. Just last question from me. I'd be remised if I didn't call out the free cash flow conversion, and it wasn't too long ago when, Xylem had set cash conversion as a priority, and you were in and around 90%, and so if we can get to 100%, or you've blown past that. So Mark, just give us a sense on sustainability, you've set 110% conversion goal for this year, what have been the kind of key changes within working capital, and also the Sensus contribution?","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah. Sure, Deane. And it's really a combination of a couple of factors, and you hit on both of them. First being, working capital, we have made continued progress in the base Xylem business, and saw improvement year-over-year in terms of working capital as a percentage of sales of 70 basis points, particularly in the areas of days payable, which improved by almost 6 days, continued progress in our receivables, which were up over 2 days.","We lost a little bit of ground in inventories, and that was largely a function of the slowdown in sales in the fourth quarter, but really good progress, and we expect to continue to push that in 2017. And then, the other point that you alluded to is, Sensus, and they have a very efficient model, their working capital as a percentage of sales is around 10%. And they generate a lot of cash, and that is just a structural and sustainable change in terms of the amount of cash conversion that they'll deliver as part of the combined company.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yeah. Great job on cash, and we I like that dividend increase. Thank you.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Thanks, Deane.","Operator","Our next question is from John Walsh with Vertical Research.","John Fred Walsh - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Good morning, John.","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Good morning, John.","John Fred Walsh - Vertical Research Partners LLC","So, hey thanks. So thinking about the $0.20 now for Sensus, do you have any guidance on how that phases in either quarterly or each one versus each two?","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","It's pretty stable. We might see a modest tick up as we execute the net cost synergies, but it's relatively stable as \u2013 I think, we've pointed out on one of the slides, what the revenue profile looks like from quarter-to-quarter. So we wouldn't expect too much variability there.","John Fred Walsh - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. And then thinking about your industrial framework for 2017, and kind of maybe parsing out some of the lighter commercial versus the heavy industrial. We are hearing about kind of an acceleration in those markets, and just wondering if, maybe the reason for your outlook is that, you might be tied a little more towards CapEx than maybe MRO spending in that vertical, but any thoughts on how that business kind of typically recovers when we start to see improved industrial activity, is it a two-quarter lag. How do you guys kind of think about that?","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah, this is Patrick. So I would split it into really two pieces of the industrial sector. In the light industrial sector that actually is more of a replacement business for us, and so we tend to be selling more into OpEx budgets. And so historically, that business has grown in kind of the low-single-digits kind of tied to GDP.","That's why we were caught off guard a bit in the fourth quarter with unexpected some slowdown there in the U.S., and we do expect that to recover, but I think we're trying to be \u2013 we're trying to be modest and conservative certainly here in the first half of the year as to expectations. So we're obviously curious to see how Q1 and Q2 play out here, and we would expect some normal recovery there.","The other piece of the industrial exposure for us, albeit less, is clearly in the energy sector, more the heavy industrial piece, we're less exposed there. But the reason you hear us calling that out is simply because of the fact that it impacts our dewatering business for the most part, which is a high-margin business.","It's hard for us to gauge whether we're being conservative on our guide here, but we've seen this softness now for a number of quarters, and we simply think it's prudent to continue to build that into our outlook at least for the first half of the year. So we're hopeful as others are that there will be a market recovery over the course of the year, but we're certainly not banking on that in our guidance range.","John Fred Walsh - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Great. Thanks for taking my questions.","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Sure.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nathan Jones with Stifel.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Good morning, everyone.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Good morning, Nathan.","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Good morning, Nathan.","Phil De Sousa - Xylem, Inc.","Good morning, Nate.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Patrick, I'm hoping you could help us bridge the gap between the down 1% to 2% first quarter, and up 2% at the midpoint for the full year.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Sure.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Given that, orders have been roughly flat here, down in the fourth quarter, how does that pick-up come along, I see you've got easier comps as the year goes along, but we haven't seen slowing organic growth as we've gone through the years.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Sure.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","If you can help us bridge from 1Q to the full year?","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah, no problem at all, Nathan. So first, I would say, just to restate some of the things we've said here. First quarter really is driven predominantly by a tough comp versus last year, because again, we had unseasonably warm weather, we had a really strong Q1 last year as you recall, and so that's being predominantly driven by a tough comp there, as well as the impact in Q1 of the slowdown in orders that we saw in Q2 and Q3 of last year, which are now working \u2013 that's working its way through our funnel, and that will work its way out in the first half of this year.","But then, we did actually see an uptick in infrastructure orders, for both Q3 and Q4. Now, some of those have some longer lead times, which by definition, would ship out in the second half of the year, in early 2018, but we expect to see the benefits of that uptick in orders that we talked about here in the fourth quarter for Water Infrastructure, up 3%.","And then, I would say, we also, as you point out, we do have an easier comp in the second half year-over-year because of some of the slowdown in organic growth that we saw in Q3 and Q4. In terms of how it splits quarter-by-quarter, think of roughly as down 1% to 2% in Q1, basically flat, flattish in Q2, up 1% to 2% in Q3, and up a little bit more than that in Q4, as I'm talking about the base legacy Xylem business, that excludes the impact, of course, of Sensus.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah. And then, I'd like to follow-up a bit more on the heavy industrial side here. The rig count bottomed in, in the middle of the last year, we've seen that improve, there's a lot of folks out there talking about seeing improvement in the mining industry. Is there some problem with channel inventory or do you lag recovery more than, maybe, I guess, I was thinking, in that business? I'm a little \u2013 just a little bit surprised that you're not seeing or forecasting better revenue growth in those two parts of the business.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Sure, yeah. So we do have \u2013 we do lag, to a small extent, recoveries in rig counts, and that typically, from our experience, would be at least a couple of quarter lag that we would see there, and that's just the nature of our customer base, and to some extent our indirect channel in terms of nervousness they would have around opening up the covers in terms of buying more rental fleet, et cetera. Part of it's also with some overhang in terms of them having adequate rental fleet to meet their demand as we sit here today.","But, that's certainly \u2013 that pressure will certainly return to them as the market recovers. And we are seeing \u2013 we are seeing pockets of uptick in activity, and we're encouraged by that. But, we just again, right now, think it's prudent for us to not be building in and assumed recovery in that business until we have a quarter or two of actually having seen it in our results.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","And if I could just slip one more in on the public utility segment, you guys have clearly been outperforming the market there, so you're clearly been gaining share. Can you talk about the two or three main areas or main things that you think is driving those share gains and how sustainable they are?","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Sure. Yeah, I mean we're \u2013 we're obviously, we don't take it for granted, so we're always looking over our shoulders, so we're always paranoid obviously around how do we stay ahead of the market in these areas, but I would say, first of all, we've got arguably one of the strongest channels to market in the U.S. both in terms of geographical coverage, but also the strength of our channel partners there, as well as our direct sales team.","And I think about the service component that we're able to offer relative to some of our competitors' offerings, clearly when you've got a rising tide of an end market like we have in public utility, whoever has a lead market share position is typically going to grow disproportionate to the rest of the market, we're certainly benefiting from that.","But I would say, at the end of the day, it really comes down to the quality of our product offerings, coupled with the service, and so we've had some recent product launches, our new Concertor launch, which is being extremely well received by the marketplace, as well as some of the additional service offering that we built around that.","And I would say lastly, although it's always hard to hang your hat on this, but we've put a lot of effort in our sales team, in leveraging our Salesforce.com investment, which has really helped in terms of lead generation, and substantially increasing our funnel and pipeline of bidding opportunities. So there's a number of things, Nathan, that go into this, I wouldn't point to any one or two things, but those would be the top three or four.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","That's helpful color. Thanks very much.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Thanks, Nathan.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano with Cowen.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hey guys, how are you doing?","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Hey, Joe. Good morning.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","So starting with Sensus, so I know your initial accretion guide was very preliminary, but what kind of changed the big bucket, that changed you get from $0.10 to $0.12, to $0.20 and can you talk a little bit more about the clean water applications that Sensus can pull core Xylem into, I think people kind of understand core business pulling Sensus in, but can you talk about other side of that a little bit?","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah, Joe. This is Mark, let me touch on the Sensus accretion question. Primarily two areas, one as we lock down on our valuation and purchase accounting, the amount of amortization related to intangible assets was not as high as we originally expected. So that's about $0.06, and we also did a better job in terms of how we went out and financed the transaction, that was a couple of cents. And they're continuing to perform strongly and have a lot of momentum. So those are the primary reasons.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah, Joe. And on the synergies from a revenue standpoint, I would step back first of all and re-summarize where we think the big ticket areas of opportunities are, I mean, first there is a funnel of a number of large multi-year contracts that Sensus was already pursuing before this partnership with utilities that we already have a good relationship with, that we can help there from a Xylem perspective or that on a combined basis now, the strength of our offering will help us succeed in some of those bids.","Secondly, it's in the area of the wastewater side, where we're able to leverage their metrology in terms of their FlexNet system as well as their data analytics and data science capabilities to provide offerings to a number of customers that we already have in common in the water utility space, but also to be able to go after new customers with a test and improvement offer.","Now, there's lead times involved in doing the engineering and technical work around that, so that's why we don't expect to see meaningful revenue synergies in 2017. And we don't have any of that baked into our guidance, although we're certainly going to drive like hell to deliver some, the bottom line is, we don't have that in our guidance.","And then the third area is, to your point, when we look at the opportunities to now leverage Sensus' capabilities in the clean water network side, we get other parts of our Applied Water business as well as our dewatering and outdoor analytic space, where we believe, we're going to be able to leverage their data analytics and data science and Software-as-a-Service capability to be able to connect our own devices, whether it'd be in the industrial space, whether it'd be in commercial buildings. But again, those are longer lead times, we'll have a lot more to say about the nature of those opportunities and the size, in Investor Day in April.","And then lastly, we haven't even talked about Visenti yet, and we'll hold that until Investor Day, because I think, people will get very excited about what capabilities they bring to the party here as well.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. So, that's great color, and fair to say that the Sensus accretion, almost none of that is from a change in the operational expectations, it's all kind of accounting related, so that's good to see.","As you guys have spent this much money and clearly your focus is on these kind of higher technology type aspects, when I look at your total portfolio and you sit back, are there areas now that maybe don't need to be part of Xylem, that you're not \u2013 that you don't see spending incremental dollars on that maybe you can look to divest?","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah. I certainly, on the divestiture front, I wouldn't ever rule out anything long-term, but I'd say today, as we sit here, I wouldn't expect anything of significant size and scale. Looking at our portfolio and just doing good disciplined portfolio management, whether it'd be where we allocate capital, but also which ones we're wanting to (58:48) be a part of, it's something we look at on a regular basis, and again, if there was anything there of meaning, we would certainly share that at Investor Day, but we don't envision anything of significant size and scale as we sit here today.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Phil De Sousa - Xylem, Inc.","Thanks, Joe.","Operator","Your next question is from Nish Damodara with Robert Baird.","Phil De Sousa - Xylem, Inc.","Hey, Nish.","Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hey, guys. Can you hear me?","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Good morning.","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Good morning.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah, we can.","Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hey, guys. This is Mike Halloran, sorry about that. Must have our lines mixed up.","Phil De Sousa - Xylem, Inc.","Hi, Mike.","Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yeah. So first question, the share count creep here, is this just a reflection of a focus on debt pay down and less of a focus on buying back stock, or is there something else going on?","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","No. You nailed it.","Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","All right. And then...","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","It's \u2013 we're really focused on getting our debt down to where we need to get it.","Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","So second question then, and I'll keep mine to two. When you look backwards at the last time we had an infrastructure bill go through, as I remember it correctly, there were delays going into the bills, people decided to wait and see what kind of funding they could get externally...","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah.","Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","...as opposed to funding things with their current stream, how do you think that dynamic plays out this time? Are you seeing any signs of project softness or anything that would reflect a similar dynamic to the last cycle?","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Mike, I'm in your camp on this based on the very reasons that you laid out. We've not seen it widespread, but we have seen it in pockets where there are projects that are in the hopper that we have seen some slowness in, in terms of \u2013 and we believe it is because of people looking to see well, does it need to be funded locally within our own budgets, or is there going to be state or federal funding that comes forward.","What's encouraging about that is the fact that, we are seeing, and you're probably seeing and hearing from other E&Cs in the space that they're seeing upticks in their quoting activity, and so the work is absolutely out there, and we do believe that we've hit a little bit of a softness here for a couple of quarters, and the question is, when do those things come forward.","And so, that's certainly my perspective, now. Phil's been around here for a long-time, and he can certainly give his perspective specifically on what we've seen historically within the Xylem businesses.","Phil De Sousa - Xylem, Inc.","Mike, I was just going to \u2013 I was just kind of thinking back to that year. And the only thing I'd highlight is, back then, that was \u2013 that created a bit of uncertainty that the market really wasn't ready for, and how to think about it going forward. So that probably went on for a few quarters before it started to shake lose. I think, this time around, yeah \u2013 certainly, there's a little bit of air pocket here, but not likely the last beyond kind of the first quarter or two, here in 2017.","So, I mean, obviously, we're watching it pretty closely. But that's a general feel by our teams, and they're obviously really close to their customers, because we predominantly go direct. So feeling a little bit more confident about the length of which that air pocket might last this time around.","Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Great. Thanks guys.","Phil De Sousa - Xylem, Inc.","You bet.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Thanks, Mike.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Cassil with Seaport Global Securities.","Jacob Schowalter - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Hey. Good morning. This is Jacob on for Ryan.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Good morning.","Phil De Sousa - Xylem, Inc.","Good morning.","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Good morning.","Jacob Schowalter - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Good morning. In commercial, where is the strength that you guys are seeing coming from? Is it more so institutional and government buildings or is it coming from elsewhere?","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah. It's predominantly coming from institutional areas. So, again, we kind of throw that in terms of hospitals, universities, kind of government spend in that space. And so, that's the first piece, as it relates to the U.S.","I would say, the other piece that we're seeing, a pretty strong rebound at this point in time, is within a few of the emerging markets, most notably China bouncing back. China had been on its back year in terms of our commercial building exposure through 2016, and we really saw that turn in the fourth quarter, and we expect that to continue through 2017, and we're seeing a tremendous growth in India from the whole Smart Cities focus as well.","Jacob Schowalter - Seaport Global Securities LLC","All right. And then, in India, I know, you guys got a couple of few larger orders back in early 2016. Did you see any follow-on activity coming through in regards to larger orders for India?","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah, I'd say two things. One, we do see a very rich pipeline and funnel there right now and are actively bidding on projects of similar size. And so, hopefully we'll bag some of that this year. That would not help this year, that would be a 2018 kind of benefit, but we've got very good line of sight to our outlook for 2017, given these are large projects. I would say that, with the focus of Prime Minister Modi on both Infrastructure and Smart Cities, we see that run continuing for quite some time.","Having said that, what we're also doing right now, especially as we have ramped up our manufacturing capabilities there as well as our R&D and Technical Center, we're trying to help our teams there, focus is much on building the day-to-day recurring base there and all the aftermarket service that comes with it to make sure that once we get through the next few years of large projects, that we got a really established, a really attractive and established base business there that recurs.","Jacob Schowalter - Seaport Global Securities LLC","All right. Thank you guys for answering my question.","Phil De Sousa - Xylem, Inc.","Sure. Thank you.","Operator","Our final question comes from Robert Barry with Susquehanna.","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Hey guys, good morning.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Hey, good morning.","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Good morning.","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","I just wanted to actually clarify the answer to an earlier question about the revenue growth progressing. I think, you indicated, was down low-single in the first quarter, kind of flattish and up low-single in the third quarter, I think, kind of implies flattish through the first nine months, so \u2013 which I think implies (01:05:00).","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah to clarify...","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Yeah.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah to clarify, Robert, so really what it is, it's...","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","(01:05:05) back-end weighted.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah. So let me, kind of walk you through it again. So it would be down 1% to 2% in Q1, and it'd flattish to up low-single-digits in Q2. And then, it would be up somewhere in the low-single-digit kind of 2% to 4% in Q3 and Q4.","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","In each of Q3 and Q4?","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","That's correct, and that's really being driven by easier compares, and the uptick in orders here the last couple of quarter is infrastructure.","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Got you, okay. And then, what's your visibility and confidence that we get there? I know, a lot of the business is pretty short cycle?","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah. I'm quite confident on our ability to get there. I think, obviously, we have visibility to Q1, I think, we got a good visibility to Q2, given the project mix that we've got, and what has been happening in backlog, and we'll begin to benefit, to some extent, from the order uptick and Water Infrastructure in Q3 and Q4.","And then, as you look at Q3 and Q4 of 2017, a combination of easier compares as well as just an overall kind of history around the dewatering business and kind of some of the opportunities we see there as we lack those type of compares. So we're \u2013 we think there's quite high confidence in our ability to get to these numbers for full year.","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Got you. And maybe just finally a question on the investment spending in the lock, is investment spending on a year-over-year basis? Is that a headwind or a tailwind? And what's the thought on kind of flexing that is needed to kind of keep margin go up on track, I see, that's been kind of the approach in the past? Thank you.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Sure. Yeah, Rob, but I'll take that one. So yeah, we've got very good line of sight to the planned strategic investments, and as we've done over the course of last few years that I've been here, I mean, we will throttle those as responsibly as we need to be depending upon where the top line is coming in.","And so, we've got good line of sight and discipline around that. At the same time, I would say, there's still a lot of self-help margin expansion opportunity here. And so, we do think there is tremendous opportunities on both the \u2013 both productivity from procurement as well as Lean Six Sigma, as well as trying to overdrive the cost synergies associated with the Sensus partnership here together.","So I mean, the combination of margin expansion opportunities just by good old fashion operating discipline that we're continuing to drive, coupled with line of sight to throttle our investments appropriately, gives us confidence that we will \u2013 we'll deliver on this margin expansion.","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Great. Thank you.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","I will now turn the floor back over to Patrick Decker for any additional or closing remarks.","Patrick K.

McClain","Thank you, Phil, and good morning, everyone. We ended the year expecting a challenging first quarter, and it was. Delays in global treatment projects and tough year-over-year comparisons for our U.S. industrial dewatering business drove our revenue expectations to be down mid-single digits. As we progressed through the first quarter, we saw additional weakness in Europe, and as a result, our top line was 1% weaker than expected. While the top line was disappointing, we gained strength in key areas of the business. Exciting new product launches are winning in the marketplace and are leading to share gains in key markets. Acquisitions added 2% to the top line, including contributions from our 2 most recent acquisitions, which we closed during the first quarter, PIMS and MultiTrode.","Looking at our operating performance, we had better-than-expected segment margins, and as a result, we are reporting EPS of $0.27 for the first quarter, in line with expectations. As we look forward, we are maintaining our full year guidance. The U.S. is a region where we have seen and expect to see growth in 2013 across various end markets. Emerging market conditions remain favorable and we are well positioned, and we expect growth to accelerate through 2013. While Europe is clearly challenged, we are actively monitoring the situation, and we are expecting a significant -- and we are not expecting a significant recovery. We are aggressively taking actions to improve our cost base and reposition ourselves for growth in this region. Now let's dig into the quarterly summary in more detail.","We received orders of 962 million, down 4% in constant currency and 7% organically. Sequentially, relative to the fourth quarter, organic orders were up modestly by 2%. For the first quarter, our book-to-bill ratio is in line with seasonal trends at 1.09. We exit the quarter with backlog of $723 million, up $76 million from year end. Of our shippable backlog, we expect to deliver approximately $400 million in the second quarter and approximately $250 million in the second half. Revenue for the first quarter was $879 million, down 5% in constant currency and 7% organically. We are reporting gross margin of 38% for the first quarter and operating margin of 8.9%. These results primarily reflects lower volume, onetime acquisition costs and continued investments.","We are funding these investments and partially offsetting margin dilution with the contributions of new products, restructuring savings from actions taken in 2012, and cost reductions resulting from Lean Six Sigma and global sourcing initiatives. As I mentioned earlier, EPS was $0.27 for the first quarter. And finally, free cash flow was a negative $10 million, driven primarily by lower income for the quarter, typical seasonality, timing of tax payments and continued investment in growth platform.","Now I'd like to provide you with an update on the business and the progress that we've made on our strategic initiatives. Please turn to Slide 4.","I want to spend a few minutes providing you with an update on the decisions that we have made and the actions that we've already taken against the strategies we discussed at our recent Investor and Analyst Day. First, an incredible focus on delivering customer value. As a reminder, approximately 40% of our annual revenue comes from our large installed base. We pride ourselves on our relationships with our customers, and our goal is to continue to earn their loyalty. Our TotalCare program is all about providing a suite of advanced aftermarket services to create customer value over the long term. With the recent acquisition of PIMS, a U.K. services market leader, we are adding firepower and extending our competitive advantage. Second, drive profitable growth. We continue to make solid advancements in our disciplined acquisition strategy. Most recently, we completed the acquisition of MultiTrode, which enhances our global water and wastewater monitoring and control capabilities. During the first quarter, we began selling the innovative product lines of MJK into China through our in-region analytic sales office, and our PIMS services has been extended to existing customers in Scotland, and Northern Ireland. These are simple examples of how our global presence is driving revenue synergies from our bolt-on acquisition and how we are accelerating our geographic growth. Third, improve business sustainability. We are focused on continually improving the efficiency and effectiveness in all we do, which translates into greater competitive advantage and builds sustainable cycle of financial stability and flexibility. During the quarter, we made substantial progress against our restructuring and realignment initiatives. In January, we opened our new EMEA headquarters office in Schaffhausen, Switzerland. We completed the transition of our European Water Solutions business to the newly formed European management structure. Andr\u00e9 Dhawan is our new leader in the region. He's a seasoned executive with over 10 years of experience in our business running key global operations and corporate strategy. We've communicated to employees the new organization and the rationale behind our changes. This is a more competitive organization and is designed to create more value for our customers. As part of the transition, we've already announced the closure of 1 facility and started integrating our sales organizations. We are moving forward to Phase 2, which is anticipated to be completed later this summer. This will move the European Applied Water Systems business under the newly formed European structure. Let me wrap up this point by saying that we are on track to deliver the targeted $13 million to $15 million of net savings from 2013 actions. This is in addition to the expected $12 million of savings from the actions we executed in 2012.","Let me illustrate how these 3 strategies on this page come to life. 2 weeks ago, I visited our facility in Auburn, New York. There, we produce the Goulds Water Technology brand for products in our residential, commercial and industrial markets. We have been investing in new products and technologies in our Applied Water segment. Our energy-leading e-SV, which is produced in this plant, saw double-digit growth in North America in the first quarter and is now in its third year of strong double-digit growth. Over the past 2 years, this facility has undergone a complete transformation. Our Lean efforts have resulted in cycle time reductions of 20% to 40%, higher on-time performance and 25% reduction in floor space. This site was also the first to implement our new ERP platform in the first quarter, which will further improve operational efficiency and our response time and accuracy. In Europe, our Hungary facility has completed a similar Lean transformation. There, we are producing our new ecocirc heating pump, which is growing more than 20%. In both cases, we are taking share through a combination of product and factory innovation and creating value for our customers. As I continue to share with you, we are gaining traction against our most critical strategies that advance customer value: new product launches, our TotalCare services program and expanding our portfolio with acquisition. This is the best way to drive growth, and this is precisely what we are doing. All the while, we continue to execute on our operational performance in these tough market dynamics.","Now let me turn the call over to our CFO, Mike Speetzen, to walk you through the first quarter 2013 results. Mike?","Michael T. Speetzen","Thanks, Gretchen. Please go to Slide 5. In the first quarter, Xylem revenues were $879 million, down 5% from our first quarter in 2012.","Let me provide some perspective on our revenue performance by end market and by region. First, in our largest end market, industrial. Organic revenue was down 10% year-over-year in the first quarter, performing worse than anticipated. In the U.S., we continue to be negatively impacted by year-over-year comparisons of water transport applications supporting natural gas frac-ing and destocking by some distributors, particularly those serving the U.S. mining industry. We also saw some weakness in niche markets like marine, which was unfavorably impacted by a cooler start to the season. European industrial market weakness continued in the first quarter, down mid-single digits. Project timing in emerging markets drove a year-over-year decline in industrial markets, particularly in the Middle East and Asia-Pac, which were both down double digits.","First quarter revenue from the public utility market declined high single digits year-over-year. Overall, this was in line with our expectations for the quarter. In the U.S., where we were up low single digits, we saw an acceleration of activity, driven primarily by previously delayed replacement and maintenance work. We continue to see stability in Northern Europe. However, year-over-year project timing, spending cuts in Southern Europe and funding challenges in Eastern Europe resulted in a double-digit decline for the first quarter. Commercial building services were down low single digits, primarily driven by weak institutional construction market conditions in the U.S. and slowing retrofit opportunities. Outside of the U.S., we continue to see strong results, particularly from emerging markets. For example, fire pumps and integrated commercial building packages drove double-digit growth in Latin America and China. While year-over-year sales were flat for the quarter, we saw conditions improving in the Middle East and are cautiously optimistic about construction growth in the region moving forward. Residential was down low single digits in the first quarter. In the U.S. we were up low single digits, with performance driven by seasonal promotions and improving market conditions for new and existing home sales. Europe was down double digits, driven primarily by weaker market conditions in Southern Europe. And as for agriculture, we were up high single digits for the first quarter, driven by better-than-expected results in the U.S. and project shipments into Latin America.","Let me spend just a few minutes on our overall geographic performance. The U.S. was down 6% on an organic basis in the first quarter, in line with our expectations. Relative to our expectations, we saw weaker industrial market conditions. These were partially offset by a pickup in public utility maintenance and repair activity after a slowdown in the fourth quarter and strength in residential. Europe was down 8% for the first quarter, below our expectations of a mid-single digit year-over-year decline, driven by weaker industrial and residential market conditions, particularly in Southern Europe. Emerging market organic revenue declined 9% for the first quarter, reflecting the impact of year-over-year project timing in our Water Infrastructure segment. China and Russia continued their upward trajectory, both posting double-digit growth in the quarter.","Gross margin was 38% and operating margin was 8.9% for the quarter. Margins were negatively impacted by year-over-year volume declines and associated leverage loss. Additionally, we continued to invest in the business, which impacted margins by 70 basis points. Partially offsetting these headwinds were benefits from cost reduction initiatives, including the benefit from restructuring actions executed in 2012 and price. As we indicated in Investor and Analyst Day, we anticipate that acquisitions and foreign exchange will have an unfavorable impacted on margins this year.","In the first quarter, we saw 40 basis points of headwind from acquisitions, primarily reflecting the impact of purchase accounting, integration and transaction costs. In addition, foreign exchange translation and transaction unfavorably impacted operating margins by 30 basis points.","Please turn to Slide 6. This slide shows our EPS walk for the first quarter. We're porting $0.27 of EPS, down $0.09 from the prior year. Core operations were down $0.08, driven primarily by volume decline, continued investment in strategic initiatives and costs associated with acquisitions. Restructuring savings and net cost reductions driven by our Lean Six Sigma and global sourcing initiatives partially offset these impacts. As planned, the completion of Phase 1 of our European realignment actions provided a $0.01 benefit to EPS, and foreign exchange was unfavorable by $0.02.","During the first quarter, we recorded a tax benefit of approximately $1 million related to a foreign tax refund. However, according to the terms of the tax matter agreement, we're required to make payment of refunded amount to ITT, and therefore, recorded an offsetting nonoperating expense. Backing this out, our adjusted operating tax rate would've been approximately 22%, in line with our expectations.","Now let me provide more detail for each of our reporting segments. Please turn to Slide 7. For the first quarter, Water Infrastructure reported revenue of $551 million, down 5% over prior year on a constant currency basis and down 9% organically. Acquisitions contributed 4 points to the top line growth. Transport declined 7% for the first quarter. In the U.S., transport declined high single digits, primarily due to a significant decline in industrial dewatering applications. This decline was driven by tough year-over-year comparisons for natural gas frac-ing-related applications and lower distributor sales, which we attribute primarily to a decline in mining. These declines were partially offset by favorable public utility performance, driven by an acceleration of operating activities and a continuation of Sandy disaster recovery dewatering projects. In Europe, transport declined in the mid-single digits, driven by funding constraints and project execution delays and broad-based spending cuts in Southern Europe. While market conditions in most of Europe continue to be challenged, conditions in Northern Europe remained stable. Treatment revenues declined 22% for the first quarter, driven by 2 factors. First, in the developed markets, we continue to see market softness. As an example, water and wastewater capital spending in the U.S. remains down, and we continue to see municipal funding constraints in Europe. We anticipate that these regions will continue to lag in performance, at least until confidence is restored and project orders are released. Secondly, the first quarter also reflects how project timing can impact any one quarter's performance. For example, the Middle East and Asia-Pac were down double digits year-over-year due to a few large projects that shipped in the first quarter for 2012. And lastly, test revenues were down 8% due to the timing of European project shipments in 2012.","First quarter operating margins came in at 9.4%. Operating excellence and restructuring actions drove 340 basis points of margin expansion. As you can see from the slide, these cost reductions, coupled with favorable price of 30 basis points, slightly offset the organic volume decline and continued investment in the business by 20 bps. Our margins were negatively impacted by 60 basis points of acquisition dilution and 50 basis points from foreign exchange.","Let me now turn to Slide #8 and talk through Applied Water. Applied Water's first quarter revenue was down 3% on both a constant currency and organic basis. Building services was down 3%, driven by the commercial and residential performance I covered earlier. Industrial water was down 6% and was primarily attributable to weakness in the U.S. and Europe. In the U.S., we were down approximately 10%. Our results were unfavorably impacted by weakness in marine and a weaker general industrial market. Europe was down mid-single digits due to continued weakness in Southern Europe. Partially offsetting these headwinds, we continue to see favorable results in emerging market regions. For example, Latin America and Asia-Pac both posted double-digit growth in beverage dispensing applications, and Russia also posted favorable performance. And lastly, irrigation was up 7%, with the U.S. and Latin America up double digits, partially offset by Europe being down high single digits. Applied Water posted strong operating performance during the first quarter, with margins up 170 basis points to 12.2%. Price and productivity actions, including the benefit of restructuring actions taken in 2012 coupled with new product sales, more than offset the impact of lower volume and inflation, enabling continued investment in this segment.","Now let me turn to Slide 9 and review our financial position. Free cash flow was slightly negative in the first quarter. Our performance is in line with our expectations and reflects the impact of lower volume and the anticipated increase in tax payments. These tax payments were related to extensions provided by taxing authorities following Superstorm Sandy. Our available cash on hand was $375 million, reflecting the deployment of $78 million into acquisitions and $15 million in share repurchases. Our net debt to net capital ratio remains at a healthy 29%, and our credit metrics are in line with expectations and our credit ratings. Our commercial paper and revolving credit facilities remain in place and continue to be unutilized.","Please turn to Slide #10. We are affirming the guidance we provided at our 2013 Investor and Analyst Day. So in the interest of time, here are the highlights. We anticipate 2013 revenues of approximately $3.9 billion, which reflects total growth of 3% to 4%, consisting of flat to 1% organic growth and 2 points of growth from acquisitions. We've prepared a revenue outlook summary on the next slide providing insight to our planning assumptions, but before we move on, let me make just a few more points. While foreign exchange rate fluctuations could impact our performance in 2013, we have not seen any significant movements that would require adjustment to our guidance. Segment margins are anticipated to be in the range of 13.7% to 14.2%, and company operating margins are projected to be in the range of 12.2% to 12.7%. We anticipate second quarter segment and operating margins to improve sequentially similar to 2012. We anticipate full year earnings per share of $1.79 to $1.89. This range excludes onetime restructuring and realignment costs of approximately $60 million to $70 million pretax but includes approximately $5 million of additional onetime separation costs and $5 million in higher pension costs. Free cash flow conversion is forecasted to be approximately 95%. Our operating tax rate is expected to be approximately 21%, a reduction from 24% in 2012. This rate reflects a sustainable benefit from the establishment of our new European headquarters in Schaffhausen, Switzerland. Please note, because of certain milestones, including the rollout of the European structure across our regional businesses, we expect the operating tax rate to average approximately 22% over the first half of 2013 and 20% over the second half.","Please turn to Slide 11, which illustrates our revenue outlook by end market and outlines a few of the related planning assumptions around the balance of the year. Industrial is our largest end market, representing 43% of our revenues. For the full year, we expect flat to up low-single-digit organic growth. We expect challenging market conditions to continue in Europe but have not factored further declines into our outlook. We do anticipate the U.S. industrial markets will improve sequentially for the second half of the year. It's also important to note that our performance will be against relatively easy prior year comparisons. Revenues from public utilities, now 35% of our total revenue, are expected to be flat with 2012 levels. We continue to expect stability in required operations and maintenance activities, as this spend is largely non-discretionary and is funded by tariffs to end users. As we have discussed during previous quarters, the portion of public utility revenue that is derived from CapEx project spending continues to be constrained by project delays. Given the longer lead times for such projects and the absence of any significant change in CapEx spending levels, our forecast for 2013 assumes that this continues to be the case. We expect that demand for emerging market public utility infrastructure will be a source of growth for Xylem in 2013. Our revenues from commercial markets are expected to be flat to up low single digits. Indicators such as the commercial Architectural Billing Index have improved for the first quarter, which could lead to a recovery in the second half. We've assumed a modest improvement in the U.S., offsetting the weakness we saw in Europe during the first quarter. Additionally, we expect that new products and emerging market revenues will continue to grow at a faster-than-developed-market rate. Residential markets support flat to low-single-digit growth, as our product sales are largely driven by replacement sales associated with our large installed base. We see potential for favorable performance in the U.S. market and have assumed that the European markets stabilize.","Agriculture remains a small market for us, and revenues are likely to be flat. Despite a strong start in the U.S. and Latin America regions, we expect flat year-over-year performance, primarily due to the difficult comparison from 2012. Taken together, the low-growth economic environment along with the relative stability of demand for the critical types of products we sell across a variety of end markets suggest flat to low growth in 2013.","Please turn to Slide 12. Although I've covered this slide in the past, let me walk you through it again, as I highlight important margin and EPS dynamics impacting 2013. First, we are incorporating the remaining required onetime separation costs for IT systems and corporate headquarters relocation into our guidance. These costs result in a $0.02 reduction to EPS and a decrease of 10 basis points to our operating margin. We expect a $0.01 dilutive impact to EPS for foreign exchange and acquisitions. At the operating margin line, these drivers will have an unfavorable impact of 50 basis points. Operating margins related to the acquisitions are unfavorably impacted by certain purchase accounting adjustments and integration and transaction costs. Excluding these impacts, operating margins for these acquisition would be accretive to Xylem's operating margin. Cost savings initiatives, restructuring savings and productivity are expected to drive a $0.07 benefit to EPS and 50 basis points of margin improvement, more than offsetting the unfavorable impact of higher pension cost of approximately $0.02, continued investment in growth initiatives and the headwind from a low organic growth environment. Finally, our European realignment will add $0.03 to EPS. The lower tax rate discussed earlier will more than offset the higher run rate costs associated with the new European organizational structure. At the segment and operating margin lines, this is expected to have a 30 basis point negative impact. The combination of all these items results in an EPS of $1.84 and an operating margin of 12.5%, consistent with our guidance midpoint for 2013.","Please turn to Slide #13, and I'll turn it back over to Gretchen to wrap up.","Gretchen W. McClain","In summary, we continue to make progress on our growth strategy through the acquisition of PIMS and MultiTrode. We delivered solid operating performance despite macro challenges, which resulted in a softer top line performance than we expected at the beginning of the year. As we move forward in 2013, we are continuing our investments for growth, launching new products and solutions to better serve our customers, driving Lean Six Sigma and global sourcing initiatives, executing on our restructuring and realignment plans and advancing our acquisition strategy by executing against a robust pipeline of opportunities. While market conditions remain challenging, the fundamentals of our business are strong, the macro trends in water are compelling, and we are advancing our growth strategy. I am confident in the Xylem team, our technologies and solutions and our direction.","With that, we'll be happy to take your question. Laura?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ryan Connors of Janney Montgomery Scott.","Ryan M. Connors - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","I had a question that relates to -- you mentioned Sandy a couple of times in the prepared remarks. I wonder if you could -- if there's any way you can quantify the impact there, whether it be in terms of top line or margin or EPS, any kind of granularity you can give us on what impact that had on the quarter would be helpful.","Gretchen W. McClain","Yes. So in first quarter, we saw revenue of Sandy at $3.5 million. You've got a couple of dynamics going on with Sandy. One, we've had our dewatering pumps there longer than we had actually anticipated. The release of disaster funding has been slower than anticipated, so some of the work that we were hoping would start has been delayed, but obviously, opportunities as we go into second quarter and the remaining of the year.","Ryan M. Connors - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then second, I guess, follow-up question. You mentioned mining as a headwind to your industrial business. Can you give us a little more color there, specifically on where we stand there in terms of bookings and backlog as we've moved into April here and what inning you think we are in, in that pullback in your opinion and based on what you're seeing in the business?","Gretchen W. McClain","Sure, good question. So mining really is impacting our dewatering business. So let me give you a little flavor of what we're seeing since April. So April is giving us some good indications, a little bit more confidence in a few areas. Dewatering, we are seeing some order pickup from the natural gas activity. And then mining, globally, there's still opportunities for us from a dewatering perspective. So as I look at our dewatering business, which is the most impacted, it is in line with our expectations going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Halloran of Robert W. Baird.","Michael Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","So just to tack on to that last one when you started talking about the trends in April that you've seen on the dewatering side. Could you maybe talk about more broadly, through the whole platform, how trends tracked through the quarter? I know at the Analyst Day, you talked about a little bit weaker February. How did March end up? And then what have you seen so far through April more broadly? And are you seeing any inflection points one way or another yet?","Gretchen W. McClain","Sure, let me give you some flavor on that. So as we went through the first quarter, we knew we were coming into a low growth environment. We knew we had some tough compares from our previous very strong 2012 first quarter. So what we did see is January, February, a little low. We had a pretty good March. It wasn't a great March, but had a pretty good March. As we've come now into April, as I mentioned, I'd say April has a couple of good indicators for us. More confidence in a few areas: dewatering, as I mentioned; natural gas; as well as the disaster that we're all seeing in the Midwest, flooding, that's helping. The other area I would say is our orders in Europe is in line with our expectations, so we're seeing some progress there. Again, we're watching that closely. Our loading program and our building services area has -- looks nice coming into the second quarter, which is obviously a good sign for us. So overall, in line with our expectations at this point. When I look at the opportunity in front of us, natural gas, the flooding, the U.S. residential market is positive. And the areas that we're watching, as I mentioned, is Europe, some of the project delays and any other uncertainty in terms of the market. But right now, more positive indicators.","Michael T. Speetzen","Yes, Mike. I guess the only thing I would add is, relative to when we talked to everybody on Investor Day, we had some projects push out of the first quarter that -- the good thing is that they're rescheduled later in the year, so we've got good line of sight to that. But that was probably the one area that came out of the expectations that we had articulated at that point in time.","Michael Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","That makes sense. And then Mike, a point of clarification on one of your comments. When you said that you're expecting second quarter margins to be comparable to 2012, I just want to make sure. Were you saying comparable on a year-over-year basis to 2Q '12, or the move from 1Q to 2Q would be comparable in '12 versus '13?","Michael T. Speetzen","Yes, the move. I think if you look at 2012 from Q1 to Q2, we saw about a 280, 290 basis point movement in margins. We see a very similar line of sight in the second quarter of '13.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Deane Dray of Citi Research.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","What I'd like to get some more color on is the municipal market. You said now this is 35% of the mix. And I'm trying to bridge some of the comments about you're seeing some stability in the U.S. muni, but you're also saying there's no capital spending, big projects releases, and we know that this has been an ongoing position for the municipalities. So within the part that they are able to spend, which is OpEx, some of it's break and fix. There's no discretion, have to fix those. But it sounds as though there's an element of business that falls under OpEx where there is some discretion and there had been some pushouts. And maybe you could just give us some color as to what those projects are. They're not the big CapEx. They're not break and fix. But they are falling into that OpEx, and in some cases, there's some discretion on pushouts.","Gretchen W. McClain","Yes, Deane, let me just kind of step back on the muni market. As you mentioned, there's the CapEx and there's the OpEx. What we saw -- and I'll talk very specifically about the U.S. first -- is last fall, we actually saw, with the uncertainty in the market, the fiscal cliff concern, we actually saw some pullback in some of what I would say is maintenance operations that typically would be done in expanding cycle. When we came into the first quarter of the year, we saw the OpEx, our transport side of the business, see some positive effects because of that. We're also seeing a couple of areas where we have advanced new products and services. So we are working with our public utilities to bring solutions around energy efficiency, helping them with -- from a maintenance cost, bring their cost down so that they can free up dollars to go towards capital expenditures. As Mike said in his remarks, our capital expenditure, we're not assuming that's going to change substantially. However, the bidding activity, as we continue to talk about, is still strong. The portfolio -- I mean, our funnel is strong, but we're not seeing any signs of any kind of sustainable release of those orders at that point in time.","Michael T. Speetzen","And Deane, I think it's evidenced by the strength that we saw in the U.S., where we were up essentially 6% relative to -- those delays, from an operational standpoint, can't happen for a long period of time, and I think you saw that play out in the first quarter.","Gretchen W. McClain","I'd just add one more piece, which is tariffs continue to grow across the board. In the U.S., they're up around 6%. And you've also have got regulatory-type requirements that are ultimately driving the implementation of some projects, both maintenance as well as CapEx, as the funding gets released.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","That's helpful. And I didn't hear you use the term sequester. So was there any pressures from the sequester side that's -- any expectations?","Gretchen W. McClain","I would say mostly in our analytics business, our YSI business, where a lot of instrumentation goes through universities, colleges and so forth. But right now, we still feel confident in our direction and the orders that we're getting in. But that is an area that we are watching and we'll keep a close eye on going forward.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Great. Just one follow-up. The comment on PIMS, the point of saying you're in Scotland and Northern Ireland. Now was PIMS already in those regions? And maybe just some color there. And how do you scale up a business that does involve a lot of headcount, and -- so what is the plan to roll out there?","Gretchen W. McClain","Yes, great question. Let me just talk a little bit. If you looked at PIMS specifically, they were mostly in the U.K, and they played predominantly in the industrial side, which complemented us very well, because we play in the public utility side. Where they were not -- where we are entering in Northern Ireland and Scotland, it's specifically through our existing sales channels, going to see the public utility and actually being able to service them more robustly. In terms of scaling this out, let me tell you how we're working through that. PIMS had a very good set of tools and documentation that we are actually now being able to deploy out through our seasoned sales companies to be able to drive that. We're also using some of their core talent to help us train those teams so that they can get up and running. There's no question you'll need people in each of the regions, but in terms of the core competency, the business model, the dos, the don'ts, it'll actually allow us to run more quickly.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Maczka of BB&T Capital Markets.","Kevin R. Maczka - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Can you touch on price cost briefly? It seems like in both segments you had some price benefit, but yet you call out a pretty sizable hit here on the material, labor and overhead inflation. I would imagine the material side gets much easier for you going forward with what's happening in commodities, but can you just talk about that bucket a little more, the material, labor and overhead?","Gretchen W. McClain","Yes, let me just take the price question, and I'll let Mike walk through some of the details. But overall, we saw in the first quarter 60 basis points from price. We've been talking about driving strategic pricing across the organization, and we have been very successful in doing that. This year, we are in a competitive environment, and we want to make sure that we maintain the share in the markets that are important to us. And so we've talked about 1 to 2 points that we are driving across the organization. In 2013, we will be at the low end of that.","Michael T. Speetzen","Yes. And so if you think about inflation, I mean, our inflation in the first quarter was about 2.8%. The way we've got that factored in for the balance of the year is definitely on a declining basis, so you ought to be expecting around 2.5% from a full year. So that will become a bit of a tailwind. I think that plays to some of the dynamics we're seeing on the front end from a pricing standpoint, as well as just the year-over-year compares relative to commodity pricing and input costs.","Kevin R. Maczka - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay. And then, Mike, a second one from me. You mentioned pushouts a couple of times, some things moving out of Q1, maybe into Q2 or the back half. Is that what really gives you the confidence to stick with a 0% to 1% organic after a negative 7% in Q1?","Michael T. Speetzen","Yes. I guess there's a couple of things that play into that. Definitely, with some of the projects pushing out, they pushed out beyond essentially Q2. There's some underlying dynamics that play out as we go into the year. One is, you've got seasonality. So if you look from Q1 to Q2, the percentage of our backlog that's shippable within the current quarter is pretty consistent as we go into Q2 as it was in Q1. And so we've got about, as Gretchen mentioned, just over $400 million worth of backlog in the pipeline as we head into Q2. And from a seasonable standpoint, we do typically ramp up into the second quarter. There was a number of things that happened in our business around loading programs that go into the Applied Water segment, et cetera. As we look out through the balance of the year, we haven't seen anything yet that tells us that things are going to be dramatically different. I think people are still projecting that the industrial production level in the U.S., although it's down versus last year slightly from a growth standpoint, it's on a increasing basis versus last year, things were on a pretty steady decline throughout the year. So that's a dynamic that works in our favor. Certainly, natural gas pricing, now over $4, gives us a good view relative to frac-ing pads coming back online, and our business that delivers water to the frac pad will, obviously, potentially benefit from that. And then you just have some of the other seasonal characteristics. You've got the flooding in the Midwest that's obviously going to play to that. And then overall, you've got the compares. So our growth rates last year were on a sequential declining basis, and by the time we got to the fourth quarter, we had essentially a negative 3% -- I think, negative 3.4% organic growth. So there's some of that, that, from a compare standpoint, helps from a growth perspective.","Gretchen W. McClain","And I would just add a couple of points, which is we had new products that we're launching. We're expanding geographically, even with the acquisitions that we've acquired, and gives us confidence as we go through the rest of the year. We've got a short cycle. As I think about quarter 2, we've got -- when you look at quarter 2, it's going to ramp up, which is seasonally aligned. It's about 25% of our revenue. And we're basically expecting second quarter to be down low single digits.","Michael T. Speetzen","Yes. And then I guess the only other piece I'd add is -- the question was probably more around revenue. But I think from a margin standpoint, it's also important to think about, obviously, we've got the sequentially improvement from revenue. You can see the impact from a volume leverage perspective. It played out against us in Q1, but that will obviously become a tailwind for us as we go through the year. We made great progress from a restructuring standpoint. We recorded about $5 million worth of cost in the first quarter, but I think it's important to understand that we essentially initiated about 70% of our actions. So we're going to have a substantial benefit in the back half of the year, well over $10 million to $11 million worth of benefit coming from the actions initiated in 2013. We're already seeing the benefits from 2012 play out, and then we've obviously got the continued focus around cost and the fact that inflation should be moderating as we get into the back half of the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Rose of Wedbush Securities.","David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","If I may follow up on the inflation question briefly, and then I have one other one. On the inflation question, is there -- other than raw materials coming in, can you give us a bit more dynamic of what your expectations are for labor and why inflation is so high versus the headline numbers that we see? I mean, is it geographical differences? Is it labor? Maybe you can you give us a little bit more color. And then I'll have a follow-up.","Michael T. Speetzen","Yes. So labor definitely plays into it. As a factor relative to the total inflation number that we provide, labor contributes about 1 point to that. So throughout the globe, we see, obviously, different inflation rates in terms of what the various labor forces are looking for. And it's obviously a little bit higher in some of our developing regions. But I do think that plays out quite a bit. We see the material component moderating, as I mentioned earlier. That takes time to work itself through the system. We have very little direct commodity exposure, so most of what we're exposed to ultimately comes through some sort of a component that's had some value associated with it. That takes time to work itself through from an inventory standpoint. And then really, our manufacturing overhead, it contributes some. We're seeing normal levels of inflation there. But I think the biggest single component starts with labor, and then it moves quickly to material.","David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. On then on the -- on your treatment business, I'm trying to reconcile some of the commentary around project delays and then regulation. Maybe you can give us a little bit more color in terms of why the treatment business is down as much as it is and your expeditions going forward outside of some of the project delays?","Gretchen W. McClain","Yes, David, let me take that in terms of the treatment. Treatment is driven primarily from the capital expenditures and the budgets around the globe. We see significant opportunity in the emerging markets as they're building infrastructure to be able to have the economies in the future, we see that as an opportunity going forward. The funnel is getting stronger in the Middle East. It's getting stronger in Asia-Pacific. But even in the developed regions, Europe and in the U.S., while there's bidding activity, given the funding is just not there in the public utilities, it's not being released. Let me give you a couple of dynamics. In  first quarter of 2012, we had a substantial amount of large orders. And in this quarter, we saw a little less, but we also saw about -- some of those projects slipping throughout the rest of the year. It's a good thing we have those in hand. It's a matter of them shipping later this year, so I feel good about that. In the treatment, half of our funnel is -- I mean, half of our orders are filled. And so it's a continuation going forward.","Michael T. Speetzen","David, I'd also add we saw some dynamics in Europe that played out last year where there were biogas regulations that played out in Germany, a little bit in Italy as well. Those have since essentially dissipated, and so there's a little bit of that, that you have in terms of the year-over-year compares as well.","David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay. So it's going to be lumpy throughout the remainder of the year, but you feel comfortable because you have projects in hand?","Gretchen W. McClain","I'd say, it's going to be lumpy. We've got projects in hand. Like I said, half of them, we've got book-to-bill that we can still go after and so forth. So we'll be watching our treatment business as we go forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Summerville of KeyBanc.","Joseph K. Radigan - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","This is Joe Radigan on for Matt. Just had a follow-up on the seasonality question. As we model the balance of the year, I mean, you're going to see stronger seasonal trends in the second quarter, but what do you expect the linearity to look like through the back half? Should we expect -- I mean, you're getting the cost -- the benefits from the cost takeout in the back half of the year. Do you expect fourth quarter to be the high water mark in terms of operating income and EPS or -- how do you expect that to fall throughout the course of the year?","Michael T. Speetzen","Yes. So from a -- it all starts, obviously, with the top line. We see our linearity playing out pretty similar to what we've seen if you looked at an average over the past several years. So I'd expect Q3 to be relatively consistent with the second quarter, and obviously fourth quarter will be the height, and that's pretty consistent with what we've seen historically. That is typically when we see our highest-margin performance. That obviously gets somewhat accentuated by the fact that we're executing a bunch of restructuring actions. Primarily, we obviously made great progress in Q1 and in Q2, and we'll be seeing the full benefit in the back half. And so those dynamics will play out and support a higher margin level in the fourth quarter.","Joseph K. Radigan - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then on the MRO side, did you recapture any of the pushout you saw in the fourth quarter, or was it just a return to sort of the normal buying patterns there? And then on the destocking that you talked about last quarter and again this quarter, has that abated now, or do you anticipate a further headwind going forward?","Michael T. Speetzen","Yes. I think on the maintenance side, the public utilities, we definitely saw that play back out. I mean, the U.S. we were essentially up about 6%. So we've seen that come back in line. I think, as it relates to the destocking, the most recent activity we've seen is more around the dewatering. And again, it's relative to the first quarter of last year, when we still saw strength from a mining standpoint. And most of the destocking is in the channel where the mining activity has come down and the distributors are essentially not wanting to carry as much stock. The other parts of the business, I'd say, there really hasn't been a big change, as we've mentioned in the past. We're carrying more inventory to supplement the fact that our customers are looking for very short lead times now, and they're really looking for us to be able to react to that. So we're obviously pushing hard to have the factories be responsive, as well as making sure we're carrying safety stock to meet those requirements. But aside from the dewatering, we didn't see a big change.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chip Moore of Canaccord.","Chip Moore - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Back to pricing. Understandable that driving price gets a little tougher just given the -- some of the end market uncertainty. Can you talk about how much of that 1 point in '13 is driven by some of the newer products and services and then how that could set you up for next year?","Gretchen W. McClain","Yes. As we've been investing in new product launches, we've been putting a lot of effort into making sure that we have a value proposition, that we really position ourselves differently and can bring something different to the customer that they value. So our gross margins, our pricing situation around those new projects, I feel very confident about. So that is helping. As I highlighted, a couple of our new products that we are launching are seeing double-digit type of advancement. So I feel good. Our vitality index, as I've talked about in terms of the robustness of our new products, is at about 16% this year. Just a couple of years ago, it was 12%. So we're continuing to advance. We continue to see them penetrate the market, and that also gives us the confidence that we've got the right position and the right portfolio going forward to address the water issues in the market.","Chip Moore - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Great. And then one more. We've talked about dewatering quite a bit, but maybe you can touch on some of the asset utilization trends just by geography, whether you've had to make any significant adjustments there?","Michael T. Speetzen","Yes. I mean, we clearly -- we manage this business very different than we do the rest of the portfolio. And really, starting back in first half of 2012, we started making adjustments. The good thing for us is the equipment is movable between different end markets, and so that gives us some flexibility. We did dial back our capital expenditures in line with the revenue decline we saw coming into '12 as well as into '13. But we're still focused on expanding. We're going into new markets. Obviously, we've talked a lot about Australia, but we're also going into Latin America and into Asia. And so we see areas where we're continuing to invest. In those markets, we've actually seen growth. We're we've essentially had to pull back in certain areas of asset investment has really been primarily in the U.S. And it's a generic statement to make, because there's actually some parts of the business where we've had to invest because the dewatering equipment is being utilized, for example, to support the Superstorm Sandy recovery and some of the activities going on in the Midwest. There's other models where we've had -- obviously had to dial back. So it's a pretty complicated and detailed analysis. But I'd say overall, we've seen a pullback in the U.S. in terms of where our investment is, but we're still moving geographically where we're seeing the growth.","Gretchen W. McClain","I'd just add to this that our whole dewatering model, we bought the -- a leading, #1 position in the U.S. with Godwin, and our goal here was ultimately to be able, internationally, to expand ourselves. So we're trying to have that right balance in terms of pulling back where it make sense but also making sure that we're investing for the global opportunity in front of us. I think last year I mentioned that we had our first dewatering order into China. We now have our first dewatering order into India, and so we are expanding nicely in terms of our opportunity and reach. So I feel very confident about our growth opportunity for dewatering going forward internationally.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thielman of D.A. Davidson.","Brent Thielman - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","On the building services side of Applied Water, as we're starting to see planning for new non-res projects picking up, can you elaborate a little more on maybe some of the incremental signs you may be seeing within your own business that gives you confidence in that improvement in commercial in the second half?","Gretchen W. McClain","Can you say your question again, because you came in very, very low?","Brent Thielman - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Sorry about that. Yes, just on building services side of Applied Water, obviously, some of the leading indicators seeming to show non-res projects picking up, or at least planning around it. Can you elaborate a little bit more on some of the incremental signs you might be seeing within your own business that gives you some confidence in that improvement in commercial for the second half?","Gretchen W. McClain","Yes, sure. When I look at building services, a couple of things. As I mentioned earlier, in April, we saw our loading program around the building services come in very nicely. So that gives us good confidence. We're also seeing, in the U.S., residential playing out nicely. But typically, that's before you see commercial, and we're seeing our architectural billing increasing, which is a good indicator that, in the future here, that we'll see nice projects. When I look at it from a geographic perspective, we're seeing nice growth in southern -- I mean, in Latin America. We're also seeing nice growth in Asia-Pacific and the Middle East. We see that's going to show signs of improvement. We had political unrest there for quite a while. I think we've got the right team and the right position there to continue to go forward. So U.S. recovery in the second part of the year, and I feel pretty good about the direction of the new products the teams are launching.","Brent Thielman - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Okay. And then just on the Water Infrastructure segment. You mentioned difficult comps for the emerging market regions. When did those start to ease? And it sounded like you were expecting some improvement going forward. Is that due to higher quotation levels, or you're actually starting to see some orders received?","Gretchen W. McClain","When I -- when we came out of first quarter, our book-to-bill in our Water Infrastructure was about 1.09, consistent with what we said in Xylem. So our book-to-bill is in line with where we are and in line with what we saw historically. So I feel good about that. When I look at the Water Infrastructure and public utilities, again, you're seeing the need for the infrastructure in the emerging markets, and our position is playing out nicely. Where I feel confident, I'll go back to new product launches. Experior had been -- has had a nice launch into the market. We have worked with many of our customers to pilot our products, and ultimately, that's leading them to see energy efficiency and ultimately to buy as we go forward. So I feel pretty confident about our base operations side of the house. CapEx is the area where we've got to watch in terms of the funding and how that flows.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Jim Krapfel of Morningstar.","James Krapfel - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","What was the growth rate of total aftermarket revenue in the past couple of quarters, where do you see that growth for the rest of the year, and how much does that presumed revenue mix shift towards aftermarket contribute to your expected margin performance in 2013?","Gretchen W. McClain","So I'll take it from an aftermarket perspective. In first quarter, overall aftermarket was down. That plays to the dynamics of the industrial market being down. You've got mining down. You've got -- then that drives the use of a lot of your products and services there. Applied Water, up 1%. And so you're seeing, where there is growth, you're continuing to see that aftermarket. Going forward, we do see the aftermarket still playing as we think the industrial market plays out. And so we believe we'll see a positive growth in the aftermarket by the end of the year.","Michael T. Speetzen","Yes. And I guess the one thing I'd add, Jim, is with the project being -- I'm sorry, project business being down, one of the things that goes along with project business is initial provisioning of spare parts. And so that obviously is a knock-on effect that we're seeing playing out, as well as we see headwind from our project business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stewart Scharf of S&P IQ.","Stewart Scharf - S&P Equity Research","Could you talk a little about the M&A, and has anything changed -- or what are the multiples? And are you looking more in one direction or just being opportunistic at this point?","Gretchen W. McClain","Yes, great question. And clearly, M&A and inorganic growth is a key strategy for us as we go forward. I feel very good about our pipeline, probably as robust -- it's as robust as I think we've ever had it. If you look at our track record, the last several quarters, we've been able to announce a new acquisition. So the team is aggressively working hard. We're working in terms of candidates, working in terms of the same areas that we've talked about. Analytics is clearly a key area as we go forward. Dewatering continues to be an opportunity for us. Services, as we look at how we can support our large infrastructure and the customers that we currently have. So those are the key areas. We haven't kind of moved off of that. They're a substantial fragmented market that we work within, and we feel good. The multiples continue to stay stable. And so we're in the game, and we hope to continue to play hard.","Stewart Scharf - S&P Equity Research","Okay. And regarding Venezuela, what is your position there, and have you changed your thinking about that area with the currency devaluation and geopolitical situation?","Michael T. Speetzen","Yes, very small presence, limited currency exposure, most of the currency is utilized within-country. So it's really a non-issue for us.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Konigsberg of Vertical Research.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Just a point of clarification, Q2 guidance and just how it relates to the year. Gretchen, I think you said that Q2 was going to be down low single digits. We talked about the sequential improvement of margins similar to what we saw last year between Q1 and Q2, around 270 basis points. Just kind of plugging it in and assuming kind of stable corporate costs and interest expense, everything else, I mean, I see the contribution relative to the midpoint of your full year guidance closer to 20%, not 25%. And then you were saying that Q3 is probably going to be a similar level to Q2, and then you'll see a bump in Q4, which actually would require a fairly substantial increase. And I know you're getting more restructuring and other items, but it just seems unusually large. Maybe I kind of misunderstood the comments, but can you just walk through that a little bit more just to make sure we're all clear on what you're saying?","Michael T. Speetzen","Yes, so let me maybe back up a step. So when you look at the sequential growth we'll have from the first and second quarter, you do the math, it's over $100 million of top line. And essentially, we're getting in the mid-30s from a drop rate, which -- it's supported by normal volume leverage. I think you can see how sensitive the business is to that from the first quarter results. Plus you've got the incremental restructuring kicking in from the actions that were initiated in the first quarter. As you get into the back half, you have stable revenue between the third and fourth quarter, and then you get a pretty sizable pickup in the fourth quarter. It does have high drop rates when you do the top level math. One, we would expect to see that in terms of the different markets that we're seeing, but you've also got the benefits from the restructuring actions that are going to hit heavy in the second half of the year. And so when you play all that math through, I think you can get yourself pretty close to the incrementals. The base business is dropping anywhere from 35% to 40%, given the volume lift that we're getting. And then you tack on restructuring on top of that, and that will get you there.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","So on the project work that you have line of sight on, I typically would think of those as kind of lower-margin type of projects. Is that not necessarily the case? And it sounds like maybe not, if you think the drop-through was so high.","Michael T. Speetzen","No,  there's definitely some impact there. We talked when we issued our guidance the first round that, for us this year, we essentially said mix is somewhat neutral. You've got a little bit of headwind coming from some of the projects, but you've also got a pickup coming from the mix for dewatering and some of the activities we have going on from a price-to-cost ratio.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Okay. And then just lastly, on kind of the frac-ing comments that you were making, you expect that to start to improve. I mean, a lot of the equipment guys in the market are discussing, while there may be some incremental improvement given some of the higher gas prices, there is a ton of equipment that's just sitting idle that needs to be absorbed before equipment actually -- or equipment orders actually start to improve. Do you not see similar dynamics? Do you not need to see, I guess, a period of absorption before you would see the benefits of, I guess, just market trends improving on that?","Michael T. Speetzen","Well, there's certainly some of that at play. But you have to also remember, most of that business is service-related. So they may have equipment sitting there, but they need personnel there to run it. So when you think about the activities that we have from a frac pad perspective, there's certainly equipment rental, but there's also the folks that are there monitoring and ensuring that the water flow is consistent and reliable.","Gretchen W. McClain","Right. So it's rental. I mean, a lot of times they're renting this equipment, the more they're using them -- their mine as compared to just necessarily expanding out to another drill site.","Operator","That does conclude the Q&A portion of today's call. I will now turn the floor to Gretchen McClain for closing remarks.","Gretchen W. McClain","Yes, let me just close with a thank you. Thank you for your time and your support for the business. We're looking forward to our next call and showing you where we are, but we've got great activities going on in terms of advancing the business around growth. Our new product launches, our services, our acquisition strategy are taking traction in the marketplace, and we feel confident in the direction that we're going.

Good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss our third quarter results.","As you will have seen from our release this morning, we delivered a solid quarter of earnings performance and continued margin expansion. Year-over-year earnings-per-share growth, excluding FX impact, was in line with our expectation and represented an attractive year-on-year increase.","Margin expansion was quite strong at the top-end of our guidance \u2013 reflecting discipline cost management, productivity gains and pricing, and free cash flow conversion was particularly strong in the quarter. However, in our end markets, we saw softer conditions than anticipated, and that's clearly reflected in the quarter's revenue performance \u2013 which came in below expectations.","Utilities demand remains solid globally, and we saw good performance across the portfolio which delivered organic revenue growth in the mid-single-digits, as expected. However, we also saw a quicker-than-expected softening in our industrial and commercial demand, reflecting some uncertainties in these markets. In particular, there was a deceleration in the short-cycle part of our U.S. business. That slowed-down was both more sudden and deeper than expected pulling overall revenue growth below our expectations for the quarter.","We expect this softness will persist through Q4 as a tight labor market continues to push back project timings and uncertainty around some industrial markets impact CapEx spend. Therefore, weaker near-term market outlooks have caused us to lower our full year guidance.","Despite that moderation in industrial and commercial demand, we have nevertheless continued to make progress on both productivity and price. And that operational discipline enabled us to deliver on earnings and bring in margins at the higher end of our guidance.","Exiting Q3, we had strong bidding pipelines and shippable backlogs beyond 2019. So, we continued to see solid growth and margin expansion potential through 2020 and into the long-term.","Looking at our regional mix, we saw strong North American utilities performance and robust emerging market growth. In the U.S., the short-cycle softness I just mentioned held back our growth here overall, but growth in utilities was steady at 5%.","Our investments in emerging markets continue to bear fruit. India, one of our fastest growing markets, delivered 28% organic revenue growth year-to-date. China also turned in a performance of double-digits orders growth in the quarter, giving a year-to-date orders and revenue growth in the double-digits. And Europe grew slightly better than expectations in the quarter in the low-single-digits.","Mark will take us into the segment detail shortly, but I want to take a moment to provide an update on our AIA business, where we took a non-cash impairment charge in the quarter. AIA's recent commercial momentum has been quite robust. Orders grew more than 80% in the quarter, and organic revenue grew by double-digits. The size and incremental margin profile of this business continues to be extremely attractive and accretive to Xylem. All of which is a say that our growth thesis to the business has not changed.","That said, the revenue ramp we are now seeing has taken longer to accelerate than we originally anticipated. As we continue to invest in the business, orders to sales conversion has been slower than expected, moving cash returns at the right \u2013 something we discussed in detail last quarter.","That extended timing of cash returns required an impairment charge against goodwill, in accordance with the accounting guidelines. However, while the early phase of revenue growth lagged expectations, the orders, sales and backlog growth we are now seeing is strong evidence of a utilities market embracing digital transformation at an increasing pace.","We are now beginning to see customers adapt several disruptive technologies at once, in order to get the full benefit of transformation, which creates pull-through across our entire portfolio. In India for example, we are deploying AIA's applications together with pumping solutions, sensor and measurement technologies, and other Xylem services, working across the portfolio to deliver our largest digital transformation project in India to-date.","Increasingly, we are also seeing the benefit of integrating our AIA expertise with our commercial teams to take these solutions into customers. In Kansas, for example, AIA collaborated with our dewatering sales team to win a large robotic condition assessment project, which will provide data driven insights to reduce our customers' capital investment requirements. These are just two of many examples of the kinds of deals we're seeing as the market embraces digital transformation.","Now with that, I'll turn over to Mark who will review our results by segment on slide 6.","Mark Rajkowski","Thanks, Patrick.","Water Infrastructure organic revenue grew 1% in the quarter, and was below our expectations due to a sudden and sharp decline in our short-cycle dewatering business. The decline in this business impacted segment growth by more than 200 basis points in the quarter.","Organic orders grew 12%, and our total segment backlog continued to grow. It was also up 12% year-over-year. The strength in orders and backlog was driven by project winds in our utilities business. Q4 shippable backlogs are up 3% year-over-year despite the order declines in our industrial markets.","Geographically, the U.S. Water Infrastructure business was up 1%. This was below expectations, with solid utilities growth being largely offset by the unexpected mid-single-digit declines we saw in our dewatering business.","The Dewatering business was most significantly impacted by a double-digit decline in equipment sales to our distributors, who largely serve the oil and gas, mining and construction markets. These declines were partially offset by mid-single-digit growth in our rental services business.","Based on feedback we're getting from our distributors and direct customers, we expect the softness in equipment sales into these industrial verticals to continue into the fourth quarter. In this month, we've seen some slowing in our higher-margin rental business serving these industrial verticals, as well. These recent trends are having a significant impact on the segment\u2019s outlook for fourth quarter revenue growth in margins.","Our Water Infrastructure business in U.S. utilities continues to perform well, growing 4% in the quarter. However, we are seeing some delays in projects due to labor shortages and inflation in some markets. While emerging markets growth in Water Infrastructure was flat in Q3, it was lapping 23% organic revenue growth in last year's third quarter. The segment\u2019s emerging markets business continues to perform very well overall, and grew orders by double-digits.","Western Europe was up 2% overall and slightly better than our expectations. We continue to experience mixed performance across Europe with utilities fairly stable, but with some softness in industrial markets. Segment operating margins grew 40 basis points to 19.6%, driven by our team's continued good work on price realization in productivity. This more than offset the impact of inflation, lower volumes and a weaker mix of higher margin dewatering revenues.","Please turn to Slide 7. The Applied Water Systems segment delivered 1% organic revenue and orders growth in the quarter. This was below our expectations due to softer demand leading to volume declines in both the industrial and commercial building services markets. Higher price realization more than offset lower volumes in these markets. This also reduced the segment\u2019s total backlog which declined 3% percent year-over-year.","Growth in the segment was led by continuing strength in emerging markets, with double-digit growth in China, India and Eastern Europe. This was largely driven by strong growth in the commercial building services market. The U.S. was flat with softening demand in the short-cycle portions of the segment\u2019s industrial end-markets. Also, commercial building services revenues declined mid-single-digits against a tough comparison of 12% growth in 2018.","And while we continue to see good pace in quoting activity in our commercial business, we experienced a number of project delays in the quarter largely due to construction labor shortages in several markets \u2013 which we see as a sign of improving demand over the medium term.","Residential had a good quarter, with 4% growth overall, led by 8% growth in the U.S. Western European revenues declined 6% in the quarter as demand further softened in the commercial and residential markets.","Our teams did a nice job of managing through tougher-than-anticipated market conditions, and were able to expand margins 90 basis points in the quarter to 17%. Execution and productivity programs and continued price realization more than offset inflation and a weaker revenue mix due to lower U.S. commercial and industrial volumes.","Now please turn to slide 8. The Measurement and Control Solutions segment delivered 8% organic revenue growth in the quarter. Organic orders growth declined 11%, but that's against a tough comparison to last year's third quarter when we had 31% organic orders growth driven by a few large project wins.","Total M&CS segment backlog grew 10% giving us continued confidence in the segments outlook from next year and beyond. The M&CS water business continue to be the primary growth driver for the segment up 15% in the quarter, energy grew 3% and the test business grew low-single-digits.","Sensus in particular had a strong quarter growing organic revenue 10% led by double-digit growth in its water business. Sensus delivered 5% growth in the U.S., led by 9% growth in water, partially moderated by lower growth in energy applications as we lap the large Alliant electric meter deployment.","Our teams have done excellent work expanding our metrology business internationally, where the water business grew roughly 30% in the quarter. We are clearly seeing the benefits of leveraging the global Xylem network, and this will be an increasing source of revenue growth in the fourth quarter and beyond.","We're also pleased with the strong commercial momentum we saw during the quarter across our AIA platform. In addition to double-digit revenue growth, we had a meaningful acceleration in the conversion of pipeline opportunities, resulting in year-over-year orders growth of more than 80%, while also replenishing the pipeline, which continued to grow strong double-digits in the quarter.","For the segment overall, operating margins expanded 50 basis points to 10%, which is in line with our expectations. Volume and price gains plus 340 basis points in productivity more than offset moderating inflation and growth investments.","Please turn to Slide 9. Our cash balance grew to over $450 million in Q3. During the quarter, we returned $44 million to our shareholders through dividends. We invested $46 million in CapEx, reflecting the expected moderating spend in the second half of the year, and tracking to our full year CapEx forecast of $235 million to $240 million.","Our working capital in the third quarter increased 80 basis points year-over-year to 20.6%, reflecting both the impact of last year's fourth quarter inventory build, which we will burn off in this year's fourth quarter as well as timing of receivables collections. Free cash flow increased almost 60% year-over-year and free cash flow conversion in the quarter was 162% improving substantially over the prior year and quarter sequentially. This was primarily driven by an improvement in working capital levels due to better inventory management, lower CapEx spend and lower contributions to our pension plans. We remain fully committed to meeting our target of 105% free cash flow conversion for the full year.","Please turn to Slide 10 and Patrick will cover our 2019 and market outlook.","Patrick Decker","Thanks, Mark.","So, based on some of the market dynamics we discussed earlier, we've updated our full-year end-market guidance. In the Utilities market, we're tightening our outlook to mid-single-digit growth. Our backlogs are healthy, indicating steady underlying demand growth, but that is offset somewhat by project timing effects.","In Industrial, we now expect flattish growth versus last year, down slightly from our previous low-single-digit expectations. We foresee the acceleration we experienced in the third quarter persisting into the fourth.","We're also still seeing mixed economic conditions across geographies, including areas of Western Europe and parts of Emerging Markets. Our outlook for the Commercial market is low- to mid-single-digit growth. The U.S. Commercial market in particular is likely to continue showing moderation to the fourth quarter due to project delays caused by a tight labor market. Our Residential outlook remains at flat to low-single-digit growth.","Please turn to Slide 11 and we'll provide guidance for the remainder of 2019. Despite steady top-line growth in utility sector, we are lowering our overall organic revenue guidance to between 3% and 4% for the full year. And we're adjusting our operating margin expectations downward. Two factors are driving this change in outlook.","First, the impact of lower-than-expected volumes in our high-margin short cycle businesses, particularly in industrial and commercial. And second, the impact of project timing and our high margin AIA digital solutions business. For these reasons, we are adjusting our operating margin expectations to a range of between 13.8% and 14%. This represents an operating margin expansion of 10 to 30 basis points and EBITDA margin expansion of 10 to 20 basis points for the year.","Moving on to earnings-per-share, we're adjusting our outlook to a range of $3.01 to $3.03 representing year-over-year growth of between 7% and 8% excluding FX translation.","Let me now turn it back over to Mark to walk through some of the detail on that guidance.","Mark Rajkowski","Thanks, Patrick.","Slide 12, typically includes a seasonal profile of revenues and earnings by quarter. However, given the expected slowdown in our Q4 revenue growth outlook, we've seen a meaningful change this year in the historical profile of our quarterly revenue and earnings. So, I'll take a moment to walk through the changes in our revenue expectation from our last earnings call to our current outlook and the impact on our fourth quarter implied margins in EPS.","At the end of last quarter, we expected approximately 5% organic revenue growth roughly 180 basis points margin expansion and earnings-per-share of approximately $1.02. Given significant changes in the market dynamic we saw in Q3 and continuing into Q4, we've moderated our expectations for revenue growth. And therefore, margin expansion in EPS as well.","There are two factors impacting our new guidance. First, the softer-than-expected demand in our short-cycle businesses in the U.S. has significantly impacted our volume growth. And while we're entering the fourth quarter with healthy shippable backlog, based on current order trends, we expect to book and ship revenues for our short cycle businesses in the U.S. to decline in the quarter.","Overall, we expect this will have a 300 basis point impact on organic revenue growth and a 90 basis point impact on margin, applying our typical fourth quarter incremental margin rate of 35%. Second, we're being impacted by weaker margin mix as we expect to have lower revenues from our highest margin businesses, which deliver well above our average Xylem incremental margins, particularly our dewatering rental and AIA businesses.","This mix effect further impacts margins by about 60 basis points. Together, these changes have lowered our margin expectations to a range of 15.3% to 15.5% representing a 20 to 40 basis point expansion versus the prior year. While there is modest negative impact expected from foreign exchange headwind, this is largely offset by lower interest expense bringing our updated earnings per share expectations to a range of $0.88 to $0.90 for the fourth quarter. These changes in our full year revenue outlook for the company are also broken down by segment as shown on the slide.","Just a couple of other items to note, we're maintaining our full year estimated effective tax rate at 19%. And we are adjusting our full-year Euro rate slightly downward to $1.11. Our FX sensitivity table is located in the appendix.","Finally, we're increasing the full-year estimate for restructuring and realignment cost to a range of $75 million to $85 million. This reflects the cost of additional actions we took during the third quarter to optimize the Sensus European manufacturing and commercial operations to better support our customers and improve profitability.","Savings from these actions will begin to materialize in 2020, with a long-term run rate benefit of $13 million.","Now please turn to Slide 13, and I will turn the call back over to Patrick for closing comments.","Patrick Decker","So, to wrap-up, clearly the sudden and pronounced slowing in our industrial and commercial end-markets has presented some near-term challenges putting pressure on margins in our short-cycle businesses. And based on our current assessment, we expect some of that market uncertainty to continue through the balance of this year.","But, our teams have responded to those challenges with disciplined operational execution, enabling us to deliver both earnings and margin expansion. Their actions in the face of evolving market conditions enabled us to meet some of our most important commitments.","We have the advantage of an extremely strong portfolio of market-leading products. And we built on that foundation with genuinely disruptive digital technologies \u2013 giving us momentum as the sector embraces digital transformation. That strong market position is particularly reflected in our utilities growth, which continues at a steady pace across both Water Infrastructure and Measurement and Control Solutions. Notably, our Sensus business is delivering very healthy growth and our AIA portfolio is ramping quickly, creating a leadership position for Xylem as digital adoption accelerates across both the clean water and wastewater sides of our utility customers. And our investments in emerging markets are also delivering impressive growth in both orders and revenues, all of which gets competence in the medium and longer term growth profile of our business despite near term headwind.","We have a resilient business that will continue to expand margins at attractive rate and will deliver strong cash generation alongside sustainable mid-single-digit growth over the long-term. We look forward to you joining us at our 2020 Investor Day to hear more about our strategy, our long-term targets and growth profile. And I'm pleased to announce the date of our Investor Day will be in the spring on March 31, when we\u2019ll gather in Atlanta, Georgia at our Data Analytics Center of Excellence. And I look forward to hosting as many of you there as possible then.","With that operator, we're now happy to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question is coming from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.","Deane Dray","Thank you. Good morning everyone. ","Hey. Maybe we start with the making sure we've calibrated which businesses are feeling most of the slowdown, and then -- frankly, we're just seeing this everywhere across the industrials \u2013 with industrial, commercial short-cycle weakness including oil and gas. So, Godwin, by our calculations, that's about 8% of total revenues and last calibrated their total Xylem oil and gas was about 5%. So, what else within Godwin \u2013 maybe it's the construction markets are soft there. So just \u2013 are those the right numbers, and then what kinds of end markets and activities are you seeing reduced in terms of demand here?","Patrick Decker","Yeah. So, Godwin would be a little bit more \u2013 a little bit higher percentage, maybe 10%. And, to your point, Deane, oil and gas is \u2013 it's not a big piece of it, maybe 4%, 5%. But what we saw in the quarter was a big slowdown in sales into our distributors, and they are heavily oriented towards oil and gas, but also mining, construction. So, that was really where we felt it the most. Rental was still pretty solid, up mid-single-digits.","But as we work through the first part here of October, we have seen downward trends in our rental business as well. And it's \u2013 a lot of it is \u2013 we believe just a function of what is some slowing CapEx spend in the broader industrial space.","Deane Dray","On the distributors -- and this is again common with other industrial levered companies -- are your distributors destocking as near as you can tell? Do you have a sense of the sell-in versus sell-through?","Mark Rajkowski","Yeah. Our sense, Deane, in speaking with the distributors is it's less of a destocking, and it's really more of just holding back on further investment. Just given the uncertainty and the CapEx budget they're selling into.","They're still somewhat confident around bidding activity and things that are out there, but it's such a short-cycle business for them that there has been\u2026 They're being conservative right now. It's hard to tell how long that lasts through the quarter. Right now, we're saying we assume it last that Q4. We'll know more about how far it goes into 2020 I'd say over the next couple months.","Patrick Decker","Early results in October are fairly consistent with what we saw in the third quarter as well on the distributor side.","Deane Dray","Got it. That's really helpful. And then on the AIA, does new orders at more than 80%, that's impressive. And it just seems so, yeah, the timing of this seems a little inconsistent that you're also taking an impairment -- and I know the impairment is more backward looking-- but the idea here, is that on the impairment\u2026 is that related to the pure technologies? And just give us a sense is it \u2013 was it the timing, cash was the factor but some more color there would be helpful.","Patrick Decker","Yes. So Dean, this is Patrick. So, it is largely Pure, and it is largely a function of us having had more aggressive assumptions around how quickly: one, we would get some of the synergy benefits of that integration. It is also some of the other digital solutions that we brought onboard because the goodwill had to be looked at across the entire platform. And the reality is even though we are seeing good momentum here, it was short of what our original assumptions were. Even though we're now gaining the momentum that we had originally expected, the timing was delayed of what was originally assumed in the deal financials.","And so, following accounting guidelines, we were required to take an impairment in the quarter, but I think it's important for people to read through and pick up on the comment you're making, and that is what we're seeing in terms of the bidding activity at this point in time. We talked about 60% increase in the bidding pipeline last quarter. We saw continued growth in the pipeline this past quarter. And then it really is punctuated with the nearly 85% orders growth in the quarter and double-digit revenue growth. So, look, we\u2026 disappointing, it took longer to get ramped up than we expected, but we feel we're in a much stronger position now than we were even a quarter ago.","Deane Dray","Great. Just last question for me, just if we could get some more context or color within that 85% order growth. I just want to make sure those are just like pilot programs, but is there some real substance around them? And then related, there was news that you all had a successful non-revenue water project in China \u2013 in Shanghai. We learned about that at the WEFTEC Program Trade Show, and can you give us some color around that as well? Thanks.","Patrick Decker","Yeah. Sure, Deane. So, yeah, the orders in Q3 of north of 80% are not just a whole bunch of pilots. I mean this is substantive business that we're getting. We still do pilots. Many times, utilities in order to get through their procurement processes which is three bids and a buy, and oftentimes there aren't two other bids to be had. Given the newness of the technology, they need to go through a pilot to be able to demonstrate proprietary nature of what we're doing.","And so, the reality is we do see some of that pilot activity, but the large majority of the orders that we had here were actually in the Pure piece of AIA. The second part of your question -- which was the non-revenue water win in China. We're now seeing a number of these tenders coming out where the utilities are -- especially the more thought-leading utilities -- are not looking at this as: Well, let's do a leak detection project, or Let's do a metering project. They're looking at and saying: We don't necessarily know which of these levers are going to improve our non-revenue water issue the most.","And so, the reality is, they're going out now and saying: Let's do a tender to bring someone in to look at our pipeline overall and determine where are the losses coming from. And, therefore, how do we optimize that deployment.","So, this was\u2026 the one specifically in China was driven, predominantly, by our Visenti leak detection capabilities, but it pulls through other parts of the business. And it was a non-revenue water project that we're doing across several districts in Shanghai.","And so, we're very encouraged by that because the more we get these, Deane -- as you can appreciate -- the more reference wins we have for other utilities around the world, and that's what we're seeing happening right now. It just takes momentum.","Deane Dray","Thank you.","Patrick Decker","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Scott Davis with Melius Research.","Scott Davis","Good morning guys. I imagine you guys and Deane would be a lot of fun at a cocktail party talking about\u2026 ","Mark Rajkowski","\u2026we would.","Scott Davis","Yeah. I love you both. But yes, it's fun. Anyways, I had to pick on him. I love Deane. ","Anyways, I want to take a step backwards because I'm not really in the nitty-gritty here, but the\u2026 how much visibility do you guys have when you look out to like 2020 on the China infrastructure spend? I mean given the five-year planning cycles -- did they give you pretty good visibility on that kind of stuff, or you walking into each quarter just kind of waiting for the phone to ring. How does that work?","Patrick Decker","Yes. It's a great question, Scott. I think let me start from the top and say roughly two-thirds\u2026 a little more than two-thirds of our business in China is in the utility sector, and the remainder is in commercial buildings and industrial for the most part. I would say on the commercial and industrial piece: that is a short cycle business, not very much different from what we see in the rest of world.","But for that little north of two-thirds of our business in China, it is very much long visibility... It's long lead time\u2026 It's heavy CapEx. It's very heavily oriented towards treatment. And so we have good visibility into that bidding pipeline and our conversion and win rate so\u2026 and that very much is tied to the fact that this is a central government led kind of mandate around clean water and environmental pickup and it is part of a kind of rolling five-year plan.","So, that part, I would say, of our business, we've got some of the greatest visibility going into 2020. And of course, we're also now seeing the increased appetite to implement some of these digital solutions that we're talking about around non-revenue water, etcetera, which gives us greater confidence.","Scott Davis","Okay. That's really helpful. And I'm fascinated by this whole labor shortage thing and it just seems so strange\u2026 the Fed\u2019s cutting rates and everybody is starting to worry about the macro in such an extreme, but is it skilled labor or non-skilled labor? Is there some sort of dynamic that's changed meaningfully in the last years as it relates to people that can actually execute on these projects?","Patrick Decker","Yeah. We're seeing it largely as non-skilled labor, particularly in the construction areas and kind of short project businesses, where a lot of this, also, is where they oftentimes rely on temporary labor. And the temporary labor market has really tightened up at this point in time.","And I know even yesterday, I think the Fed chair talked about tightening labor markets despite the discussion around softening or lessening interest rates. So, we saw that on the commercial side of the business. We think it's transitory because we still see strong quoting activity. And this is feedback we're getting from our channel partners where we rely heavily on our indirect channel for this market in the U.S.","It is a US-specific issue that we're seeing. And what we're also seeing is show up, Scott, to a lesser extent, but we talk about project delays and utilities even though we've got strong growth there. We are seeing some projects being delayed through our engineering consulting firms whereby their initial budgetary quotes are coming in well above what the utilities have been expecting.","So, they're pushing back on them to go back and reengineer the quote. The projects will still go through. We still see them as bidding pipeline, but we're also seeing that little bit of an air pocket as people go back and have to kind of redo their budget assumptions on some of these projects due to higher labor cost.","Scott Davis","That's amazing. Okay. Thanks for color guys. Good luck to you.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones with Stifel.","Nathan Jones","Good morning, everyone. I'd like to follow up on the goodwill write-down first in Pure. I think you've explained pretty thoroughly that things haven't ramped up here as fast as you'd anticipated. You've had Pure for about a year-and-a-half now. Maybe you could comment on the changes in your view of where you end up in the long term rather than whatever happened here in the short term. After a year-and-a-half of having that and putting together this AIA platform, have your expectations for the long-term revenue potential out of this platform increased, decreased, stayed the same?","Patrick Decker","Yeah. I would say, Nate, a very good question and appropriate one obviously. Our view over the long term -- and I would even say now over the near and medium term, as we stand here today -- things remain unchanged from our original assumption. It just took us longer to get the ramp going than what was originally assumed. And so, if I look at what parts or what aspects of AIA broadly -- because we really are looking now at its AIA broadly rather than just Pure, and quite frankly, we're now looking at it in terms of the broader impact and pull-through potential for Xylem in terms of really deploying these digital solutions and new technologies, hence, the reference to the win in China, the win in India, the win in Kansas, these are pull-through opportunities for also the rest of the company. I would say we feel as good if not better about that potential and opportunity than we did at the time that we built this platform.","I would say\u2026 what have we learned? I think what we've learned -- and what I certainly personally learned -- is that the conversion cycle for the utilities has simply been longer than we had originally anticipated. In some cases, the sale cycle has been up to a year on the digital solutions because of the need to run pilots, the procurement process that I talked about earlier. And just the fact that this is\u2026 we're bringing disruptive solutions to a sector, and what I've certainly learned, as well, is that this is not going to be a straight line. Disruption is never a straight line. So, it's taken longer than we had originally anticipated. But we feel very good about where we are now, and I'm very proud of what the team's doing.","Nathan Jones","Water utilities are well known for their pace of adoption of new technologies. Maybe just talking a little bit more about this China project. You said it was largely Visenti that won that project. Visenti has been a pretty small business, and you talked there about the ability to pull through technologies from the other parts of the business. So, maybe you could talk about whether it's just this specific project or a more general\u2026 kind of what are the content non-revenue water project won by Visenti can pull through for the rest of Xylem?","Patrick Decker","Sure, yeah, it's a great question. And China is just one example, we've got a number of these examples around the world. And what we're really talking about here is\u2026 Visenti just happened to be one of our number of digital solutions whereby, in this case, it happens to be a specific type of leak detection capability.","They were able to go in and -- in this but other examples as well\u2026 India, Australia, we've got an example here in the US -- where they were able to go in and start off. They were the ones that opened the door\u2026 where the customer looks at this as my non-revenue water issue is: I\u2019ve got to solve leaks.","But as the team goes in and assesses the situation, they see a bigger opportunity than just doing a leak detection opportunity. It can flow into the fact that there may be a metering need\u2026 a metering opportunity. There may be a metering replacement opportunity that we pull through one of our other capabilities. It could be\u2026 it can be of a range of things that happen.","It's no different than whenever, our EmNet team goes in and our team applies that EmNet technology around storm water overflow or combined sewer overflows. There's the project around doing\u2026 getting the data and doing the analysis. And that might be an ongoing SaaS contract. But there are just as many opportunities to then go in and say: Hey, there's a problem in the treatment plan.There's a problem in the wastewater pumping network. ","That can then pull through our Flygt submersible wastewater pumps into that. So, there are a number of examples where one of our digital solutions are applied. They get the signature win, but they pull through the rest of the business. And then other revenues not showing up in AIA. It's showing up in our other\u2026 at our other segments.","Nathan Jones","Yeah. One quick one on industrial. We talked a lot about the drop in industrial demand here related a lot to de- watering, related to heavy industry oil and gas that kind of stuff. The light industrial business is supposed to be a lot more stable and a lot less subject to these kinds of rapid fluctuations. Can you talk about light industrial during 3Q and your outlook for light industrial in 4Q?","Mark Rajkowski","Yeah. Nate, we\u2026 you're right with that observation. Nevertheless, we did see decelerating order growth in our lighter industrial applications. A lot of that being in our Applied Water segment. So just like we're seeing in general CapEx spend, OEMs are just a little bit more cautious in some of their spend, and we're\u2026 our order trends are down and we expect it to be flattish, maybe down low-single digit, going into the fourth quarter. It's\u2026 and I think some of it is just general\u2026 just general concerns and then managing their operating budgets.","Patrick Decker","Yeah. I mean I think Nate the\u2026 our comments in the past, I wouldn't want them to be interpreted as a \u201cevery single quarter\u201d. I think our view is over the course of any given year. That whole sector of light industrial typically is in that low single digit. That's what we're seeing. Certainly when the year said and done as we look ahead to next year, we still expect that to be generally in line with GDP growth.","But there can't be a quarter here or there where you get some skittishness on the part of our distributors to hold back a little bit. We also\u2026 in the quarter and even to the second half we had a pretty tough comp versus last year. I mean we were up I think close to 9% last year in the quarter so that we didn't kind of call that out and our comments but that's an important point to make here.","Nathan Jones","Okay. Thanks very much for taking my questions. I'll pass it on.","Operator","The next question comes from line of John Walsh with Credit Suisse.","John Walsh","Hi. Good morning. Just wanted to kind of go back to thinking about calibrating the forward look here and obviously, you remain very confident in your mid-single-digit organic growth going forward. This sounds cyclical on some of these pressures that you're feeling. So, there'll be transitory and I think, as Deane alluded to, most companies are feeling this, but consensus does have 5%. I know it's early to kind of be putting point estimates down for next year, but how would you think given this kind of short cycle pressure feeling in the backlog, what kind of visibility do you have to actually put a potential range out there for next year?","Mark Rajkowski","Sure, John. So, yeah, I'm into your point. Obviously, it's early for us to really be giving any specific guide -- and we will give a full guide with our Q4 earnings report early next year. I would say we look at it really in a few different dimensions. First of all, and I think to your point most importantly here, we feel good about the steady growth in utilities, most notably within our MC&S segment as well as that part of the Water Infrastructure business where shippable backlog in 2020 is up high-single-digits in both of those segments. We think China and India still have a lot of runway based upon building activity of backlog we see there, and we are seeing our AMI metering project deployments ramping up in 2020.","And then, lastly, the conversion of the AIA funnel we expect to be ramping up in 2020 and beyond as well.","Having said all that to your point, we do have a somewhat of a cyclical downturn here right now in our commercial and industrial businesses, and we're not going to try to prognosticate here in terms of what\u2026 how long that's going to roll. We'll have a better feel for that, I'm sure, as we get through the end of Q4. But that uncertainly in my view probably will linger through certainly the first half of the year and the fact that we had some tough comps that we're going to be lapping.","I mean again first half of this year, Industrial was up 3%. Not a lot to write home about, but\u2026 about where it normally is, but Commercial was up 9% in the first half. So, we're going to have a little bit of tough comp in the first half. The last thing I would say is\u2026 but we continue to be confident in our margin expansion, and we still have meaningful productivity opportunities out there.","We've talked before about the mix of MC&S coming to our favor now given the heavy water project rollout there, and also the continued strong performance in Water Infrastructure from a margin standpoint.","Matt Latino","Can we have the next question please?","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Lee","Hey guys. Good morning. Maybe to jump off of that topic, Patrick, since you bring up the productivity, 400 basis points, or so, I think it was the best you've seen year-to-date. And then on the flipside, volume mix was maybe a bit worse than you've been tracking at. So, two questions here. Can you maybe talk to the puts and takes here you know this is the near-term trend we should be expecting going forward for these margin drivers. And then second question, just given the additional reset in operating margins here for fiscal 2019. I'm wondering if the 100 basis point expansion view that you outlined earlier in the year for 2020. Is that still intact or should we be anticipating an update to that as well? Thanks, guys.","Patrick Decker","Let me let me take the first part of that question relative to some of what we saw on third quarter. I mentioned in my prepared remarks the teams really did a nice job continuing to drive productivity. We continue to find places to take out our costs in our manufacturing supply chain operations. And as you'll recall, we did take some restructuring actions as well in the first part of this year that's really starting to ramp up in Q3.","We expect that to continue into Q4 as well. And we've seen, as we expected, some moderating inflation in the third quarter as well, certainly in our M&CS segment as expected as we lap some of those component shortages and some of the higher costs. We have to deal with some of the moves that we've made on addressed tariffs and also we saw a lower inflation in Applied Water for the third quarter as well, and we expect that to continue into the fourth quarter also.","Mark Rajkowski","And on your question around kind of looking at 2020 and the 100 basis points of margin expansion, I would say, Brian, of our view on that, as we sit here today, is that the productivity, the pricing piece, all the levers that we have in our control remain intact.","And I think the big question in terms of what any kind of delta might be versus that is it all going to come down to what we believe our volume growth profile is going to be in 2020 relative to what we said before in terms of a mid- single digit. I'm not signaling anything there. I'm simply saying that will be the one factor that will make sure we get comfortable with it as we give a guide for 2020.","Brian Lee","Okay, great. I appreciate the color. Thanks guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Saree Boroditsky with Jefferies.","Saree Boroditsky","Good morning. So, you remained pretty positive on the outlook for 2020 for MCS. And I guess, could you just comment on the visibility that you have into the project timing, and is there any risk that some of these projects get pushed out?","Patrick Decker","Sure. So, we've got\u2026 we've got pretty good visibility into the MCS segment based on our shippable backlog in 2020 and beyond. The shippable backlog in 2020 and beyond is quite healthy. I think we're looking at like 7% growth versus last year which is that was coming out of the quarter. We've got\u2026 there is a portion of that business that is day-to-day replacement meters.","And so, I wouldn't want anybody to think that everything is locked in the bag base. It's not all large projects, but there is a meaningful piece of that business that definitely is. It's probably about half of the revenue for the segment is sitting in backlog right now, and that's pretty solid for any one of our businesses going in.","I think secondly, what we're seeing there is just again good, healthy conversion to AMI, and those projects have very good returns on them economically, not just for us but for the utilities. That's why they make the investment. I'd say there's always a risk that depending up on what the broader economy was to do. If we were to go into a recessionary environment, then, of course, there's always some risk there that project can move to the right. But that's not historically been the case based upon the diligence that we've done.","Lastly, although again it's only\u2026 it's right now only $120 million of business. Again, we were seeing good ramp up now in AIA which is very helpful in terms of helping spike that growth rate for the segment. And then the\u2026 lastly, what I would say is: we've integrated the AIA business and the Sensus business now into our commercial teams in Europe and emerging markets. And that's given the team already a bump up in increase in bidding pipeline and visibility into the market in terms of opportunities. And so, I do expect there to be opportunity there as well.","Saree Boroditsky","That's helpful. And considering your growth in Western Europe picked up slightly from last quarter just a little different from some of the macro trends. So, could you provide some color like on what you're seeing in that market?","Mark Rajkowski","Yeah, it did actually. It was actually a little bit better than we had seen in the first part of the year. A lot of that was driven by utilities and it was\u2026 we saw a relative strength low-single-digits plus in some parts of Europe. But it was it was fairly broad based and where we\u2026 where it wasn't as strong was on the industrial side but that was in the quarter probably one of the good surprises we had. And we expect\u2026 we are expecting that to continue into Q4.","Saree Boroditsky","I appreciate the color. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James.","Pavel Molchanov","Thanks for taking the questions. Given the industrial headwinds that we've been talking about for the past hour, I'm curious if the smaller more focused private players in your value chain are presumably feeling this to a greater extent. And if so, does this perhaps create an opportunity for you guys to kind of reaccelerate the M&A trend from several years ago?","Patrick Decker","That's a good question. I mean I think you know we remain disciplined on our approach to M&A. We do have a healthy pipeline right now of targets that we look at all different shapes and sizes. We haven't seen a meaningful move as of yet in terms of valuation expectations. But I do believe that could certainly change depending upon how prolonged the industrial commercial thing could be.","But we'll play that by ear, we'll remain disciplined and our priorities remain unchanged. We've talked about before we think we have a really good platform in utilities at this point in time. So anything we do there would be more likely to continue tuck-ins and bolt-ons of digital solutions. And then the second \u2013 not even our second \u2013 our other biggest priority is building out a more robust industrial franchise. And so, we continue to look those opportunities, and, hopefully, some things will come along here, but we're going to be disciplined.","Pavel Molchanov","And then a follow-up on the balance sheet, your net-debt-to-cap went below 40% this quarter, the lowest level since before the Sensus acquisition. Are you pretty happy with where the leverage is at the moment?","Mark Rajkowski","Yeah, we are. I mean we had, post the Pure acquisition, gotten a little bit ahead of our target, but we knew we'd be able to bring that down relatively quickly. We have. And it was just this quarter, really, where we've seen really strong cash flow that we were pleased with. So, we're now moving it into our targeted range which is 2.5 to 3 times Moody's.","Pavel Molchanov","Got. Okay. Understood. Appreciate it guys.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano with Cowen.","Joe Giordano","Hey guys. So, look, it's hard to give guidance. I think we all appreciate that. So, we've seen a couple cuts in a row. If you're looking at it just optically, it could look like it's a bit reactionary rather than anticipatory. So, I was wondering if you can kind of reconcile that with how you're actually learning the business internally. Like getting ahead of slowdowns in terms of restructuring actions and looking at cost structures. And have you feel like you've been a little bit faster to react on that part rather than maybe the publicly discussed numbers that are out there?","Patrick Decker","Yes. I think so Joe. It's a good and fair point to make. I mean, we do have \u2013 we do still have a meaningful part of our business, which is roughly somewhere probably between 40%, 45% especially non-utility that is short cycle business. And so, to your point that there are things obviously that we will get, we don't just kind of wing it and take a guess on outlooks and forecasts. The point is things can change quickly within a quarter.","And that's what we saw in this quarter was things really change late in the quarter. And it happened pretty suddenly and through distribution, et cetera.","So, I would say, had we not been anticipatory around that being a possibility then we would not have been able to pull the levers that we did to deliver on our EPS and at high end of our margin guidance in range for the quarter. Obviously, we're looking into Q4, and now even in 2020, there are other actions that we've taken both from a cost out, but also just leaning in even harder on productivity than otherwise anticipated.","Lastly, I would say though we are\u2026 it's important that everyone knows that we have been focused also on preserving investments and the key elements of our portfolio, and will do so both in Q4, as well as going into 2020. That's an area that we do not want to be seen as being purely reactive to the near-term.","Mark Rajkowski","And we've talked about this as a team going into the beginning of this year relative to at some point the cycle will turn, we need to be prepared for that, and we... as every business has, there are opportunities for us to get more streamlined and leaner, and we've been doing that throughout the course of the year.","Patrick Decker","So, I think, Joe, the challenge that we've been facing near the end of this last quarter and through Q4, it's again really just getting as much visibility as possible into: Is this an air pocket commercial and industrial in the US?... for\u2026 and How long does that pocket run before you see some return to normalization?","Because if it were not for this softness that we saw in this particular part of the business -- which does tend to be more cyclical, but it does rebound -- we saw very solid and strong growth in the rest of our portfolio in line with what we've been talking about both in the near-term and longer term.","Joe Giordano","Sure that makes sense. On AIA on the impairment, look, I get the\u2026 I think the portfolio that you're building there is interesting and it's unique and it's almost by definition going to take a long time to kind of figure this out with the market. But does this kind of development kind of change the way you think about how much to pay for smaller bolt-ons or maybe not real small bolt-ons but ones that have, like, some heft to them? Does it\u2026 do you have to like recalibrate what the appropriate multiple in some of those businesses are as you go forward?","Patrick Decker","I think it's\u2026 I think the most important thing, Joe, the way we look at it is I would say first of all I certainly wouldn't want to have any of these businesses in somebody else's hands. They need to be with Xylem. Okay. And as we\u2026 and I think that as we have integrated the ones that we now have over the course of the past number of months here \u2013 because, you know, we've only had the non-pure businesses, we've only had those over the course of the last year -- and so we've been integrating those as we speak.","We've learned a lot during that timeframe. I've learned a lot by being out with a lot of customers and understanding even better kind of how they think now that we have C-suite level conversations because we have the credibility to go in and talk to customers at a broad enterprise level. That will certainly inform and educate as we look at any future bolt-on acquisitions both from evaluation standpoint. You're never going be able to perfectly time an acquisition and perfectly layer the price on what you're paying. It\u2026 you don't want to over pay, of course, and we'll always be discipline in that regard. So, those are our learning but no, we're not\u2026 we're not gun shy about going on and continue to build out this portfolio. Not at all.","Joe Giordano","That's fair. And just last one, I just want to sneak a last one here. As we get into like a slower kind of pocket in some of your cyclical businesses, your infrastructure segment has done a really nice job on margins. It's been a definitely a bright spot. What's the potential there? It's expanded a lot over the last couple of years. You've had good volume to help drive that. If you get into like a slower growth market, how much more potential is in that segment?","Mark Rajkowski","Yeah. Listen, the\u2026 there's always opportunity in it. It doesn't come just from cost cutting and more productivity. That's important and that we do that, and we'll continue to do that months in and months out. I think the other part of it is also continuing to innovate and bringing new leading edge products, solutions, into that form, to Patrick's point earlier.","This whole notion of opening the door with our AIA platform and digital solutions in the pool and bringing new higher end pumps and equipment in aftermarket is\u2026 there's a lot of potential there relative to the margin profile.","Patrick Decker","Yeah. I think the.. I think the\u2026 beyond just normal volume-driven leverage and productivity that we get in any one of our businesses -- and certainly most notably in Water Infrastructure given our strong market position there in terms of leadership. That, by definition, draws through very strong incrementals when you've got growth even if it's slower growth. But I think the really big deal here is on the innovation side. The new product development pipeline, by definition, as we continue to grow that pipeline. I think right now, as a company, we're up to 25% in our vitality index. That's up from 22% in the first quarter. And so, there's a continued ramp there that we're seeing and that pipeline drove through it. In our experience, these products that not only grow faster or technology grow faster than the average but they bring with them higher margins than the average. And so, that's a very meaningful part here of the story across each one of the three segments including Water Infrastructure.","Joe Giordano","Great. Thanks guys.","Operator","The final question will come from the line of Walter Liptak with Seaport Global.","Walter Liptak","Good morning. So, my question is pretty quick and easy. I just wanted to drill into the M&CS business. You mentioned that the visibility is good. You've had nice backlogs, but I wonder if you could delineate that between water, gas and electric because it sounds like the water was strong this quarter and you've got some tough comps in some of the others. I wonder about the visibility for 2020 with that funnel for gas and electric.","Mark Rajkowski","Well, we had some big wins a year-and-a-half-ago that were electric, gas and they're starting to roll off and where we've seen good success recently both domestically and internationally is in our water business. So, most of that is on the water side.","Patrick Decker","Yeah. The good news is also we just launched a brand-new product in the energy side as well. So, we expect that to get momentum in the market. I think we just announced that a few days ago publicly. So, we still feel good about the electric-and-gas side of the market, but certainly we're very encouraged by the momentum we're seeing on the water side which brings with higher margins.","Walter Liptak","Okay. Got it. All right. Thank you very much.","With no further questions, I'll hand the floor back to Patrick Decker for closing remarks.","Patrick Decker","Great. Thank you. ","So, thanks everybody for your time and attention this morning and patience \u2013 as we ran a little bit long here. Thanks for your continued support and interest and we look forward to seeing many of you out in the field. Otherwise, we'll be back in touch for our Q4 earnings call.

Then I'll turn it over to Mark for additional detail on the fourth quarter and we'll round back to offer our 2020 outlook before taking questions.","Focusing first on 2019, in the first half we delivered solid growth, mid-single digits or better across our segments and end markets, but the year presented a dynamic market environment and second half conditions were clearly more challenging. I was pleased with the agility of our teams in adapting to those changing conditions and we were able to deliver full year organic revenue growth of almost 4%.","Solid performances and utilities and in our U.S. and emerging markets offset some of the second half softness in industrial and commercial end markets. Our full year margin expansion was 20 basis points and we closed 2019 with an operating margin of 13.9%. Earnings per share were up 5% year-over-year and up 9% excluding the effects of foreign exchange. ","The fourth quarter unfolded much as we foresaw in our October earnings call and the team's agility and discipline delivered over performance on cash with free cash flow conversion of 124% against the target of 105% driven by significant working capital improvements. That kind of solid operational execution was also essential to delivering our earnings commitment in the quarter. Because we focused on managing the things we can control, while also maintaining our investment for growth. We are well positioned for 2020 and beyond.","We have good visibility of our pipeline of business and we built strong fundamentals over the last few years that give us confidence about continuing to deliver significant value creation from near term and long-term growth, margin expansion, and cash generation. So let's focus on those fundamentals for a moment. We were a very different company today than we were just a few years ago. We laid out our key initiatives to lift the growth profile of the company back at our original Investor Day in 2015.","At the time, the company was delivering low-single-digit growth, emerging markets contributed roughly $750 million in total revenue. Our vitality index, which is the proportion of sales comprised of the new products launched in the last five years stood at just 18% and we weren't yet in the metrology or digital solutions businesses at all. ","So, now five years on, emerging markets are now well over $1 billion with China growing more than 50% and India more than doubling over that timeframe. We've also placed Xylem at the cutting edge of innovation. Our investments have brought many of the industries leading technologies into our portfolio and the M&CS business exposes us to market segments with higher growth rates.","Our vitality index has risen from 18% to 25%. The digital transformation of water networks, which was until recently a fragmented proposition is now an executable reality for our customers. AIA's double-digit orders growth in 2019 shows the customer enthusiasm and demand. Our job in 2020 is now to deliver on that reality and leave the sector in helping customers catch the latent value in their networks.","Our annual revenue is now $5.25 billion and we have set a consistent pace of mid-single digit organic growth over the last three years. Of course, our emphasis on growth would be a double-edged sword if we had diluted margins along the way, but we've done the work to become more profitable as we invested to ensure sustainable growth and margin expansion.","We clearly have more work to do here. Margin expansion continues to be one of our top priorities, but we have so far delivered approximately 250 basis points of EBITDA expansion in the last five years, even as we invested the reach in the new geographies and new product segments. And we've been able to deliver an average 13% compound annual growth in EPS over the last five years, significantly improved versus the previous four years. EBITDA has increased by 65% over the same period.","As we digest the large deals at the front-end of new growth and as CapEx shifts to aftermarket and recurring revenue streams in the next several years, we do expect the margin profile of our growth to become even more attractive. At the same time, we brought focus and rigor to operational execution, developing the capability I mentioned a moment ago to deliver favorable bottom-line outcomes even in unfavorable market conditions.","Just one example of that is their increased discipline in cash generation. We delivered average free cash flow conversion of 108% over the last five years, largely by driving down working capital from 23% to 17.5%, I expect focused operational execution to continue being a key capability for us. ","Any reflection on what we've been building over the last few years would be incomplete without considering sustainability, which is at the center of Xylem's business strategy. Not that long ago, our sustainability goals were sincere and ambitious, but they were largely about reducing our own environmental footprint. Today, we're equally focused on the sustainability outcomes we create with our customers and in the communities in which they operate. Because of the positive impact of our products and solutions, this is a much bigger opportunity. So we built aggressive, industry-leading commitments into our sustainability strategy, targeting the downstream impact of the solutions we provide. This is a far more meaningful approach to sustainability and one we believe is a clear differentiator.","The fundamentals we built and the trajectory we've established give us a balanced view towards 2020 and beyond. We're cautious in the face of near-term uncertainty but we are also well-grounded and able to deliver sustained growth. ","We do see continuing softness in some of our short cycle revenues in the first half. In the second half, we expect that to moderate in parallel with an increasingly solid position in our backlog. We expect to be delivering mid-single-digit growth in the back half of the year and into 2021. We'll talk about that overview shortly including some more detailed guidance on 2020 I review the drivers of our 2019 for your results, it's on slide 5, I'm happy to address any of that in more detail in the latter part of the call during Q&A, but now I want to turn over to Mark to provide a deeper level of detail on how our segments ended up ","Mark Rajkowski","Thanks Patrick.","Revenue growth was flat in the fourth quarter as the market softness we began to experience in the third quarter persisted and slightly worse than we expected. Top-line growth continued to be affected by weakness in the shorter cycle industrial market as well as some softness related to timing of sales in the commercial end market.","Organic orders in the quarter also came in soft down 6% versus the prior year. We did see some deceleration of order rates in the quarter, although it is worth noting that we were lapping a 10% organic orders growth rate in the fourth quarter of 2018. The soft orders intake at the end of the year certainly influences our view on top-line growth for the first half of 2020.","As we look at revenue performance across the end markets, we saw strength in utilities continue up 4% in the quarter with growth reflected across most major geographies. Industrial end markets were down 3% weaker than expected and primarily impacted by the same short cycle dynamics we experienced at the end of the third quarter.","Our commercial end market was down 5% with declines across most major geographies and the residential end-market was down 2% which was slightly better than expected. I will cover end market dynamics in more detail as we move through the segment discussion.","Operating margin was 15% down 10 basis points versus the prior year. I will review operating margin performance by segment in a moment. But, as we look across the businesses, weaker than expected volumes and unfavorable mix particularly from the double-digit declines in our high margin dewatering business negatively impacted the quarters margin performance compared to our expectations.","I'm disappointed in our revenue growth and margin performance in the quarter. I am pleased with the team's operational execution and cost discipline to deliver strong cash flow and meet our commitment on earnings per share of $0.89.","Please turn to Slide 7 and I will review our segment performance for the quarter. Water infrastructure orders in the fourth quarter were down 8% versus last year driven by declines in our dewatering business as well as timing on large project wins. Total shippable backlog in the segment exiting 2019 is up 7% ","Backlog shippable within 2020 is down 1% or shippable backlog in 2021 and beyond is up double digits reflecting the near term softness expected in the first half of 2020 along with a strong backlog of large projects in hand to be delivered beginning in 2021. Water infrastructure revenue grew 1% organically in the quarter as the 11% decline in our North American dewatering business largely offset mid single digit growth in the rest of the segment ","While we had expected the dewatering business to be down in the quarter. Rental revenues in North America declined 17%. This was softer than expected due to a sharp decline in rentals to oil and gas customers as well as lower year over year rentals related to storm events. We expect this cycle to persist at least through the first half of the year. ","Operating margin for the segment remained flat versus last year at 20.7% in the quarter. Significant savings from net productivity and cost reductions were offset by volume declines and the negative mix impact from our North American dewatering business.","The segment delivered 70 basis points of margin expansion for the full year ending at 18.2% this reflects continued gains across the year in price realization in productivity more than offsetting the second half volume declines and weaker revenue.","Next, please turn to slide 8, applied water revenue declined 2% in the quarter, driven by lower sales in commercial building services as well as the modest declines in residential. Segment orders and backlog were each down 1% in the fourth quarter. Shippable backlog within 2020 is down 4% versus last year. ","Both of these indicators are pointing to what we expect to be a softer first half of 2020 for segment revenues. From an end market perspective, commercial declined 5% in the quarter with tough compares, driven by the timing of prior shipments related to price increases for tariffs in the U.S. as well as some slowing demand in Western Europe.","Residential was down low single digits in the quarter, driven by economic softness in Europe and U.S. residential market was a bright spot up 6% in the fourth quarter and up 10% for the full year driven by modest share gains and some improvement in housing market activity.","Operating margin declined 60 basis points in the quarter to 16.6%. Volume declines in the commercial business, geographic mix and overall inflation. We're not fully offset by strong productivity and price realization in the quarter. Despite the challenging fourth quarter for the year, the team was able to deliver 50 basis points of margin expansion, amid market headwinds and tariff impacts by driving 250 basis points of price realization in 400 basis points of productivity across the business.","Now let's turn to slide 9, and I'll cover M&CS. Measurement and control solutions orders declined 7% organically in the quarter, which primarily reflected a tough compare to 18% orders growth in the prior year, which included a large Middle East metrology order in the timing of large North American energy orders.","Revenue increased 2% driven by mid-single digit growth in Sensus and partially offset by modest weakness in the analytics business and project timing in AIA. Segment backlog exiting 2019 is up 8%. Shippable backlogs in 2020 are down 4% reflecting the impact of the timing of large project deployments with most of the decline in the first half of the year. However, shippable backlogs for 2021 and beyond are up double digits providing confidence on revenue growth momentum in the back half of 2020 and into 2021.","Sensus revenues in the quarter grew 4% driven by growth in water and energy metrology deployments in emerging markets. While lapping a tough compare of 13% revenue growth last year. Advanced infrastructure analytics revenues declined 3% in the quarter with several project push outs. Orders were also down in the quarter, although it's worth noting that this is coming off the third quarter with nearly 85% organic orders growth.","Full year orders revenue and backlog were up double digits. We expect to continue to see relatively lumpy revenue in orders growth on a quarterly basis as we scale this project driven business ","Segment EBITDA margins in the quarter are up 80 basis points to 18.1% and segment operating margin increased 20 basis points to 7.7%.","Net productivity benefits and price realization were partially offset by weaker revenue mix. From a full year perspective, EBITDA margins declined 100 basis points to 18.2% and operating margins declined 90 basis points to 8.5% unfavorable mix in the impact of strategic investments ahead of a slower than expected ramp of digital solutions revenues were partially offset by 390 basis points of productivity, volume leverage and 80 basis points of price realization.","Well, let's turn to Slide 10 for an overview of cash flows in the company's financial position. We closed the quarter with a cash balance of $724 million. We invested $51 million in CapEx in the quarter and returned $43 million to shareholders through dividends. Working capital also improved significantly versus 2018, ending at 17.5% sales. This is 150 basis point improvement from last year, driven by the team's focus on operational efficiency, significant reduction in inventories and solid improvements in accounts receivable, collections and payables.","Our cash conversion cycle improved by five days in 2019 with a strong second half push, which enabled us to grow free cash flow 75% for the full year and deliver free cash flow conversion of 124% ","Lastly, we also announced an annual dividend increase of 8% representing our ninth consecutive annual dividend increase.","Please turn to slide 11 and Patrick will cover our 2020 outlook.","Patrick Decker","Thanks, Mark.","Given the slow revenue growth and mixed outcomes in the second half of 2019, we took an extremely close look at the forward profile of our business based on what we saw as we exited the year. One of the lessons of 2019, it's a reminder of how much the short cycle business still impacts our revenues and margins. So we're being appropriately attentive to uncertainty in short cycle market conditions as we guide for 2020. We are also taking into account the revenue profile of our highest growth businesses including treatment, Sensus and AIA, and our two fastest growing emerging markets, India and China. because these businesses deliver a higher proportion of a large CapEx intensive projects. We've been careful to account for timing effects in our guidance.","Several of you have heard me say that growth rarely happens in a straight line this year is going to provide good evidence of that. It's very much a story of two halves. In the first half we see flat to down organic growth and utilities. This is primarily due to tough year-over-year comparisons. You may recall U.S. utilities was up mid-teens in the same half last year and we're also lapping several large projects in the same period.","In industrial end markets, the muted conditions experienced in the second half of 2019 are expected to constrain our short cycle book and ship business at least through the second quarter. Although we anticipated this continued softness as we exited the year, since then events in China have further tempered our short-term outlook. The impact of the Corona virus has for the time being essentially halted deliveries within China, which is our second largest and fastest growing market and its slowing trade in Asia more generally.","As of today, our best view is that the first quarter impact of the Corona virus to the company is likely to be approximately one to two points of revenue in the quarter and $0.03 to $0.04 of EPS. It's obviously a dynamic situation and we are monitoring it very closely. In light of this first half challenges, we are being cautious and further managing costs down in 2020 on top of realizing savings from the restructuring actions we took in 2019. Those actions combined with the operational discipline we demonstrated in the second half will enable us to maintain our investments for growth through this period of market headwinds.","We see a return to momentum in the second half and into 2021. In utilities, we have clear visibility of significant growth from deals in hand in the second half of the year including a half dozen large Sensus AMI deployments. We also expect double-digit growth in the second half of the year in both China and India, driven by project deployments. And based on the information we're receiving from our customers and distributors, we foresee a moderate recovery in industrial and commercial end markets and a return to modest revenue growth in the second half.","For good measure, the third and fourth quarters will also be lapping the soft second half we've just experienced getting both quarters the opportunity to build on favorable year-on-year comparisons. In short, in the second half of 2020, we anticipate returning to mid-single-digit growth overall.","Now please turn to Slide 12. For the full year, we anticipate utilities will end 2020 with low-single-digit organic growth benefiting from a recovery in the second half of the year as U.S. OpEx spending normalizes to healthy levels and smart meter deployments continue to ramp up. Industrial is expected to come in flattish despite modest recovery in the second half. And we anticipate the first half softness in commercial will be largely offset in the second half and the market to be up low single digits for the year.","For Xylem, overall, we foresee a combined picture of full year 2020 organic revenue growth in the low-single digits. And we expect to exit 2020 with momentum and increased visibility of committed revenues given the strong backlog position heading into 2021. It's a dynamic environment, so we will continue to manage through elements of uncertainty by focusing on the things we can influence, effectively controlling our costs and driving productivity, so we can continue to invest to ensure sustainable growth over the long-term. ","We are fortunate to be well positioned with a balanced global portfolio that we expect to continue delivering healthy cash generation through the year. By the end of the year, we foresee having approximately $1 billion in cash on hand. Given the growth in our cash balance, there has been understandable interest in our stance on capital allocation. Alongside organic investment M&A remains a top priority and we do see opportunity for some investments this year.","Having said that, we are considering all options for capital deployment including additional returns to shareholders in 2020 under existing share repurchase authorizations which have a remaining capacity of more than $300 million.","Now I'll turn it over to Mark for a bit more detail on both the first quarter and the full year.","Mark Rajkowski","Thanks Patrick.","On Slide 13, we've provided our 2020 planning assumptions as well as the profile, the first and second half market dynamic which Patrick just reviewed.","In the first half of 2020, we expect revenues to be down low single digits and then return to mid single digit growth in the second half. We're guiding to 1% to 3% organic revenue growth for 2020 this breaks down by segment as follows.","We expect flat to 2% growth in water infrastructure with solid growth in utilities being partially offset by continued weakness in our North American dewatering business, which will be lapping double-digit growth compares through the first half of the year.","In applied water, we expect flat to 2% growth through the full year as the segment enters 2020 with weak order trends and lower shippable backlogs. In the measurement and control solutions, we expect 4% to 6% growth with strong second half revenues related to project deployments offsetting lower first half growth against tough prior year compares a 15% growth in North America driven by double-digit growth in water as well as large energy project climates.","We're assuming a Euro rate of [1.11] [ph] which was the average for the month of January. Our FX sensitivity table is included in the appendix. Our estimated tax rate for 2020 is 19.5%. Non-cash pension income is expected to decline by $15 million or $0.07 per share due to the planned buy out of our U.K. pension plan. Expected 2020 EPS of $2.96 to $3.16 is an increase of 1% to 8% excluding the impact of foreign exchange translation and the reduction in non-cash pension income.","Moving to the first quarter, with shippable backlogs down 3% and at least one to two points of revenue growth impact from the Corona virus in the quarter. We anticipate total company organic revenues will declined in the range of 3% to 5%. We expect first quarter adjusted operating margins to be in the range of 8% to 9% representing 180 to 280 basis points of contraction versus the prior year.","At the Xylem level, this will be driven by unfavorable mix and lower volumes, largely in our North American dewatering business, the Sensus North American metering business and in China. EBITDA margins are expected to be in the range of 14.1% to 15%. We see EBITDA margins breaking down by segment as follows. We expect water infrastructure to be in the range of 13% to 13.9%, applied water to be in the range of 16.2% to 17.1% and M&CS has to be in the range of 14.8% to 15.5%.","With that, please turn to Slide 14 and I'll turn the call back over to Patrick for some closing comments.","Patrick Decker","Thanks, Mark. The transition from 2019 to 2020 sees us emerging from one year of two halves and entering another year of two halves. Despite near term uncertainty, 2020 presents a balanced picture. There are still some good market conditions in the short-term, but as we look toward the second half of the year, our backlog and our line of sight to the timing of major projects provide a high degree of competence both about our guidance for 2020 and about the momentum to which we will return as we exit this year.","And both now and over the longer term, we remain grounded in the tenants of our investment thesis. We expect to continue to deliver attractive top-line growth, more investments in the capabilities and solutions that enable our customers to transform their businesses.","We remain committed to ongoing margin expansion while maintaining our investments in future growth by pursuing the productivity, costs and simplification initiatives that will make those margin gains sustainable. And we will continue driving disciplined cash generation to enhance our capacity for attractive capital deployment, including investment in organic and inorganic growth and increase returns to shareholders.","We'll provide an update on our strategic priorities and our long-term plans at our upcoming investor and Analyst Day on March 31st. We'll look forward to sharing more detail on our technology and solution capabilities, discussing our growth plans and hearing directly from some of our business leaders and customers. I'm hoping to host as many of you as possible then at our Data Analytics Center of Excellence in Atlanta, Georgia.","Now operator, we'll turn the call over to you for questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ryan Connors with Boenning & Scattergood.","Ryan Connors","Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I think you covered a lot of the details pretty well. I had a couple of bigger picture questions actually. The first one is, just strategically, obviously you're transitioning here to a bit of a different period. Headwinds may in fact be transitory, but what cost control and restructuring becoming a more important part of the story right now, especially in the near term.","So obviously you've said in the past you don't want to cut into bone, but can you just talk about how you look at the things you're doing in cost control and restructuring relative to R&D investments and other things. You talk about the vitality index and how you ensure that you don't lose that momentum on innovation and R&D and product development as you kind of rationalize things. ","Mark Rajkowski","Yes, Ryan. Good morning. It's Mark. I mean it's a, it's a great point and it's certainly something that we pay close attention to at the end of the day. We're going to create the most value by growing. We need to continue to maintain our investments in R&D. We are continuing to invest to grow our digital solutions platform. So we're really focused on, those areas of spend where, we've got too much complexity where we've got redundancy in the organization. And last year, we launched a series of restructuring efforts to get after that very thing. And the savings coming from those programs, all in are going to be roughly $40 million. We're continuing to look at opportunities. We continue to drive cost out through great work that all of the teams are doing through Tony Milando's leadership under continuous improvement. ","There's savings that while a little bit late in GBS this past year will provide opportunities to reduce complexity and take out costs as well. So we're not looking at cutting back on investment at all.","Patrick Decker","Yes, right. I think it's a great point. And I think that, first of all, we still see there'd be a high level of continuous improvement opportunities across the company as we've deployed lean six Sigma starting handful of years ago. But we're still in the early stages quite frankly from my perspective on where the opportunities are, especially beyond the four walls of the factory, but across the rest of our P&L. But, we are definitely going to be investing through this near term noise. We adopted a handful of years ago will be called a productivity for growth mindset and where, a meaningful portion of our productivity has been invested for growth because we believe this is a long-term game to your point.","Ryan Connors","Okay. And then my other was -- my follow-on was related in that, if you look across the industrial landscape the last few years, it seems that this sort of portfolio pruning, kind of targeted divestitures have become a popular strategy for companies facing, tougher times, lots of peer companies going that route, whether they call it realignment or pruning. Is that something that's on your radar or are there any lower margin brands or businesses that you would consider offloading? Or is everything you have considered kind of core?","Patrick Decker","Yes, right. And so, we take at least an annual review, if not even more frequent than that, of the growth profile, but also the returns on capital, economic value creation is the criteria that we apply across, each of our business lines. As we sit here today, there really are, well there are some businesses that might be dilutive at times in cycles to growth. There's nothing right now that is, anywhere close to not delivering its return on capital above the cost of capital. So, everything clears the hurdle at this point in time. It is something that we look at on an annual basis at a minimum.","Ryan Connors","Okay, great. Thanks for your time.","Patrick Decker","Thank you, Ryan.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.","Deane Dray","Thank you. Good morning everyone. Patrick, I was hoping you could give us some high level thoughts on guidance here. I think you've done a good job explaining the dynamics first half, second half, but I'd be interested in hearing if you've taken any different approach this year to setting guidance maybe along the lines of embedding some more conservatism, maybe some implied contingency because there is variability to your earning stream, especially with a short cycle dewatering business, but has there been any change in terms of how you're approaching guidance?","Patrick Decker","Yes. I think that Deane as we look back and reflect on, kind of what we learned in 2019. I mean, as I mentioned before, and you just reiterated a meaningful portion of our business is still short cycle. Heading into 2019, we were still feeling pretty bullish based on what we were seeing in the marketplace. But quite frankly, we should have built in more contingency, into that view.","We think this guide is a balanced view. We clearly see near-term headwinds that we laid out, orders softened in Q4, lower shippable backlogs coming into the year, clearly the uncertainty with the China Corona virus and some tough comps. But what gives us confidence about the second half of the year is the projects and backlog that we have already in hand for second half. And just assuming a modest return to growth in the short cycle, again, not a miracle is required in the second half year. So we do feel it's achievable, but it's a properly risk adjusted.","Deane Dray","Got it. And then, you are one of the only companies in the industrials and certainly ones that we follow that have actually embedded revenue and EPS impact from the Corona virus. We appreciate the fact that you've taken this approach. Maybe just give us some real-time color in terms of how your businesses are being impacted. You've got $0.03 or $0.04 negative impact, but is there any other lasting affects that you see in terms of relationships or the types of demand fall-off that you're seeing today?","Patrick Decker","Sure. Great question, Deane. Appreciate that you appreciate that we've tried to be transparent here. We felt it would be disingenuous not to lay out real-time as of what we see right now impacts in the business given that it is, our second largest business outside of U.S. So, first, as you all appreciate, the safety of our people is absolutely paramount. Secondly, we are -- although we're not advertising it, we are heavily involved in the humanitarian response. In Wuhan, we have been delivering pumps, and offering to build water towers there at some of the pop up hospitals. So that's been very important.","As you said, this is very fluid and so what we do know right now is that, there would be impact on the shutdown of our factories, because right now we have halted deliveries, again. We don't know how much of that is simply delays versus it would get recovered, either in the quarter or in Q2. So we're monitoring that very closely.","There clearly is an impact on our supply chain, in terms of our suppliers being down as well. And so there's that kind of knock on effect that again, we think would be recovered over the course of the year. But we're trying to keep a handle on what that is for certainly Q1. And that's really the basis on which we laid out the impact on revenue and earnings per share. Again, we're going to keep monitoring this very closely and certainly in a position to give you all updates no later than Investor Day.","Deane Dray","Appreciate that. And then, can I also ask some questions on the free cash flow guide? So, first of all, great work this year, so that was a vindication year if you will Mark for the team, the cash flow performance. So we appreciate that. Is there any other color you can give us on the guide of 95%? Is that also a conservative cut? We look at -- I see CapEx is up, so that explains some of it, but I'm concerned there might be some give back in the working capital improvements that you did especially in the fourth quarter. So give us some context there, please.","Mark Rajkowski","Yes, Dean. And thanks for that note. We were certainly looking to vindicate ourselves after last year, but a chunk of that was timing as we discussed, we had built up inventories, we had a big ramp up in sales at the end of the year, high single digit growth. And to some extent, the teams did a great job driving down inventories. There was a lot of inventory to drive down. We had softer volumes and we maintained a good discipline around our inventory build. We've done a better job on collecting cash, managing payables and I would say that, we're certainly expecting as we took you through in prepared comments, a ramping up of revenues in the second half.","So there will be instead of working capital being a source, it won't be as big as source of cash flow in 2020. However, we're still looking at improving our cash -- cash conversion cycle and reducing days both in inventories, receivables and pay outs.","Patrick Decker","Adding to that Deane, I think, we think it's a very balanced view on working capital. There's really no major movement built into our guide here on working capital. Obviously, we'll have some of the pressure that Mark alluded to here, but there's still opportunities to try to mitigate that as well. We feel much better about the spot that we're in with working capital now than we were a few years ago.","I think to your question also on conversion, you picked up on the CapEx, the modest increase there and that really is driven predominantly by some expansion plans that we've laid out for India to support the -- really breakout growth there as well as continued an investment in some of the software, the MCS, but also where other segments, where much of that gets capitalized. And so those are really the two big drivers for CapEx increase in 2020.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones with Stifel.","Nathan Jones","Good morning everyone. I'd like to go back to some of the guidance, specifically the mid-single-digit expectation in the second half. I mean clearly you're going to have eight year comps. It sounds like you have some shippable backlog there primarily around the M&CS kind of stuff. But I mean I think there clearly has to be an expectation here that you're going to see short cycle improvement. You probably need to see the orders start rolling in and about second quarter. But, to ship those in the back half, can you talk about, for that mid-single-digit growth rate in the back half, what you have in hand, what's in backlog in terms of these projects versus what kind of improvement you need to see in the underlying environment. What kind of growth you need to see in orders rate over the next couple of quarters to support that outlook in the back half?","Mark Rajkowski","Sure. Yes. Nathan, its Mark. I think it starts with the confidence that we've got certainly in the utility space broadly, but accentuated in our M&CS business. There are the way the projects work in terms of deliveries year-over-year, the backlogs are much stronger in the second half of the year.","We also, we're not looking, as Patrick said, for a miracle and in terms of recovery in the short cycle businesses, but they are going up against much tougher comparison. I mean or easier comparison. I would say what really gives us confidence is more in terms of projects in hand in the back half of the year versus a strong recovery in our short cycle business.","Patrick Decker","And we've been hearing as we stay close to our channel partners as well Nate, especially here in the U.S. that they feel quite good right now about bidding and quoting activity that they are involved in. And part of the softness they saw in the second half was working down some of their inventory that they bought in ahead of the price increases that we had done. So there's a bit of that. So more of the -- more of the pressure that will linger in the second half would be in the industrial business. And that's the one that we're staying closest to in terms of seeing what that order rate looks like in Q2.","Nathan Jones","Okay, fair enough. I'd love to then talk a little bit about mix both here in 2020 and longer term. I mean, clearly you've got some headwinds for stuff like dewatering. It's very high margin. You're going to have some mix headwinds on these M&CS projects as you roll out the hardware initially. Can you talk about, what you anticipate the impact of mix, whether it's, basis points of margin or however you want to couch it in 2020.","And then, if you look forward, I would think, let's say dewatering recovers and these M&CS projects, get the hardware installed and move to software. You should see any improving mixes we go forward over the next few years. Can you talk a little bit more about, what kinds of impacts we should expect to see that have on margins as you go forward qualitatively or quantitatively?","Mark Rajkowski","Yes. Nate, it's Mark. We're going to lay out a lot more of this when we get together in March, but clearly it gets back to the -- it is a story of two halves, right? And our mix, it's really tough given compares in our dewatering business in the first half of the year. And also certainly in the first quarter plus that compares with our Sensus North American water growth. But, that does turn around, in the second half given, the project deployments that we see in M&CS, just an easier set of compares in our short cycle businesses, a little bit more robust growth as Patrick mentioned, given some of the timing and commercial business services. And we are expecting to see a better ramp in our digital solutions business. So first half tough, second half better, but all in it's probably not a big contributor to overall margin expansion. ","Patrick Decker","So Nate, this is Patrick. You've raised a very important point here I think for investors to look at and understand, and we will go into much more detail on this at Investor Day is the impact that we see from the shift in growth profile of the company to the higher margin. We will see a recovery in dewatering. It is very high incremental margins. But on top of that, we will see the adoption of AIA and M&CS overall, which will have very nice accretive margins, higher growth profile.","So that mix is going to be a part of our story in Investor Day, but that does not remove us from focusing on what we control. And that is productivity cost in our investments.","Nathan Jones","Okay. Thanks very much. I will pass it on.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Davis with Melius Research. Mr. David, your line is open.","Patrick Decker","Lisa, maybe we will come back to him and go to the next one.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Walsh with Credit Suisse.","John Walsh","Thanks for all that detail in the prepared remarks. I guess following on the last question, just wondering if we could have a conversation about how some of the restructuring and realignment savings flow through. I'm just trying to put everything together and looking at what your implied Q1 detrimentals are? And then, how we get positive. Obviously you highlighted a lot of stuff already around volume, et cetera, but maybe you can talk about how the savings flow through into 2020, and I'm assuming some of that stuff has a tail into 2021 as well.","Mark Rajkowski","Yes. So, the 2020 restructuring and realignment is primarily around business simplification. It's GBS-related. So we are seeing benefits coming from our procurement tower finance as we've talked about is going to be delayed into later into 2020. But we did initiate some programs last year in terms of simplification in Europe additional actions in North America. And as we look at those benefits, we're certainly expecting them to ramp up through the year, particularly those actions in Europe, which were just take longer to work through the works council.","John Walsh","Good. And I mean, any way to kind of quantify in an H1 versus an H2 benefit, just so we can kind of help for the modeling purposes?","Patrick Decker","It's about 6 million of restructuring savings in Q1 John.","John Walsh","Okay. And then, obviously appreciate, you gave the details around the backlog shippable into 2020 and also visibility in the 2021. Can you just remind us how firm those orders are like, once a customer decides to place an order, are there, either progress payments or cancellation fees? Just wanted to understand that a little bit better.","Mark Rajkowski","Yes, John. And these are commitments. Now, in some cases, particularly in some of our larger infrastructure projects, particularly in emerging markets but not limited to emerging markets, we do look to get advanced payments. While the orders are in hand, as long as there's a commitment, some of these -- the timing of them can move out from quarter-to- quarter. So that's always something that we need to pay close attention to. But these are certainly -- these are things that are commitments for but timing can shift in any given quarter.","Patrick Decker","Yes. Very rarely. This is Patrick. Very rarely would they be canceled. And when you think about even our metrology deals that we do, especially on the AMI side, the economics on these things, the returns on capital for utility. Once they'd gotten these things approved in their rate case by the regulator are so attractive for them that they, it would be rare for them to ever cancel one of these. And that's a big part of what we see in the shippable backlog beyond 2020.","John Walsh","Great. Thank you for the color. Appreciate it.","Operator","Your next question comes from Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James.","Pavel Molchanov","Thanks for taking the question. You guys alluded to the hefty cash balance that you're expecting by the end of the year and in that context, let me ask you about the M&A landscape. You guys are seeing the headwinds, presumably many smaller players in the water tech space are seeing as much, if not more. Is the kind of valuation opportunity becoming more interesting from a consolidation angle?","Patrick Decker","I would say we've not seen any meaningful change in valuations to-date. Obviously, that could change based upon the volatility you alluded to. And so, we are always evaluating. We think we have a very attractive pipeline of opportunities. We will always remain discipline on valuations. And again, make sure that these things are critical to really enabling the strategic growth of the portfolio. So again, we mentioned earlier, we think there are some opportunities out there this year. But again, we'll have more of an update on that at Investor Day in terms of what that pipeline looks like, at least directionally.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Giordano with Cowen.","Francisco Amador","Good morning guys. This is Francisco Amador in for Joe. Could you explain why you expect M&CS margins, it is so low to the start of the year and just what your longer term margin target is for M&CS and how you get there?","Mark Rajkowski","Yes, Francisco. It's Mark. There's a couple of things. One, new volumes are down and we'll see some impact on that relative to leverage. But also mix as I mentioned in our prepared remarks, our North American dewatering business have a really tough compare year-over-year, very high margins. And also, just given some of the timing we see in our high margin digital solutions business, there's some mixed impact there as well.","And the last point is, and Patrick mentioned this, despite the soft patch in terms of volumes and mix in Q1, we are continuing to invest. We've got customer commitments we need to meet. We're excited about the opportunities in the digital side. So we're actually increasing our investment year-over-year.","Patrick Decker","And I would say just to punctuate the investment comment, the couple of areas that are really our priority to invest in that segment right now are predominantly, again, meeting, some of the customer commitments on some product modification for some of the large deals. We do have some new products that we're looking to roll out this year in the metrology space that we think are going to be very exciting.","And then lastly, continuing to invest in building out the go-to-market infrastructure for the digital solutions capabilities that we've got. And that's not just in the U.S. that's on a global scale.","Francisco Amador","Okay, great. Thank you. And then just as a follow-up, are you seeing any aggressive pricing by competitors in the dewatering market, having an impact on margins? And do you have any color just on the competitive landscape here?","Patrick Decker","Yes. I think the dewatering space, it has always been quite competitive from a pricing standpoint, although obviously the margins are very attractive. I'd probably rather not comment too much on competitive pricing at this stage. But I would say we don't really, I don't think we see a major sea change in that area, but it's always been a competitive market that we -- and what really helps lift margins in that business is just the emergency nature of it and how critical the services are to customers when they are in need.","Mark Rajkowski","And obviously as volumes are softer, it's even more competitive.","Francisco Amador","Great. Appreciate it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brett Linzey with Vertical Research Partners.","Brett Linzey","Hi, good morning. Just wanted to come back to the second half guide. Could you just put a finer point on the size of those specific M&CS deployments that you expect? And then thinking about the delivery timetables there, is it pretty balanced between Q3 and Q4? Or is it pretty loaded up in the tail end of the year?","Mark Rajkowski","No. It's fairly balanced. It is certainly a component, but we have a global business and we see continued improvement in just recurring revenue in replacement of meters as well. So, but the thing that really makes the difference is a little bit easier compare and more robust backlogs that are pretty much evenly expected to deploy across Q3 and then Q4.","Brett Linzey","Okay. Is there any way you could quantify the size of the projects and just call it, points to the year or absolute dollars?","Mark Rajkowski","Yes. The growth in the deployment of these larger projects is, it's mid single digit plus impact.","Brett Linzey","Okay. Got it. Thanks. And then just shifting back to the restructuring question, go ahead. Shifting back to the restructuring question and I am a bit surprised given the softness and some catch-up on the simplification efforts here and doing more from a restructuring standpoint this year. Maybe, just the thought process there and then, how you're thinking about the, the drop through on savings and payback timing.","Mark Rajkowski","Yes. The savings we discussed have always been phased. It doesn't happen all at once. The programs that we undertook from a simplification perspective last year in Europe and North America, we're really rolled out as we saw things moving in the back half of the year. So we start to see that ramp up throughout this year. We saw some benefits at the end of last year, but we'll see more this year.","Patrick Decker","This is Patrick. Again, you think about anytime you've got restructuring programs, you've got some that are rolling off as you're laughing. And so, we had taken restructuring in the first half of last year that we had announced that really began to benefit second half of the year and trails a little bit into this year. That phase was done. That was kind of phase one in Europe. We had a phase two in Europe that we launched in the second half of last year. And just given the lead times involved in getting things like work's council approval, there's some factory implications. So these things have to be managed. We expect those to happen in the second half of the year.","So, there's always a bit of phase in here in terms of when a program gets launched versus when it gets rolled out and deliver savings.","Brett Linzey","Got it. I appreciate the color. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Lee","Hey guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I guess just first stuff on the margin front. I know this has been something you guys have obviously been highly focused on a couple of moving parts here. But if you could just help us, you had been talking about I believe a 100 basis points of EBITDA margin expansion in 2020 originally. Now the target mid point is more like 30 to 40 basis points a year-on-year. Appreciate there's a lot of moving parts here.","But to the extent that you can -- any sense that you can provide of kind of the bridge between the old and new views, how much is a lower volume, how much is mix operational savings, maybe falling short and then any other items as we think about how you can again, kind of bridge back to the faster margin expansion trajectory you had been targeting before.","Patrick Decker","Yes. This is Patrick. I mean, I would say, first of all, clearly we plan to spend a fair amount of time on this at Investor Day to really kind of lay out how we're thinking about margin expansion. Clearly, we are still deeply committed to margin expansion through productivity, shifting mix in our revenue portfolio and still some other costs take that opportunity. So we'll walk through that certainly at Investor Day in a bit more depth.","I think the biggest drivers here dramatically are the challenges in our two highest margin businesses that being dewatering and simply the slower ramp up of conversion of orders to revenue on digital solutions. We believe those are simply transitory, but we'll walk you through that at Investor Day. Mark talked about some execution delays that we talked about last year as it related to the finance tower. We're still deeply committed to that. We're moving that forward, but there -- it has been a shift in the right. And that's certainly impacting part to 2020.","We've also continued to invest for growth so we've not pulled back on R&D or other investments to grow these faster growing businesses. But again, we'll walk you through in more depth on that in terms of how we're thinking about longer term margin expansion and how we're going to guide to that each year.","Brian Lee","Okay, fair enough. I'll look forward to that. And then maybe just a housekeeping question for Mark. I noticed the interest expense assumption for 2020, it's coming down about, close to $10 million a year-on-year. Any assumptions there embedded on refinancing or paying down debt through the year or what else might be driving that year-on-year change outside of just additional cash on the balance sheet?","Mark Rajkowski","Yes, well, part of it is, we manage our interest rate risk through swaps and other programs that are certainly benefiting us a little bit this year in the back part of the year as well as a full year benefit into 2020. So that's just the effects of that interest rate risk management program.","Brian Lee","All right, I got it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Hey, good morning guys. Your rental business was starting to weaken when you reported last October, I think you said it was down 17% in Q4. You mentioned tough storm comparisons, weakness in oil and gas. Have you seen the rate of decline in rentals stabilize at all yet? And what are your rental teams telling you about the incremental weakness in that market and when it might subside?","Patrick Decker","Yes. So, if I follow your question correctly, you have to really break dewatering out between the rental piece of the business and our equipment sell. And actually, we did see a growth in our rental business by mid single digits. It was really the equipment sales that we saw the big drop there. And that was largely driven by reaction on the part of our distributors. They were seeing -- what they saw, CapEx uncertainty, they run to cash, they're small distributors typically. And so they got skittish understandably and pulled back. Our rental piece continued to grow modestly during that timeframe. Now we have again, seen that a weakness continue and that part of dewatering for heading into this year. That's why we're trying to be cautious in terms of how we guide that business.","At this point in time, we are still seeing a broad based industrial weakness. And so that does temper our view on how we view this and because it has such a large detrimental impact when it goes the wrong way. We want to be cautious in terms of how we guide here.","Mark Rajkowski","I'll just add a little more color in terms of, so what changed in the fourth quarter? We expected some rental weakness just based upon what we were seeing in our distributor channels. And on the sales side in the fourth quarter, it was weaker than we expected. And really for two reasons; one, our shipments into customers in the oil and gas space are down more than we expected. And some of that had to do with bankruptcies and oil refinery explosions. And then there was a big year-over-year decline in rentals related to storm events.","So both of those were more than we expected. But, to Patrick's point, we do expect some of the weakness in rental to persist, particularly as we sell into the oil and gas. And other heavy industry in the first half of 2020, but some normalization as we get out of that period, particularly when you look at the tough comparison that we had to the first half of 2019.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Great. Thanks for that color guys. And then, just I wanted to ask you about, M&CS in the context of timing. Revenue growth in Q4 was up 2%, I think you said shippable backlog in the 2020 was down 4%, but up double digits for 2021. So, you mentioned difficult comparisons, but as something been happening either in the quarter, over the last couple of quarters to sort of further slow down decision-making or customers just more hesitant to take on these digital projects given they're worried about the economy, is that what it is? Is it labor availability? What is it that's slowing it down?","Patrick Decker","Yes. Well, I think we have to break it down between -- it's hard to talk about M&CS as one, it's not one business line. So the projects -- they're very different kind of projects. So, the digital solutions piece where we're talking about those kinds of projects, these are things that typically start off in a pilot phase. Then they move into orders. And then, they're always subject to weather events. It's not a reflection of there being a lack of funding or a lack of interest or they're pulling off on those. It's simply a matter of timing in that regard based upon the orders that we had on hand coming out of Q3 and Q4.","And then for the -- for the census for metrology piece of M&CS, we've not really seen any change in dynamics in terms of decision-making, length of time it takes, that's not really been a driver here in terms of why we stepped backlog. It's just -- these are large -- several large implementations that it takes a while for those utilities to get their case approved and get the specs finalized and get the RFPs out and finalized. And so there's always going to be a level of lumpiness there. And that's why it's important in our view that we look at these things over a longer timeframe than a couple of quarters or even from one year to the next.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Appreciate it guys.","Operator","Thank you.

At this time, all participants have been placed on a listen-only mode, and the floor will be open for your questions following the presentation.","I would now like to turn the call over to Phil De Sousa, Vice President of Investor Relations.","Phil De Sousa - Xylem, Inc.","Thank you, Jackie. And good morning, everyone, and welcome to Xylem's second quarter 2016 earnings conference call. With me today are Chief Executive Officer, Patrick Decker; and Chief Financial Officer, Mark Rajkowski. They will provide their perspective on Xylem's second quarter 2016 results and discuss the full year outlook for the year. Following our prepared remarks, we will address questions related to the information covered on the call.","In addition to having a \u2013 in order to have enough time to address everyone on the call, I'll ask that you please keep to one question and a follow-up and then return to the queue. We do anticipate that today's call will last approximately one hour. And as a reminder, this call and our webcast are accompanied by a slide presentation available in the Investors section of our website at www.xyleminc.com.","A replay of today's call will be available until midnight, September 6. Please note the replay number is 800-585-8367 and the confirmation code is 29489904. Additionally, the call will be available for playback via the Investors section of our website under the heading Presentations.","With that, please turn to slide two. We will make some forward-looking statements on today's call, including references to future events or developments that we anticipate will or may occur in the future. These statements are subject to future risks and uncertainties, such as those factors described in Xylem's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and in subsequent reports filed with the SEC.

First, to highlight that we have provided you with a summary of some of our key performance metrics we reported earlier this morning in our release. This includes both GAAP and non-GAAP metrics. For purposes of today's call, all references will be on an adjusted basis unless otherwise indicated and non-GAAP financials have been reconciled for you and are included in the Appendix section of the presentation.","Additionally, please note that references to 2016 outlook metrics include the financial impacts attributable to previously closed acquisitions and have been adjusted to exclude non-recurring transaction costs.","Now, please turn to slide four. I will turn the call over to our CEO, Patrick Decker.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Thanks, Phil, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us to review our second quarter performance. Overall, I'm pleased with the results we delivered in the first half of the year. Our ongoing focus on enhancing our commercial leadership is continuing to yield faster than market growth as well as share gains in key regions.","Our teams continue to capitalize on a very strong public utility market, which is not showing any signs of slowing down. This is helping to offset weakness in certain areas of the industrial sector, namely, oil and gas and mining. We're also making significant progress on our continuous improvement and business simplification initiatives, which is driving margin expansion and earnings growth.","We have been and will remain keenly focused on the factors we can control, namely, enhancing our customer-centric selling approach, leveraging our broad portfolio of solutions and channel partners, improving our working capital efficiency, and optimizing key aspects of our operations. This strategy is enabling us to capture more than our fair share of growth in certain key verticals, and optimize our performance in those markets where conditions are mixed. All of these efforts have positioned us well to deliver on our full-year commitments and we believe we are on track to meet our longer-term objectives as well.","We expect many of the macro trends, including the mixed market conditions that existed in the first half of 2016, to continue through the end of the year. This includes some volatility in the timing of major project awards, which slipped out of the second quarter, even as the underlying market conditions in public utility remains strong. This is not an unusual circumstance. And importantly, we continue to cultivate a growing bidding pipeline.","Having closed out the first half of 2016 with 3% organic growth, we are confident in our ability to deliver a similar result in the second half of the year. So, we are narrowing our full-year revenue growth guidance to reflect both our first half results and the timing of orders. As a result, we are tightening our projection of 2% to 4% organic growth, to between 2% to 3%.","We pleased with our margin expansion and expect that progress to continue, even as we invest for future growth. For the full year, we're increasing the upper end of our operating margin target. We now expect to deliver a full-year operating margin in the range of 13.4% to 13.8%.","Finally, we're narrowing the range of our full-year EPS guidance while maintaining the midpoint. We now expect to deliver adjusted EPS of $2 to $2.06. I'll come back to the details behind this change in a few minutes.","Please turn to slide five. Our top line organic growth in the quarter was 2% and consistent with our expectations. This excludes 1 point of growth from acquisitions. The strong growth in public utilities helped to mitigate the softness in the industrial and residential end markets. Looking at our end markets, growth in public utility remains robust. Globally, we grew 15% in this sector in the second quarter with contributions across all major regions, and the U.S. delivering a 22% increase for the second consecutive quarter. And as I just mentioned, our teams continue to report strong bidding pipelines and steady demand.","Our industrial business continues to be negatively impacted by weak oil and gas sector as well as mining, though it's worth noting that we are now seeing sequential improvement. And the commercial end market, which was up 2% in the quarter, was a mixed bag. Our business in Europe is strong, driven by new products introduced over the past couple of years as well as the investments we've made in strengthening our sales channels there. The U.S. commercial building market is stabilizing. But after seven consecutive quarters of growth, we were down in the second quarter.","Regionally, Western Europe led the way, delivering 7% growth in the second quarter. The U.S. market was flat despite the strong performance in public utilities. And looking at our emerging market regions, the results were mixed, though overall, we delivered 1% growth in the quarter.","China continued to be soft, down 11% year-over-year, as we'd expected. We saw sequential improvement there and investment in infrastructure remains steady. In addition, we continue to capitalize on other growth opportunities across the Asia region. Our Middle East business is solid and growing, up 10% in the quarter.","Finally, India continues to thrive, as we continue to deliver on a major infrastructure project. Our team also shipped its first custom pump export order from India to Germany, an important milestone for this business. We have a very robust pipeline in India and anticipate some significant project wins that we hope to communicate in the coming weeks and months.","Coming back to Europe for a moment, I did want to make a few comments about Brexit. Like most companies, we are assessing both near and long-term impacts from this decision, but it's very early in the process. To provide some perspective, the UK represents approximately 6% of Xylem's total revenue with about 70% of that in our Water Infrastructure segment. This customer base is predominately water utilities, which are inherently more resilient to economic volatility because of the country's five-year water infrastructure investment plan, known as the AMP cycle. Right now, the UK is in its sixth five-year AMP cycle, and we do not anticipate any significant changes.","Our Applied Water applications, which generate about 30% of our revenues in the country, are tied to more economically sensitive markets, including residential, commercial and industrial and therefore are more vulnerable to economic headwinds. Overall, we aren't drawing any definitive conclusions at this point, but we do not foresee the Brexit decision resulting in a significant impact in the immediate term on the markets we serve in the UK or, more broadly, across Europe.","Back to our results. Organic order bookings in the quarter were weaker than expected. This primarily reflects project timing fluctuations and a tough year-over-year comparison. In a robust environment such as the U.S., we have experienced some delays between the time we receive commitments and when we receive the actual order. This is due to E&C firms juggling a growing portfolio of larger more complex projects, which can cause some delays in the process. This is not an unprecedented dynamic as we've seen from previous periods of significant market recovery, and this is a high quality problem.","Despite this variability driven by timing, we continue to cultivate a growing project pipeline. As I already mentioned, we're seeing consistently strong design and bidding activity in the U.S. water utility sector. Our treatment business, which we consider to be a bellwether for the long-term health of the water utility business has a steadily expanding project funnel. In the second quarter, we saw a year-over-year growth of approximately 15%, with quarterly sequential improvement as well. This growth was driven primarily by increased bidding activity in China and India. There are also signs of potential growth acceleration in parts of Europe and a growing project pipeline in our emerging market regions.","I'm particularly pleased with the progress our teams have made in the first half of the year on driving productivity. Our initiatives around continuous improvement and business simplification have already and will continue to create significant value for Xylem. In the quarter, operating margin expanded 100 basis points to 13%, with volume leverage and favorable mix driving 70 basis points of improvement. Price was neutral overall for the quarter. Collectively, global procurement, lean and Six Sigma activities and restructuring savings reduced our costs by $30 million in the quarter, resulting in 320 basis points of margin improvement.","Partially offsetting these savings were cost inflation of 170 basis points and the funding of our strategic growth initiatives of 90 basis points. Our growth initiatives included increased new product R&D spend, investment in our selling and continuous improvement capabilities, and localization of assembly and production in attractive faster growth regions.","A couple of points on our continuous improvement efforts. In addition to the dollars saved through our lean and Sig Sigma initiatives, we are changing processes and eliminating barriers to productivity. In the first half of the year, we completed 80 Kaizen events that are generating measurable improvements. While some focus on internal processes, others target improvements in how we engage with our customers. These initiatives are creating sustainable change that will continue to pay dividends down the road.","Our global procurement group has really hit its stride and is well on its way to meeting our full year goals. The result will be another year of record savings from procurement. We've launched our new eSourcing tool, which resulted in more than 15% average savings in the first two online auctions.","In addition to going after direct spend opportunities, we are increasingly looking at our indirect spend categories as well. As I said before, this productivity for growth mindset is enabling us to fund important initiatives for our medium and long-term growth, while continuing to expand our operating margins. One other point, we are seeing positive benefits from the restructuring actions we've already taken this year.","Shifting back to our results. At the bottom line, we generated adjusted earnings per share of $0.48 in the quarter, an increase of 12% year-over-year. We continue to generate solid cash flow. The year-over-year decline in the quarter reflect increased investments in growth initiatives, but we are well on our way to a second consecutive year of free cash flow conversion, north of 100% of net income.","Our sharp focus on improving working capital performance continued. In the quarter, we generated 100 basis point year-over-year improvement, excluding the impact of foreign exchange translation and acquisitions.","Now, I'll turn it over to Mark for more details in the quarter and then I'll come back to our outlook for the year.","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Thanks, Patrick. Please turn to slide six and I'll provide additional details on our reporting segments. Water Infrastructure recorded orders of $562 million, down 4% organically. As Patrick mentioned earlier, we had a challenging year-over-year comparison to last year's second quarter, when we had two major projects that totaled $18 million. Excluding the impact of those projects, our orders would have been roughly flat year-over-year. We exited the quarter with total backlog of $546 million.","Given the strength of the project pipeline that our teams are working and our solid win rate, we believe this year-over-year decline is due primarily to project timing. Worth noting is that in addition to a growing project pipeline, we did see a modest increase in our weekly order rates in June. Revenue of $566 million represents a 3% increase year-over-year on an organic basis. Acquisitions added an additional $11 million to the top line, while foreign exchange was an $11 million headwind.","We generated 15% growth in the global public utility market with double-digit gains across most of our businesses. In the U.S., our public utility business matched its strong Q1 performance with 22% growth in the second quarter. Our teams are executing very well, driving share gains in a healthy water and wastewater market.","Western Europe grew 4%, driven by broad public utility growth over most of the region, including solid increases in the UK due to the AMP6 cycle. There was also strength in the Nordics, France and Germany partially offset by a decline in Southern Europe.","Emerging market results were favorable, up 4% despite mixed market conditions. Our overall growth was driven by large custom projects in India and Laos coupled with strength in treatment from infrastructure investments in the Middle East.","Finally, expected weakness in oil and gas and mining markets coupled with a softer than expected industrial CapEx environment drove mid single-digit declines in our industrial vertical. Operating margin increased 150 basis points to 14%, as volume leverage, cost reductions and modest price realization more than offset cost inflation and increased strategic growth investments.","Please turn to slide seven. Applied Water recorded orders of $361 million, up 1% organically over the prior period, and entered the third quarter with total backlog of $180 million. In this segment, we saw a modest improvement in our weekly order rates over the course of this past quarter. Revenue was $366 million, flat, organically, versus the prior year.","In Western Europe, revenue increased 14% as industrial water and commercial building applications both delivered double-digit growth in the quarter. Here we continue to see benefits from energy-efficient product launches and our investment in building our regional sales capabilities.","In the U.S., residential was down 5% primarily reflecting softer market conditions, including lower demand for well pumps in the West, which benefited last year from severe drought conditions. The segment's U.S. industrial revenue declined 4%, reflecting softer general industrial, marine, and food and beverage demand. The most significant portion of this decline was attributable to weakness in regions more directly tied to the oil and gas market.","Segment revenue was down 5% in our emerging markets primarily due to the as expected 11% decline in China, driven by softer demand in the commercial and industrial end markets. On a sequential basis, our performance in China continues to improve. Segment operating margin increased 40 basis points to 14.8% year-over-year.","Cost reductions drove a 380 basis point improvement, more than offsetting 160 basis points of cost inflation, 110 basis points from strategic growth investments as well as unfavorable mix. The year-over-year increased investments relate to the funding the localization of product assembly in the Middle East and higher investments in new product development.","Now, let's turn to slide eight to cover the company's cash flow and in financial position. We closed the quarter with a cash balance of $586 million. Our net debt to net capital ratio is healthy at 23%, and our revolving credit facility remains in place and unutilized. This underscores our financial strength and capacity for capital deployment. In that regard, we continue to pursue and execute on opportunities to profitably grow the business through organic investments and M&A, while also enhancing shareholder returns through dividends and opportunistic share repurchases.","During the second quarter, we invested $25 million for capital expenditures and we returned $28 million to our shareholders through dividends. Free cash flow was $59 million, a modest decline from the prior year, reflecting increased year-over-year spending on growth CapEx. We continue to expect to deliver at least 100% cash conversion this year. It's worth highlighting that we improved working capital as a percentage of revenue by 100 basis points in the quarter, excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign exchange. The improvement was driven by better inventory management and receivable collections.","Please turn to slide nine and Patrick will cover the update to our 2016 outlook.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Thanks, Mark. We continue to expect to generate revenues of approximately $3.7 billion for the full year, including 1% growth from acquisitions and foreign exchange headwind of approximately 2%.","As I mentioned earlier, we are narrowing our organic growth expectations. We now anticipate full year organic growth in the range of 2% to 3%. Again, this reflects timing variability as project awards have shifted from the first half to the second half in a very strong public utility market.","Following the strong execution in productivity delivered by our team in the first half of the year, we are increasing the upper end of our operating margin guidance 10 basis points. We now expect our full year operating margin to be in the range of 13.4% to 13.8% for the year. As I reviewed earlier, we have narrowed our EPS guidance range to $2 to $2.06 to reflect a couple of items.","First, we are reducing our foreign exchange translation headwind impact by $0.02, about $0.01 from the first half and another $0.01 in the second half. And second, this narrowing also reflects the adjustments to the top ends of our revenue growth and margin expansion guidance ranges. There is no change to our free cash flow conversion guidance.","Please turn to slide 10 and I'll walk you through the update to our end market assumptions for 2016. Beginning with public utility at 33% of total revenue. Through the first half, we generated organic revenue growth of 13%, but expect our second half organic performance to moderate. This expectation reflects continued strong market conditions, but we do face tougher year-over-year comps. Some of you may recall that we delivered double-digit growth in the U.S. in the second half of last year.","With that said, we expect second half 2016 revenue to be up mid single-digits, and as a result, our full year expectation is in the high single-digit range. This outlook is improved relative to our previous expectations and reflects the positive performance realized to-date and momentum heading into the back half.","Our industrial end market, which represents 44% of total revenues and includes a wide range of industries from general light industrials to the heavier sectors. Full year organic revenue growth is now expected to be flat, which is slightly lower than we previously anticipated. Here we see double-digit declines in the oil and gas and mining sectors, offsetting modest growth in general and light industrial applications. While industrial overall was down 3% in the first half, we do expect that performance to improve over the balance of the year, primarily reflecting easier second half comps as we lap more significant prior year headwinds in the oil and gas market.","Moving to commercial. We are maintaining our full year mid single-digit growth outlook. This reflects first half organic revenue growth of 3% and modest improvement in the back half. That improvement is supported by solid underlying market conditions in the U.S. and continued growth in Europe, driven by new product demand. In addition, we expect the weak conditions in China to begin to stabilize and then improve in the latter part of the year.","In our smallest two end-markets, residential and agriculture, we project full year revenue to be down mid single-digits. Both of these sectors have experienced challenging market conditions in the first half of the year, due in part to lower demand for well pumps as drought conditions moderated in the Western U.S. We expect those to continue in the second half.","Now, please turn to slide 11, and Mark will walk you through more of the details on the second half outlook. Mark?","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Thanks, Patrick. I'd like to spend a minute calibrating everyone around what we expect our revenue and operating income profile to be over the balance of 2016. First shippable backlog, of the total $725 million in backlog, $525 million is shippable in the second half of this year, and the remaining $200 million is expected to ship in 2017. Third quarter shippable backlog is approximately $365 million, which is down 2% organically versus the prior year. This represents approximately 40% of our expected third quarter sales.","While we still have a lot of book and ship business to secure and deliver in the quarter, we believe that we have solid momentum in the public utility sector as well as stable outlooks across most of our key regions. In addition, our teams have stepped up their execution and are delivering more quickly to our customers.","Organically, we anticipate second half revenue to increase in the range of 2% to 3%. We see the second half revenue profile similar to past years, down 3% sequentially in the third quarter before ramping up in the fourth quarter. This reflects the impact of seasonality in Europe in July and August.","We expect operating income performance in the second half to improve sequentially. This will be driven by volume, improved mix and a continued ramp-up of savings from our productivity initiatives. In the third quarter, we anticipate margin expansion of approximately 50 basis points to 100 basis points year-over-year. Finally, we expect full year corporate expense of approximately $50 million.","With that, please turn to slide 12, and I'll hand the call back over to Patrick for some closing comments. Patrick?","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Thanks, Mark. We delivered a solid first half of 2016, and I believe we're building strong momentum in our commercial execution, as well as achieving significant progress against our productivity initiatives. We know there's plenty more to do, but that leaves us even more optimistic about our potential for future growth. We will continue to increase our investments and strategic growth initiatives, including in the areas of innovation and technology as well as in our faster growing markets.","Finally, we remain committed to driving a disciplined capital deployment strategy and continuing to improve our working capital performance, both important contributors to our growth. Now, operator, we can open it up to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","The floor is now open for questions. Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Good morning, Deane.","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Hi, Deane.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","I was hoping to get some more color on this high quality problem regarding the surge in bidding activity. And then specifically, maybe you can size for us what this funnel looks like, maybe some color on what that mix is in this funnel. How much would be advanced water treatment, analytics and so forth. And then lastly, with this bidding outlook, what does this say about your 2017 visibility? Thank you.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Sure, Deane. So, yeah, let me just characterize what we're seeing here and I've seen this in the past, both in this market as well as even in the energy sector's when projects begin to heat up, which is obviously not the case right now in that sector. But what you saw is you've got constraints on a number of the E&C firms, the construction firms, tight labor market, obviously, some level of wage inflation there. They bid these projects, they put in there their budgetary quotes. The quotes sometimes come in higher than what the municipalities were actually thinking at that point in time. They push it back, say rebid again.","And although we've already been committed, the project and the order from a customer, the contractor, they can't officially place the order on us until they actually have that in hand. It typically, from my experience, takes a couple of quarters for this to work through the system. It's hard to predict, but again, it is not unprecedented. And as I said, it is a high quality problem to have. And those rebids and the quotes don't have an impact on our pricing or our margin structure. It really is just a matter of the timing of when the project actually flows through.","When I talk about the size of the pipeline, the total pipeline that we're talking about really are treatment projects, and those are the leading indicators for us. And that total pipeline is about $2.6 billion and that pipeline is up 15% from a year ago. And so it does give us pretty good visibility into what 2017 could look like, again, setting aside any ongoing shift out of the timing of some of these projects. But overall, it's actually a very encouraging sign to see this level of healthy bidding and tension in the system, Deane.","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah. And I'd add, Patrick, just to put an exclamation point on that. While it's up 15% year-over-year, we're up, we've seen 10% improvement quarter sequentially.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And then just to clarify, when you talk about the preponderance of treatment systems in this pipeline, does the mix imply interest in your advanced treatment and your analytics?","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","It does, it does, Deane. And it also is a bellwether for the overall wastewater market. And so, when you see healthy bidding pipelines here and project activity, that also bodes well for our Flygt submersible pumps. Anything that we're selling into the wastewater sector tend to benefit from that rising tide.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. And then just my last question, and Patrick, you and I have talked about this before, is when you see municipal with this type of strength, and we're not seeing any signs of slowing here, could you give us a perspective on how long these cycles run in municipal recoveries, both in the U.S. and in the developed markets?","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Sure, yeah, I would say that it's a bit more cyclical in the U.S. and the cycles there historically would run anywhere between five to 10 years on the wastewater side. I would say the recovery that we're seeing in Europe will be steadier, and we see that improvement obviously being driven largely right now by the AMP cycle in the UK, which is a five-year program, and we're in the second year of that. So, that's got a few more years of its tail behind it. And as I said earlier, we continue to see quarter sequential improvement in the project pipeline for China and each of the emerging markets. And so, we see a level of rebound happening there as well on the public utility side.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yes. This is all great to hear. Thank you.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Thank you, Deane.","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Thanks, Deane.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line Ryan Connors with Boenning & Scattergood.","Ryan Michael Connors - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thank you. Actually, I want to just continue on that same vein and maybe get some, try to paraphrase your response to Deane there and make sure I understand. So basically, you're saying that despite the pretty extraordinary growth rates we're seeing in municipal, you don't feel like we're setting up tough comparisons for next year. You feel like the project pipeline or the bidding pipeline is sufficient that we can sustain a strong rate of growth despite these comps we're setting up here. Is that appropriate way to read what you're saying?","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah, Ryan. I think the way I'd characterize it is we would consider, as we talked about at Investor Day, that once we got through this first year of extraordinary comps, that we would see somewhere in the healthy mid single-digit growth for 2017 and onward. Obviously, that can vary from year-to-year, could be a little stronger than that in certain years. But we do see the comps get tougher and they get tougher in the second half and that's why we've guided down to mid single-digit growth in the second half, averaging at a high single-digit for the year, but again, we would consider that kind of strong mid single-digit growth to be healthy and sustainable for the next number of years.","Ryan Michael Connors - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc. (Broker)","Great. And then a follow-up would be, one of the parts of the thesis I think for the company is that you've got a really strong innovation aspect in the company and the new product and development cycle is strong. Do you feel like part of what you're seeing in municipal is share gain? Because I think you're certainly posting growth rates that are in excess of what many of your peers are doing. Should we read that as share gain or is that just the project mix, or what's your view there?","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah. I think it's a combination of the two. I would say that there is some benefit of projects in there from quarter-to-quarter, but I do feel confident that we are gaining share in certain key markets in the wastewater side. I think that is attributable to two things. One, there have been some products that we've launched that are entering the market and are being extremely well received, and we'll have more to talk about on that front in future calls here.","But secondly, one of the benefits you have when you have a large share position like we do, especially on the submersible wastewater pump side of the market. By definition, as you see an increase in the level of repair and maintenance in kind of break and fix business, the person with the larger share does benefit disproportionally there in terms of growth, because it's our installed base that's being repaired and replaced. And these customers, as you well know, almost always replacing kind, and so we're certainly benefiting from that as well. That's also helped our mix because that's a higher margin business for us relative to the initial OEM install.","Ryan Michael Connors - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Great. Thanks for your time.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones with Stifel.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Good morning, everyone.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Good morning, Nathan.","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Hey, Nathan.","Phil De Sousa - Xylem, Inc.","Good morning, Nathan.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Patrick, I was hoping to get some more color on some of these growth outlooks for the rest of the year. With the 3% sequential decline in the third quarter, that kind of implies that it's kind of flat to maybe up 1% in the third quarter. And then you've got to see acceleration to something like 3% to 6% in the fourth quarter. We saw orders down 2% in the quarter, but you are sounding very confident that some of these projects are going to come through. Can you just talk about what visibility you have to that improvement in the fourth quarter to make that full year number?","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah. Yeah. Nathan, its Mark. I think part of this is just a function of the timing, part of it's natural ramp-up that we see in the fourth quarter on a regular basis, but some of this is timing and we've seen the delay from the first half of the year into the back half. And so some of this, we do expect to push out a little bit with probably more of that in Q4 than we'd expect to see in Q3.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","We also have the \u2013 we also have the visibility, Nathan, that you'll recall, that last year, we booked a $40 million project in India. That's shipping out this year well into the second half of the year as well. So that gives us confidence in the Q4 ramp as well as some other projects that we already have in the bag.","So, part of it is normal seasonality in terms of Q3 being down, because we do have obviously some of the holiday periods in Europe and timing around that. And that volume tends to then be re-shipped in Q4 or shipped out in Q4. So, there's nothing there that alarms us at this point in time based on what we see in the funnel and what we've got backlogged.","Phil De Sousa - Xylem, Inc.","And then, I'd just add...","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay.","Phil De Sousa - Xylem, Inc.","And I could cover this off, with you after the call, but you should end up with organic of about 2% here in the third quarter, and kind of 2%, 3% or so in the fourth quarter organically. We still expect FX headwinds over the course of the back half of the year and do still have some impact from acquisitions as well, but I can walk you through the details.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. The visibility on that India project kind of helps that. You talked about some of these public utility treatment projects pushing out of the first half into the second half. What visibility do you have to 3Q awards, 4Q awards, that kind of thing, and what do you view is the risk of that pushing out even a little further?","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","I think \u2013 we've got good visibility within particularly our new CRM tool, which is salesforce.com. So we've got a good tracking of the bidding pipeline and when these projects are likely to be awarded, what our confidence is in probability to win. We've got a whole rating system like many companies do on a project-by-project basis. So, we get very good visibility there.","I would say that when you look at our guidance for the second half of the year, the scenario by which we would deliver the lower end of that 2% to 3%, would be if, in fact, there were some projects that were shifted out of Q4 into Q1. Again, we don't \u2013 we aren't calling that, we don't see that, but we thought we'd be prudent to at least build that into the lower end of the top line growth range.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah. I guess, that stuff's kind of beyond your control anyway.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","And just on the industrial performance and expectation, is it possible for you to split that out between the heavy industrial, mining, oil and gas, and the lighter industrial, that should be doing better and be less cyclical?","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Sure. Yeah. So, Nathan, we got \u2013 of the 44% of industrial, I believe about 36% of that is what we call light industrial. So, it's not tied to production output, it's pharmaceutical plants, chemical, marine, food and beverage. It's not tied to commodities, it's separate. And that's been growing very steadily in that low single-digit rate, kind of tied to GDP.","And it's been that way year-after-year, so no real change there.","The 8% of our industrial which is tied to oil and gas and mining, 3% of that is oil and gas, 5% of that is mining. Oil and gas is basically going to be \u2013 it's going to be basically flattish in the second half of the year to maybe down low single-digits that were calling, depending upon the 2% to 3% range.","And then mining, we're calling to be down a further 10% in the second half of the year. Again, in the case of mining, it's not tied to output. As long as the mine is up and running, it needs to be kept dry, this really is a reflection of some continued shuttering and mothballing of mining sites around the world. And so, that we don't have a lot of good visibility, I'd say, beyond a quarter out, because obviously, we're not there with our customers and know exactly what their decision is site-by-site. So we think we're being prudent by calling it down a further 10%.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","So is it fair to say the weakness in first half industrial revenue is largely tied to the heavy industrial side, and the improvement in the second half is just easier comps from last year?","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","That is correct.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thanks very much.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Thank you.","Phil De Sousa - Xylem, Inc.","Thanks, David.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chip Moore with Canaccord.","Chip Moore - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Morning, thanks.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Good morning.","Phil De Sousa - Xylem, Inc.","Good morning, Chip.","Chip Moore - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","I wanted to stick with the logjam on the utility infrastructure side, just in terms of deployments. Is this a relatively small amount of larger projects, or is this more of a broad-based phenomenon? And then by geography, it's mostly in the U.S.?","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Yes, it is a U.S. phenomenon. And I would say it is concentrated around some of the larger projects, some of the larger more complex projects that are out there. I mean I wouldn't suggest it's not happening also in some of the smaller ones, but we see it more in a few of the larger ones.","Chip Moore - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Okay. Perfect. And then just switching up on commercial, another quarter where you're seeing some pretty good traction in Europe, maybe where you think you stand there in terms of new products and some of the sales efforts. Thanks.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Sure. Yeah. So we saw tremendous strength in Europe. Commercial in Europe was actually up 20% in the quarter. Now that is off of a smaller revenue base relative to our competitors. So, I'd say we're still a little bit off the radar screen and that's good. It's coming from new products to a large degree, which are really focused in on energy efficiency, which are taking good hold there. But it's also really been enabled by some targeted investments our team there has made and what we call our city teams, where they are working very well together across the entire portfolio of AWS, including our Water Infrastructure side as well, and really focusing in on select key cities there in Europe and really penetrating along with our channel partners, and have made some very, very good traction. Now those comps too will get a little tougher as we lap, but we see that ongoing penetration for some time now and to continue.","Chip Moore - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Thank you.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Walsh with Vertical Research Partners.","John Fred Walsh - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Hi, good morning.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Good morning.","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Hey, John.","Phil De Sousa - Xylem, Inc.","Good morning, John. Welcome to the call.","John Fred Walsh - Vertical Research Partners LLC","I wonder if we can get \u2013 yeah, wonder if we can get some color around what you're hearing out of Washington, kind of around there's been some movement here in the WRDA and then any kind of thoughts around public-private partnership funding or investment that President Obama was talking about late last year.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah, sure. So I'll give you what we know as of right now. As you pointed out, there is proposed legislation that has bipartisan support, and it does intend to work its way through Congress. Our intel suggests that obviously nothing will happen there until after the election. And certainly, one candidate has made comments on what her approach will be on this, and obviously we're waiting to hear what the other candidate has to say about this, but both have clearly indicated the importance of making these investments in infrastructure, and that's encouraging to us. So we are optimistic that something will move forward there, wouldn't obviously have meaningful impacts in the market until sometime next year. So, right now for us, it's a wait and see approach.","On the idea of P3 partnerships, we do see a growing level of discussion and interest in that concept. I'd say we are in the early stages of getting traction in the U.S. overall around understanding how P3s work, and convincing some of the public utilities around the U.S. that those can be very attractive ways to fund and finance these kind of projects. So, I'm optimistic, but these things always tend to take longer than we would like them to in terms of adoption.","John Fred Walsh - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Got you. And then, just as a follow-up, kind of any update on the M&A pipeline and kind of the opportunity you see, if anything, before the end of the year.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Sure. So, we obviously play in a highly fragmented industry, including some attractive adjacencies. So, as I mentioned at our Investor Day late last September, we continue to believe that M&A is going to be a significant accelerator of our growth over time, as the right opportunities come forward. We do have a strong and attractive pipeline, and we're very focused on opportunities that are higher up the technology curve, really focused on four key areas: smart water infrastructure, advanced treatment, industrial water services and then, of course, opportunities to defend our core businesses where necessary.","I'd say naturally we don't control the timing of the opportunities. It takes two to tango, and we strive to be disciplined in our evaluation and our pursuit of any potential deals, both from a financial and a strategic perspective. As you know, we did complete two small acquisitions fourth quarter of 2015 and first quarter of this year. And as we sit here today, we feel we have a strong balance sheet to support transactions of larger size and scale.","John Fred Walsh - Vertical Research Partners LLC","All right. Thank you very much.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Thank you.","Phil De Sousa - Xylem, Inc.","Thanks, John.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robert Barry with Susquehanna.","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Good morning.","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Just a couple questions on the margin front. It looks like you're now expecting a little less op margin expansion in the second half, 60 to 120 bps, I think it was 80 to 130. I just wanted to clarify, what was driving that?","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Yes. This is Mark. Yeah. But some of that on the high end is just related to some of the volume drop. But that is partially offset by what we see as continued improvement in ramping up our productivity initiatives.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah. And it's also some of the investments that we've got scheduled for the second half of the year. The timing in some of those investments, we're wrapping up investments in the Middle East expansion, as well as some of the investments that I talked about earlier in our European sales team on the city teams initiative that's driving that growth.","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","I see. Did some of it just shift a little more to the back half?","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","That's correct. And we'll continue to manage and rate the pace on that.","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","And then earlier, Patrick, I think you mentioned that post this first year, you see good case for healthy mid single-digit growth in Water Infrastructure as the cycle plays out. What is the right incremental margin that we should be assuming on that growth?","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah. I think as we look at it right now, I would say it's probably around the 35%-plus incrementals, and that's down a little bit from what we would historically see in that sector, but that's really a reflection of higher project mix. And so obviously, depending on how that plays out and what drives the revenue, it could be at 35%, it could be higher than 35% incremental margins.","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Right.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Historically, we've done close to 40%.","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Right. What's the mix dynamic with treatment leading the growth here and actually test looking like it's lagging a bit? Is that a mix headwind, that dynamic?","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah, I mean, it would be a mix headwind, although what I would say is that the relative size of the treatment and test businesses are much smaller and they're also very similar in size, almost identical in size, and so they really kind of negate each other to some extent in terms of depending upon on how they play out. But obviously, the larger piece of our Water Infrastructure revenue is being driven by the submersible wastewater pump business in Flygt, which is very attractive incremental margins. And that's also really driving a lot of our impressive growth right now in that sector.","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Great. Thank you.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano with Cowen.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. How are you doing?","Phil De Sousa - Xylem, Inc.","Hi, Joe.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Good morning, Joe.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","I just want to, keep harping on the same thing, but I just want to make sure I'm clear here. With the orders on muni in Water Infrastructure, so we're looking at a zero comp in 2Q 2015 for the whole segment. I just want to know what were orders for muni this quarter and year-to-date, and what were the comps? And maybe you can talk about that by geography.","Phil De Sousa - Xylem, Inc.","Joe, we probably wouldn't get into all that level of detail here. Certainly don't want to open up that Pandora's box and be expected to be commenting on it quarter in, quarter out. You'd appreciate that. I'd highlight if you recall last year, we got the pretty large Panama Canal expansion job in our dewatering business. That was about $6 million worth of order that we got in Q2. We ended up shipping it in Q2 and in Q3, or recognizing revenue.","We also got a pretty sizable public utility or municipal job in the Middle East, can't name the customer only because we're not allowed to. That was a $12 million job. It was a global project shopped, worked on by, well, a lot of different contractors and vendors. That was also a pretty unique order that we got that we delivered later in the year. And so those are really the drivers in the Water Infrastructure muni side of things.","We would have seen flat order growth last year in Q2 overall for Water Infrastructure, but these would have driven, if there was 4%, 5% orders growth in the municipal side of the Water Infrastructure order book last year, that would have been offset by the beginning of headwinds that we started to see in the oil and gas business, predominantly in our dewatering business in Q2 of last year. So that was offset there.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","And then if we look at where you're starting to see, or whether it's bidding or actual orders coming through, any particular geographies within the U.S.? Are we focused, are you're seeing more like reuse stuff in California-type areas or is it pretty balanced nationally?","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah, Joe. It's pretty broad-based. I would say, we're seeing it happening in a couple of sectors. Obviously, in those metropolitan areas that are experiencing very attractive increase in tax receipts, California being an example, Texas being an example. Florida is a very hot market for us right now. We're seeing strength in Northeast. But it's pretty broad-based in terms of the munis that are showing those signs of recovery.","And I would say in terms of applications, I mean we certainly are seeing a significant increase in both our wins, but also bidding pipeline on reuse projects in places like California and Texas and elsewhere. But those are not yet hitting our revenue or our order book in a big way just yet, but expect them to do so later this year into next year. That's specifically on the reuse side.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jim Giannakouros with Oppenheimer.","Jim Giannakouros - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hey, good morning.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Good morning.","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Good morning.","Jim Giannakouros - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","The margin \u2013 again on the margin, sorry, trying to understand that you see a little bit of upside here, I'm just trying to make sure I understand, is that more on the productivity initiatives, the greater traction there, or are you starting to tighten up at all discretionary items versus original plans?","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah. This is being driven by productivity.","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah. We are seeing increased rates of success in terms of our Lean projects and Patrick mentioned it early on, Global Procurement is doing an outstanding job. So, it is really the large productivity initiatives as opposed to a lot of discretionary spend.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, certainly, as I mentioned earlier as well, as we look at our rate of strategic investments, we'll continue to be responsible in monitoring and moderate that if we saw any weakness on the top line. So we've got good line of sight to that from a contingency standpoint, but what we're committing to you right now is productivity gains upside.","Jim Giannakouros - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thanks. And on the Middle East, you guys sounded quite bullish. One other company I listened to this morning had incremental caution in the region, just given oil down versus it's recent highs, that's impacting their expectations, again, just versus their outlook coming into calendar 2Q.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Yes.","Jim Giannakouros - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","What exactly are you seeing there and any specifics will be helpful. Sorry, if I did miss them. Thanks.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","No, that's fine. That's fine. So, we were up 10% in the Middle East in Q2. And our full year outlook is to be in the mid single-digit. There is some project timing in there and movement around. So, we're calling mid single-digit for the full year. Couple things that are driving that for us. We've had some really \u2013 so first of all, we're serving the public utility market and the commercial building sector. And so, we're a little bit immune from the commodity prices of oil and gas. The Middle East is building out basic rudimentary wastewater infrastructure at this point in time, and we continue to see healthy commercial building growth there as well.","And then, also the fact that we are completing our grand opening of our new manufacturing facility, dedicated sales people on the street, and localization of R&D, they're later this year. And so, we don't have a lot of that baked in from a growth standpoint, because it's not done yet, but that gives us opportunity here to take share in the market.","Jim Giannakouros - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","That's helpful. Thank you.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Okay.","Operator","There appear to be no further questions at this time.

McClain","Thank you, Phil. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. We appreciate your interest in Xylem. I'll begin the call by providing you an update of our overall financial results for second quarter; spend a few minutes updating on the progress we've made on our strategic objective; and provide my perspective on our first half revenue performance and our full year outlook. I will also discuss the actions we're taking to address the continued economic uncertainty and to position us future growth. I'll then hand it over to Mike to walk through the details of our quarterly performance on our full year guidance.","Today, we're reporting second quarter revenue of $966 million, reflecting growth of 4% on a constant currency basis. Organic growth was 1%, with acquisitions adding another 3%. While overall revenue were below our expectations for the quarter, our performance was on top of strong growth last year and in a more challenging environment. In Europe, where overall economic growth is negative, our revenues on a constant currency basis, were down a modest 1%. And our continued focus an attractive acquisitions is helping us to drive top line growth. YSI added $32 million in revenue in the quarter and continued to outperform our expectations.","On a year-over-year basis, YSI is up approximately 11%. We received orders of $970 million, up 2% in constant currency, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.0. During the quarter, we won some key public utility and industrial transport and treatment projects spread across the U.S., Europe and emerging markets, which will ship in 2013.","Let me highlight that in the second quarter, we registered our highest order rate in treatment projects since the first quarter 2011. This is a positive sign for next year and we're encouraged by the number of projects still in the funnel. As I mentioned last quarter, good activity for capital projects has continued to increase, but release of orders continued to be slower than anticipated.","A key focus for us has been margin expansion. Despite the lower demand, we continue to reach higher levels of profitability. This performance demonstrates the results of years of disciplined execution, a focused growth strategy and processes put in place to drive price and reduce operating costs. We will cover these details later on the call, but for now, I'd simply note that for the quarter, gross margin was 39.6%, up 60 basis points versus last year and fast approaching the long-term target we set out at our Investor Day.","Operating margin was 14.8%, up 100 basis points, excluding the impact of recurring standalone costs. Earnings per share were $0.49, up 4% on a comparable or normalized year-over-year basis. Core operations and YSI performance drove earnings up 13%, giving us confidence that we can continue to deliver fundamental growth in a tough environment. The negative impact of foreign exchange knocked 9 points off that growth rate, bringing it down to the 4% you see on the slide. We've generated year-to-date free cash flow of $86 million, which represents 54% conversion of net income and is consistent with our seasonal performance.","Please turn to Slide 4. As we laid out in our October Investor Day, we have 3 key focus areas in 2012: advancing our strategic position, deploying innovative new product applications and services, and continued strong execution. We continue to make good progress in advancing these priorities, and this slide highlights just a few of these accomplishments. On July 13, we announced another important step in advancing our strategic position with our first Xylem acquisition, MJK Automation. MJK's strong position in the Scandinavian market and their flow in level-centric technology and expertise, enhances our analytical instrumentation platform and provides energy-saving measurement and control equipment. MJK is another example of a perfect bolt-on for our Water Infrastructure segment, as it allows us to expand our wastewater and surface water applications, and bring together our transport and test capability.","For those familiar with MJK's products, their products are used in water, wastewater, environmental and irrigation applications, where critical measurements are required in pipe, wells, open channels and canals. Their monitoring control technologies are well suited for field, online and lift station application; all areas where Xylem has a strong presence and can now offer even more value to our current and new customers. MJK is the fifth acquisition we've closed in our analytical instrumentation platform.","And much like YSI and the others, they bring a strong local market presence, and this provides the ability to sell our other products to their customers and expand its product sales globally through the rest of Xylem. During the quarter, we also announced several plans to continue to expand our emerging market presence, including our plans to grow our dewatering platform in the attractive markets of Brazil. We will start by strengthening our rental offering in 3 key locations before launching new services at additional locations across Brazil in 2013 and '14. We're also making great progress in deploying innovative new product applications and services to address global water challenges. I already mentioned the strong treatment orders in the second quarter. Here, we're deploying our technologies into industrial adjacency and new application solution.","Let me highlight that just yesterday, we received an order for a small package turnkey water treatment plant in New South Wales, Australia. We're excited because it's the first order that includes our ZeeWeed membrane system through our expanded partnership with GE. We expect this to be the first of many orders to come from a growing pipeline of projects being developed by our global sales team. A new product launch out of our analytics business, EXO, is the next generation of multiparameter field water quality instrument. The largest order we received since the launching in June, was from the New York City Department of Environmental Protection. The Department is using the equipment to monitor the Hudson and East Rivers for water quality parameters, such as oxygen and pH.","This data is used to confirm that the rivers are safe for recreation and public use. In addition to supplying the instrumentation, Xylem is also providing training, installation and field support services to ensure the department is receiving the highest data quality. Another example is how we're working with the public utilities to address one of their key challenges: reducing their energy cost. As part of our total care offering, we've been performing energy audits as a new service for our public utilities customers at their site, providing extremely valuable data in consultation regarding the efficiency level of their operation.","By highlighting areas of improvement and having the energy-efficient solutions, we can help them significantly reduce operating costs and put ourselves in position to win additional business. Taking this a bit further, energy represents the highest cost for a wastewater treatment plant and research shows that the aeration process accounts for up to 60% of that total energy consumption. Just a few weeks ago, at the Singapore International Water Week, we shared the results of our study performed at a full-scale wastewater treatment plant.","The study concluded that Xylem's energy-efficient secondary treatment solutions can help customers reduce energy costs up to 65% through an optimized aeration system. Just one example of exciting opportunities in front of us that leverages our product breadth and our application's depth. The third area of focus is strong execution. We continue our journey to increase our presence in emerging markets. We had an exceptional quarter, growing at 22% on constant currency basis, with positive contributions from all emerging markets. We are also working a number of areas to ensure we achieve the growth and margin potential our businesses are capable of delivering, independent of market conditions.","As you can see, we're making progress against our key priorities, as evidenced by our growth and operating margin expansion. The processes and disciplines that we've implemented around our pricing, through a customer excellence program, continues to pay off. We are delivering strong price realization in our results, approximately 1.7% over the first half of this year. And we continue to gain momentum and improved profitability with our lean factory and global sourcing initiatives, as well as driving product rationalization. These activities are all key in delivering more value to customers and getting the right cost structure for the future.","So now turn to Slide 5. Let me provide some perspective on our first half revenue performance by end market and by region. This will help frame for you how we're looking at things, heading into the second half of the year. First, in industrial, our largest end-market segment, we saw mid single-digit organic growth in the first half. On a sequential basis, industrial grew in the second quarter but not at the rate we had anticipated. North America was generally in line with our expectations of mid single-digit growth, however, weakening macroeconomic conditions unfavorably impacted Europe.","We continue to see and expect resiliency out of our public utility markets with flat year-over-year performance, despite lower revenues due to delayed capital projects in 2011. I'll remind you that we had a strong second quarter last year from our dewatering rental services, which benefited from the heavy snowfall, a cold winter wet season and severe flooding conditions in the U.S. and Australia. So stepping back and considering the tough compare, I think of this as good performance given the budgetary pressures public utilities face in this environment. This illustrates the mission-critical nature of the products and expertise we provide our customers, and the valued relationship we've built over many years of service.","As I've mentioned, we've had some good progress in our projects business with our key wins in second quarter. Unfortunately, the delay in these order bookings has pushed revenue recognition into 2013. Our commercial business services business came through with low single-digit growth in the first half, certainly better than the flat markets in which we operate, but lower than our expectations. During the first quarter, we saw healthy growth, particularly in the U.S. and Asia Pac region. The performance moderated in the second quarter and Europe was down mid single-digits. Residential was down, low single-digits for the first half. The U.S. posted strong growth in the mid single-digits, following a tough first quarter, which was unfavorably impacted by a warm winter.","Europe, on the other hand, continued to struggle. While sequential revenues were up for the second quarter, year-over-year performance was down mid single-digits. Touching on ag, we continue to see robust business in the U.S. given the drought conditions; however, it's on top of already a very solid year in 2011. Europe was challenged, as you would expect. On a regional basis, we've laid out for you on this slide all the major drivers. I'll just highlight a few. The U.S. saw the benefits of the industrial and residential growth, partly offset by the drought conditions and strong compares with the prior year in dewatering. I will highlight that industrial dewatering applications continue to be robust in the first half.","Europe was down across most end markets, with the exception being public utilities where we were flat year-over-year. Emerging markets continued to drive top line growth and we saw contributions across all regions during the first half. We expect continued strength throughout the balance of the year.","Now turn to Slide 6. Exiting the second quarter, it is clear we are faced with a weaker economic environment in Europe than originally anticipated and some moderation in the U.S. growth. We expect significant foreign exchange headwinds to continue. Despite volume challenges, we are confident that our performance in delivering solid productivity and strong execution will continue through the second half and beyond. Although we will pay some investments, our disciplined approach is allowing us to continue to invest in our business, while expanding operating margin and advancing our strategic position. Simply put, our goal is to maintain our 2012 operating margin rate as previously guided, despite the lower projected revenues of approximately $150 million.","So we are updating our full year guidance and now, expect our full year EPS to be within the range of $1.72 to $1.82 per share, compared to previous guidance of $1.80 to $1.95. This reduction reflects current macroeconomic conditions and end market dynamics, updated exchange rates, and continued productivity across all businesses. Excluded from our guidance are restructuring realignment costs estimated to be in the range of $15 million to $20 million in the second half of 2012. We are taking aggressive cost actions targeted at reducing operating costs across our European operations, and to align our Xylem business for flexibility given the lower level of demand, while strategically positioning the business for growth in the geographic regions critically important to us. These actions are similar to steps we took in 2008 to reposition our cost base and as a result, we will have a more competitive business structure and will allow us to continue to lead within the global water industry.","Now let me turn the call over to our CFO, Mike Speetzen, to walk through the detailed results. Mike?","Michael T. Speetzen","Thanks, Gretchen. Please go to Slide 7. In the second quarter, Xylem revenues were $966 million, reflecting 4% growth on a constant currency basis. Organic revenue growth contributed 1 point to the total and acquisitions added another 3 points of growth. Foreign exchange was a headwind of 5 points. Organic growth was driven by strength in the industrial and public utility end markets, where we continue to see growth opportunities. The U.S. continued to show modest growth and emerging markets were strong, up 22% on a constant currency basis. Europe continued to present challenges, given the worsening economic environment.","YSI had a strong quarter, adding 3 percentage points to our top line. I think it's also important to note that YSI, once again, had double-digit organic growth and is not included in our organic growth performance articulated earlier. Organic order rates were down 1% and book-to-bill was 1. Orders were impacted by sluggish demand from Europe, coupled with tough compares to prior year treatment orders. Operating income, adjusted for onetime separation costs, increased 1% in the second quarter and was up 7% when adjusted for incremental standalone ramp-up costs incurred in Q2 of 2012. Despite lower than expected organic revenue, second quarter operating margins came in at 14.8%, up 100 basis points, excluding separation costs and the impact of standalone ramp-up costs. Gross margin was 39.6% for the second quarter, up 60 basis points versus the prior year, as price, cost improvements in YSI, more than offset inflation and unfavorable mix.","By driving gross margin performance, we're able to continue to invest in our business, while expanding operating margins. Investments in the second quarter impacted operating margin by 30 basis points. The impact of foreign exchange translation and transaction was neutral with operating margin. As the chart reflects, on an operating basis, we drove incremental margins of 36%, excluding standalone costs and foreign exchange. I would add that this 36% incremental margin was achieved on modest organic volume growth and reflects additional investments to further our strategic execution. These additional investments were a 6-point drag on our incremental margin.","Now turn to Slide 8. This slide shows our EPS walk for the second quarter. This is a transition year for Xylem and as such, there are a lot of moving parts. So I want to spend some time this morning, as we did on the last call, describing the components of our performance. As the middle section of the chart depicts, we have adjusted both 2011 and 2012 EPS to a normalized basis to provide a clear picture of how we performed operationally versus last year. The walk starts with GAAP EPS for 2011 and ends with GAAP EPS for 2012. In between, we make 2 sets of adjustments. For the second quarter, on the left side of the chart, we increased 2011 GAAP EPS of $0.39 by $0.08, to show how 2011 would have looked had Xylem been a standalone company with interest expense on debt and required independent company costs. We have also adjusted the number to exclude the 2011 impact of onetime separation costs and special tax items.","For the second quarter of 2012, on the right-hand side of the chart, we adjust GAAP EPS of $0.48 by adding back the net negative impact of 2012 onetime separation costs and special tax items. Making these adjustments puts both second quarters on a comparable, normalized basis to allow for a better view of operational performance. This analysis shows that normalized EPS increased 4% or $0.02. I'd also highlight that excluding the impact of foreign exchange translation, our core operations plus YSI, less the tax rate differential drove a 13% increase in EPS.","Now let me provide more details on each of our reporting segments. Please turn to Slide 9. This slide shows the results of our Water Infrastructure segment. For the second quarter, this segment reported revenue of $609 million, up 7% over prior year on a constant currency basis and up 2% organically. The YSI acquisition contributed 5 points to the top line growth and foreign exchange was a 6-point headwind. Transport grew 6% for the quarter, driven by the global industrial market and strong emerging market growth. A significant portion of transport is driven by the public utility market and here, we continue to benefit from the stability that comes from a large install base and growing tariffs. Public utilities were up mid single-digits in Q2 and industrial continued to demonstrate strength. Drought conditions in the U.S. and Australia negatively impacted our dewatering rental business.","Treatment declined, driven by the softening we saw in developed market project orders in 2011. As a reminder, treatment orders for large projects slowed after the first quarter of 2011, and given the longer lead times associated with these projects, we are seeing the impact in our year-over-year revenue performance. We're encouraged by the win rate we've seen in the second quarter for treatment projects. Conditions appear to be improving, and we anticipate order growth to continue in the second half. Test revenues were up significantly, driven by the inclusion of the YSI business acquired in Q3 of 2011. Excluding YSI, the test application was down year-over-year, coming up a strong 2011 performance, and reflecting weakness in Europe.","Second quarter operating margins came in at 16.1%, up 20 basis points from 2011, excluding the impact of standalone costs. YSI contributed 50 basis points to the segment margin, highlighting the strong business that we have added to the portfolio. In addition, our operational and customer excellence initiatives are more than offsetting the impacts of inflation and have provided flexibility to continue to invest in the business while expanding margins. Our margins were, however, negatively impacted by the previously mentioned lower rental volume.","Let me now turn to Slide #10 and talk through our Applied Water segment. Applied Water second quarter revenue was flat on a constant currency basis. Building services was down 2%. Commercial building services were down low to mid single-digits, reflecting slow institutional demand for retrofits. Residential building services were down low single-digits. U.S. performance was up mid single-digits, more than offset by challenging economic conditions in Europe and continued instability in the Middle East region. Industrial water was up 4%, driven by favorable general industrial market conditions and strength in our food and beverage applications. And lastly, irrigation was down 4% against a difficult compare versus the second quarter of 2011. U.S. strength, reflecting strong demand given the current weather conditions, was more than offset by weakness in other regions.","Second quarter operating margin came in at 14.4%, up 140 basis points from 2011, excluding standalone costs. Price and productivity actions more than offset the impact of inflation and enabled continued investment in the segment. Margins continue to improve sequentially, as we execute on our cost reduction initiatives.","Now let me turn to Slide 11 and review our financial position. Slide 11 reflects the key elements of our balance sheet and capital structure. We generated $86 million in free cash flow year-to-date, a conversion on adjusted net income of 54%, reflecting typical seasonality for our business. Our cash flow is down from Q2 of 2011, as anticipated, driven primarily by incremental interest payments of $26 million, related to the debt put in place as a result of the spinoff from ITT. In addition, we had incremental U.S. federal and state tax payments in 2012. As a reminder, the 2011 figures are a result of the carve-out financials provided in the Form-10 and reflected an allocated portion of U.S. tax payments that were deemed a Xylem obligation for the purposes of the Form-10 statement.","Note that adjusting for these tax payments would bring the 2011 conversion in line with our current year performance in normal seasonal trend. And lastly, we incurred additional cash outlays associated with costs operating as a standalone company. As you can see from the slide, we also improved our working capital as a percent of revenue year-over-year. As it relates to our capital structure, we ended Q2 in a strong position. Our available cash-on-hand was $358 million, up from the first quarter of 2012. We have a solid net debt to net capital ratio of 30% and our credit metrics are in line with expectations and our credit ratings. Our commercial paper and revolving credit facilities remain in place and continue to be unutilized.","Now let me transition to Slide 13 and talk through our guidance for 2012. As Gretchen mentioned at the beginning of the call, we are revising our guidance down to reflect the impact of the current and anticipated economic environment. Let me spend a few minutes walking through our assumptions and revise guidance. Slide 13 reflects our revised view of the various end markets we serve. As a reminder, we discussed our original end market projections on February 28. We view the industrial end market performing in the low to mid single-digits for the full year versus a previous assumption of mid single-digits. As Gretchen highlighted, industrial was strong in the first half, but we saw moderating growth in Q2. We're assuming a slowing in this end market, predicated on the current European market conditions, as well as a slowing market in the U.S. The revised outlook still assumes moderate sequential growth in the second half.","The public utility end market was previously projected to grow low single-digits. We are now revising this to flat to low single-digits, based on the delay in project order bookings. This revised outlook still reflects modest second half sequential growth. The commercial end market is now projected to grow low single-digits versus low to mid single-digits, given the lack of improvement in the underlying market. We see this end market as flat to up slightly in the second half, driven primarily by energy-efficient solutions.","Lastly, we see the residential and agriculture end markets performing in line with our prior guidance. Bottom line is that a weaker Europe, economic environment, and some level of moderating U.S. conditions are driving our revised revenue outlook. Our revised guidance assumes sequential organic growth in the second half. On a year-over-year basis, our guidance assumes a second half organic growth of over 2%, based on the end-market dynamics in our seasonal profile.","Turn to Slide 14 for a roll-forward of our guidance. This chart illustrates the walk from our previous guidance midpoint, for revenue and EPS, to our revised guidance. Our previous guidance was for $3.95 billion in revenue and EPS of $1.87. Foreign exchange has become a substantial headwind, driven primarily by the continued weakening of the euro to the dollar. Our guidance assumes $1.22 exchange rate for the balance of the year versus the $1.31 assumed in our previous guidance. The weakness experienced in the first half, coupled with the projected weaker euro in the second half, impacts revenue by $50 million and has a $0.03 negative impact to EPS. The majority of this impacts the second half of the year.","We recently announced the acquisition of MJK Automation. This acquisition will add approximately $6 million in revenue and will be $0.01 dilutive, as acquisition costs and purchase accounting impact the first 6 months of ownership. We expect that the acquisition will be accretive in 2013.","Lastly, the previous communicated end market weakness will impact the top line by approximately $105 million. The effect of the loss margin on this revenue decline is approximately a $0.16 headwind to EPS, partially offset by approximately $0.10 of cost actions to mitigate the loss margin impact. These net to a $0.06 impact to EPS. Relative to previous guidance, our current outlook reflects a 3-point reduction on organic revenue, partially offset by cost-saving initiatives, which nets to a 3% decrease in EPS, as illustrated on this slide.","Turn to Slide 15 for more details on the revised guidance. This slide provides all the relevant details for our revised guidance range. I'd like to highlight a few key points. We're now projecting a full year organic revenue growth of 1% to 3% versus a prior 4% to 6%. From a sequential perspective, we expect approximately 45% of Water Infrastructure's second half revenue to come in the third quarter, and we view Applied Water to be essentially evenly split between the 2 quarters. We expect full year segment margin in the range of 14.2% to 14.6%, up 20 to 60 basis points over the prior year.","We're holding our operating margin range to our previous guidance, flat to up 60 basis points over the prior year, despite slow organic growth and incremental standalone costs. Excluding standalone costs, this represents a 90 basis-point improvement year-over-year. Our revised EPS guidance range is now $1.72 to $1.82 with a midpoint of $1.77. As Gretchen mentioned earlier, we've taken initial steps to address the softening European economic environment, and have initiated several restructuring realignment actions. We anticipate these charges in 2012 to be between $15 million and $20 million. These actions will be substantially completed in 2012 with approximately $2 million of additional costs being incurred in 2013. The run rate savings will be approximately $10 million beginning in 2013. We anticipate less than $1 million in savings in 2012.","I'd also add, we are tracking to our onetime separation cost of $15 million to $20 million. Please note that our EPS guidance does not include any impact from restructuring and realignment costs, onetime separation costs, and unannounced acquisitions and related costs. Let me now turn the call back over to Gretchen to wrap up.","Gretchen W. McClain","Thanks, Mike. Let's turn to Slide 16. There's no question, today's economic conditions are volatile, but we have faced similar conditions in the past and we have successfully managed through them with strong focus and attention to the many levers that we control in our business. In 2009, our business declined 9% on an organic basis. Despite the external factors, we were able to hold our operating margins flat year-over-year. Our demonstrated performance and our continued margin expansion are the result of several key drivers and management decisions. These include a portfolio of businesses that have demonstrated resiliency during difficult times, thanks to the large install base of leading products and critical customer applications and strong customer relationships.","A disciplined management approach, including proactive actions beginning in 2008 at the onset of the decline, and again this year, taking appropriate steps to position us in the future in the face of continued economic uncertainty. In addition, we are aggressively managing our costs through our continued customer and operational excellence initiatives. This has enabled us to continue to invest in our business, to capture growth as markets rebound and to gain market share. And our acquisition strategy has led to higher than average profitability, while expanding our market reach.","As the slide illustrates, based on our midpoint guidance, we expect and have expanded operating margin by 290 basis points since 2008. Collectively, through the actions we control, we have shaped the company into what it is today, and we are laying the path for Xylem's future, a better positioned leader in the global water industry. Now turn to Slide 17.","In summary, we had strong second quarter operating performance. Our business's performance illustrates the stability of our portfolio in the face of challenging global economics, backed by disciplined execution. However, we're not immune to the environment and we expect some headwinds during the second half of the year, particularly in Europe. We are addressing the challenge head-on, taking actions and making strategic investments today that will drive future growth. And of course, our strong cash flow generation and financial position provides the flexibility to continue to execute our long-term strategy.","With that, we'll be happy to take your questions. Brandi?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Ryan Connors with Janney Montgomery Scott.","Ryan M. Connors - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","I'm just interested in exploring, for a minute, this issue of -- that you mentioned several times, bid activity continuing to increase while release of orders among your customers are disappointing. Can you just expand on that a bit for us? Your remarks sort of implied that you think order release will ultimately follow. So I'd be interested in your perspective on whether you've seen this kind of dynamic in the past, and if so, how that ultimately played out?","Gretchen W. McClain","Ryan, I'd look at it first from a broad perspective. I mean, we're seeing large issues around the water industry and public utilities, and then having to pull back to be able to support their operating and maintenance activities. And so a lot of activities around capital expenditures have been deferred or put off. Though the activities are being planned, so when they get the additional funding, they're able to let them go. So this last fall -- I mean, we didn't see much activity. All through last year, our project activity was quite low. And so the stacking of projects in the queue has continued to come forward. And we've been doing a lot of activity around first quarter and second quarter in bidding. They just have not been released as quickly. We believe, given the tariffs that continue to increase with the public utilities, that they will be released as we go forward. And the other area that we've been focused on is trying to the help the public utilities bring their operating costs down, so they can free up money for capital expenditures.","Ryan M. Connors - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then to your knowledge, is there any correlation with project release around fiscal budget resets? I mean, most of your customers, I assume, are either June or September fiscal year, so as those new budgets get set, is that when we start to see some of that money starting to flow?","Gretchen W. McClain","It varies because if you look at U.S., you'll see the June time frame. It's on around, obviously, the government-type funding. But you also have many of them that are on a year-over-year, especially when you look globally. So it does flow differently throughout the year. We are planning on treatment in our activity, continuing to pick up in the second half from an orders perspective, but given the length of the projects, you'll typically see the revenue come in to 2013.","Ryan M. Connors - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. That's helpful. And then just one last, when you mentioned that you took 170 basis points in price in the first half, obviously, that's a very impressive figure in this kind of environment, and I know you focus more on the value-added, technology-driven-type product lines, but do you feel like you're sacrificing share anywhere in the portfolio as a result of your stance on price in this kind of a tough environment?","Gretchen W. McClain","Yes, it's a great question. It's something that we try and stay very close to. We feel really good about our strategic position in the market. We're still having good growth, in general, when you strip away a couple of the activities that I talked about, on top of the very great growth in 2011. So we have individual market and regional, and really project strategies that we deploy in a framework of an overall portfolio strategy. So I feel good about where we are. We've put a good process in place, that we review our wins and our losses, and then we make the appropriate adjustments as required. So we feel good that we're driving the right thing and, of course, we're driving profitable growth as we continue in the future.","Michael T. Speetzen","Ryan, the only other thing I would add is, what you're seeing come through on the first half, is also the product of the price actions that were taken in the second half of last year, primarily in our Applied Water segment, where we saw a pretty significant inflation. And obviously, that will moderate a bit because the compares become a little bit more difficult in the second half. But that also plays into it, in terms of similar dynamics that we saw play out across the broader market.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Deane Dray with Citi Research.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I wanted to first start with Mike. If you could just give us an update about the expectation of separation costs, how those may taper off during the course of the year? What are the big components of that? Maybe we can we start there, please.","Michael T. Speetzen","Yes, so, let's talk onetime separation cost. So we had indicated that we would have $15 million to $20 million. We've incurred about $10 million through the first half. As we've indicated in the past, we see that being -- tapering off, really, in the fourth quarter. So I would look at Q1, 2 and 3 being kind of at that same level. And it's really -- as we finalize legal aspects, as well as any of the branding signage of the company and those types of activities, and there is some IT work that has to go into that, we've got a pretty disciplined process around that, not a lot of concerns relative to the range that we've put out there on that particular bucket. From a standalone cost perspective, we've indicated $25 million to $30 million. We're holding to that range. We've obviously, as you see in our results, did take some actions relative to our corporate cost structure in the second quarter, in light of the current economic environment. But we don't see that impacting the incremental standalone costs. As I've indicated in the past, there's a good chunk of these costs that really relate to IT infrastructure that we had to put in place, and some of the incremental costs that were added, not only at corporate but also within our business segments. Again, we have a good line of sight to that and we feel pretty comfortable that we'll be right in the range on those.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Great. That's really helpful. And I should have just prefaced my comments with the fact that these slides that you're providing, and the bridge and the individual business line commentary is really helpful. And the next question is, to go into the businesses with the impact of the drought. Obviously, from the dewatering side, there are some positives I would expect. You mentioned ag and some of the irrigation, but also, is there much of an impact to weigh on the well business? Anytime you've got drought and water tables get lower, there's problems with wells. Anytime you open up a well, you usually put a new pump into it. So just give us a -- some of the puts and takes, with that or drought-related on your businesses?","Gretchen W. McClain","Sure, Deane. Just in terms of the other businesses that you see upside, as we mentioned, agriculture is obviously an area when we look at our TTL business with vertical turbines, and so forth. Great business during a time of the drought, helping the farmers continue to grow. If I look at U.S., North America, we're up 5% in our residential market. So we feel good about where we are. You also have, as you mentioned, the well pumps. They're working harder. You see water levels drop and so you have the opportunity for replacement. So we feel good, again, where we are with that position and continue to grow that. Coming back to your dewatering question, the one thing I would just bring up is -- yes, it was impacted by the drought, but our dewatering model in itself supports many other end markets. So we'll continue to help in mining. We're still helping with public utility bypass and other areas, still a very robust business and a great opportunity where you have similar equipment that can be used in many different applications.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Great. And just last question for me, and it's a related question to the MJK acquisition. The idea that there's still a lot of fragmentation to the analytics market, and maybe you can give us a sense of a road map of how you'd like to build out this segment. Just in terms of priorities, is it geography? Is it adding more technology? Is it broadening the line of contaminants that you want to test for? Or maybe it's all of the above. Just kind of the roadmap for the build-out and maybe a sense of the pipeline today.","Gretchen W. McClain","Yes. Deane, I'd say, you laid it out very nicely, as those are all the areas that we're looking at. In terms of our healthy backlog of candidates, we feel like we've got a healthy deal pipeline and we're working that very aggressively. The bolt-on strategy has worked for us and we think that's a nice way to continue to expand, as well as to invest back into the organic platform that we're continuing to build. So geographic, technology, and clearly, regional areas are going to help us or channel into the market, will be areas that we continue to expand in.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Matt Summerville with KeyBanc.","Matt J. Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions. First, I apologize if you gave this. But what was the EPS hit from FX in the second quarter? And what is the expectation for the full year, relative to your prior estimate?","Michael T. Speetzen","Yes, so the foreign exchange impact in the second quarter was $0.04, and then we're talking, relative to the guidance range, $0.03 year-over-year in terms of the change in guidance and that's on $50 million of revenue. And Matt, really, where that's coming from is -- although we've seen some of the currencies that make up our basket come down, the biggest impact has been in the euro. It's moved down about 7%. We had given previous guidance at $1.31. It's now at $1.22. If you think back to some of the framework we've put in place in the past, where we talked about a 10% move in the euro, yields about 3% to 4% move in the top line, you can ratio that down and it gets you pretty close to the movement you're seeing right now.","Matt J. Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then can you -- is there a way to quantify the magnitude of push out you've seen on the projects side of the business into 2013?","Gretchen W. McClain","I'm trying to help you. Clearly, on the treatment area, we've seen a significant push into next year. We're anticipating our treatment business to be down for the rest of the year, continuing to get orders and continuing to get book-to-bill shipping. But we will see a large portion of our treatment business falling into next year.","Michael T. Speetzen","Yes, I mean, Matt, when you think about the guidance we initially gave for public utilities, we had guided that they would be in the low to single -- low single-digits. We're now saying flat to low. That change in guidance is being primarily driven by the fact that the anticipated order bookings that we were planning for, coming out of last year, didn't materialize and so that push has essentially moved that range from kind of low single-digits to that flat to low.","Gretchen W. McClain","And then just one more point, Matt, in terms of public utility treatment, we're also trying to take, as I mentioned, our treatment technology into industrial. And we've seen some very nice orders and wins there. Again, some will be pushed into 2013. There'll be some that obviously play into 2012. But given the length of time, typically a 2013-type revenue recognition.","Matt J. Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","All other variables held constant, what is your view on Xylem's raw material input costs in the second half of the year versus what you experienced in the first half?","Michael T. Speetzen","Yes, we -- at this point, we're planning to be essentially flat, meaning about 3% inflation in the second half. And at this point, we felt it was better to plan for a higher level of inflation, both in our cost actions, as well as our cost structure. And if that ends up playing to the benefit, then we'll obviously have that as an opportunity. The thing that I'd also note is, our susceptibility to the current period fluctuations is -- I won't say that we're not, but it's minimized by the fact that we tend to put ourselves on long-term supply agreements, which essentially dampens some of that volatility. Our direct exposure to commodities is relatively small. And so some of that is going to be taken out of the equation. But we've always planned conservatively, and we'll look for any opportunities to improve that as we can.","Operator","Our next question is coming from David Rose with Wedbush Securities.","David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Just very real quick ones. The -- if you could, can you reconcile the difference between the slides showing emerging market growth in constant currency for the second quarter at 20% and for the first half at 11%? Is the implication that it accelerated in Q2 significantly?","Gretchen W. McClain","So our emerging market -- so let me address that. Our emerging market growth, what we've seen, nice growth in the first half and we continue to see that sequentially growing as we go through the second half the year.","David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Maybe I can back up. Gretchen, on Page 5 you show organic growth versus prior year of 11%, and on Page 4, it shows emerging market growth at 22% both in constant currency. So it implies a meaningful step-up in the second quarter versus the first quarter.","Michael T. Speetzen","Yes, that's right, it's true. We had about 17% growth in the second quarter in our emerging markets.","Gretchen W. McClain","So we've got a couple of big projects that we've won in India and a few others that ship in the second half of the year. And we've had nice order-taking and good business execution in our emerging market's strategy. Think about this, we announced that we positioned ourselves in Russia. Our organization is up and running. We've got an opportunity to continue to grow there. We've put a very focused strategy around our emerging market activity. And so, as we are expecting sequential growth from first half to the second half, we believe we've got good line of sight from some of our projects that we'll ship, as well as what we need to do and execute in our end markets.","David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then, I guess, this could sound like a pricing question, you discussed -- we had all discussed, at one point in time, a pricing slop. How much of the pricing slop do you think you still have in terms of your powder for the second half? I think I recall there was, maybe, a 200 basis-point movement, pricing slop. You took advantage of some of that in the second quarter. How much is left in the back half?","Gretchen W. McClain","Yes, so when you think about it, we talked about 170 basis points for the first half. I'll still go back to what we have said our goal is, 1 to 2 points a year. And we're driving that aggressively. You're going to see a couple of dynamics in the second half of the year. One, we drove very aggressive pricing last fall, so you're going to have some tougher compares to where we were at the first half. And we've been at it for a while. So the team is getting very disciplined about their approach. The other area is, it is a tougher market. So you're going to have market pressures in the second half and so we've accounted for that as we look through the second half of the year.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Chip Moore with Canaccord.","Chip Moore - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","I was wondering if you take us back to the financial crisis in '08, kind of what you saw in Europe then and how that compares to some of the trends you're seeing now?","Gretchen W. McClain","So in 2008, when the onset -- you saw, the primary focus was in the U.S. at that point in time. Europe came much later, I would say, at the end of 2009. I would say, where we're seeing the issues in Europe -- and I think it's important to really focus where Europe is. It's been driven primarily by southern part of Europe. We're still seeing strength substantially in the Nordic regions. We're seeing strength in the U.K. We're still holding our own in Germany. So it really has been more of a Southern Europe exposure. Now, coming through the second quarter, we did see some volatility across Europe, which had us concerned and, hence, the reason why we have re-forecasted our forecast for the rest of the year. But it's not the same dynamics as what we saw in the 2009 timeframe. But there is a lot of volatility, and we want to be prepared appropriately, and that's why we're taking aggressive steps.","Michael T. Speetzen","Yes, Chip. I think the way I would think about it is, in 2008 to 2009, we were coming off some market highs, specifically around commercial and the CapEx side of public utilities. And since then, those markets really have not had a significant improvement. We've seen gains in areas like retrofits and specific projects, and so what we're really seeing is more of a moderating environment, which I think is consistent with how we've articulated it versus a dramatic falloff in terms of what we saw back in that '08, '09 time period.","Gretchen W. McClain","I guess I'd add one more thing. As you know, the public utility business has been stable and what we're seeing is, you saw industrial, you saw ag, you saw the rest of the industry going up. You're seeing that now start to slow back down but, still, stability in the public utilities across the board with the exception of Southern Europe.","Chip Moore - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","And maybe just one follow-up. In terms of the reduction in revenue, the $105 million market-related, can you give us a sense of how much of that is European-related?","Michael T. Speetzen","Yes, so here's the way to think, kind of the full picture. We had been anticipating the U.S. to be in the mid single-digits. We are now projecting it in low single-digits. We had expected some level of European growth from a full year standpoint. We're now assuming Europe will essentially be flat, and we really haven't moderated the emerging market growth that we had assumed. It's -- I'd say, more heavily weighted towards a European reduction, than it is the U.S. But we are seeing moderation in both those markets.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Terry Darling with Goldman Sachs.","Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Maybe just a follow up on that last comment. Mike, why would Europe get better in the back half, relative to the slight decline in the first half? What are you seeing there?","Michael T. Speetzen","Yes, so there's a couple of things. One, we do see some of the typical seasonality that has held up over the past several years, especially coming out of the vacation season that we'll see in August. A couple of other components. One, the public utility side tends to ramp. They're on a different fiscal calendar, so you can obviously read into that, in terms of some of the dynamics that play out as you get into back half of the year. And then, our analytical instrumentation business was down heavily at the end of last year. That has obviously moderated and we see that continuing to improve sequentially, and that will also fuel some of the growth. And then we've obviously got a good presence in Eastern Europe, and we'll see that to continue to be an opportunity for growth.","Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. That's the Russia piece in particular there?","Michael T. Speetzen","Yes.","Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then on emerging market, what is the assumption on the full year now that is unchanged?","Michael T. Speetzen","We're essentially looking at approximately 10% growth coming out of the emerging markets.","Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, so similar second half to first half?","Michael T. Speetzen","Yes, very similar.","Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And you've had a very strong growth there. I'm just wondering in China, in particular, are people looking for any signs that some of the stimulus in places like Changxia, and others, will help the industrial sector? Are you seeing anything there from a bid perspective in China that gives you optimism that maybe China gets better in the second half?","Gretchen W. McClain","Yes, we've actually seen our bid activity in China pretty well. If you think about their 12th 5-year plan, it's around wastewater, and our teams have been aggressively working, not only in the large cities, but moving Westward and trying to capture the growth there. We've got a disciplined approach. I think we will continue to see some nice execution from our China team.","Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And Gretchen, can you remind us -- in China, the percentage of total revenues, 3% to 5%, something in that range for the company?","Gretchen W. McClain","That range.","Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then on the restructuring efforts, a couple of questions there. First, any breakdown of the $15 million to $20 million between Infrastructure and Applied for us?","Gretchen W. McClain","So in terms of the details of it, I don't want to get into the details here. It's too early to do that. But we've got detailed plans that spread across both of our segments. It's really going to position us appropriately for what we're seeing in terms of volume, but also strategically position us as we come together as a Xylem team, to maximize our penetration in the market based upon our strategic objectives going forward.","Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And Gretchen, does the -- obviously, the step-up in restructuring -- the view that Europe stays a little weaker for longer implicit in that; but I'm wondering from the way you're thinking about the portfolio, is there any change in your thinking on potential divestitures within the context of the changed landscape?","Gretchen W. McClain","So, yes, we've looked at Europe in terms of it's going to be volatile for some period of time, so we're thinking through that as we make these decisions. We still think Europe is a critically important region for us. And we don't want to lose that focus on our customers and our ability to continue to invest for the long-term growth. So I feel very good about what we need to do, but we need to right-size both from the economy, as well as strategically position ourselves so we can execute our strategy. In terms of our portfolio -- and you look at our fundamental business of Xylem -- solid business, a solid set of portfolio, pipeline, product lines and businesses. So I feel very confident of what we have. Our strategy more is in acquiring and continue to bolt-on to our business, and continue to run our foundation even more effectively.","Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, and then just lastly, in the $0.10 of cost -- from cost-saving actions in the new guide, that is above and beyond the restructuring program. Just the paced investment comment, can you add some color there? Where are you pacing those investments? Is R&D in the mix there? Is it feet-on-the-street in emerging markets? Where are you pacing the investments incrementally there?","Gretchen W. McClain","So we're doing a couple of things. I mean, obviously, our first focus is really around discretionary cost reductions and running our business more effectively like we've been doing over the last several years. We will look at pacing some of the investments. One, when we do that, we look at what's happening in the economy, and are there some end markets where we are going to be launching certain activities that we ultimately should be slowing down based upon the execution. So it's really aligning it based upon the strategy that we have, which we are still advancing, but aligning that geographically based upon on where we have the growth. So it's pulling back a little bit, but it's not stopping our growth strategy.","Michael T. Speetzen","I mean, Terry, we're heavily focused probably more on the discretionary side. You saw it come through in the second quarter. And pulling the levers where we're clearly not jeopardizing the stewardship of the company, but that we have opportunities to defer or cancel out cost levels within the business to preserve the investments. And then really going after the restructuring as a way to make sure that we're in a good position, heading into next year to preserve our ability to continue that investment level in the business.","Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Then can you just clarify, Mike, on the free cash flow for the year, 95% excluding onetime separation costs. Just to make sure we're on the same page there, 290 to 300 implied by that? Have I got that about right?","Michael T. Speetzen","Yes, it's in that range.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Kevin Maczka with BB&T Capital Markets.","Kevin R. Maczka - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Just to clarify on the cost savings, that $0.10, that is not coming from the new or accelerated restructuring, but those savings from that program will be more achieved in 2013, is that correct?","Michael T. Speetzen","Correct.","Gretchen W. McClain","Correct.","Kevin R. Maczka - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","And can you just repeat, what is the savings, do you expect from that in 2013?","Michael T. Speetzen","Yes, you bet. So we're going to have $15 million to $20 million of cost this year. There will be an additional $2 million next year. The run rate savings that we'll achieve will be about $10 million starting in 2013.","Kevin R. Maczka - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Got it. And would you characterize this more as somewhat new, defensive, if you will, move in reaction to something you saw in Q2 and expect in the back half? Or is this more, something that we plan to do all along anyway and we're just accelerating it now because maybe we don't quite have the volume in certain areas that we thought we would?","Gretchen W. McClain","I'd say it's more proactive steps that we're taking to position us for some of the unknown in terms of the market that we see. But also, as we think about ourselves strategically and how best to position in a geographic region.","Kevin R. Maczka - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay, and just last from me, one more quick one on pricing. Where are you in the rollout of your initiative there as it relates to rolling this out, enterprise-wide, to your sales force?","Gretchen W. McClain","I'd say, roughly, we're about 70% deployed across the organization. Our plan was to complete about 80% this year. We're slightly ahead. So it's pretty much deployed throughout the leadership teams and very specifically, across end-market-by-end-market. The teams are really driving it in a much more aggressive way than we had in the past, and I feel good about our process.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Michael Roomberg with Ladenburg Thalmann.","Michael G. Roomberg - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division","I just have a quick question for you on branding. Can you refresh us on the extent to which you have or are planning to incorporate the Xylem brand across your platform? And then related that, kind of talk a bit about how you strike the write balance between, I guess, leveraging the cross-selling opportunities of Xylem, the umbrella of Xylem, versus ensuring the customers kind of maintain their previous perceptions or loyalties to the brands that they've grown accustomed to over many years?","Gretchen W. McClain","Yes, great question. You look at Xylem, brand new company and we need to build our brand as a company and that's extremely important so people to know who we are. And we as a team of 12,500 employees, come together as an organization with a common focus around water. Our legacy brands are very strong. Many of them have been in the market for over 150 years and have a very strong relationship with our customers and the end markets in which they serve. So I think they're like, kind of like a house of brands. Now in that, we clearly will have some brands that we continue to eliminate, and really go after our strong brands, so when we go into different regions, just like I talked in our last earnings call, was we're taking products out of our WTW [ph], which is over in Europe in our analytics business and we're bringing them into the U.S. under our YSI brand, because that makes some sense. So there'll be cross-branding, maintaining those strong legacy brands, all under the house of Xylem.","Michael G. Roomberg - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division","Got it. So you're not looking necessarily to transform any of your existing brands into a new Xylem brand for instance?","Gretchen W. McClain","Not at this point.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Jim Krapfel with MorningStar.","James Krapfel - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Does your longer-term margin and revenue goal target some plays, that being, I think, 14.5%, 15.5% on margin in 2015, and then water, mid single-digit organically and applied water up low to mid single-digit organically?","Michael T. Speetzen","Yes.","Gretchen W. McClain","Our long-term strategy hasn't changed. I mean, we still see we've got opportunity in our business to continue to get more leverage, more productivity and we can -- and as we think about deploying new products and new markets that we go into, more attractive, more opportunity for profitable growth.","James Krapfel - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then you talked briefly about -- your acquisition pipeline looks pretty good. Would you -- do you see anything in the pipeline that -- if you do, to the size of what you did with YSI at $300 million acquisition costs, or there's more smaller bolt-on acquisitions?","Gretchen W. McClain","So we've got a healthy pipeline of opportunities, many of them focused around the bolt-on, but we've got some sizable of -- the size of YSI. We look at the full industry and we'll make the decisions based around strategic, obviously, culture, how it fits, and then the final line being the financials and does it make sense for the business. So that strategy hasn't changed. I would say, though, primarily bolt-ons, but we are looking across the whole industry for the right strategic alignment.","James Krapfel - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","And the strategic focus would be on companies with more emerging market exposure and healthy margin levels? Is that the idea there?","Gretchen W. McClain","Well, you go back to our growth platforms, being dewatering and analytics, that's clearly important to us. But emerging market's important, continuing to expand our technology, and as well as channels that allows us to position ourselves in expanding areas. So when you think about products in the portfolio, we think of gross margin and how we can improve our gross margin. So that aligns with our strategy as we go forward.","Operator","Our final question is coming from Stewart Scharf with S&P Capital.","Stewart Scharf - S&P Equity Research","On your long-term projections, are you pretty much, over the next few years, sticking with your long-term growth, organic growth of, say, 4% to 6% and operating margins in the 14.5% range with 50 to 75 basis points annually? Do you see that basically transpiring over the next 3 or 4 years?","Gretchen W. McClain","Yes, so our long-term growth strategy has not changed and the goals that you outlined there are the same. We see that continuing to play. The actions that we're investing in, our core business, as well as the acquisitions that we have pursued, drive us in that direction and so that stays the same and we see ourselves on the right path. Some economic headwinds that we're seeing right now, but nothing's taking our eye off the ball on achieving those.","Stewart Scharf - S&P Equity Research","Okay. And targeting around $300 million a year in acquisitions, would that basically mean that you're done for the year, and you're looking more towards '13 now for any acquisitions of that [indiscernible]?","Gretchen W. McClain","We're very active. We've got a very active pipeline. We're continuing to look at it. Now, we're not going to force something to happen. We're going to be disciplined as we have been because that works for us. Our process has really demonstrated that's the right direction to go in because we're getting profitability out of our acquisitions that we've done to date. So we've got the capability to spend $300 million, but it will be paced, based upon strategic and opportunity at the right time.","So let me close with just a couple of comments. Our business operations continue to perform even with the lower anticipated revenues. We feel great about gaining share in the emerging markets. We're introducing new products and services. We're expanding our position in our dewatering and analytics businesses, while we're continuing to advance our strategic acquisition strategy. And we're also, as we talked about, taking proactive actions to reposition ourselves, given the uncertainty in Europe at this point in time. We're focused on good earnings and a strong, solid cash flow. And so we feel good that our business is performing, now that we're 9 months as an independent company. So feel good about the direction that we're headed in and the growth opportunities that are in front of us. So I want to thank for your interest and the time this morning.","Operator","Thank you.

Welcome to Xylem's first quarter 2016 earnings conference call. With me today are Chief Executive Officer, Patrick Decker; Chief Financial Officer, Mark Rajkowski; and Vice President of Finance Global Operations, Shashank Patel.

I'll turn the call over to our CEO, Partick Decker.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Thanks, Phil, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us to review our first quarter results.","Before I begin, I want to welcome our new CFO, Mark Rajkowski to Xylem. Mark brings more than 30 years of diverse financial and operational experience. And importantly, he had a significant experience in leading transformational change, across operating models and product portfolio changes, M&A activity and capital market transactions, all to create substantial shareholder value. He's been here just over a month, but he's already hit the ground running, visiting the field and working closely with our senior leadership team, to gain a better understanding of the business and our plans for future growth. I know some of you already know Mark, but for those who don't, I'm sure over the coming months, we'll find opportunities for you to get to meet him.","I'd also like to take this opportunity to thank Shashank Patel, who's here with this morning for his outstanding work as our Interim CFO over the past seven months. Shashank is an incredibly effective executive, who brought his financial acumen and deep knowledge of Xylem's businesses to bear to create a seamless transition in his important to CFO role. He's been instrumental in bringing Mark up to speed and I look forward to continuing to work with him as he takes on a new role here at Xylem.","Now let's move on to our first quarter results. We had a solid start to 2016, which positions us well to deliver on our full-year commitments. The benefits of our diversified product portfolio and end-market exposure helped us deliver 4% organic growth. Our top-line growth exceeded our expectations, with strong execution by our teams helping to drive share gains in key regions. But I do want to acknowledge that we benefited from some projects shifting from Q2 into Q1, as well as weather conditions that were favorable to the public utility market. I'll come back to that in a few minutes.","A significant driver of our growth was the continued momentum we saw in key end-markets; namely, public utilities where growth was seen across all key regions. The U.S. was particularly strong up 22% year-over-year. The rising trend line on the break and fix side of the business continues, and the milder winter provided an opportunity for public utilities to accelerate some needed repairs and maintenance. As I've mentioned previously this area of the business has been suppressed for the last few years as municipalities have deferred activities due to budget constraints. But we are seeing some changing priorities and these smaller projects are being green lit with greater frequency.","In addition, as I just mentioned, one of the contributing factors to our top-line growth in the quarter was the shift of treatment projects in the second quarter into the first. Given the treatment project installations generally deliver lower incremental margins relative to other parts of our business, this shift didn't have a significant impact on the bottom line. On a macro level, mixed economic conditions do persist but we remain focused on our growth objectives.","We are seeing stable market conditions in the U.S. and the early signs of improvement in Europe and while we've seen a significant slowdown in some Emerging Markets, we still generated 2% growth across these regions. India and the Middle East were particular standouts in the quarter, generating 90% and 10% growth respectively. That growth was partially offset by a significant year-over-year decline in China, which reflects both soft market conditions in certain sectors as well as the variability in project work.","That said, China's performance was in line with our expectations. Based on what we're seeing in terms of quarter-to-quarter sequential order trends, we believe the local market maybe stabilizing.","Importantly, we remain confident in the China market. Water Infrastructure is a top priority of the government, something that was reaffirmed in the State Council's latest action plan released in April and we see a robust pipeline of project activity.","So, as we begin to lap the steep declines we faced in commercial and industrial sectors, which became more pronounced in the fourth quarter of 2015, we will be well positioned to further accelerate our growth performance. Net-net, we are expecting China to deliver results in flat to low single-digit growth for the full-year.","Organic order bookings in the quarter were flat versus last year, but this result reflects the variation in timing that occurred with major project work. For example, if we adjusted for just two of the major orders won in Q1 of last year, year-over-year orders would have shown a 3% increase.","Our adjusted operating margin in the quarter expanded to 10.9%, up 40 basis points excluding the impact of our recent acquisitions of HYPACK and Tideland. Given our strong top-line growth and ongoing cost reduction actions, we have accelerated some investments in our growth initiatives. Let me provide a brief update on the strategic priorities that we laid out at our Investor Day, last fall. First, enhancing commercial leadership. As we continue to shift our center of gravity close to our customers, we are engaged in a number of activities to improve the customer experience, and expand our channel reach, which ultimately will increase our opportunities to generate more growth. We're investing in additional capability building, around a common set of tools and processes across our commercial teams.","Our second priority is to grow in Emerging Markets and as I just mentioned, we are making good progress. In the Middle East, you'll recall that we are opening a new facility in Dubai, in order to localize manufacturing and assembly of some of our products, beginning with our Applied Water portfolio. This expansion will enable us to better serve our growing customer base in the region by bringing the supply chain closer to them and we expect to be operational later this summer.","We're also encouraged by the momentum we see in India, where we have a relatively smaller but growing presence. We are moving forward with our plans for localized product design to be more responsive to the needs of this market. In the area of strengthening innovation and technology, we are starting to build good momentum. We have already begun to invest in several areas and expect to increase our 2016 full-year R&D spending by 50 basis points, to more than 3% of revenue. Our core areas of focus are smart technologies, systems intelligence, and advanced treatment and industrial services. We expect these investments to drive not only top-line growth, but also to improve the gross margin profile of our business.","Coming up, we are looking forward to a significant new product introduction in our Water Infrastructure segment, later this month.","Our next priority, continuous improvement includes Lean, global procurement, and a sharper focus on driving business simplification. We expect these efforts to generate significant cost savings and operating margin improvement this year, and over the next several years. As I've discussed before, we're instilling a productivity for growth mindset throughout the business so we can fund the necessary investment to achieve our longer-term value creation objectives.","In the first quarter, we achieved $22 million in cost savings through Continuous Improvement, global procurement, and business simplification initiatives, and we are on track to reach our full year goal. I am pleased with the momentum our teams are building in this area, and would highlight that we expect to achieve another consecutive year of record savings in 2016.","Our final strategic priority is to cultivate leadership and talent development. On the leadership front, with the addition of Mark as our CFO, I now have my senior team in place and working together toward our common goals. We have also launched the Xylem Learning Center, a global platform for training and knowledge management throughout the organization, as well as two concentrated development programs for high-performing managers and leaders.","Shifting back to our results. At the bottom line, we generated adjusted earnings per share of $0.35 in the quarter, an increase of 9% year-over-year, excluding the impact of acquisitions. Also, a strong focus on our working capital performance drove a 130 basis point improvement as a percentage of revenue, and an increase of $23 million in operating cash flow. These efforts position us well to deliver another year of free cash flow conversion in excess of 100% of net income.","Finally, as we announced this morning, we are raising our full year earnings guidance to $1.98 to $2.08. We will cover this in more detail later in the call, but let me give you some perspective. Our guidance increase today reflects the incremental interest savings from the refinancing of a portion of our long-term debt. There is no change in our expectations regarding the performance of our core business. We expect stable conditions across roughly 90% of our portfolio and we anticipate generating growth across all key regions. Given that, we believe we're positioned to exceed market growth rates.","We are certainly off to a good start for the year, delivering solid top-line growth and executing well across our businesses. But we're one quarter into the year and we recognize that we are still operating in a mixed macro environment.","One last point, we could potentially recognize some favorability benefit from foreign exchange movements if rates hold over the balance of the year. However, we believe it's too early to make those types of changes, so we did not change our underlying foreign exchange assumptions in providing today's earnings update. Mark will give some additional color on our FX sensitivity later in the call.","Now with that, I'll turn it over to Mark for more details on the quarter.","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Thanks, Patrick. Now please turn to slide four. We generated revenue of $847 million in the quarter, up $10 million from the prior year despite FX headwind of $27 million. Recent acquisitions added $6 million to the top line in the quarter. Organic revenue increased $31 million or 4%, which exceeded our expectations and was largely driven by the 12% increase in the global public utility market.","Looking at the rest of our end markets, our industrial vertical was flat as expected. Commercial was up 5%, but residential was down 5%. Sales to our ag customers were down 1%. From a regional perspective, we generated growth in each of our key regions, with Western Europe up 5%, the U.S. up 4% and Emerging Markets growing at 2%.","Operating margin increased 10 basis points to 10.9% for the quarter. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, margins increased by 40 basis points year-over-year. Strong execution and cost reductions enabled us to fund the strategic investments we need to further accelerate profitable growth.","Let me provide a little more detail on our margin expansion. Continuous improvement, global procurement and business simplification initiatives reduced our costs by $22 million in the quarter, resulting in 260 basis points of margin improvement. Our operating margin increased 100 basis points due to volume leverage, modest price realization and favorable mix.","Partially offsetting these items were cost inflation of 190 basis points and strategic investments of 130 basis points. These investments included increased R&D spend to fund new product development, expansion of our organization's selling and continuous improvement capabilities, and the localization of assembly and production in attractive faster growth regions.","Earnings per share of $0.35 grew 6% year-over-year, but were up 9% excluding the acquisitions of HYPACK and Tideland, which were $0.01 dilutive in the first quarter, as expected, due to the seasonality of these businesses. These acquisitions are tracking to plan and are expected to be earnings neutral for the full year 2016 and accretive to earnings in 2017.","One final item. We have excluded from adjusted earnings a net tax benefit of $14 million during the quarter, which is primarily the result of closing out a prior year tax audit.","Now, let me cover each of our reporting segments. Please turn to slide five. Water Infrastructure recorded orders of $534 million, down 2% organically, as we lapped a prior-year quarter that included two large project wins totaling approximately $25 million. Excluding these unusually large orders from last year, orders would have been up 3%.","We exited the quarter with total backlog of $580 million, about the same as last year on an organic basis. Of this total, we expect to ship approximately 75% over the next three quarters. This is up 3% organically year-over-year, and relatively consistent with our sales outlook for the segment. Revenue of $514 million represents a 6% increase year-over-year on an organic basis. Acquisitions added an additional $6 million to the top line, but foreign exchange was a $21 million headwind.","Now, let me provide you with some color on this quarter's performance. We generated 12% growth in the global public utility market. This increase reflects the continued market recovery we've seen over the past few quarters, as well as milder winter weather, which enabled municipalities to accelerate maintenance activities.","Additionally, strong execution and the timing of a few treatment project deliveries also contributed to better-than-expected performance. In the U.S., where our public utility business grew 22%, our teams performed very well, driving share gains in the water and wastewater pump market. We also saw benefits from our investment in sales capability, as demonstrated by an increase in mixer and mixer aftermarket sales.","Strength in Western Europe came from the early stages of the UK Public Utility AMP6 cycle. Emerging market results were favorable despite mixed market conditions. Our overall growth was driven by a large custom pump project in India, and continued investment in water and wastewater infrastructure in the Middle East.","Finally, our industrial end market was flat as low-single-digit growth in the general industrial and construction markets was muted by the negative impact of the oil and gas and mining sectors.","Operating margin increased 150 basis points from 10.6% to 12.1%. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, operating margin increased 200 basis points, driven by volume leverage, favorable mix, modest price realization and cost reductions, partially offset by increases in cost inflation and increased strategic growth investments.","Please turn to slide six. Applied Water recorded orders of $354 million, up 2% organically over the prior year period. We entered the second quarter with total backlog of $197 million, down 5% on an organic basis, primarily due to the delivery of a large project in the fourth quarter of 2015. Of that total, approximately $105 million is expected to ship within the second quarter.","Applied Water segment revenue was $333 million, up 1% organically from the prior year. Highlights of our revenue performance include the following. Commercial and industrial market strength drove 5% growth in Western Europe. Here we're seeing the continued traction from energy-efficient product launches and our investment in building our regional sales capabilities.","In the U.S., commercial was up 3%, driven by continued strength in the institutional building sector. We also saw 3% growth in residential, but with an unfavorable mix in demand within our product offerings. Here, as a result of a relatively warm winter, demand for our higher margin hot-water circulators declined, while demand for lower margin well pumps increased.","The segment's U.S. industrial revenue declined 7%. This primarily reflects lower demand for specialty pump applications serving the food and beverage and marine sectors, and drove the overall 1% decline in the U.S. Segment revenue was down 3% in our Emerging Markets, due primarily to the anticipated slowdown in the commercial and industrial end markets in China.","Sequentially, we've seen modest improvement in orders in China; thanks in part to what we believe are stabilizing end market conditions as well as strong execution by our local team. Partially offsetting the year-over-year decline in China was double-digit growth in Eastern Europe and the Middle East, again driven by the strategic growth investment that we're making to build our sales capabilities in these regions.","Segment operating margin declined 130 basis points from 13.9% to 12.6% year-over-year. Cost reductions drove a 270 basis point improvement, more than offsetting inflation and the impact of unfavorable residential mix in the quarter. However, increased spend on strategic growth investments reduced margins by 180 basis points. These investments are funding the localization of product assembly in the Middle East and include higher investments in innovation and technology for new product development. Looking at the full year 2016, we continue to expect segment margin expansion in the range of 30 basis points to 50 basis points.","To summarize this quarter's performance, we delivered modest top line growth as we managed the near-term slowdown and tough year-over-year comparisons in China as well as sluggish U.S. industrial market conditions. At the same time, we remain focused on delivering productivity gains to fund our growth investments.","Now let's turn to slide seven, where I'll cover the company's cash flow and financial position. The first thing you'll likely notice on our balance sheet is our unusually large cash position of $1.2 billion at the end of the quarter. This reflects the proceeds from our very successful European debt issuance in March, which we used to redeem our 3.55% senior notes on April 11. Our net debt to net capital ratio is healthy at 24%, and our commercial paper and revolving credit facilities remain in place and unutilized. This underscores our financial strength and flexibility.","In that regard, we remain committed to a balanced capital deployment strategy, which is to profitably grow the business through organic investments and M&A, while enhancing shareholder returns through dividends and opportunistic share repurchases.","During the first quarter, we invested $37 million for capital expenditures, much of this for growth projects. We acquired Tideland for $70 million and we've returned $28 million to our shareholders through dividends. The first quarter included a 10% increase in dividends per share, marking the fifth consecutive year that we've increased our dividend.","Historically, our first quarter free cash flow generation is seasonally low and impacted by the timing of annual incentive payments, as well as lower sales leverage. Free cash flow was $4 million in the quarter, representing a modest improvement from the prior year. Year over year, free cash flow benefited from a $23 million reduction in working capital, largely offset by the timing of additional interest and tax payments in the quarter. We continue to expect to deliver at least 100% cash conversion this year.","It's worth highlighting that we improved working capital as a percentage of revenue by 130 basis points in the quarter, excluding the impact of acquisitions. The improvement was driven by better inventory management and receivables collections.","Please move to slide eight, and I'll turn the call back over to Patrick to cover our 2016 guidance. Patrick?","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Thanks Mark. I'll begin by making two quick points. First, the growth rates I refer to on this slide all exclude the anticipated negative foreign exchange impact that we discussed in our last earnings call. Second, and more importantly, as I said in my opening remarks, there is no change in the outlook for the performance of our core business. We continue to expect to generate faster-than-market growth, delivering organic revenue growth of 2% to 4%.","While I'll cover specific details by end market on the next slide, let me highlight that we continue to expect stable conditions across roughly 90% of our portfolio, including growth across all key geographies. Additionally, we expect acquisitions will provide an additional 1% of revenue growth.","Our adjusted operating margin is still expected to grow in the range of 50 basis points to 80 basis points overall, with roughly 20 basis points of margin dilution from the acquisitions of HYPACK and Tideland. Excluding the dilutive impact of acquisitions, our operating margin is expected to expand by 70 basis points to 100 basis points. This expansion will be realized after the impact of investments we are making to accelerate profitable growth.","As I mentioned earlier, we continue to drive our continuous improvement work deeper into the organization with very good results. We expect our Lean and global procurement initiatives to generate full year gross savings of $120 million, an increase of roughly 20% year-over-year.","We're raising our earnings per share guidance to $1.98 to $2.08 to reflect the interest savings from our debt refinancing. This range excludes restructuring and realignment cost of about $25 million, but this projection does include $0.04 of negative foreign currency translation impact. Excluding this impact, EPS growth is now expected to be in the range of 9% to 15%.","We will continue to execute a disciplined approach to capital deployment, which is expected to result in free cash flow conversion greater than 100% after investing $120 million to $130 million in CapEx.","Finally, we currently anticipate returning a minimum of $150 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.","Now, please turn to slide nine. Let me summarize our updated full year performance by end market and highlight a few changes since our previous outlook in February. Beginning with industrial, which represents 44% of total revenue. We continue to expect this market to be flat to up low-single-digits. Our projection assumes that low-single-digit growth in general industrial will be partially offset by headwinds in the mining and oil and gas sectors.","While first quarter performance in mining, which represents approximately 5% of total revenue, was generally in line with our expectations, we continue to closely monitor market trends. Oil and gas, which now represents less than 3% of total revenue, is forecast to decline through the first half of this year before we lap last year's second half of nearly 40% declines. Public utility, which represents 33% of our total revenue, is now anticipated to grow at a mid to high-single-digit rate.","Here, we've raised our outlook, following a strong first quarter start and with the expectation of continued momentum in the U.S. We also see encouraging signs for improved European market conditions, including strong contributions from the AMP6 cycle in the UK. And in the Emerging Markets, we expect to see continued project growth.","For the commercial end market, no change to our expectation of mid-single-digit range growth. We see solid contributions from both the U.S. and Europe and double-digit growth in the Middle East.","The relatively warmer winter weather led to a slow start to the year for residential heating applications and tougher macro conditions in Australia. As a result, we now expect the residential market to be flat year-over-year. And finally, our smallest sector, agriculture, we anticipate will be up low-single-digits for the year.","Please turn to slide 10 and Mark will provide some calendarlization insight for the rest of the year.","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Thanks Patrick. For the second quarter of 2016, we expect total revenue of approximately $920 million, flat versus the prior year. This includes organic growth of approximately $20 million or 2%, revenue from our acquisitions of approximately $10 million and approximately $30 million of headwind from foreign exchange translation.","We anticipate operating income to be up modestly year-over-year with operating margins of 40 basis points to 60 basis points as volume leverage and cost reductions more than offset inflation, growth investments and unfavorable mix.","Looking out to the second half of the year, we anticipate year-over-year organic growth of approximately 3% with acquisitions adding just over $30 million and FX headwind of nearly $45 million.","Operating margins in the second half are expected to increase in the range of 80 basis points to 130 basis points year-over-year. This improvement reflects volume leverage in the net incremental savings from restructuring and continuous improvement cost actions in excess of increased R&D and growth investments. Relative to the first half of the year, we also anticipate favorable mix, given that will lap oil and gas headwinds as we exit the second quarter.","To wrap up, let me make a few points about the foreign exchange assumptions and our full year guidance. As Patrick mentioned earlier, we have not reflected any potential benefit from foreign exchange variability in our updated outlook, we did not see any significant benefit in the first quarter and it's too early to update any full year assumptions at this point in the year given the volatility of currencies.","Having said that, we have provided a table in the appendix that outlines the potential full-year impact to those assumptions, which is $0.01 of EPS per quarter, based on exchange rates, late last week.","With that I'll turn the call back over to Patrick for closing comments. Patrick?","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Thanks, Mark. So, we feel good about our start to the year and are pleased to be on track to deliver on our financial commitments. Our teams are executing well and remain focused on improving the customer experience. We continue to be encouraged by strengthening public utility market.","We are making measurable progress on our strategic priorities, particularly in the area of continuous improvement, accelerating our investments in innovation and technology and investing in faster growth markets. We've made good strides in improving our working capital performance, which will lead to another year of strong free cash flow conversion.","With that operator, we can now begin the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. Our first question is coming from Deane Dray of RBC Capital.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Good morning, Deane.","Phil De Sousa - Xylem, Inc.","Good morning, Deane.","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Good morning, Deane.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, we had lot of references about warmer weather and a pull in from the second quarter into the first quarter. Can you give any quantification \u2013 can you point to any specifics on how that might be calibrated? And then, since we're on weather, lots of a headline news flooding in the South again, and has there been any opportunities there for Godwin dewatering, not just on the one-time rentals, but this is happening with higher frequency. Are there any longer-term permanent type of projects that we saw after in the Northeast after Sandy? Thank you.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Sure, Deane. This is Patrick. Yeah. To put a total on the combination of timing on some of the project deliveries and treatment that we've alluded to, as well as the weather impact, we'd say, it was roughly about $8 million of revenue, so just under a point of top-line growth. And I'd say, probably a little less than a third of that was the actual impact of the weather, albeit at high margin given the impact that it had on our Godwin business.","To the second part of your question, we certainly see the weather patterns that are happening here as an opportunity both in the immediate term, but there is a systemic move here as you see happening. And so, we certainly have deployed our resource (34:40) on the ground, not only tactically but strategically. Part of the things we've been doing there is leveraging what we're doing in the deployment of Salesforce.com and making sure that our teams, not just in Godwin, but also on the Flygt side of the business, are sharing leads, and making sure that we're maximizing the opportunity there.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. And then, just a second question. I'd like you to expand on this R&D investment increase. Really interesting in how you identified three areas for further investment. I think I got them -- smartwater technology, systems, and advanced water treatment. So, it really looks like you're deliberately moving up the technology curve in the portfolio. What kind of specific opportunities do you see, and is this \u2013 are you doing this build versus buy type of decision making and what's this say about M&A opportunities?","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Sure. Great question, Deane. So, as you know, I've spoken much about -- I do think that there is a great opportunity for us to continue to move our offerings up the technology curve. It really comes out of the value mapping work that we did over the course of the first year or so that I was here. That definitely has informed our priorities, both in terms of organic investment in R&D and the innovation technology roadmaps that Jay, our new Innovation Technology Officer and our R&D teams, are really focused on. But at the same time, it's also informing our M&A pipeline. Certainly the acquisitions of HYPACK and Tideland were a demonstration of that, and we see a very rich pipeline of further opportunities to be able to do that.","You know that we set out some ambitious goals at Investor Day on where we can take our vitality index, in terms of revenue generated from new offerings over the last five years. And so, we're expecting for several hundred basis points of improvement and expansion on that over the next four years to five years.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Thank you.","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Thanks, Deane.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Nathan Jones of Stifel.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Good morning, everyone.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Good morning, Nathan.","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Hi, Nathan.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Slight difference in the way you're reporting on the slide deck there where you're specifically breaking out the strategic investments, 130 basis points in the quarter. Can you talk about how that compares to historically for Xylem, what the expectations are for the benefits out of that, maybe in ROI or any color you could give on that?","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Sure. Yeah. So it is a \u2013 we are purposely breaking it out because I think it's important for our investors to understand what we're doing in driving productivity support larger investments. I do want to point out that we have got very good line of sight and visibility obviously on the rate and pace of those investments, and so we're not just opening the floodgates here. We are very focused on investing in very attractive return opportunities, margin expansion that need to be accretive. A big theme of our here is not only to move the operating margin expansion but to improve our gross margins as a company as well.","So that would be the color I would give you, is that we've been very focused in being accretive. We've got good line of sight on what they are. We're rating and pacing them. And you'll continue to see us break those out as we go forward.","I don't know, Mark, if you want to add any color.","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah. I think, while it's still early days, we're starting to see some returns particularly on the commercial capabilities and some investments we've made in our sales teams. We've seen that in both in Europe and as well as some of our Emerging Markets. So, the R&D is a little bit \u2013 it takes a little bit longer in terms of the time when it pays back, but some of the quick hits on the commercial side we're already seeing benefits.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And how does it compare to an historical rate of these strategic investments? Is it a significant increase?","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah. I mean it's \u2013 from my perspective I think it's a sizable increase and if you look at the level of productivity we drove in the quarter and have over the course of the last year and you see us making those investments here, hard for me to put a specific number on exactly how much we've done in the past. I would say we are probably talking close to 2x the amount of what we've seen historically. And, again, that's being funded by what we are doing on the productivity side while still committing to operating margin expansion.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. That 2x is helpful, and you are clearly paying for it. So, my second question was the public utility in Europe. In the slide deck there, there is an expectation that public utility in Europe is improving. Is that all better AMP 6 out of the UK, or how is the public utility market looking in the rest of Europe?","Shashank Patel - Xylem Inc.","Yeah. So, this is Shashank. On the AMP 6 cycle, we saw a little bit of benefit in March, but the stronger benefit will come for the balance of the year. So really what we saw in Q1 was everything but the AMP 6 cycle. Our expectation that that continues at that pace for the balance of the year in Europe.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah. We saw some continued encouraging signs, Nathan, in other parts of Europe. Southern Europe continues to be basically flattish but we did see pretty good growth in the rest of Central and Northern Europe.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","That's helpful. Thank you.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Okay. You are welcome.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Mike Halloran of Robert Baird.","Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Morning, everyone.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Good morning.","Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","So, two quick ones here. First the, on the guidance. What's the assumption for underlying demand? How does that track through the year when you look at the 2% expectations organically 2Q, 3% back half of the year? Is there any assumption for improvement outside of the public utility market where you've got a pretty positive outlook, or is it pretty stable from here?","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah. I would say, it's pretty much stable from here, Mike. What you hear us talking about in Q2 really is just the impact of the shift of the projects and some of the acceleration of work in the public utility space due to the weather to Q1. So you're looking really at basically 3% over the first half of the year, which is pretty much in line with our guidance, and we'd look for similar performance in the back half of the year. So no real uptick. I mean, you heard us talk about some improvement in public utility versus our previous outlook, but that's really being mitigated a little bit by some of the softness that we continue to see in mining and oil and gas, and a little bit in resi that we called out.","Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","So pretty normal sequential patterns then?","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Yes; that's correct.","Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And then, second one is, when you look at over the last five or so quarters, orders versus revenue, revenues obviously outpace the order side. Some normalization on that this quarter. Maybe you could just talk about the dynamic there, obviously a positive outlook for growth that's been outpacing where the orders have been. Is that short cycle, is that project timing? Maybe could you just talk about that dynamic.","Shashank Patel - Xylem Inc.","And then, Nathan (42:15) and as you noted there is several pieces to that. And when you take a look at some parts of the business like the Applied Water segment, there's a heavier portion of book-and-ship business that typically happens, and the second quarter ends up being the strongest quarter there. But there is also some seasonality, I mean, there is also some impact with project shipments. As we talked, there was pulling of project shipments in the first quarter. And on the order side, we also talked about on the Water Infrastructure side, a year ago, we had strong activity with a couple of large projects that impacted the year-over-year dynamic. So it is a mix of when the projects actually book, when they actually ship out, as well as the level of the book-and-ship activity. And then the last piece is also the lapping of the oil and gas headwind we saw last year, and that laps in the second quarter. So we'll see favorability in Q3, Q4 as we have good prior year comparison on oil and gas.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","I would just add here. Another a bit of color on the backlog is, as we look at the treatment pipeline, which is a good leading indicator for the rest of our public utility kind of business here, it is lumpy and so you do see these kind of quarter-to-quarter comparison that would be challenging, but the actual bid pipeline that we're going after is actually up 10% year-over-year. And so, we continue to see very healthy trends in terms of the projects that are coming to market. And so, that bodes well for the back half of this year into 2017.","Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Great. I appreciate the time.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Phil De Sousa - Xylem, Inc.","Thanks, Mike.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Chip Moore of Canaccord.","Chip Moore - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Morning. Thanks. I guess, Emerging Markets, you talked about some stabilization in bookings in China. Can you maybe give us a little more color on what you're seeing there?","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Sure. Yeah. So, as expected, China was down both in terms of top-line growth and orders year-over-year because we are lapping the drop off there that really occurred mid to late last year. But quarter sequential, we saw 20% plus growth in orders. And so, that's very encouraging for us. It looks like it appears to be stabilizing. What's really driving that? Again, as we talked about in our prepared remarks is just being the number one policy issue right now or one of the top policy issues for the China government. And so, we continue to see a very attractive pipeline there, projects coming forward and good order trends.","Chip Moore - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Okay. And then, on India, maybe you can just give us an update on that large project? And then, also, how you're thinking about timeframes for localizing product there? Thanks.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Thank you.","Shashank Patel - Xylem Inc.","Yeah. So, on India, we talked last year, late last year, on a couple of large projects that we won, we've started delivering on some of those. The pipeline on the quotation activity remains very high and it tends to be large projects, in infrastructure, primarily, on the Water Infrastructure side, so that continues strong. As far as localization initiatives, a lot of the large projects we are doing, they're almost 90%-plus localized. Quite frankly that's how we stay competitive in the India market, which is an extremely competitive market. So, we see continued growth in that market space. We're also looking at on the Applied Water segment opportunities on the commercial building side with the smart cities initiative. And again, a lot of that will be driven by localization initiatives as well.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Kevin Maczka of BB&T Capital Markets.","Kevin Richard Maczka - BB&T Capital Markets","Thanks. Good morning.","Phil De Sousa - Xylem, Inc.","Good morning.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Good morning, Kevin.","Kevin Richard Maczka - BB&T Capital Markets","Back on the cost inflation item, the 190 basis points headwind this quarter, is that more comp or commodities, and I'm just wondering in the back half, as some of these commodities have started to increase again, does that line item may be becoming an even bigger headwind?","Shashank Patel - Xylem Inc.","Yeah. Primarily, and we talked about this I think in the last several quarters. The bulk of our inflation is from compensation and benefits and then there is a little bit coming out of commodities. As you've noted, commodities was soft all the way through last year and the first quarter they did pick up a little bit. But the way we get impacted by pure commodity because it's only a piece of the components we use to make our product isn't as significant. But to your point, as we go through the rest of the year, there could be a little bit of a headwind on the 190 basis points, maybe 20 basis points, 30 basis points is what we've historically seen about the 190 basis points level, as we go forward. So, there could be a little bit of that. Quite frankly, some of that should also help our pricing in the market because commodity does support better pricing levels as well.","Kevin Richard Maczka - BB&T Capital Markets","I think pricing lately has not been as robust as it historically has been, so are you starting to see some of that reverse and maybe see some pricing tailwind offsetting. Are you seeing that already?","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah. Yeah. In the quarter, we saw about 30 bps to 40 bps of pricing benefit in the Water Infrastructure business, which is really the business that's benefiting the most from kind of the rising tide of public utility. And so, that was really the first time we've seen that in quite a while, so we're pretty encouraged by that.","Kevin Richard Maczka - BB&T Capital Markets","Okay, great. Thank you.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Giannakouros of Oppenheimer.","Jim Giannakouros - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hi, good morning, guys.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Good morning.","Shashank Patel - Xylem Inc.","Good morning, Jim.","Phil De Sousa - Xylem, Inc.","Good morning.","Jim Giannakouros - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Just on the public utility, I'm sorry if I missed it, but broad based strength, well understood, but are there any areas geographic areas worthy of note, whether you're seeing a particular strength or weakness to call out in the U.S.?","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Sure, yeah. So, the biggest \u2013 far and away, the biggest area of strength for us right now is the U.S. We saw a 22% growth in the quarter coming from the U.S. Now, again, that was a combination of some of the benefits of the warmer weather conditions, some of the increase in repair and maintenance activity and also some project strength. So, that's \u2013 we are not going to hold to the full year at that level but we're expecting it continuing to be very attractive. And then secondly, we saw, again some returning strength in Europe. As Shashank mentioned earlier, we haven't really begun to see the full impact of the AMP 6 cycle in the UK but we are seeing some of the activity coming through in Q2 now, and expect that to really begin to ramp up for here over the course of the year. India was another real big bright spot for us, I mean, up 90% and the pipeline is continuing to grow there. I'd say, no real areas of weakness that I would call out in public utility. It was pretty broad based. We were up 12%, overall the company. So, I'd say that's one of our biggest bright spots across the board.","Jim Giannakouros - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Got it. I'm sorry if I wasn't clear. I meant specifically in the U.S. but nothing to call-out in the U.S. by region?","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","No, nothing really to speak of. I mean, it's pretty broad-based across the board. I mean, I think, we didn't see any areas where we saw low-single digits or flattish or down. Everything was growing at least mid-single digits. I think it's a matter of relative bright spots.","Jim Giannakouros - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Got it. Okay. And by product line, call it, transport, treatment, test, you're showing obviously different growth rates given project activity timing, that's understandable. But can you discuss any impact you are seeing specifically from upgrading your go-to-market strategies, your more unified sales approach, et cetera. Just checking that that's the driver of the share gains that you are speaking of and anticipating.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, we certainly feel very confident about the bright spots we're seeing early on here as we've \u2013 whether it be revision of some our incentives, whether it be the implementation of Salesforce.com, whether this be our teams getting more time together, we co-located some of our offices, and our sales teams. There is a lot of ingredients that go into that, an increase in training that we've done and just being very proud of how hard our teams are working in the field, they are getting added. And I think, that's where leveraging our combined efforts are important. I also think that's we are having a definitive market-leading brand or brand that we've got, you tend to benefit in a rising tide. And we just can't \u2013 there is no rest for the weary here, so we can't. We got to keep looking over our shoulder and working as hard as possible.","Jim Giannakouros - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Brent Thielman of D.A. Davidson.","Brent Edward Thielman - D. A. Davidson & Co.","Thanks. Good morning.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Good morning, Brent.","Phil De Sousa - Xylem, Inc.","Good morning, Brent.","Brent Edward Thielman - D. A. Davidson & Co.","Good morning. On the dewatering business, it seems like some of the challenging sectors there should be nearing a bottom at least and understand the mix headwind today, but can you speak to how the overall pricing environment is evolving there? And is it realistic to think as the business reaccelerates we should start to see a net positive for Water Infrastructure margins?","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah. Sure. So, certainly, we \u2013 given the oil and gas and mining exposure, that our dewatering team has been facing there that was a big body blow for us last year. And really provided a headwind for against all the other great margin expansion efforts that we were doing. The team within that business did a fantastic job of at least holding their margins flat, despite a significant drop off last year in revenue. And I think, we are confident that as that business rebounds, hard to make a call as to when oil and gas and mining might rebound, but certainly as that business laps that and begin to get some additional top-line growth, we would expect to see quite sizable incremental margins fall through, given a number of the cost actions the team took last year to manage the bottom. And that certainly would be an accretive impact for Water Infrastructure.","Brent Edward Thielman - D. A. Davidson & Co.","Sure. Okay. And then, Patrick, the 10% increase in the bid pipeline for treatment you referenced, was that for the U.S. or globally?","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","That is global.","Brent Edward Thielman - D. A. Davidson & Co.","Okay. And is it fair to say, it's higher in the U.S.?","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","I'd say the growth rates are higher in the U.S., yes.","Brent Edward Thielman - D. A. Davidson & Co.","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Okay. You're welcome.","Phil De Sousa - Xylem, Inc.","Thanks, Pat.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Robert Barry of Susquehanna.","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Good morning.","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","I just wanted to circle back and make sure I was clear on what you were dealing about the order momentum and how it's tracking versus your plan? The commentary in the last couple of quarters has seemed very positive, certainly maybe a lot of that is just a muni. But it doesn't feel like the momentum is really building here in the orders?","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah. I mean I think we feel quite comfortable and good about the outlook. I think the momentum that we see is very much in line with our plan and kind of where we've guided to. As we talked about, we got a number of these big projects last year. So, when you're looking at year-over-year comparisons, there is going to be some lumpiness there. I know that people can look at orders within Applied Water. That's not a big backlog business. And so, it really is heavily skewed towards book-and-ship business. And so, again, we feel positive. Again, we're keeping our expectations in check here.","We're in the early stages of a public utility recovery. And hopefully we're seeing things stabilize in the Emerging Markets. China obviously had a significant impact in the order book in Q1 on a year-over-year basis as well.","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","I'd add, as I mentioned in our prepared remarks, that when you exclude a couple of unusually large projects that we had in the first quarter of last year, Water Infrastructure would have been up 3% year-over-year.","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay. Fair enough. And then, just a question on line of sight through that 80 bps to 130 bps of half margin improvement you're expecting in the back half, it sounds like a combination of volume and restructuring. I mean, how much of what you need to see that is in the backlog and just general line of sight on the restructuring coming through?","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah. As we look at the back half, a big part of that acceleration is cost reductions. So, we will see ramp up from our 260 basis points that we saw in Q1 to closer to 380 basis points in the second half. So, we are expecting to see acceleration in cost out as well as those periods are seasonally stronger in terms of volume. So we'll see more volume leverage and we'll also benefit \u2013 part of that cost reduction will be additional restructuring benefits, $8 million in the second half the year. That work is underway.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","I'd just add that within that guide we've also got about a 100 basis points from it \u2013 going the other direction from strategic investments. And so, obviously, as I mentioned earlier, we got line of sight to that. We will rate and pace that accordingly, but right now we feel confident about making those investments.","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Got you. So, that's something that you can dial up or down a little bit depending on how things...","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","That's correct.","Phil De Sousa - Xylem, Inc.","That's correct. Yeah...","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","That's helpful. Thank you.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Kevin Bennett of Sterne Agee.","Kevin Bennett - Sterne Agee","Thanks. Good morning, everybody.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Good morning.","Phil De Sousa - Xylem, Inc.","Good morning, Kevin.","Kevin Bennett - Sterne Agee","Patrick, I would like to dig in a little bit on your industrial market overall. I guess, I think we all know what's going on in oil and gas and mining, but within the rest of it, and I know you guys serve a ton of different end markets, but would like any color you could provide on what may be strong within that and what may be weak. And then, more specifically on your industrial water treatment business, which I know is kind of an increased focus of you guys going forward, so I was wondering if you made any progress there.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Sure. Yeah. So, very quickly on the industrial piece, it's good to pull it out as you did. So in that 44% of overall industrial revenue for us, 8% of that is tied to oil and gas and mining, so the other let's call it 36% of our total revenue, we really refer to that as more light industrial, and that's been up 3% and are expecting that to continue. It is heavily tied to GDP in the U.S., it's overweighted to the U.S. It is a broad swath of exposure ranging from food and beverage to pharma, to chemicals, to marine, to a wide variety -- car washes. It's a wide variety of areas. The nice thing about that business is that it's historically been very, very steady. We're not tied to capital spend. We're not tied to industrial output. As long as people's operations are up and running, they're going to burn through these small pumps that we sell them and so it's a good steady business.","The tweaks that we typically see there is when there can be adjustment in inventory or stock. We saw a little bit of that last year. But, again, expect that business to be pretty stable here in that low single-digit range for 2016.","On the industrial treatment business, only about 25% of our treatment business today is sold into industrial. We're heavily weighted towards muni and wastewater, and that is a business that tend to be lower margin for us. Hence the discussion around shifting even more of our weight toward the industrial sector where it's higher technology, more regulations, deeper pockets, people willing to spend based on lifecycle cost. And so it is an area of focus for us both as it relates to our own internal R&D efforts and the pipeline there. Again, those tend to be slower to come to fruition, but we're working on those right now, as we speak. And as we've mentioned before, it is an area of focus for us in terms of M&A down the path.","Kevin Bennett - Sterne Agee","Got it. That's helpful. And then one quick question on the commercial market. I guess you said in your slides that you expect the U.S. to moderate and was wondering if you've seen that or is that based on orders, or I guess what makes you think that U.S. will moderate?","Shashank Patel - Xylem Inc.","So \u2013 and that is based on the first quarter order activity, and as we mentioned on the residential side, where we had strength in the groundwater side. But on the residential circulators, which fall onto the commercial side, there was a little bit of softness because of the relatively warm winter. So we did see moderate growth in the first quarter, and we expect that to continue for the balance of the year.","Kevin Bennett - Sterne Agee","Okay. Thank you.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Thank you.","Phil De Sousa - Xylem, Inc.","Thanks, Kevin.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Joe Giordano with Cowen.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi, guys. How are you?","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Good morning, Joe.","Phil De Sousa - Xylem, Inc.","Good morning, Joe.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","I guess, if I had to ding you somewhere, maybe \u2013 you maybe start talking about the incrementals on organic growth being a little bit lower, and can you just kind of flesh out how much of that is from mix shift towards treatment which is lower margin, but kind of a good problem; how much is M&A; how much is FX? Can you kind of talk about that a little bit?","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Sure, yes. Most certainly in the first quarter, the biggest driver of that lower incremental margins than what would historically have expected would be the treatment mix, and again, some of the projects that moved into the quarter at lower margins, so that was one big impact.","If you look at the overall, certainly what we saw in terms of the investment in the Middle East, in the quarter, which hit Applied Water only because that's the first business that was going in there in terms of product localization. And as we mentioned in the prepared comments, Applied Water will more than recover that and expand margins for the full year, so it really is the timing of the investment that hit in the quarter. Those'd be the two biggest impacts. Obviously, we had a little bit of dilution from the acquisitions, but that was not so large and will be as expected, that becomes neutral over the course of the full year.","Phil De Sousa - Xylem, Inc.","Hey, Joe. It's Phil. I'd just highlight. So if you're looking just on the face, it looks like we have got 20% incrementals for the quarter...","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Right.","Phil De Sousa - Xylem, Inc.","But if you back out the acquisition impacts, we're right in the sweet spot of the norm of about 35% incrementals overall. So pretty much in line with what we would have expected.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Fair enough. I wanted to talk higher level about municipalities and what you are seeing. Are you seeing more of a willingness to invest in newer technology, like are you able to value sell maybe a more expensive project if you can convince them that it's better long-term benefit? Are you seeing a shift in (1:01:46)","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah. I'd say, Joe \u2013 Joe, it differs. It clearly differs by customer. I mean, I think that those water authorities that are privately owned and privately managed, they tend to focus much more on the pure economics and the longer-term lifecycle and therefore, definitely play up the technology curve and are willing to adopt more of a solution sell there. But I would also say there are, even in the public sector, there are a number of water authorities that are becoming much more progressive. It's not limited to here in the U.S. It's actually been faster adoption in some of the Emerging Markets, in parts of Europe. So, it really depends on the customer itself. But we are encouraged by their willingness to adopt new technology and to really focus in on the value proposition.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Awesome. And then, one last question, and I'm sorry if I missed this earlier. Can you talk about your M&A pipeline and what you are seeing out there in terms of potential targets on the technology side and what you are thinking in terms of size?","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah. Let me share my observations on that since I'm the new guy on the team. One of my early observations is that very impressed with the strategic work around the value mapping and targeting where to play and how to win, and one of the benefits of that is having a very clear roadmap to informing our capital allocation choices including M&A. And as I got up to speed on the M&A pipeline, very clear that both in terms of the number as well as the relative attractiveness of those opportunities that are in the sweet spot relative to smart infrastructure monitoring and control up the technology stack if you will. It's robust and I think there's a lot of opportunity there.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Phil De Sousa - Xylem, Inc.","Thanks, Joe.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question is coming from the line of David Rose of Wedbush Securities.","David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Good morning...","Phil De Sousa - Xylem, Inc.","Good morning, David.","David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","...and thank you for slipping me in.","Shashank Patel - Xylem Inc.","Sure. Good morning, David.","David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Just two quick questions. On the aftermarket, I was hoping maybe you can quantify the growth you've seen in the aftermarket? And maybe some of the impact from TotalCare? And maybe provide us a little bit more color on the margin impact that w can expect over the rest of 2016 and 2017? I know it's probably pretty small this year but how should we think about that? And then the second question will be water reuse?","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Sure. Yeah. So on the aftermarket service side, we've seen growth of about 5% organically, and it's a pretty good spot to be in. Obviously, we're looking to grow that even more but it's good to have a steady mid-to-high single digit kind of piece of business there that generates margins that are historically about 1.5 times the level of our original equipment sale on the project. So we do believe that we've seen some share gains in that area as well. But hard to quantify and it's a very, very fragmented market. So that is an area of the business that we have prioritized in terms of focusing our teams, our work structure, et cetera to make sure that we get at that to make sure that we win more than our fair share of that aftermarket service business.","On reuse, reuse continues to be a very attractive spot for us in our treatment business. Obviously, the flashpoints in California and other areas that are now looking at reuse as a truly viable alternative whether it'd be to desal or other forms of treatment, it well positions us to play in that sector. It's still a very small piece of our business. And so I wouldn't put too much on it in terms of financial impact in the immediate term, but I think it's a very positive trend line for our business from a technology standpoint.","David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thank you very much.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Thank you.","Phil De Sousa - Xylem, Inc.","Thanks, David.","Operator","Thank you. I'll now turn the floor back over to Patrick Decker for any additional or closing remarks.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Sure. Well, thank you all for joining.

We have a lot to cover, so I\u2019m going to hit on a few highlights from our 2018 results, then I\u2019ll turn it over to Mark to provide some additional details.","As I reflect on this past year, one of the things that stood out to me is the momentum that we built on the topline. We delivered our strongest growth to-date as a public company with 8% organic revenue growth. We saw healthy advances in each of our businesses, with a number of important achievements, including several successful new product launches and strategic project wins. ","We also saw 9% organic orders growth this past year. Fourth quarter orders were up double digits and showed strength across all of our businesses. We see continued strength in our bidding pipelines across the entire company. We see strength across our transport and Applied Water businesses, and it\u2019s worth noting that a growing portion of our orders and recent wins are for longer lead time projects in our treatment, Sensus and AIA businesses. This tells us that our markets appear to be very healthy over the near and long term, and it further strengthens our conviction around our 2019 and longer term growth prospects. ","For Adjusted EBITDA, we saw an improvement of 80 basis points, which was in line with our guidance of 19.5% for the year. Operating margins were slightly short of our guidance for the year at 13.7%, up 60 basis points excluding purchase accounting year-over-year.","We saw benefits from productivity, volume leverage and price realization which accelerated throughout the year. Partially offsetting these gains were inflationary pressures, sales mix and funding our strategic investments. Much of that investment has been focused on our measurement and control solutions segment. This is aimed at capturing significant revenue opportunities across our businesses. The investment also capitalizes on our first mover advantage in providing new digital and analytics solutions. We expect this to moderate as we enter the second half of the year. ","I\u2019m very pleased with the benefits that we are already realizing from this strategy. Since the Sensus acquisition we won more than $100 million in contracts that will provide revenue synergies and we expect to announce another exciting and significant deal this quarter.","Adjusted earnings per share were up 20%. Our full year free cash flow conversion was below our expectations. We took measures in late Q4 to maintain customer service levels impacted by component shortages by building inventory of critical items and we made strategic purchases to manage tariff impacts. We remain confident in our ability to deliver free cash flow conversion at or above 100% in 2019 and beyond. So in summary, while there is certainly areas for us to work on, I am pleased with our strong momentum as we head into 2019. ","Let me now spend a few minutes on the progress we are making our top strategic priorities that enable us to meet our long term financial commitments and maintain the company on a path of sustainable growth and margin expansion. The first is accelerating profitable growth, which encompasses our initiative to drive commercial excellence, grow in emerging markets and further strengthen innovation and technology. ","First commercial excellence: I\u2019m encouraged by market share gains across a number of our business lines. I also want to expand upon our team\u2019s execution on price. We can attribute about one point of the organic growth we saw this past year to our commercial teams pricing efforts, and we see continuing strength throughout 2019. I am very proud of what our sales and marketing teams have demonstrated here in terms of commercial leadership. In emerging markets we delivered 11% revenue growth and orders momentum continued in our key focus markets of China, India and the Middle East. ","Advancing innovation is another core element of our longer term growth strategy. Our team delivered 120 basis point increase and our vitality indexed over 25% and we are pleased by the accretive growth rates and margin profile of these new offerings. ","We\u2019re also excited about a number of new technologies that will bring the market in 2019. These offerings combine our data, analytics and software capabilities with our installed base and this is enabling us to bring in entirely new solutions to our customers and we aim to help them address their biggest challenges or water scarcity, affordability and resilience. ","As I already mentioned, we remain sharply focused on our continuous improvement program. In 2018 we achieved $157 million in savings, a 6% increase in the previous year. We saw plenty of runway on our CI journey and see more efficiency opportunities as we penetrate deeper in the company and across our functions. ","To that end, we are now planning the next stage of our business simplification efforts which we spoke about at our last Investor Day. This is the next progression in our plan, which we timed to avoid disrupting our focus on growth and the integration of new businesses over the last 18 months. This work will now further simplify our business structure, eliminate waste and bureaucracy and allow us to move faster and with greater agility to better serve our customers. ","We will also focus on future manufacturing and supply chain efficiencies, from footprint optimization, SKU rationalization and improvements to our cost of quality. We expect the execution of the majority of these actions to begin in the second half of 2019. ","We estimate up to 100 basis points of savings on a run rate basis, with most of the benefits in 2020 and the balance in 2021. This work reinforces our confidence in achieving our 2020 targets, and it positions us to be more efficient and focused for the long term. ","We continue to put our capital to work in smart disciplined ways. This allows us to develop organically, as well as acquire the solutions we need to best address our customers\u2019 challenges. These investments have focused on disruptive technologies and solutions and we will continue to remain steadfast in our approach in that area. ","We continue to return capital to shareholders, today announcing a 14% increase in the dividend, consistent with our commitment to growing our dividend in line with earnings growth. We are very proud of our talent and we continue to strengthen our team to a number of investments and development programs, strategic hires and the talent that joins us through acquisitions. ","And finally we are a purpose driven company. In 2018 we advanced our commitment to be a company that crates both significant economic and social value. We\u2019ve achieved our original five year sustainability goals one year ahead of schedule, and we are set to release ambitious new goals this spring. ","We\u2019re honored to have been recognized by a number of external organizations for these efforts, yet we can and we will do more. In terms of the solutions we provide, our social impact in areas like disaster relief and our environmental footprint. Sustainability is increasingly important to our people, our customers, our investors and the community and it\u2019s a key priority for Xylem. ","So now let me turn it over Mark. ","Mark Rajkowski","Thanks Patrick. Please turn to slide five and I\u2019ll begin with our full year results. First I\u2019m very pleased with our top line performance this year as we beat the high end of our revenue guidance with 8% organic growth. This reflects strong growth across all of our end markets. ","We also saw robust organic growth in all major regions with emerging markets in the U.S. leading the way at 11% and 9% growth respectively. Our revenue performance benefited from solid underlying market growth, but also from the outstanding work of our commercial teams to gain share and ramp-up our price realization. ","Operating margins for the year were 13.7% up 60 basis points from the prior year excluding purchase accounting impacts. This reflects continued traction in our productivity initiatives which delivered $157 million in savings, as well as volume leverage and exhilarating price realization.","Partially offsetting these improvements were higher levels of inflation, higher investments to drive longer term growth, unfavorable mix and negative currency impacts. Adjusted EBITDA margin was up 80 basis points to 19.5%. We reported adjusted earnings per share this year of $2.88, an increase of 20% and at the higher end of our original 2018 guidance.","Our free cash flow conversion finished below our expectations this year at 64%. Our cash conversion metrics in both 2017 and 2018 were impacted by large non-cash tax items. Excluding these fourth quarter items, our cash conversion was 75% this year, which was below our target.","As Patrick mentioned, the primary driver of this miss was our working capital performance. The timing of our strong sales growth late in the fourth quarter and the impacts of higher raw material inflation and strategic pre-buys of inventory to manage tariffs and component stocks drove working capital higher by $140 million in the quarter. As a result, year-end working capital increased 50 basis points over last year to 19% of sales. ","To give you perspective on the impact that the timing of our Q4 sales and strategic inventory build had on our year-end working capital, our 12 month average cash conversion actually improved by over four days from December 2017. So I\u2019m confident in both the improvements we are making to our working capital processes and that working capital improvement will once again become a source of cash for Xylem in 2019. ","So please turn to slide six, and I\u2019ll review the fourth quarter results. We were pleased and a bit surprised by the strength of the acceleration in demand through the fourth quarter which drove sales above the high end of our outlook. Organic orders were up 10% with high single digit growth in both Water Infrastructure and Applied Water and 18% organic growth in Measurement and Control Solutions. ","Revenues were up 9% organically in the fourth quarter, which was on top of 7% organic growth in the fourth quarter of 2017. Acquisitions contributed 2% growth and foreign exchange was a 3% headwind. ","From an end market perspective, the utility segment was up 10% organically. This growth reflects strength across nearly all regions and applications globally, and is encouraging given the tough compare to the double digit organic growth in last year\u2019s fourth quarter. ","Industrial Markets were up 8%, driven by continued strength in North America, Europe and Latin America. Commercial Markets had a very strong quarter growing 17% with double digit growth in the U.S. and Asia Pacific regions. Certainly some of the strong demand in the U.S. was driven by the timing of announced price increases. As a result we expect to see solid but moderating demand in our commercial business for Q1. ","Our residential business was flat in the quarter. Operating margin for the quarter was 15.1%, which was up 30 basis points versus the prior year excluding purchase account. This was lower than our expectations as continued margin expansion in Water Infrastructure and Applied Water were muted by margin contraction in the MCS segment. I\u2019ll review the details of each segment\u2019s margin performance in a minute. ","Against the backdrop of supply chain challenges from tariffs and constrained electronic components supply, I am very pleased with our team\u2019s performance in delivering earnings per share of $0.88, an increase of 16% year-over-year. ","Please turn to slide seven and I\u2019ll review our segment performance for the quarter. Water Infrastructure orders grew 7% organically year-over-year. This growth was driven by sustained strong demand in North America and emerging markets, particularly in treatment. We exited the quarter with total backlog of $620 million, up approximately 7% organically year-over-year. Of this amount $480 million is due to ship in 2019, which is up 6% on an organic basis. ","Our Treatment Bidding Pipeline group 10% this year, driven heavily by U.S. activity and large projects in India. The Treatment Pipeline remains a strong barometer for us as to the health of the Water Utility market. Water Infrastructure revenues grew 9% year-over-year on an organic basis and foreign exchange was a $24 million headwind. ","Revenue in the emerging markets was up 18% with much of the growth coming from our Treatment business. Particularly noteworthy was the 37% growth in China. We saw more than 40% growth in treatment and more than 30% growth in Transport as we\u2019ve continued to see demand for our products benefit from both the new regulations around water quality, as well as our investments in product localization. ","India was down slightly in the quarter due to the lapping of large custom pump project deliveries in the prior year. With our current backlog in growing project pipeline from new Wastewater Treatment Regulations, we expect India to be our fastest growing market in 2019 with over 30% organic growth. ","Western Europe was up 7% led by high single digit growth in transport, where we saw strong OpEx activity across several countries. This segment grew 4% in the U.S. with solid growth in both the Waste Water Transport market and Industrial Dewatering business. ","Treatment growth was impacted by project delays that moved into the first quarter. We are also encouraged by the high single digit organic orders growth during the quarter. Operating margin for the segment increased 80 basis points to 20.7%, the highest level in our history. This reflects our continued progress in driving the productivity, as well as volume leverage and accelerating price realization. ","Please turn to slide eight. Applied Water orders grew 8% organically over the prior year. Overall we exited the quarter with backlog of $200 million, up 5% organically compared to last year. Our shippable backlog for 2019 is about $185 million, which is up approximately 15% on an organic basis. ","Revenue in the quarter grew 10% organically versus the prior year. The growth was driven by the commercial and industrial end markets, which were up 17% and 7% respectively over the prior year. ","In the U.S. revenue was up 14% year-over-year with growth across all three end markets. Most of that growth was driven by strong project activity and price realization in both our industrial and commercial applications, both of which grew double digits. ","Emerging markets revenue grew 13%, reflecting strong commercial growth in China and India, as well as for industrial applications in Latin America. Segment operating margin in the quarter increased 30 basis points to 17.2% year-over-year. Strong productivity of 390 basis points and price realization of 220 basis points more than offset increased inflation, which was impacted by tariffs and currency impacts. ","Now let\u2019s turn to slide nine. Measurement and Control Solutions orders grew 18% organically over the prior year and revenue grew 11% on an organic basis. For Sensus, revenue in our Water business increased 16% driven by growth in the North American market. ","Our Gas business grew 23% mostly from large North American project deployments. Electric was down 5% in the quarter due to the lapping of project deployments in North America. And our advanced infrastructure analytics business grew high single digits on a pro-forma basis driven by the delivery of projects in the U.S. and Europe. ","We continue to see success in bringing the AIA platform solutions to new markets through existing Xylem channels and relationships, including first time wins in several countries. We are also encouraged by the strong consumer interest in these new solutions and the order growth we saw this past year. ","Now moving to margins, adjusted EBITDA margins in the quarter were down 160 basis points year-over-year to 17.3%. Adjusted operating margin for the segment decreased 280 basis points to 7.5%. We\u2019ve been accelerating our investments in these businesses to drive market share gains with our Sensus solutions and capitalize on our first mover advantage in our Advanced Infrastructure Analytics business. Our investments impacted margins by 270 basis points year-over-year in the quarter and were largely in line with our expectations.","During the quarter and despite the tremendous efforts of our supply chain team, we saw increased supply constraints for electronic components. This impacted both our material costs by an additional 100 basis points and revenue mix by over 100 basis points in the quarter and put more downward pressure on operating margin than expected. ","We will continue to aggressively manage the electronic component pressures to minimize impact to our customers and expect supply constraints the ease after the first half of 2019. We expect component shortages and project mix to continue to impact margins primarily through the first quarter of 2019 with improving mix, moderating investment levels and volume leverage driving strong margin expansion for the second half of 2019 and 100 basis points of improvement for the full year. ","Now let\u2019s turn to slide 10 for an overview of cash flows and the company\u2019s financial position. We closed the quarter with a cash balance of about $300 million. We invested $66 million in capital in the quarter and returned $38 million to our shareholders through dividends. We repaid $200 million of debt in the quarter, bringing our leverage down to 2.7x. This represents the midpoint of our target leverage range which we achieved as planned and for the first time since the Sensus acquisition in 2016, and we remain committed to maintaining our investment grade credit rating. ","I\u2019ve already discussed our working capital performance and my confidence that working capital will be a source of cash flow in 2019 enabling us to deliver cash conversion of at least 105%. ","Please turn to slide 11 and Patrick will cover our 2019 outlook. ","Patrick Decker ","Thanks Mark. As we discussed, we ended the year with solid topline momentum and we are confident in our trajectory and focus on achieving our 2019 targets and long term strategic goals. For 2019 we expect to deliver organic revenue growth of 4% to 6%. Our adjusted operating margin is forecast to expand 100 to 150 basis points to the range of 14.7% to 15.2%. ","Let me pause and acknowledge that we realize one of the keys to achieving our margin expansion in 2019 and staying on track to our 2020 targets is to now begin delivering accretive margin improvement in the MCS segment. ","We expect to drive 100 basis points to margin expansion despite continued investment and component supply cost pressure in the first half of 2019. Now back to the outlook, we expect adjusted EBITDA to improve by 100 to 150 basis points, which will bring it to a range of 20.5% to 21%. ","At the bottom line we expect to generate adjusted full year earnings per share in the range of $3.20 to $3.40. This excludes restructuring and realignment cost of about $30 million. Adjusted EPS growth is projected to be in the range of 11% to 18% for the year. Finally as Mark discussed, we expect to continue to generate solid cash from operations and this will enable us to deliver free cash flow conversion of at least 105% in 2019. ","Please turn to slide 12. Now let\u2019s review the expected end market growth for 2019. First Utilities, which make up about 50% of our revenue, are expected to grow in the mid-single digits. As we saw in 2018, we expect water and wastewater spending to remain healthy, particularly in the U.S. and emerging markets. This includes mid to high single digit growth in our Water Infrastructure business, as well as mid-single digit growth in the MCS business reflecting timing of project deployments. ","In Europe the outlook is mixed and we expect low single digit growth there in total. We are encouraged by the continued infrastructure investments and locations like India, where wastewater regulations are leading our healthy treatment backlog. In both India and China, we expect to grow double digit. ","Our industrial end market which represents roughly 35% of our revenue is expected to be up low to mid-single digits. Growth in the U.S. is expected to moderate slightly in the second half of the year compared to the last two years, however still up mid-single digits. We expect the emerging markets to continue to gain strength in India and Latin America. ","Industrial Applications in the Middle East are expected to soften a bit and we expect China growth to moderate slightly to low to mid-single digits. Our commercial end market which constitutes about 10% of our revenue saw considerable growth in 2017 and 2018. We expect this to remain healthy in 2019. The U.S. and Western Europe will provide low to mid-single digit growth and overall we expect the commercial end market to grow low to mid-single digits in 2019. ","And finally in our smallest end market, Residential, which is about 5% of our revenue, we anticipate low single digit growth. With a flattening U.S. housing market and a highly competitive replacement market, U.S. and European growth is expected at flat to low single digit levels. Emerging markets growth remains healthy as secondary clean water demand continues in China and Greater Asian. ","Now Mark will give you a few additional details on the 2019 outlook. ","Mark Rajkowski ","As we\u2019ve done in prior years, we\u2019re providing the seasonal profile of our business, as well as highlights of our 2019 planning assumptions on slide 13. ","As Patrick discussed, we are guiding to 4% to 6% organic growth for 2019. This breaks down by segment as follows: We expect 5% to 7% growth in Water Infrastructure, 3% to 5% growth in Applied Water Solutions and 4% to 6% growth in Measurement and Control Solutions. We\u2019re assuming a euro rate of 114 which was the average for the month of January. We\u2019ve included our FX sensitivity table in the appendix and our estimated tax rate for 2019 is 19.5%. ","Moving to the first quarter, we expect total company growth in the range of 5% to 6% led by continuing strength in the U.S. municipal market and emerging markets growth. We expect first quarter adjusted operating margin to be in the range of 11.3% to 11.6%, representing 20 to 50 basis points expansion over the prior year. ","While we do expect modest margin expansion for the MCS segment on a quarter sequential basis, we also expect the impacts of the component constraints and mix to continue through the first quarter of 2019. Meanwhile we expect strong margin expansion in both our Water Infrastructure and Applied Water segments, driven by continued cost reductions, volume leverage and improved price realization. ","With that, please turn to slide 14 and I\u2019ll turn the call back over the Patrick for closing comments. ","Patrick Decker ","Thanks Mark. 2018 was a year of solid momentum. We are very encouraged by the health of our end markets, as well as the growth in the organic and inorganic investments that we\u2019ve made. We are also very pleased about the integration of our recent acquisitions, which are allowing us to provide new disrupted solutions. ","We are managing through near term challenges and supply chain disruptions in the marketplace and we are confident in our near and longer term targets based on growth and accretive margins in large deals, as well as the additional opportunity we have to remove cost and inefficiency. We are guiding in 2019 to what we believe is healthy topline growth and margin expansion to execute on our 2020 financial targets. ","Now with that operator, let\u2019s open it up to Q&A. ","Question-And-Answer Session ","Operator","The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions]. The first question will come from Nathan Jones with Stifel.","Nathan Jones","Good morning everyone. ","Patrick Decker","Good morning Nathan. ","Nathan Jones","Let\u2019s just start on the 2020 financial targets. I guess the big one is that17% to 18% operating margin goal, which clearly requires a big ramp-up in margins in 2020. So maybe if you could just give us a little more color on how you get there, what the buckets are that get you from you know \u201819 guidance here to at least at the bottom end of that range in 2020?","Patrick Decker","Sure, so this is Patrick. So I\u2019d say Nate, you know first things first. I mean we believe we have a highly credible 2019 plan that we\u2019ve gotten to hear to get at least 100 basis points expansion this year. Beyond that, let me give you some of the large bucket that we see for 2020. ","First which is the biggest bucket is our savings from continuous improvement and cost take out, and that\u2019s all net of inflations. So that\u2019s our biggest bucket. That\u2019s again continued productivity on our procurement and lean journey. We also have savings that began to wrap late \u201819 into \u201820 from our global business services initiatives, as well as the broader simplification that I outlined in my prepared remarks. ","The second area is again the core volume and price leverage that we expect to get. You know even at the low end of our long term revenue growth guide of 4% to 6%, we expect to see very good margin accretion and leverage flow though there. And then third, is the large deals that we\u2019re getting right now from the Sensus synergies and AIA and those deployments start later this year and really layer on in full fold in 2020. ","Additionally as we commented earlier, our investments in the MCS segment do begin to moderate later in \u201819 and then moderate once again in 2020 from our 2019 levels. So those are the four really big buckets that give us the confidence to be able to hit our marking guidance. ","Nathan Jones","That\u2019s helpful, thanks. Maybe on the MCS investments here, I mean you guys have obviously been investing heavily to drive growth there and demonstrating very good growth all across the portfolio, so I don\u2019t think anybody will have a lot of problems with that. Maybe you can talk a little bit more about the things that have been achieved with those investments, what\u2019s in the pot to come to market, maybe later in \u201819 and into \u201820 to continue to drive growth. ","Mark Rajkowski ","Sure, I\u2019d say with respect to \u2013 first I\u2019d say we continue to invest in all aspects of our portfolio. So we are investing certainly in our Water Infrastructure and our Applied Water businesses as well, especially about bringing new products to market. But specifically within MCS, I think we\u2019re in the early stages of building out our offerings and embedded software and networking services, and really looking to take full advantage of that first mover advantage. And I\u2019d say, given the strength and productivity we\u2019ve had across the entire company. It also affords us the opportunity to accelerate growth and investments in four really areas. ","First is, again building out this new Advanced Infrastructure Analytics Platform; second is, building out new offerings in electric and gas to support some of the large deals that we\u2019ve secured in one there. We are investing in designing specific products and specs for some of the international deals that you\u2019ve heard me talk before about that, we\u2019re pursuing and then again lastly building out a much broader networking and software solution capability. ","Beyond that and in terms of getting any more specifics, I\u2019d probably hold back from there at this point time. There\u2019ll be more to come in that regard, but again, we feel very good about the pipeline of deals that are out there that we are pursuing right now, that really are a result of these new offerings. ","Nathan Jones","Okay, and just one more on CapEx and Mark thanks for the explanation on working capital, that helps a lot on free cash flow. CapEx has increased pretty significantly over the last couple years. I know a lot of that is growth CapEx, localizing production, CapEx for 2019, looks like it staying at about the same level as 2018. Where do you see that shaking out in the long run once you get through kind of this investment cycle to localize and drive growth? ","Mark Rajkowski ","Yeah, I mean that\u2019s a good question and certainly one that we talk about with the team and the Board. I think we are at the upper end when you think about you know capital as a percent of revenue. We have ramped that up. That that has been a function of the investments we make \u2013 we\u2019ve been making. So some of those investments that Patrick talked about just a moment ago is for new products, so there is tooling that we are building; we\u2019ve got a lot invested in engineering and software some of which gets capitalized. ","So clearly when you look at those components and then even dewatering this year. We had a huge ramp-up in demand and we had to build capital in some capacity to meet demand. We are building out our smart hubs in AIA and that requires not only P&L related investment around on the ground support in sales and engineering, but also you need tools, you need PipeDivers, you know SmartBalls, you need trucks and so we\u2019ve really hit a point I think this year and into next year where you are going to see a higher level of investment as a percent to sales and that starts to moderate back to where we\u2019ve been. ","Patrick Decker","You know I would just add Nate, I would say \u2013 again this is Patrick. I would say much like Mark talked about in his prepared comments around working capital and cash conversion I would say the same thing around CapEx and that is there is no structural change here in the capital intensity of this business. It really is the timing around the things that Mark eluded to here and we would expect that to moderate back to kind of normal levels. So nothing that we are particularly concerned about here. ","Nathan Jones","Okay, thanks very much for the help. I\u2019ll pass it on. ","Patrick Decker","Okay. Thank you. ","Operator","The next question will come from Mike Halloran with Baird. ","Mike Halloran","Hey, good morning everyone. ","Patrick Decker","Good morning. ","Mark Rajkowski","Good morning. ","Mike Halloran","So let\u2019s just start on the orders side and the pipeline. Obviously underlying trends remain healthy. It doesn\u2019t sound like there is any sign of slowdown. Maybe you could give a little color on how customers are looking at the world right now. Any hesitancy in in pipeline conversion from their perspective, and any color around that would be great?","Patrick Decker","Sure Mike, this is Patrick. So we are saying you know we are keeping our areas close to the ground obviously on each one of our end marks, so let\u2019s start with utilities. We really aren\u2019t saying or hearing any indications of a slowdown. Again, if you think about the 10% increase in our bidding pipeline and treatment which is a really good indicator and that\u2019s you know, that\u2019s on a very big pipeline. So you know at some point in time you\u2019ll expect that to kind of be tough in terms of year over year compares, but it continues to expand there, and that is consistent whether it be in North America and certainly in the emerging markets as we indicated. ","We think Europe is next. You know it will moderate to kind of low single digit growth in 2019, but we\u2019re not seeing any change in trajectory here, which is quite encouraging. Now we also feel that a fair amount of that is share gains, but again the overall market seem to be healthy. ","On the industrial side, again you know 35% of our total revenue, you know there are channel partners; we go heavily through distribution. They again continue to see strength in the market. Again, we are calling for some moderation here in the second half of this year. We are not seeing that yet, but we are calling it. We are expecting that there will be some tough comps year-over-year that are out there. And so not sure if that\u2019s helpful, but you know we\u2019re not seeing it right now in terms of any slowdown. ","Mark Rajkowski","Just one comment. Yeah, and it\u2019s all good but we are also mindful that you know there\u2019s a chunk of our business that\u2019s short cycled, right and when these things hit, they hit quickly and we are sober to that fact. But as Patrick said we have our antennae up. We are talking to our teams and customers constantly. We are all over the pipeline, so right now we are not seeing those signs. ","Mike Halloran","Sounds good and then another customer question, what\u2019s the receptivity been as you are trying to bring some of these MCS solutions, you know the technology connectivity, analytics to the broader platform, particularly in the infrastructure side. Seems like its good receptive, I know you referenced in the prepared remarks and incremental product offerings coming this year, but love to hear some early thoughts there. ","A - Patrick Decker","Yeah, so we\u2019ve been very encouraged. I think where I start Mike is we are able to have very different kinds of conversations today at different levels of the organization, more senior levels of the organization than we\u2019ve had before, because if you think about any company going in and speaking to, let\u2019s take utility, irrespective of what the utilities biggest challenges are, if you\u2019ve only got one or two products to offer or a couple of pain point you are going to address, you spend your time trying to convince them those are the pain points they need to be addressing. We are able now to go in with confidence and first have a conversation around what are the biggest challenges that you believe you have or that the data shows that you have. With a pretty high likelihood we also then have the product, the technology, the offering to solve that problem and so we\u2019re able to be seen as even more objective and consultative in the conversation. ","Now that\u2019s early days. You know we\u2019re not \u2013 we don\u2019t have that selling capability across the board. I don\u2019t want to get ahead of ourselves, but that\u2019s certainly where we\u2019re going, and so I see a high degree of receptivity from the utility operators and CEO\u2019s, because they want to be able to have that open candid objective conversation. ","You know where we see a lot of the opportunities here, where we see a lot of synergies is new wins and interests across the emerging markets, where you know if they are building new infrastructure, they don\u2019t want to build dominant infrastructure, they want to build smart infrastructure and so they need the help to be able to know how to best optimize that and that\u2019s why we are seeing a lot of the receptivity there. ","And then, you know when you think about the fact that previously Pure and the other advance infrastructure analytic businesses that we\u2019ve acquired were pretty much largely North America and to some extent you know European businesses. Not a lot of presence in the emerging markets and that\u2019s where we\u2019re seeing a lot of the excitement from customers. ","Mike Halloran","That\u2019s helpful, and then last one just the water infrastructure margins, obviously really robust in the quarter. Anything in there that you don\u2019t think is sustainable relative to revenue levels in normal seasonality? ","A - Mark Rajkowski","No, it\u2019s pretty clean. What we saw as a real push on productivity and savings and really kind of a catch up on pricing to offset what had been you know a little bit of a headwind from inflation and really good progress on that, so nothing unusual and we expect to continue to see that, you know those trends in 2019 with more pick up on price. ","Patrick Decker","And I would also just add there that I think it\u2019s important that we know that you know we\u2019re managing a portfolio here and so we\u2019re allocating capital you know every day, every quarter, each year. And so you know we continue to invest in water infrastructure, we continue to invest in applied water. Obviously as we begin to see the ramp up in MCS margins here, that affords us the opportunity to further invest in those two pieces of our portfolio, because there\u2019s a lot in the pipeline from a new product development standpoint and sales and marketing efforts that we\u2019d like to be able to do here, but you know we\u2019ll continue to manage that as a portfolio over time. ","Mike Halloran","Thanks gentlemen. I appreciate it.","Patrick Decker","Thank you. ","Operator","The next question will come from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.","Deane Dray","Thank you. Good morning everyone. ","Patrick Decker","Good morning Deane. ","Deane Dray","Hey, I\u2019d like to start with the free cash flow guidance for 2019, the 105% or better and maybe could you just clarify whether you are baking in any of these working capital inefficiencies at the start of the year or any other tax noise, you know the component shortages that are requiring you to add a bit more to inventories. So any of those dynamics affecting the cash flow outlook? ","Patrick Decker","Yeah, absolutely Deane. We definitely took it on the chin in the quarter relative to some of these strategic you know pre buys, as well as and whether that was for the tariffs or around the component shortages, and you know we also as I mentioned in my prepared remarks saw a big ramp up in volume and quite frankly it was higher than certainly the \u2013 we had forecasted, above the top end of the range and the timing of that in the quarter was such that there were you know \u2013 that was $90 million of cash just in terms of volume. ","And that is going to normalize in both of those items, along with continued progress on improving our processes and efficiency, whether it\u2019s in receivables we\u2019ve got a lot of opportunity on the inventories side of things with supply chain in our S&OP and payables, but those will reverse out in 2019. ","Deane Dray","That\u2019s good. And just sticking around the cash flow side, a couple of points. One is, you all talking about at higher volume at year. You\u2019re right, on the good side of being an outlier, because we\u2019ve heard a number of the industrial companies that aside, just the opposite that there was a lot of fall off in December, so you\u2019ve got that high quality problem of handling that $90 million, so that\u2019s a positive. What about CapEx? How much for this year? Any particular projects that you would highlight in terms of investment? ","Mark Rajkowski","Right, I think you know we really pushed hard and we did spend capital to grow out our AIA platform as I mentioned. We\u2019ve been running hard in terms of our engineering development around a number of software components and products that ended up as capitalized software. ","And back to your point about nice problem to have, the demand in our dewatering business has really been running high, so we\u2019ve had to add capacity to the fleet as well. So those are nice problems to have, but certainly things that we needed to respond to. As we look out in 2019 though Deane, we will \u2013 the investment level, we expect to remain flat. Part of that is a function of getting that ahead of the curve, which we did in you know the back part of 2018.","Patrick Decker","Yeah, and I think to your question Deane around, you know are there any specific projects to be called out in 2019, one of the reasons why you know we\u2019re not able to say that it\u2019s moderating or declining is because we also need to absorb and it\u2019s not a big ticket item, but you know we\u2019re going to be you know likely kicking off another greenfield expansion in India in terms of manufacturing capacity. ","Now that won\u2019t all hit in \u201819, but we\u2019re certainly going to be starting that in \u201819. It\u2019s not a big ticket item in and of itself, but it\u2019s enough to kind of hold these numbers flat year-over-year and that\u2019s just really again to get ahead of the incredible demand we\u2019re seeing in India. ","Deane Dray","That\u2019s great to hear about those investment opportunities and if we were looking at that free cash flow target for the year of that, it feels to us that there is further upside to that 105%, but we\u2019ll see how this develops. And then as a follow-up\u2026 ","Patrick Decker","I can assure you Deane, we\u2019re working at it. So you know it will\u2026","Deane Dray","I hear that.","Patrick Decker","We were disappointed in Q4, right, so it got our attention on the working capital side. ","Deane Dray","Good, and then in terms of the organic revenue guidance, everything looked pretty much as expected if not a little bit better. The one that kind of jumps out at me is MCS. The four to six seems like they could be doing better and maybe it\u2019s because we\u2019re all excited about the opportunities in AIA. Maybe that they don\u2019t move the needle enough yet, but what is that upside at MCS that could potentially do better than what you\u2019re forecasting today? ","Patrick Decker","Yes, so the AIA platform is still a you know relatively small chunk of revenue for us at you know north of $100 million of revenue and that is going to be growing a very healthy double digit and is accelerating in 2019 versus \u201818, both orders and revenue. It really is the centerpiece of the platform and really Deane, it\u2019s just very straight forward; its assumptions around timing on project deployments. ","So you know we\u2019ve got some very large deals that we\u2019ve won. We have some that we are likely going to be announcing here in very short order. It just comes down to when those things hit. Most of them we believe will hit in 2020, which is what gives us great confidence around our margin expansion and growth in 2020. So obviously the timing of those things could move this around, but we are giving you our view kind of right down the middle of fairway right now. ","Deane Dray","Great, thank you. ","Patrick Decker","Thank you. ","Operator","The next question will come from John Walsh with Credit Suisse.","John Walsh","Hi, good morning. ","A - Patrick Decker","Good morning John. ","John Walsh","So maybe just following back to that 2020 margin question, if I could ask it a little bit differently. So since you provided those targets, you\u2019ve had FX tariffs, you\u2019ve been getting some deals done. I believe that was an organic number and didn\u2019t contemplate deal dilution at that time. Just wondering if you are filling this bridge with things that would have been sitting in a contingency bucket or if you are filling it by kind of over executing on other parts of the plan to you know think about this as not really an end point, but you know as the step to drive margins you know higher beyond, you know that kind of range over time. ","Patrick Decker","Yeah, and I\u2019d say \u2013 sorry, this is Patrick. Sorry for that. No, it\u2019s a great angle on the question John. The way I would articulate it would be, yes there are things that have created \u2013 leveled the dilution on their own, that being deals and things of that nature from an on margin standpoint, and this is a journey over time you know. It doesn\u2019t end in 2020 and obviously it won\u2019t be long and we\u2019ll be giving you targets beyond 2020.","What I would say has changed here are a couple of things that give us the confidence. One is that, we do see further opportunities to drive simplification and efficiency across the organization. Part of that obviously is by way of some of the integration synergies from the deals that we\u2019ve done, part of that is just simplification of our heritage businesses by further integration there and simplification. So certainly we are leaning on that level harder than we had necessarily laid out at our original Investor Day, but it\u2019s based on opportunity.","Two, as we\u2019ve added other you know assets to the portfolio and we are getting more mature on our own continuous improvement, you know the whole lean deployment journey, we are now able to deploy those capabilities across those new assets and so you now we\u2019ve got a bigger pie to play with here in terms of driving efficiency, both on the lean sig sigma side, but also on the procurement side. ","So those are the area that I would say that we are feeling even more confident about. And then, you know what we indicated at Investor Day was that as we integrated Sensus, we would get a better feel over time as to what the investment profile would look like on a year-by-year basis and so that moderates now that we are getting traction and you know seeing the benefits of what we\u2019ve already spent on. ","Mark Rajkowski","And I\u2019d just add to that, yeah we \u2013 you know in terms of the investments, if you look at the model, we\u2019ve run heavier, sooner because of some of these opportunities and let those moderate. Also in the model we didn\u2019t have as much inflation built in and we really \u2013 you know we really got hit hard this year and we\u2019ve ramped up price and we\u2019re going to be continuing to drive that into 2019. So there\u2019s more there than we anticipated in the model as well, yeah. ","John Walsh","Got you, and then maybe just to follow on that, you know when you think about price, there\u2019s obviously what you can get because of you know inflation where you are kind of passing through these costs, but you know there\u2019s been a big kind of concerted effort to increase you know your pricing entitlement right, from what you are doing from a technology perspective, value based pricing. Can you talk about how \u2013 you know if you had to deconstruct the price, you know where \u2013 what\u2019s more kind of value added, Xylem price versus you know kind of material or inflation related. ","A - Patrick Decker","Yeah, I would say you know it\u2019s obviously hard to put a specific number on that, but I would say that directionally if I use the 80\/20 rule here, yeah I\u2019d say it\u2019s still 80% is just you know brute force, get out there, leverage the fact that we got to drive price to cover inflation, cover the tariffs, you know those kinds of issues. ","While at the same time certainly in each one of our businesses, at least the three segments, what I\u2019ve been really encouraged by is the highly accretive margin profile of the new products that we\u2019ve been bringing to market, whether they be products for different business models and that\u2019s more of a big criteria and our new product development pipeline is, it\u2019s got to be accretive in terms of growth rate, but also margin for the company. So I\u2019d say that\u2019s the kind of 20% if I picked a number to say that it\u2019s been more value based pricing capability. ","Mark Rajkowski","And also the opportunity I think.","Patrick Decker","Yes.","John Walsh","Great, thank you. ","Patrick Decker","Thank you. ","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. The next question will come from Ryan Connors with Boenning & Scattergood. ","Ryan Connors","Great, thank you. I want to actually stick with that very theme you were just talking about there and then talk about the flipside of price costs, and get your thoughts on you know if we do go into an environment of where raw material costs are more moderating than ramping up, you know how does that impact your guidance assumption around margin. You are talking 100 and 150 basis points of margin upside, you know if pricing \u2013 to what extent can pricing be sticky and if raw materials come down is there upside to that? ","Mark Rajkowski ","Yes, so Ryan I think historically in these businesses as we\u2019ve gone back and looked at it, pricing has been pretty sticky. You know when you\u2019ve gone to an inflationary period and you\u2019ve gotten price, its unusual then been seen as giving it away. Obviously there\u2019s probably someone that fringed the margin, but it\u2019s not a step function change. ","So if we were to see an auto moderating inflation or slowing down of cost pressures there, we would expect that to be sum of that level of benefit; hard to put a number on it. At this point in time it obviously depends on how much that price cost dynamic moves, but it should be a net positive for us. ","Ryan Connors","Got it. And then my other question, just wanted to probe on China a little bit and we buy the story there of the new regulations and whatnot, but just wanted to kind of play devil\u2019s advocate and get your response to the fact that you know the strength is coming from treatment which is generally a longer cycle business, and might it \u2013 what would you say to the argument that you know maybe it\u2019s going to stay stronger for a little longer, it will roll slower than you know some of the shorter cycle industrial businesses out there. And then so just want to get your thoughts on that dynamic?","Patrick Decker","Yeah, so to you know kind of breakdown China a bit here. So again we are expecting double digit growth in 2019, which dose moderate slightly from the 23% growth that we had in \u201818, but it\u2019s still going to be \u2013 we expect strong double digit growth. ","Now as you as you probably recall, we actually \u2013 two-thirds of our revenue in China is in the utility space, and that\u2019s historically been pretty well protected. So when you think back what two, three years ago when companies were going through the shock in China and the downturn, we in the aggregate were down slightly, but even within that our utility business never declined, you know it grew throughout that cycle. It slowed, but it grew. It was the industrial and commercial piece of the business, the other third that took the big hit like our other industrial peers. ","So your thesis is absolute correct in that one, the long lead time nature of the treatment orders and pipeline is what gives us great confidence that you know we don\u2019t see an overall slowdown impacting us in China in \u201819 certainly on the utility side of the business. Secondly, we\u2019re seeing very good growth in transport, you know on the pumping, on the waste water pumping side, which is very good margin business. That is more near term, short cycle business that remains strong. ","We are not prognosticating here, but we are building into our guide some slowdown in the industrial and commercial building piece of the market in the second half of the year, which is what really kind of helps moderate our growth from 2018. I shouldn\u2019t say help, but leads to that along the way. But the other lever we got there is this new AIA platform. I mean we\u2019ve got tremendous adoption across the Chinese customer base in terms of excitement in that area. Again, a small piece of business, but very promising for \u201819 and beyond. ","Ryan Connors","Okay, great stuff. Thanks for your time. ","Patrick Decker","Thank you. ","Operator","The next question will come from Joe Giordano with Cowen.","Joe Giordano","Hey guys, good morning. ","Patrick Decker","Good morning Joe. ","Joe Giordano","Hey, so I don\u2019t want to keep talking about margins, but I\u2019m going to, so apologies here. If I look at \u201819 right, so the operating guide, I think at the mid-point it\u2019s something like 60% incrementals and then to get from there to 20 is another roughly 250 just to the bottom end of that where you\u2019d have infrastructure already at a pretty high level. ","I fully appreciate the comments about MCS and the spending and things like that, that will moderate and lapping some of the big comps. But I guess I\u2019m getting to \u2013 it seems a lot easier to get there on EBITDA and if you were in a situation where you hit EBITDA guidance \u2013 EBITDA 2020 guidance, but are a little light on the operating side. Internally in the way that you\u2019re running your business, is that a win, is that something that you\u2019re driving towards in that way or you are meeting it but optically on the operating side it\u2019s a little different. ","Patrick Decker","No, we\u2019re going after the operating peace. I mean we lay out the EBITDA just because there is noise in there and you know deal accounting and things of that nature, but no we are measured on operating income, that\u2019s a third of our annual incentive plan. The other third is organic revenue growth and the other third is working capital. And so you know we\u2019re \u2013 that\u2019s the way we are playing it Joe. ","Mark Rajkowski","And I would say that for 2019 we are going to continue to see good volume leverage. We are going to continue to drive price acceleration and that ramped up nicely throughout the course of the year. I mean we started Q1 at 20; we ended Q4 at 140 basis points, so that\u2019s a big element. ","We continue to drive productivity and we\u2019ve got the actions and opportunities that Patrick talked about. We haven\u2019t seen the ramp yet from global business services. So, there is a number of levers that we have that are going to be driving our operating margin expansion, which will play through to EBITDA as well.","Jo Giordano","Fair enough. When you talk about China, you guys just kind of guiding to it, can you size the China and India business for you guys right now?","Patrick Decker","Sure. Yeah, so China has now become our second largest market outside of the U.S., albeit still relatively small. So our revenue in China is roughly about $300 million and that was about $170 million just a few years ago, just to give you a feel. So again, still not large numbers in the absolute, but growing very nicely. ","India is just under $100 million of revenue, with an order book that is well above that here in 2019, but India is still a relatively small piece of our overall revenue, but just again going to be our fastest growing market in \u201819 and \u201820.","Operator","The next question is from Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James.","Pavel Molchanov","Hey guys, thanks for taking the question. On the M&A front you\u2019ve obviously been quite active this past year. As you\u2019re looking at valuations of prospective deals across the three segments, two kind of inter-linked questions. Number one, are those deal multiples higher than what perhaps they have been over the past year and secondly, among the three segments which in your judgment present the most attractive M&A prospectivity today?","Patrick Decker","Sure. Yes, so we\u2019ve not seen \u2013 I guess first of all the kind of deals that we do, you know I\u2019m very proud of our M&A team and our folks in the businesses as to how they cultivate these deal opportunities and relationships, which has proven over time to help keep the multiples either in a really attractive spot or in a manageable spot, and so we\u2019ve not seen any big move or expansion in multiples.","By having said that, not for those reasons you also though haven\u2019t seen us do a deal in the last 12 months, and so it\u2019s kind of hard to say at this point in time, as to what there maybe is a gap between seller and buyer expectations. But we\u2019re not seeing any big move there at this point in time. ","In terms of the question around the three segments, first of all we like all three, they each have interesting opportunities, but they play different roles, and so I would say that if you look at our Water Infrastructure space and you look at our MCS space, that\u2019s largely around the utility and I think there you will continue to see us do smaller bolt on tuck-ins to build out this new analytics platform, as well as strengthen the digital offerings of our product lines along the way, but they are not going to move the needle in terms of capital outlet, based on what we have line of sight to today. ","But then when I turn to the Applied Water segment, and you think about our industrial water business there, we see potentially attractive opportunities in that space to further move that business up the technology curve and round out our solutions offering in that set. So there are opportunities across the board. Obviously we are prioritizing the digital and software component, but that\u2019s not at the exclusion of also defending our core product offerings when the opportunity presents itself.","Pavel Molchanov","Alright. I appreciate it, guys.","Patrick Decker","Thank you.","Operator","The final question is from Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Lee","Hey guys, good morning. Thanks for taking the question and squeezing me in here.","Patrick Decker","Good morning, Brian.","Brian Lee","Good morning. Maybe a couple of modeling questions here. First on MCS, it does look like the growth derating here near-term in Q1 and then you did mention some of the bigger deployments later this year, but maybe more fully materializing in 2020. So is it fair to say 2019 is a bit of a normalization year in terms of MCS growth and you\u2019d see acceleration in 2020 or do you actually think you can do better growth second half versus first half, even this year with the comps being tougher as you move into the back half?","Mark Rajkowski","Yes Brian, this is Mark and Patrick had mentioned it I think briefly in the opening remarks, but also in response to a question. I wouldn\u2019t call 5% to 6% normalization. It really reflects timing of some of the large deployments we\u2019ve had and you\u2019ve seen some of the big wins, the orders growth and what\u2019s happening here is really just the timing of when those projects get deployed. And so we do expect a little better growth rate in the back half of 2019 and certainly into 2020. We expect to see significant acceleration of revenue growth.","Brian Lee","Okay, fair enough and then second question just on the free cash flow topic, I know there\u2019s been a number of questions here, but if you just look through the first nine months of the year for \u201818, you were at 60% conversion and that was already tracking well below the levels that you were at the past two years at the same points in each of those respective years. ","So wondering, you know why was 4Q shaping up to be such a swing factor for free cash flow conversion this year, and was it all timing related or was there something else at play in \u201818 and then maybe just to round it out, why doesn\u2019t that repeat in \u201819? Thank you.","Mark Rajkowski","Yes, sure Brian, good question. Typically, we generate a lot of cash in Q4. I mean it\u2019s our best quarter and so what happened this year, a couple of things and one is timing around the very strong growth we saw later in the fourth quarter, and that was a $90 million impact on its own in terms of cash related to sales and receivables. ","And then as things got a little bit more pressured in terms of the component shortages, we \u2013 the teams got aggressive and we made some strategic buys there, as well as some more on the \u2013 you know related to tariffs to lock in better pricing. And both of those factors will work through. It will be a source of cash in 2019, and we do expect \u2013 we don\u2019t expect those to be recurring, and we expect a more normalized picture around our cash flow profile in 2019.","Patrick Decker","Yes Brian, I would just maybe wrap up that question with an additional view. Your question around maybe tracking below the previous year through the first nine months, that was really being driven by a couple of things. ","So we were tracking very well from a working capital improvement year-over-year standpoint through the first nine months of the year, and so as a result of that, we were also confident in our ability to fund some of the CapEx that Mark alluded to around the dewatering fleet, the cap software in Sensus, smart hubs in AIA and then that\u2019s what drove some of the year-over-year declines in the first nine months. ","But we were expecting before we had these issues that Mark laid out around the supply chain constraints and just a big pop in receivables in December because of a heavy revenue month, we were expecting to be able to claw that back and be at or above 100% free cash flow conversion. , and that really was the surprise for us. ","So, that\u2019s on us, we own it. We are rectifying it and we\u2019re highly confident we\u2019re going to be at or above the 100% in \u201819 and well beyond. There is no structural change here.","Operator","At this time I would like to turn the conference back over to Patrick Decker for any closing comments.","Patrick Decker","Alright, well again, thank you everybody. Safe travels. I appreciate your continued interest and support. See you out on the road, and we\u2019ll talk to you again after our Q1 earnings call.

At this time, all participants have been placed on a listen-only mode and the floor will be open for your questions following the presentation [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the call over to Matt Latino, Senior Director of Investor Relations.","Matt Latino","Thank you, Maria. Good morning everyone and welcome to Xylem's second quarter earnings conference call. With me today are Chief Executive Officer, Patrick Decker and Chief Financial Officer, Mark Rajkowski. They will provide their perspective on Xylem's second quarter 2019 results.","Following our prepared remarks, we will address questions related to the information covered on the call. I will ask that you please keep to one question and a follow-up and then return to the queue. As a reminder, this call and our webcast are accompanied by a slide presentation available in the Investors section of our website at www.xylem.com.

For purposes of today's call, all references will be on an adjusted basis unless otherwise indicated, and non-GAAP financials have been reconciled for you and are included in the appendix section of the presentation.","Now, please turn to slide four, and I will turn the call over to our CEO, Patrick Decker.","Patrick Decker","Thanks, Matt. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss our second quarter results. Overall, we are pleased with our performance in the quarter which reflect a continued strong revenue growth and margin expansion. Our organic topline growth was broad based driven by solid demand across our end markets and with orders and revenue growth tracking in the mid-single digits. This result marks our eighth consecutive quarter of at least mid-single-digit organic revenue growth.","This reflects the results of our focused investments that are bringing new solutions to the water sector and we believe will drive sustainable attractive margins. We also delivered solid margin expansion of 50 basis points in line with our guidance. In addition, we delivered earnings per share of $0.79 which was also in line with our expectations. That represented a 10% year-over-year increase excluding foreign exchange translation.","As a result of sustained continuing healthy growth, we are narrowing our organic revenue guide and raising the midpoint to the upper end of the range. As a result of near-term mix and targeted investments to accelerate and sustain our growth, we are narrowing our EPS guide to the lower end of the range. We'll get into each of them in a bit more detail.","Looking at the composition of our top line, our regional end-market mix is robust. We turn in solid performance in each of our end markets led by high single digit growth in both utilities and commercial. Regionally, we delivered particularly strong momentum in the US and in our largest emerging markets China and India, each of which grew double digits organically. The high growth in China and India is very pleasing, given we've invested considerably in product localization and our investments there are clearly paying off.","Europe has seen some softening in certain markets, most considerably Italy and Germany driven by broad based industrial weakness. Generally, the rest of Europe shows a steadier picture. Mark will take us into the segment detail in a moment, but I would like to quickly point out that all three segments of our business have turned in solid performances. However, there is a more dynamic picture in MCS. We're very happy with the progress and growth of our Sensus business. Its revenue growth is outpacing Xylem overall, turning a 9% global growth in the quarter and solid double digits in North America.","Our new AIA platform in MCS is in an earlier phase with growth ramp. The acceleration of customer interest is reflected in a 60% expansion of the total AIA deal pipeline over the past 12 months, led by a doubling of opportunities within the new digital solutions portion of that platform.","Moreover, the size and incremental margin profile of that pipeline is very attractive and will be highly accretive to Xylem. The conversion of project to revenue has been slower than expected however. As with any new disruptive technology, our digital platform represents a new approach for customers. So many are prudently taking time to validate the solutions and savings.","As that validation progresses, we are in fact seeing expansions of project scope. Despite slower conversion, the expanding market opportunity we are uncovering continues to affirm our long-term investment thesis. Our approach is to invest just ahead of the adoption curve in order to be positioned to realize the benefit of our first mover advantage and bringing digital intelligence to the water sector. To that end, we are scaling our sales and marketing capacity and continuing to add incremental capabilities to the AIA platform both organically and through M&A as we build out and integrate the portfolio.","Lastly, before turning over to Mark, I do want to take this opportunity to shine a light on our commitment to sustainability. In developing our new 2025 goals, we took a bold aspirational approach in many industries and business models positive sustainability outcomes are a cost of doing business. For Xylem positive sustainability outcomes are a result of doing business. The technology that we sell address water scarcity, water affordability and resilience to climate change, all while dramatically reducing our customer's energy consumption.","So the more business we do, the more technology we deploy, the more sustainability benefit we generate for the customers and the communities that we serve. The complete list of our commitments is in our sustainability report and a summary of our five signature goals is in the appendix of this earnings package. They are commitments to our shareholders and stakeholders alike, every bit as strong is our commitment to deliver robust growth and financial returns.","Now let me turn over to Mark.","Mark Rajkowski","Thanks, Patrick. Please turn to slide five and I'll begin with our second quarter results. Our overall growth momentum continued in the second quarter with organic revenues up 5% Organic orders were also solid up 4% on a tough comparison of 8% growth last year. Most geographies saw healthy revenue growth led by the US, China, India and Australia which each grew double digits.","However, we did have some specific pockets of slowing within Europe and Latin America due to negative prevailing economic conditions which we expect to continue into the second half of the year. All end markets saw positive organic revenue growth led by 8% in utilities, which was on top of a tough comparison of 11% growth in 2018. This was supported by mid-teens growth in the US where we saw robust growth across both the OpEx and CapEx sides of our utilities business.","Industrial market was up 2%. Healthy project business and price realization in the U.S. combined with the continuation of strong construction and mining activity in our dewatering business was partially offset by moderating industrial demand in several regions. Continued strength in the US and double-digit growth in emerging markets drove commercial market revenues up 7% year-over-year.","The residential market grew 1% which was in line with our expectations. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter expanded 50 basis points to 14.3%. This was primarily driven by 280 basis points of cost savings from our productivity programs and 200 basis points of price realization which more than offset inflation, unfavorable mix and provided funding for our growth investments. Earnings per share was $0.79 in the quarter up 10% versus the prior year excluding foreign currency translations.","Please turn to slide six, and I'll review our segment results. Water infrastructure maintained its top line growth momentum with 4% organic orders and 6% organic revenue growth in the quarter. It's worth noting this performance was on top of a tough comparison of an 11% revenue increase last year. Segment backlog was up 2% to $684 million at the end of the quarter with $449 million shippable this year.","While our shippable backlog for the remainder of 2019 is flat, for 2020 and beyond it is up 10% organically, a very positive sign for future growth momentum in the segment. The US market was up mid-teens in both the utility and industrial end markets. Several large CapEx treatment projects and steady OpEx spending drove our strong utilities performance.","Industrial was driven by another strong quarter from dewatering which continues to benefit from a healthy construction and rental market. Emerging markets were up 3% driven primarily by double digit growth in China more than offsetting declining demand due to economic weakness in Latin America and project timing in the Middle East.","Western Europe declined 1% overall, reflecting low-single-digit growth in utilities, which was more than offset by softness in the industrial market. Segment operating margins grew 130 basis points to 19.1% driven by productivity savings price realization and volume leverage. I'm very pleased with the work the teams have been doing to continue to drive cost savings capture further price and share to fund our growth investments and expand margins.","Please turn to slide seven, the applied water systems segment delivered 4% organic revenue growth and 1% organic orders growth in the quarter. Steady order activity in North America and Asia was largely offset by slowing orders in Europe. Overall backlog was $216 million at the end of the quarter, $175 million is expected to ship this year which is up 5% organically year-over-year.","Geographically, Applied Water results were led by the U.S., up 7%, with growth across all end markets. Results were mixed in emerging markets, which were up 2% overall, led by double-digit growth in China, partially offset by declines in Latin America and the Middle East. Western Europe was down 4%, primarily from lower market demand, reflecting economic weakness in certain countries. End market revenue growth was led by commercial which was up 7%, while industrial revenues increased 1%. Growth in both end markets was driven primarily by delivering on a healthy project pipeline and price realization in the U.S.","Segment operating margins were 16.8%. Inflation negatively impacted the segment's margins by 450 basis points, which included roughly 100 basis points of tariff-related cost. However, the team did an outstanding job capturing 350 basis points of price realization and driving 320 basis points of productivity to deliver 60 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter. Now please turn to slide eight.","Measurement & Control Solutions grew orders 7% in the quarter and delivered 6% organic revenue growth. Segment backlog grew double digits year-over-year to $964 million, with $340 million expected to ship this year. As Patrick mentioned earlier, we continue to see strong momentum within Sensus, especially the North American water business, which grew nearly 20% in the quarter. Software and services revenues were down 9%, primarily due to the lapping of a large high-margin software sale in Europe last year.","The energy business grew 4% despite lapping last year's large Alliant project deployment and our test business revenues were up 1%. Segment operating margins were 8.7%, 40 basis points below the previous year and modestly below our expectations. Adjusted EBITDA margins were down 30 basis points to 18.2%. Higher volume, price realization and productivity were more than offset by unfavorable mix in investments to grow our new AIA platform as well as pursue large AMI deployments.","There are few moving parts to the MCS margins story that are important to unpack to understand the dynamics and relevant trajectory of the components within the segment. Our Sensus business had a terrific quarter. Organic revenues grew 9% and orders grew 13%. Sensus EBITDA margins of 20% expanded 180 basis points driven by volume leverage, price realization and productivity savings.","Revenues across the AIA platform were down low single digits primarily due to delays in converting several large projects. This also had a meaningful impact on segment margins compared to our expectations as the digital solution revenues have a very attractive margin profile.","Despite the delay in converting projects to revenues in the quarter, we continue to invest to scale our digital solutions business globally to position us to leverage our first-mover advantage. Year-over-year investments to build out our digital intelligence solutions as well as global commercial and service capabilities reduced segment margins by about 100 basis points in the quarter.","Importantly, we see very strong customer engagement and growing interest in our expanding digital solutions project pipeline. And we continue to expect this business will be an important source of revenue growth in margin expansion for the future.","Please turn to slide nine for an overview of the company's financial position. Our cash balance at the end of the quarter was $383 million. We returned $43 million to our shareholders in the quarter through dividends. $60 million was invested in CapEx, which is in line with our plan, and we continue to expect our full year CapEx spend to be between $230 million and $240 million.","Our working capital in the second quarter increased 160 basis points year-over-year to 21.1%. This primarily reflects timing as we continue to be impacted by inventory price at the end of the prior year as well as inventory build in the first quarter related to tariffs and Brexit. This will be worked down through the back half of this year.","Free cash flow conversion in the quarter was 45%, which improved the quarter sequentially but is below the prior year, largely reflecting the year-over-year timing related to working capital in CapEx investments as well as higher cash tax payments we made in the second quarter of 2019.","Keep in mind, that the first half of the year is a seasonally weaker cash flow period than the second half, where we have historically generated between 75% and 90% of our full year cash flow. We continue to forecast improvement as the year progresses, and we remain committed to our target of 105% cash conversion for the year. Please turn to slide 10, and Patrick will cover our 2019 end market outlook.","Patrick Decker","Thanks, Mark. Our view on end markets for the remainder of the year include some small changes in the guidance we provided last quarter, and we will now be narrowing to the upper end of our original growth guidance range. Our healthy orders and backlog support confidence in our growth expectations for the balance of the year and beyond.","In the utilities market, we now expect mid to high single-digit growth, led by a solid U.S. where a healthy aftermarket environment and our project and deal pipeline and water infrastructure in Sensus provide confidence in our outlook. The regulatory mandates and core infrastructure investments in China and India are also expected to continue.","In industrial, we now believe our growth outlook is closer to the low single digits. While the U.S. market continues to be steady and our Applied Water project pipeline remains robust, we do expect there to be some moderation in the second half. We're also seeing weaker economic conditions in certain European countries, which we believe will impact us through the balance of the year.","Our outlook for the commercial market remains unchanged at mid-single digits. Our residential outlook is now flat to low single-digit growth. Please turn to slide 11, and we will provide guidance for the remainder of 2019. We started in the first half of the year with strong top line growth of 6% and continue to expect to deliver organic revenue growth in the mid-single digits of 4% to 5% in the second half and 5% to 6% for the full year.","We're adjusting our operating margin outlook to a range of 14.3% to 14.5%. This represents healthy expansion of 60 to 80 basis points. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in a range of 20% to 20.2%. This updated outlook takes into account our performance to date and also reflect the softer growth in Europe and project conversion timing in our AIA business. Having said that, we will continue to drive healthy margin expansion across our entire platform so that we deliver our commitments for this year and beyond.","Moving on to adjusted earnings per share. We're narrowing our outlook to a range of $3.12 to $3.22, which reflects the items I just mentioned regarding margin. This represents year-over-year growth of between 8% and 12%. Finally, we continue to expect 105% free cash flow conversion, and we're executing on our plans. Let me now turn it back over to Mark to walk through some of our other full year and third quarter details.","Mark Rajkowski","Thanks, Patrick. Slide 12 includes a seasonal profile of our business as well as highlights of our planning assumptions. By segment, we are narrowing our full year organic revenue growth guidance as follows: we expect 6% to 7% organic growth in Water Infrastructure; 3% to 4% in Applied Water; and 5% to 6% growth in Measurement & Control Solutions. We have lowered our full year estimated effective tax rate from 19.5% to 19%. We continue to assume a euro rate of 1.12, and as usual, our FX sensitivity table is located in the appendix. Our restructuring and realignment costs of $60 million to $70 million remain unchanged for the full year.","In the third quarter, we expect an overall company growth rate of 4% to 5%, led by steady U.S. utility market and continued growth in China and India. Our expected growth rates for the third quarter by segment are 4% to 5% in Water Infrastructure; 3% to 4% in Applied Water; and 5% to 6% for Measurement & Control Solutions.","Third quarter adjusted operating margin is expected to be in the range of 15% to 15.1%, representing 40 or 50 basis points of expansion over the prior year. Measurement & Control Solutions is expected to expand segment margins 20 to 40 basis points in the quarter. We expect 40 to 60 basis points of margin expansion in Water Infrastructure and 30 to 50 basis points of improvement in Applied Water systems.","Now please turn to slide 13, and I'll turn the call back over to Patrick for closing comments.","Patrick Decker","So to wrap up, we are demonstrating solid and consistent growth with healthy margin expansion. We're pleased that our teams are working hard to outperform the market, enabling us to meet our financial commitments, while also continuing to invest in future growth. We have healthy top line momentum and strong project backlog, which gives confidence in continuing mid-single-digits revenue growth through the second half into 2020 and beyond as we continue to drive solid margin expansion.","In that regard, we also look forward to providing you with an updated view of our long-term targets and strategy at our 2020 Investor Day, which we are targeting to be sometime early next year. We will have more details to come on this in our third quarter earnings update. So with that, operator, we are happy to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of Nathan Jones of Stifel.","Nathan Jones","Good morning, everyone.","Patrick Decker","Hey, good morning, Nate.","Mark Rajkowski","Good morning, Nate.","Nathan Jones","I'd like to talk a little bit more about the reduction in the margin guidance here. There's no change to the restructuring and realignment costs that the revenue numbers here is still pretty strong. So, it doesn't look like you see anything structurally that needs to be addressed in the business.","So maybe if we could start with AIA because you guys called out mix and investments as the two main causes for the reduction here. Can you talk about the investment trajectory in AIA? I think it was supposed to begin to ramp down as we went into the back half of the year. Is this related to delays in the projects ramping up? Or is it because you see more opportunities to go off that? Just some color around that.","Patrick Decker","Sure. I'll take that first, Nate. I think it might be helpful for folks to understand kind of what's the waterfall and bridge on the net EPS reduction in terms of lowering the lower end of the guidance range. You're really looking at about $0.04 is coming from, again, the weaker Europe, just given how rich that margin is on our businesses, so we are reflecting that into our guide right now.","Secondly, probably about $0.04 attributable to AIA, and that is a combination of the slower ramp in terms of converting projects to revenue than we expected, although we are seeing scoped increase and we're seeing the funnel, as I mentioned before, has more than doubled in the digital solutions piece of that platform, so we're very encouraged. And based upon that, we are holding our investments.","So, there's a little bit more in there, but we have four investment that we had originally talked about. And then the way we have been mitigating that $0.08 of kind of impact is about $0.03 coming from stronger performance, most notably in the U.S. utility market that we expect to continue through the balance of the year.","Mark Rajkowski","I mean, we've talked about that on our last call and we have a number of actions that are well underway related to simplifying the organization, improving our speed and agility. And those are tracking to our expectations.","Nathan Jones","Maybe another one on AIA here. I think the anticipation from these projects is that they began to ramp-up kind of later in 2019 and really started to hit stride in 2020, and drove some pretty good growth, potentially double-digit growth in the MCS segment next year. Does that push this out a little bit? Do you still see those ramping up later in the year? Is that kind of number in 2020 still in play? Or has it shifted to the right a little bit here?","Patrick Decker","No. I'd say it's still in play for 2020. And what we also see, we step back and I think you've done a good job, Nate, in kind of parsing. There are two pieces of this MCS segment, and I think folks oftentimes lump them all together. Two very different pieces.","There's Sensus, which is really being driven by good core North America water growth, which is a combination of day-to-day business but also we are seeing -- we're winning a number of AMI, large AMI deals in that space. And so that's certainly going to drive very strong growth late this year in MCS, but also certainly in 2020 and beyond.","The second piece is AIA, and even with an AIA, there is the traditional core, the pure business that we acquired. But there are also a number of these smaller, about 7 of this smaller technology we've acquired in the last few years that we build out to be our digital solutions platform in that business. And that's really the -- and our core pure business actually continue to grow nicely and pretty much on plan or above plan in the quarter and for the full year.","Really, that new digital solutions platform that we're seeing tremendous uptick in the funnel, but converting those from a concept into orders and revenue has taken a little longer than we had anticipated. So net-net, to your answer, we see no change in kind of outlook for 2020. If anything, this further strengthens our view on that based upon the quality and the degree of uptake in terms of customer interest.","Nathan Jones","That\u2019s useful color. Thanks very much. I\u2019ll pass it on.","Patrick Decker","Thanks, Nate.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray of RBC Capital.","Deane Dray","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Patrick Decker","Good morning, Deane.","Mark Rajkowski","Good morning, Deane.","Deane Dray","I'd like to pick it up right there where you ended off with Nate. So on MCS, broadly, thank you for emphasizing that distinction between Sensus and AIA. Sensus is executing really well from our perspective, and we did note that one of Sensus' competitors negatively preannounced this quarter, it looks like they're losing share and you all seem to be outgrowing the market nicely. So that's good news.","Patrick Decker","Thanks, Deane.","Deane Dray","So on AIA, so not too surprised that it's taking time for this from project wins into revenue. You all have disruptive technologies and the water industry is notoriously slow to adopt. So the way I look at it, and just would love to hear your comments on how each of these factors might be at play, but there's three factors.","So do you have the right -- I will take you all three. Do you have the right pricing model yet on these? Because are customers are balking at the price, the Network as a Service contingency kind of payments, so do you have the right model? Or are customers just notoriously slow to adopt and are just taking their time? Or is it macro worries before a little nervous about throwing the switch and committing to the capital? So how do these three factors play out?","Patrick Decker","Sure. Now you've laid it out well, Deane. I would -- the two factors I would pretty much -- I would certainly eliminate the last which is any kind of macro fiscal concerns, we're not seeing that. And if anything, what we're seeing, part of the reasons why there's as much excitement as there is and we are seeing scope expansion in a number of these areas is because what we're really hitting at in a big way here is the affordability issue. And so these technologies, as you well know, and others may or may not know, are getting at the affordability issue in terms of how do you take large-scale CapEx projects and make them more affordable.","And secondly, how do you extend the life and performance of the existing assets. So all of those play very well into the whole affordability equation. What that literally leads to is there is still some work that we're doing around making sure that we got the optimal revenue model here in terms of how we share value in that given how much we're able to disrupt.","But I would say right now the predominant issue is that these are breakthrough technologies. Utilities are conservative, as they should be, and so they want to make sure that they validate the savings, the functionality of this, and it is new and disruptive.","And so what we're seeing though is the reason why there is such an increase in this funnel at this point in time, is word is spreading. Utilities are talking to each other and sharing the pilots that they're looking at getting involved in. And so I really think that this is simply a matter of timing of ramp.","The margins that we see in terms of incremental margins are extremely attractive, very accretive to the overall Xylem, so there's no change in outlook there. And so that's why we're still so encouraged and that's why we said we'd still need to continue our investments in this slightly ahead of the adoption curve. We're not going to go crazy about it we don't need to, but we're still very, very encouraged by what we see.","Deane Dray","That's great to hear. And I really do like seeing the additional investments, even though there's a margin hit associated with it, that's, from our perspective, it's the right thing to do. And just second unrelated question. Lots of anxiety about trade tensions, but it looks like your China business continues to turn very nicely. Maybe just characterize the tone of business, the funnel in China where there are opportunities?","Patrick Decker","Sure. Thanks, Deane. So I think Mark may have mentioned, we expect to note double-digit growth in 2019, which is down from 23% in 2018, so moderate slightly. But -- so two-thirds of business in China is tied to utilities and is relatively well protected. You'll recall that even during the last downturn in China, that part of our business didn't actually decline. It actually held pretty steady and strong. And what's really driving that is, again, water environment quality continues to be a top policy mandate for the Chinese government, as driven by the citizens of the country.","And so we still consider to see very strong pipeline on the bidding site, et cetera. The area that we do keep a close eye on as well as the other third that is tied to industrial and commercial building. We've not seen any downturn in that business, we don't see any signs of such there. So we remain still quite bullish on China. One of the questions we also get is given that we're servicing kind of critical government infrastructure, is there any risk that we could be targeted at some point in time?","And we don't see that. And we keep a close eye on that. We don't see it right now because, as you've seen, Deane, when you visited our facilities there in China, we are a Chinese company in China. I mean there's -- we have the total look and feel of a Chinese company. It just happens that access to global leading technologies along the way, and so we don't really see that we have a threat there.","Deane Dray","Thank you.","Patrick Decker","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Davis of Melius Research.","Scott Davis","Hi. Good morning, guys.","Patrick Decker","Good morning, Scott.","Scott Davis","Trying to get a sense of -- I know it's very different by business for you guys on inventory levels and such, but some of the declines you saw in Western Europe, would you attribute a certain percentage of that inventory destock? Or is it -- do you already have line of sight sell-through that is pretty consistent?","Mark Rajkowski","Our view on that, Scott, is that there is clearly a slowing in economic conditions. Certainly, we've seen that in Italy, we've seen that in Germany and a couple of other countries. And so, it's really not an overstocked position relative to what's been sold into the channels, but just more of a slowing in the broader economies in some of these countries.","Patrick Decker","Yes, we would say, Scott, that we certainly don't see really anything being attributed to a destocking of inventories. And we've got quite a good line of sight on the businesses there in Europe, which tend to be more of a direct channel. We do have some indirect but we got a healthy direct channel as well.","Scott Davis","Yes. I know that's tough. There's a lot of nuances there, and this is just a follow-up. I know, pure is a really cool asset, but you also paid a pretty good price for it too, it wasn't free.","Patrick Decker","Yes.","Scott Davis","So how is it tracking versus the deal model? And are you getting the kind of revenue take rates that you expected? Or should I say it a different way, with you guys as the owner, have you been able to really drive that model to your liking?","Mark Rajkowski","Yes. Scott, I think there's still plenty of demand. One of the things that we've been working on and investing in is growing out our international business. And there's a lot of activity. This is all new to our teams. We're leveraging the existing commercial capabilities that we have there.","Frankly, that's one of the areas that we need to continue to invest in so we can accelerate some of the growth for opportunities that are clearly there. There's a lot of demand. But as we've talked about it, it's a very different value proposition, it's a different set of selling skills, there is solutions. And so we're migrating up that curve as well. That's probably a little bit slower than we would have liked at this point, but it's not for lack of underlying customer excitement and demand.","Patrick Decker","Yes, the way I'd characterize is, Scott, is there's the pure, the DS and pure technology that we acquired. And that certainly has always been intended to serve as the kind of fundamental platform of some of these new digital solutions that we have acquired through other startups. So the pure business is delivering as we expect this year. It's on plan. The plan's obviously driven by deal model, so that piece is there.","I think what you're seeing right now and you hear us talking about the pushing out of some of the AIA demand is really being driven by the other small startups that we put together and are integrating into the new digital solutions platform.","So, when we talk about some of the validation of savings and these delays and some of the adoption in terms of getting the procurement at the utility, we're really talking about the digital solutions part of the AIA platform, not really the pure piece.","Scott Davis","Okay, very helpful. Thank you. Good luck, guys.","Patrick Decker","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Walsh of Credit Suisse.","John Walsh","Hi, good morning.","Patrick Decker","Good morning.","John Walsh","I guess the first question around the margin bridge implied in Q4, can you kind of help unpackage what swings in terms of mix, in terms of restructuring savings, just to kind of get comfortable with the ramp there year-on-year. I think a bunch of it probably comes from leveraging the better organic sales growth in Q4, but anyway to help unpackage that natural buckets would be helpful.","Mark Rajkowski","Sure, John. No doubt, nice ramp there in Q4. Typically, that is our highest margin quarter and you hit on one of the drivers. It's just there's really good volume leverage. The other thing is that I think you touched on also, and we talked earlier one of the questions related to cost reductions from some of the restructuring actions that we've put in place that really ramped significantly in Q4 relative to the timing of when folks are leaving.","And I would also mention that the inflation comp starts to get a lot easier than what we've been living with in the first half of the year as some of these tariffs lap, our component shortages are lapping. And we're going to see better mix too. We're going to see better mix in a number of our businesses, including M&CS. I mean, we had a lot of volume last year that had low margins related to some of these large deployments where it was installation-related. So those are really the key drivers that gives us confidence that we will see that ramp in Q4.","Patrick Decker","The other thing I would add is on that mix comment, just to make a finer point there is last year's project revenue was heavily oriented towards the energy side of the equation with heavy install and lower margin on that whereas the mix this quarter in Q4 is going to be heavily water, which carries a much larger incremental margin on it than it does on I think the energy side.","John Walsh","Got you. And then thinking about the current order growth, I mean, obviously, you've been 4% now the last two quarters on very tough comps. You still have very difficult comps here in the back half. But you know, as we think about the mid-single-digit growth construct kind of going forward and into next year, what do you need to see in terms of margins? I mean in orders? What are you guys looking for in terms of order acceleration potentially in the back half? And what drives that?","Patrick Decker","Yes. So I'd lay it out this way, if you look at our three segments are going to be behaving, I think, or going to probably diverge a little bit here in ways that you haven't seen over the last, I'd say, 1.5 to 2 years, where they've all -- they've each kind of been running in that mid-single-digit growth in terms of both revenues and orders. That begins to diverge a little bit so we do expect that Applied Water will likely moderate back to more of a GDP level growth.","We hope to outperform that, but that would be in that kind of low single-digit range. And we're seeing some of that right now play out, as you saw in the orders in Mark's commentary. Water Infrastructure has historically been in that mid-single-digit growth, both in terms of orders as well as organic revenue. And as we mentioned in the quarter, it was up 4% orders, it was against an 8% comp last year in Water Infrastructure.","We don't see that changing so we feel good about that. And really what you begin to see happening here is MCS begins to ramp, and so we do expect those order growths to continue to grow, increase in terms of the rate as well as the organic revenue growth both back half of this year, but also certainly in 2020 and beyond. So you're going to see a little divergence there amongst the three segments that give us confidence around that mid-single-digit organic growth continuing.","John Walsh","Great. Thank you.","Patrick Decker","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Connors of Boenning and Scattergood.","Ryan Connors","Great. Thanks for taking my question. I'm wondering if you could actually talk a little bit more about the order book from a pricing perspective. And just give us some take on the success you're having in getting price in this environment? And if so, where?","Mark Rajkowski","Yes. Ryan, we've seen really good success in terms of pricing. We continue to get price in U.S. They actually led the way and worked early to drive good price realization. You saw that particularly this quarter in AWS, which had 350 basis points of price. Europe got on board a little bit later. And even Emerging Markets now is driving for price.","And I think most encouraging is what we saw in M&CS, particularly around the Sensus business, where they are not only driving very strong volumes but also driving good price as well. So when you think about backlogs, I mean our strongest backlogs are in M&CS. A lot of that is Sensus and we feel pretty good about that.","Ryan Connors","Okay. And then my other one is just you've talked a lot about the utility and Sensus and AIA but you haven't really gone as much into the industrial side and you didn't have kind of a negative revision to your outlook there. If you can just kind of unpack the different pieces within industrial? And what's -- where the outlook is? Is it still better? And where the headwinds are coming from.","Mark Rajkowski","Sure. Yes, on the industrial side, let me comment on the full year rather than give you a headache quarter-by-quarter. On the full year, we continue to see solid growth in the U.S., And really there, it's the fact that we're really tied to more of a general light industry. Most of the products resolve there are on a periphery of an industrial complex. And so as long as these complexes are up and running, they're going to burn through our pumps and our treatment needs.","And so we see that continuing to grow in a healthy clip. We also see positives in dewatering on the rental side. We continue to see a very healthy market there. I would say, outside of the U.S., its mixed. You see strength in parts of Asia, and we also see depth of softness in Europe and across the Middle East. And in Europe, it's not entirely broad based, I mean, it's really concentrated on a certain number of markets. We do see some divergence there in Europe. But right now, we're just calling that. We're trying to be prim here. It's a very short cycle business, as you all know, for us in the industrial side.","Ryan Connors","Okay. Thanks for all the color.","Mark Rajkowski","No worries.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Walter Liptak of Seaport Global.","Walter Liptak","Hi. Thanks. Good morning.","Patrick Decker","Good morning.","Walter Liptak","I wanted to ask what about the AIA investment. Considering the delays, is that changing anything about your M&A pipeline or your thoughts about timing of deals or other technologies that you might need?","Patrick Decker","Not at all. Not at all. As I mentioned before, but it's worth reiterating, when we think about M&A and utilities, we do think about this predominantly by end-market or vertical, not exclusively. But that's certainly one lens we look at it through.","I'd say on the utility side, we do have a very robust platform now of solution sets that we can bring to the utility customers both on the clean water side, the wastewater side and the outdoor water side, but that's not to say we don't still have -- as we're in there talking to these leaders and learning even more about what some of the other pain points are, there's still a few things out there that we would like to bring into the portfolio. They'll again be smaller tuck-in type acquisitions.","So no, it doesn't change our view on that. It, quite frankly, makes it more robust. But having said that, there really aren't that many more things out there that we really have led a site to that we're interested in at this point of time. We're really focus on executing on the platform that we've built.","Walter Liptak","Okay. Great. And then just a couple on the sector outlooks. You mentioned in industrial the second half in the U.S. being a little bit weaker. Is that just related to some of the PMIs that have come down and generally slower industrial? Or is there something else going on?","Mark Rajkowski","It's -- we think it's solid to up slightly. It's really what's driving the industrial change in our outlook is what Patrick mentioned before which is really some of the softening conditions and some of what appear to be recessionary trends in parts of Europe. But U.S. we think will remain pretty solid.","Patrick Decker","Yes. I think it's in the U.S. If anything, it's more of a tough comp -- tougher comp in the second half of the year. Kind of mid-single digit last year, that will probably moderate back down to low-single digit in the U.S. It's not, I think, maybe a little bit behind your question, is there any going on in the channel the inventory levels, we're not seeing that, at least in our business.","Walter Liptak","Okay. Okay. Makes sense. Small residential, you talked about the U.S. flattening but I think there is some other companies out there they're saying there's signs of strengthening going on in residential. Are you seeing any hope that the low interest rates in good U.S. economy might be turning residential around finally?","Patrick Decker","We certainly, we always hope so, but I guess it is not a large piece of our business and so we, at this point in time, we just kind of call it based on what we see right now. We haven't seen that kind of recovery so we didn't feel it was prudent to going to bake that into an outlook.","Walter Liptak","Okay. Alright. Thank you.","Patrick Decker","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano of Cowen.","Joseph Giordano","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Patrick Decker","Hey, Joe.","Mark Rajkowski","Hey, Joe.","Joseph Giordano","So I just wanted to go back to the kind of ramp as we go through the year here. Just standing check my math. If we're looking at 3Q margins of like roughly 15 and you have a pretty narrow range for the full year expectation on adjusted Op, are we talking like comfortably over 17 for 4Q? I know Mark talked through some of the things hitting in 4Q, but we've seen kind of modest year-on-year expansion through the year, a decline in 1Q and then we're talking like 200-plus basis points in 4Q, so I just really want to make sure I understand how that plays out.","Mark Rajkowski","Yes, Joe, I'd say I wouldn't say it's way over -- comfortably over 17. I think upwards of 200 basis points is certainly what our expectations would be.","Joseph Giordano","Okay. Is that including any of the benefits from the back-office stuff that was kind of getting pushed out? Or is that still a 2020 phenomenon?","Mark Rajkowski","It's limited. I mean, we just launched our latest wave in July, but we're -- there are benefits there. Well behind the track from where we expect to be as we enter the year. And that still pushes out into 2020. And so there's certainly more benefits ahead of us in the fourth quarter.","Patrick Decker","I mean you're looking roughly, Joe, the right math. It is about 180 basis points of margin expansion in Q4 and as Mark mentioned earlier, really is being driven by we do have other restructuring that we announced last quarter that is cost takeout, most notably within our European business but also within our Water Infrastructure, the MCS businesses, MCS have little bit there as well that really ramps in Q4.","You definitely have the attractive volume leverage given a mix of revenues are going to be heavily skewed towards Water Infrastructure and MCS which are going to be higher margins for us. And then as Mark pointed out earlier, we have some easier comps on the inflationary side which is noteworthy when you look at the quarter sequential. That's about 50 bps itself.","Joseph Giordano","Okay. Sorry if I missed this earlier. Is the big failure order you have got, is that in orders already? Is it in backlog?","Mark Rajkowski","Joe, it's in backlog. It's not in orders yet.","Joseph Giordano","It's not in orders yet? Okay. So when do you expect that to start hitting? And can you maybe talk through the timing of one that deploys into revenue and what the margin kind of -- is that accretive to MCS? How do we think about that?","Mark Rajkowski","Yes. Joe, it's certainly our expectation is to see that start to hit in the back half of this year, probably more in fourth quarter. And it's full-bore into 2020. It's a water deal and so the margins are certainly attractive relative to the energy side of the business.","Joseph Giordano","Okay. And maybe last for me, just more high-level. If I think through bolt-on technologies that makes sense for MCS, is there an obvious thing missing right now like some of the stuff that you bolted on recently seems like it fit pretty very clearly into what you're doing. But I guess as we fill out that portfolio, finding obvious holes is a little more challenging. So is there anything that strikes you as we can put a proxy out instead of doing R&D and figuring something out internally if we can go buy something there a piece that is interesting to you Patrick?","Patrick Decker","Yes, I mean there are still few things out there. I probably prefer, Joe, not to come on them publicly because to the extent they are M&A, I don't want to drive the piece up. There is not -- it's not a long list. There are probably a few to a handful of things that are out there that would be, I don\u2019t say -- just kind of nice to have, but they would address some other pain points.","As you think about what we're really bringing to bear here is the capability with our digital solutions platform to be able to go to the utility and work with their operating folks. And better understand how they can drive and improve performance of their existing assets and bring down the costs of the new capital that they are putting in place and get with what they already have.","So, when you think about the landscape of the utility, what their operating budgets are driven by, both CapEx and OpEx, there's a myriad of things that one can do by mining the data for them. And that's, in a simple way, what we're looking to doing in addition to others.","And so we'll keep you guys abreast of acquisitions as they come along. They\u2019re not going to be large acquisitions. They\u2019re going to be tuck-ins and bolt-ons. And I think as we get into Investor Day early next year, that will be a good form for us to kind of paint the picture for everyone as to what are the gaps that we filled out here and what's the landscape that we are operating in.","Joseph Giordano","Okay. Thanks.","Patrick Decker","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Pavel Molchanov of Raymond James.","Pavel Molchanov","Thanks for taking the question. Back on your comments regarding M&A, the fact that it's not a priority as you see it right now. Given the amount of free cash flow that you're generating above and beyond the dividend, what are your latest thoughts on buyback as a way of deploying that surplus cash?","Patrick Decker","Sure, this is Patrick. Just to clarify, my comment was not that we're not interested in M&A, I am specifically talking about the utility space and the bolt-on kind of digital solutions. So we continue to see M&A as an appropriate enabler of our long-term growth in the company.","And I mentioned on other calls that some of the other areas that we're focused on whether that be, again, continuing to look at areas in the industrial water landscape is one example, and there are others that are out there. There's nothing -- I'm not foreshadowing anything here, all I'm saying is we continue to see that as our priority to deploy cash but only for smart disciplined transactions that are out there. So we would certainly be looking to do that before we would be talking about doing share repurchase.","Mark Rajkowski","But we also recognize that unduly large amounts of cash on the balance sheet -- they're not sustainable. So we look at if we see there's nothing out there that we expect to need it for, we certainly look at repurchasing shares.","Pavel Molchanov","Okay. Let me follow-up on what you referenced at the very beginning of the call which is your ESG targets. As I look at your set of targets, separate from some of the kind of philanthropic or charity stuff, do you look at these as margin enhancers? Or are they actually a cost of doing?","Patrick Decker","No. We view these things as very much -- we try to be very clear when we speak externally as well as internally to our folks. And we actually had a great kind of podcast here internally just last week between myself and the executive sponsor of our sustainability program who happens to be our general council. And she and I did a terrific event here I think with our colleagues, really reinforcing to them that we don't have a sustainability strategy that sits separate from our business strategy, they go hand-in-hand.","And so the more that we are able to deliver on the signature goals that we laid out here, no doubt that's also good for business. But that's not the only reason we're doing it. We're doing it because we really believe that we have the responsibility here to really make a positive big impact for communities and for our customers and for our suppliers, but it's also all about making sure that we attract, retain the top talent across the landscape. And people nowadays, as you all know, they want to believe something larger than themselves and they want to work for a company as a purpose.","And we're not the only one out there, I realized that. But that's what's really driving these sustainability goals. It's good for business, it's good for the planet, it's good for everyone involved and we have a unique opportunity and a role to play here and we're doing so. And so that's why you want to move well beyond kind of motherhood and apple pie on just a few things that most companies talk about, in sustainability, we have an opportunity to make a much broader impact than just a few key areas.","Pavel Molchanov","I appreciate the perspective. Thanks.","Patrick Decker","Thank you.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one more question. Our final question will come from the line of Brian Lee of Goldman Sachs.","Brian Lee","Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in.","Patrick Decker","Hey, Brian.","Mark Rajkowski","Hey, Brian.","Brian Lee","Maybe two quick ones and then I'll let us all wrap here. In China, it sounded like results were pretty good but then you did make a little bit of pullout around slowing growth as part of the update for the industrial end market outlook here. Maybe can you elaborate on that? Is that a general flowing in the macro? Tougher comps? Or is there something else going on there?","Patrick Decker","We wouldn't want to overstate any commentary around softness in the industrial in China. We had some tough comps there. It's rather a small piece of our overall business in China. So, we're not probably in the best position to make a call on broader China industrial landscape. We're not seeing anything noteworthy there. I don't know, Mark, if you want to add any commentary?","Mark Rajkowski","Yes. As you said, the comps are tough and it's solid, it's steady, but we grew over 20% in the prior year. So there is no underlying fundamental issue that we see.","Patrick Decker","The primary driver of our growth in China is really the utility side, and it's really the investments being made by the government there across-the-board. So that kind of masks what we see in the industrial space, which again, is just really -- it's a tough comp. So no big read through there on our part.","Brian Lee","Okay. Fair enough. And then just on pricing, I know, I think you had mentioned maybe last quarter that MCS may see more of a tailwind in the second half due to some of the later pricing actions that played out for that segment. So with some of the mixed commentary and the AIA conversion delays, is there any change in that view around pricing trends for that particular segment as we move through the back half?","Mark Rajkowski","Yes. And I mentioned this in the prepared remarks, Brian. One of the encouraging things that we did see, team really got after it this year and we had, it was 100 basis points, maybe a little bit more of price improvement. And we'd expect that to continue through the remainder of this year.","Patrick Decker","And I think a big driver of that, Brian, as we mentioned before, I believe, is more so in the MCS business and certainly Sensus than other segments. These are oftentimes long lead time projects that we would have been locked in. So until new projects have been executed, it's hard to get prices. So team has done a great job on some recent projects on implementing those price increases and that's why you see it really ramp from the first half to the second half of the year.","Mark Rajkowski","And on replacement, the year's end points being sold into their channels as well","Brian Lee","Okay. Appreciate the color. Thanks guys.","Patrick Decker","Thank you.","Operator","And thank you. I'd now like to turn the floor over to Mr. Patrick Decker for any additional or closing remarks.","Patrick Decker","Well, thank you. And thanks for all your time, interest and support.

Decker","Thanks, Phil, and good morning, everyone. Thank you, all, for joining us today. This morning I'll review the highlights of our fourth quarter and full year 2014 results and provide a brief update on some of our major initiatives. Mike will provide additional details, and then we'll discuss our 2015 outlook. So let's get started.","We closed out 2014 strong. The renewed focus on execution across our organization helped us to generate solid organic top line growth, the sixth consecutive quarter of margin expansion as well as double-digit earnings growth. And I point out, that these results were achieved in an environment with strong foreign exchange headwinds and a mixed economic environment, conditions that we anticipate will continue throughout 2015. I'm pleased with our progress but we are in the early stages of our journey. We continue to operate in an uncertain global macroeconomic environment. We are encouraged by the bright spots such as an improving U.S. market and solid opportunities in several emerging markets, where we are poised to continue to grow and take share. But there remain many challenges, the most significant being the uncertainty in Europe, given both the political and economic headwinds the region faces. We are also keenly aware of, and closely monitoring, the currency markets, as foreign exchange translation does have a disproportionate effect on our reported results. But let me be clear. This will not be a distraction for us. We remain focused on the factors we can control, such as driving growth in our core business and operational improvements to drive out cost. Enhancing commercial excellence at Xylem is a strategic priority and critical in our efforts to accelerate profitable growth. And we're making good progress in rolling out the integrated technology solutions that are enabling stronger selling effectiveness and making it easier for our customers to do business with us. I anticipate measurable improvement in this area over the course of this year and look forward to sharing our progress.","With regard to cost reductions, opportunities remain to drive further business simplification and structural efficiencies. We are taking appropriate steps to achieve additional productivity gains and cost reductions, leveraging the lean and global sourcing capabilities we are building as well as other targeted cost actions. We expect these efforts to also enable us to overcome some of the headwinds, including the unfavorable impacts of foreign exchange translation and slow growth in Europe. We are taking a balanced view towards 2015 in light of uncertain and challenging market conditions. But we remain committed to executing our plans to achieve faster than end-of-market growth and further expansion of our operating margins and returns on capital.","But first, let's review the fourth quarter performance. Orders grew organically 3% year-over-year. The sequential deceleration in growth in the previous quarter reflects the impact of some large Water Infrastructure project wins that closed in the third quarter and the push-out of orders from the fourth quarter to the first quarter of 2015. Taking a longer view, we saw orders grow 6% on an organic basis during the second half of the year, with at least 1 point of growth attributable to our longer cycle infrastructure project business. Organic revenue increased 6% in the quarter, reflecting growing strength in the industrial and public utility sectors. We saw 8% growth in the U.S., as that market continues to improve, and the emerging markets were up 14% in the quarter, including 25% growth in China. I'm encouraged by the resiliency of our business in Europe, which delivered 1% growth this quarter despite a very challenging environment. Our operating margin expanded 70 basis points in the quarter to a record 14.7%. This reflects continued progress on improving execution across Xylem.","To wrap up the fourth quarter results, volume growth and improved operating performance drove earnings per share of $0.62, an increase of 11% over the prior year. This result includes a $0.03 drag from the impact of foreign exchange translation.","Now turn to Slide 4. For the full year, revenue increased 3% on an organic basis. We saw broad-based growth in the industrial and public utility markets and benefited from the recovering U.S. commercial market. We generated the strongest growth in the emerging markets over the course of the year, where we posted a 13% increase. Our operating margin expanded 110 basis points year-over-year, including a 100-basis-point reduction in G&A cost, an area that continues to have room for further improvement. We delivered record earnings per share this year of $1.97, an increase of 18% and a solid indicator that we have set Xylem on the right path forward to improve financial returns. Finally, we generated $297 million of free cash flow in 2014, an increase of 50% year-over-year. We are continuing to make progress on our working capital performance across the business, which improved 40 basis points as a percent of revenue, excluding the impact of foreign exchange translation. This improvement, coupled with our increased profitability, allowed us to increase the return of capital to shareholders by 45% in 2014. That includes a 10% increase in the dividend and $130 million of share repurchases under our current program.","As we announced in our press release this morning, our Board of Directors approved a 10% increase in our quarterly dividend. This further illustrates the confidence we have in our execution and the cash generation ability of this company, and it marks the third consecutive year of dividend increases.","So with that, let me turn the call over to our CFO, Mike Speetzen, to walk you through the results and the company's financial position in more detail. Mike?","Michael T. Speetzen","Thanks, Patrick. Please turn to Slide 5. During the fourth quarter, we generated revenue of $1 billion, essentially flat to the prior year, including a $50 million headwind from foreign exchange translation. On an organic basis, revenue was up 6%, which includes the benefit of 1 extra business day or roughly 1.5% when compared with the fourth quarter of 2013. From an end market perspective, we saw strength across the board. Industrial was up 6%, with growth in all regions, including mid-single digit growth in the United States and double-digit growth in both Latin America and the Middle East. As a reminder, Xylem serves a wide variety of industrial customers, and in the quarter, we generated industrial growth in both our Water Infrastructure and Applied Water segments. I'll cover both of these in more detail in the next 2 slides. Revenue from the public utility end market was up 5%, with mid-single digit growth in both the U.S. and Europe. We generated even stronger growth in the emerging markets, where we continue to see public utility investment to build out water and wastewater infrastructure. Revenue from our commercial end market was up 8%, with 14% growth in our U.S. business, which represents more than 50% of our overall sales in this end market. Operating income of $153 million was up $8 million over last year, despite $7 million of headwind from foreign exchange translation. Operating margin increased by 70 basis points to a record 14.7%. Cost reductions, including Lean Six Sigma, global sourcing and restructuring savings, more than offset inflation, driving a 30-basis-point improvement in segment margins. Corporate expense was $3 million lower than the prior year, when we incurred onetime costs associated with the relocation of our corporate headquarters.","Wrapping up on the consolidated results. Strong organic revenue growth and execution across our cost-reduction initiatives resulted in record EPS of $0.62, an increase of 16% before the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange or 11% overall.","Now let me provide more details on each of our reporting segments. Please turn to Slide 6. In our Water Infrastructure segment, we reported revenue of $672 million, up 6% on an organic basis. We grew across all major regions, with emerging markets leading the way, up 13%. U.S. revenue increased 6%, while Europe grew 3%.","I'd further summarize our revenue performance as follows: transport was up 6% overall, with broad-based strength; in Europe, the business was up high single digits, driven by public utility demand for our applied pumps, aftermarket parts and prepackaged pump stations as well as timing of shipments from Q3 to Q4. It's important to note that performance within Europe was mixed. For example, France, our second-largest market in Europe, was down low teens. In the U.S., we continue to see strong performance in industrial transport, driven by dewatering applications related to natural gas extraction-related activities. Treatment revenue was up 4%, as we delivered a large water filtration project in Brazil, and continue to see strong demand for filtration and disinfection products in China. Finally, test applications finished a record year with another strong quarter, up 5%, with strength in the U.S, driven by continued success of new products and cross-selling of our European-based technologies. While strong revenue growth in the quarter was balanced across the region and applications, order performance for Water Infrastructure was mixed. For the fourth quarter, we booked orders of $596 million, flat on an organic basis. This was down from the 10% organic growth we experienced in the prior quarter. While transport orders grew, treatment orders were weaker in the quarter as we saw some project delays in the U.S, Europe and the Middle East. For the fourth quarter, we're reporting record operating income of $113 million and a record operating margin of 16.8%. Performance was driven by the increase in organic volume and cost reductions of $26 million, driven by sourcing and Lean initiatives as well as $6 million in restructuring savings. In addition, we saw the benefit of a slightly improved pricing environment and a favorable impact of foreign exchange translation. Partially offsetting these tailwinds was inflation of approximately 3%, unfavorable mix and increased spend on strategic initiatives.","Please turn to Slide 7. Applied Water reported revenue of $370 million, up 7% on an organic basis. Regionally, we saw strong growth in the U.S, up 9% organically, and emerging markets grew 18%. Latin America and the Middle East were both up more than 40%. Growth in China moderated from earlier in the year but was still up 10%. Europe remained a weak spot, however, declining 3% as construction and industrial demand was soft. I'd further summarize our revenue performance as follows: building services grew 6% as we benefited from a long-awaited recovery in the U.S. institutional building market and associated distributor restocking as well as success with marketing and promotional activities; industrial water grew 7%, with strength exhibited across most regions; and lastly, irrigation, which represents less than 10% of Applied Water revenue, grew 25%, driven by the timing of several project shipments against a relatively small revenue base. Operating margin expanded 40 basis points year-over-year to 13.5%. However, this headline masked the strong 70-basis-point improvement in operations as foreign exchange translation negatively impacted results by 30 basis points. Our strong operational performance was driven by volume and cost reductions from sourcing and Lean Six Sigma activities and, to a lesser extent, restructuring savings. Partially offsetting these tailwinds was inflation of nearly 3% and the impact of divesting our valves business earlier in 2014. And pricing was neutral in the fourth quarter.","Now let's turn to Slide 8 to cover the company's full year performance by segment. Looking back at full year 2014 results, let me first start with Water Infrastructure. Revenue was $2.4 billion, up 4% organically, including double-digit emerging market growth, driven by the build-out of public utility infrastructure and industrial growth. In addition, we saw low single-digit growth in the public utility market for developed regions overall and strength in the U.S. industrial market, driven by demand for dewatering applications. Operating margin was also up strongly, increasing 110 basis points year-over-year to 14.3% due to volume leverage and the impact of cost reductions initiated in 2013 and 2014.","Moving on to Applied Water. Revenue was $1.5 billion, up 2% organically. We delivered 9% growth in emerging markets, including double-digit growth in industrial water applications in the Middle East and Latin America. We saw U.S. strength across all applications, including signs of a slowly recovering commercial building market. The weak macroeconomic environment in Europe, particularly in Southern Europe, was a consistent headwind throughout the year. For the year, Europe was down 2%. Operating margin increased 90 basis points year-over-year to a full year record of 14%, primarily reflecting positive price, strong productivity improvements and the impact of cost actions from 2013 and 2014. Overall, a focus on productivity and cost efficiency against the backdrop of a slow global growth and currency volatility has enabled us to generate strong segment margin expansion over the course of the year.","Please turn to Slide 9, and I'll cover the company's financial position. Xylem maintains a strong cash position with a balance of $663 million at the end of Q4, with approximately 21% held outside of the U.S. We remain committed to our balanced capital deployment strategy, which is to maintain and grow the business while also enhancing shareholder returns through dividends and share repurchases. During 2014, we invested $119 million in capital expenditures and we returned $224 million to shareholders. This includes a 10% increase in our dividend and $130 million under our share repurchase program. We also generated $297 million of free cash flow, largely reflecting higher income and lower CapEx spend. Relative to the prior year, our free cash flow performance improved by $99 million. Free cash flow conversion finished the year at 91%, up from 87% last year. That said, we fell short of our 100% conversion rate target, primarily due to working capital performance. We're disappointed with our performance in this regard, and as you'll hear Patrick address in a few minutes, improving working capital performance is one of our top priorities in 2015.","Lastly, we increased the return on invested capital by 90 basis points to 10.9%, in line with our expectations.","Please turn to Slide 10, and I'll turn it back over to Patrick to cover the CEO update.","Patrick K. Decker","Thanks, Mike. So please turn to Slide 10. As we look ahead, we have a clear vision to achieve our goal of establishing Xylem as the definitive market leader in the water space. These long-term strategic initiatives will enable us to grow our business, establish stronger commercial partnerships and build a culture in which excellence across all functions is fostered and delivered.","Let me briefly discuss our 2015 strategic priorities. We continue to see increased growth opportunities in the emerging markets. As I mentioned last quarter, we are focusing additional resources in China and the Middle East this year, building more robust capabilities and growing our presence in each market. Globally, we're already beginning to develop deeper, more distinctive industry vertical marketing capabilities. One of Xylem's unique strengths is the breadth of products and services we offer customers across the water cycle. Positioning Xylem as the total solution provider for certain industries and large key accounts will enhance our ability to solve our customers' challenges and drive efficiencies along the way. As I've said before, I believe the opportunity to drive continuous improvement and business simplification across the company can and will be a significant lever for long-term value creation. This is the fundamental thread in the productivity for growth mindset that we are driving into our day-to-day activities. Last month, we announced that Tony Milando will be joining us as our Senior Vice President of Continuous Improvement and Business Transformation. Tony just started this week, and he brings a wealth of experience in business integration and simplification. Given the challenging macroeconomic environment we face today, we are looking to accelerate certain Lean and global sourcing initiatives as well as some other targeted cost actions. We will continue pushing the cost levers, and Tony now will help accelerate the execution of our Continuous Improvement road map. In addition, we will invest some of those productivity savings back into the business to build new and stronger organization capabilities that drive faster-to-market growth and margin expansion that is sustainable over time. As Mike mentioned, improving our working capital performance is also a top priority, and we anticipate at least 100-basis-point improvement as a percentage of revenue, excluding the impact of foreign exchange translation.","Finally, as I mentioned before, we intend to initially pursue bolt-on acquisitions. While timing is always difficult to predict, we aim to be more active in this area in the latter part of the year.","So now please turn to Slide 11. As I review this slide, the growth rates I refer to all exclude the foreign exchange headwinds that we expect to negatively impact our results. Looking at the year ahead, we anticipate 2015 organic revenue growth of 1% to 3%. Our adjusted operating margin is expected to grow in the range of 50 to 90 basis points, reflecting the carryover benefit of our broad-based restructuring efforts last year as well as additional efficiencies we expect to drive in 2015. We anticipate generating earnings per share of $1.85 to $1.95, which includes $0.21 of negative foreign currency translation impact. Excluding this headwind, EPS growth is expected to be in the range of 5% to 10%. Finally, we will continue to execute a disciplined approach to capital deployment, which is expected to result in 100% free cash flow conversion.","Please turn to Slide 12. This slide outlines our expectations for 2015 organic revenue by end market. Industrial, which represents 44% of our total revenue, is expected to grow at a low single-digit rate. This projection assumes continued growth in the U.S. but a slightly slower growth in the emerging markets. The public utility sector, which constitutes 1\/3 of our total revenue, is anticipated to grow at a low single-digit rate. Here, we anticipate continued growth in the emerging markets as well as in the U.S., where we see encouraging signs in terms of municipal funding. For the commercial market, we see growth in the low to mid-single digit range. Again, the U.S. market appears to be improving, and the emerging markets are anticipated to have continued strength. But we expect Europe to remain soft. The residential sector remains challenged, and we anticipate we will be flat to down low single digits, as Europe continues to be a drag. And finally, our smallest sector, agriculture, will likely be flat for the year.","Please turn now to Slide 13, and Mike will walk you through a few more details on our expectations.","Michael T. Speetzen","Thanks, again, Patrick. Given the recent focus on foreign exchange and the potential impact on many companies' financial performance, we thought it would be appropriate to help provide transparency as it relates to our company. So first, let's begin by discussing Xylem's foreign exchange transaction exposure. This is true economic exposure, and we have in place a comprehensive hedging program that substantially mitigates our overall transaction exposure. Our strategy is to proactively hedge and mitigate up to 75% of net cash flows for our 7 largest currency pairs. Furthermore, we hedge the monthly mark-to-market exposure on our balance sheet as well. We do this on a rolling 12-month basis and all of our hedging activity utilizes forward instruments. Finally, as it relates to foreign currency transaction exposure, I would highlight that any residual impact not offset by our hedging program is reflected on our underlying operational performance.","Now let me address foreign currency translation exposure, which is the impact resulting from translating financial statements of foreign entities back into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. Given the nature of this exposure and the anticipated impact on our financial results in 2015, we will isolate the impact so that you will be able to better judge the operational performance of our company and progress against strategic initiatives. This table illustrates the top 5 translation currency exposures for Xylem, and provides you with the average exchange rate for each currency last year and the 2015 rate assumed in our guidance, which was based on a spot rate for each currency last Friday. To summarize, based on these rates used for guidance, revenue will be negatively impacted by approximately $280 million and operating income by $48 million, which results in a $0.21 EPS headwind.","Turning to Slide 14, I'll further illustrate this impact. As you can see here, we expect organic revenue growth of 1% to 3% before approximately 7 percentage points of negative foreign exchange translation impact. Operating income is expected to be in the range of $528 million to $553 million, resulting in margin expansion of 50 to 90 basis points [ph], excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange translation noted on this slide.","Please turn to Slide 15. Just a few more points around our full year 2015 outlook. On this slide, each of the projected margin and EPS growth rates exclude the negative impact of foreign exchange translation. At the segment level, we expect Water Infrastructure revenue of $2.3 billion, reflecting organic growth of 1% to 3%. And for Applied Water, we expect revenue of $1.4 billion, with organic revenue flat to up 2%. Segment margins are anticipated to be in the range of 14.5% to 14.9%, and operating margins are projected to be in the range of 13.1% to 13.5%, reflecting margin expansion of 50 to 90 basis points. At the bottom line, we anticipate earnings per share of $1.85 to $1.95 excluding restructuring and realignment costs of $20 million. As noted on the slide, EPS growth is expected to be 5% to 10%. As mentioned earlier, we're driving 100% free cash flow conversion of net income, and this takes into consideration expected CapEx in the range of $120 million to $130 million. We expect return on invested capital to remain at approximately 11%, given the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange translation on operating income. Excluding this anticipated impact of foreign exchange translation, we would expect approximately 50 basis points of improvement in 2015. Our operating tax rate is expected to be 21%, approximately 1 point higher than in 2014, given the expected mix in regional revenues, specifically, higher growth in the U.S., where we have our highest effective tax rates. Lastly, fully diluted share count is expected to be $183 million.","With that said, please turn to Slide 16. As we've done in prior years, I'd like to spend just a few minutes highlighting the seasonal profile our business, which you can see on the left side of the chart. For the first quarter of 2015, we expect 1% organic growth, due in part to the fact that we have 1 less day in the first quarter of 2015, and an extra day in the fourth quarter later in the year. On average, 1 day represents $15 million of revenue, which would impact year-over-year growth by 1.5%. I'd also note that we expect foreign exchange translation headwind of approximately $75 million in the first quarter. We anticipate operating income to be down year-over-year, due primarily to $12 million in expected foreign exchange translation. While we anticipate our annual corporate expense to be held flat with 2014, we expect corporate expenses in Q1 to be in the range of $12 million to $13 million, slightly higher than last year. And lastly, we anticipate that continuous improvement activities and restructuring savings will fund strategic initiatives.","With that, I'll turn the call back over to Patrick for closing comments.","Patrick K. Decker","Thanks, Mike. Let me conclude by reiterating that we are pleased with our results in 2014. We made significant progress last year, delivering strong financial results, refining our operating model, and raising our execution game. We entered 2015 with solid momentum, and we intend to build on our achievements. I am confident that we have the right strategy in place and we're building the right team to move Xylem forward and increase the value of our shareholders' investments.","Operator, we can now open up for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets.","Deane M. Dray - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just to start off, I really appreciate that Slide 13 you provided on your FX exposure. We recognize that this is a -- not one of the elements necessarily within your control, but this additional detail is a big help. And so a couple of questions, for starters, and just so everyone is clear, I know some initial worries about the Swiss franc and being your tax center in Switzerland, I know it's a nonissue, but Mike, if you could just take us through why it's not an issue. And then also address, please, within the hedging, why 75% on the transaction hedging? Why not 100? And where we would see the mark-to-market adjustments on a quarterly basis? Are those in your operating results? So -- and I know I just grouped up all my FX questions there.","Michael T. Speetzen","Okay. All right, Deane, so let me take a shot at this. So I think as it relates to Swiss franc, we do have some impact from that because we have local cost. But relative to the total size of the company, they're very small and not material. I think the key element to understand is, although we are in Switzerland, our functional currency within Switzerland is the euro, since we're transacting primarily with euro-denominated countries. And so again, it gets back to, the majority of our foreign exchange impact is heavily weighted, and you can see that on Slide 13 in terms of the amount of profit that we capture in Switzerland but it's denominated in euros. As it relates to the hedging program, it's a bit of a call from a company perspective. We have picked 75% because what that does is that essentially gives us some cushion for any variability we have in our forecast. It's all about qualifying for hedge accounting so that we avoid the second part of your question, mark-to-market variation. As long as we can demonstrate that we're effectively hedging predicted cash flows with a high degree of accuracy, essentially, all the mark-to-market gets caught in basically a balance sheet account and then is released as we incur the gain or the loss on the actual transaction. So it takes the variability out of the P&L and it gives us a little bit of cushion from a financial projection perspective.","Deane M. Dray - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Great. And just one follow-up within the currency exposure. Mike, how would you characterize your natural hedge with having manufacturing in, let's say, Sweden and just outside the U.S., how are you balanced on the revenue and cost side?","Michael T. Speetzen","Yes, I'd say, probably not as much as we'd like to be, and I think that shows up in the fact that our hedging program covers about $0.5 billion in net cost and cash movements. And I think for the European exposure, we're pretty well offset, given that most of our manufacturing is done in either Italy or in Sweden. But we do deal with some of the cross-currency effects. And with our Applied Water business, we have a pretty heavy manufacturing base in the U.S., and that gives us a little bit of a disadvantage, especially when we see the U.S. dollar appreciating. But again, we look to try and use the foreign exchange transaction program to put us in a better position in terms of hedging that off.","Deane M. Dray - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then away from FX and -- first of all, I appreciate all that additional disclosure and detail on the FX side. And then just if you would characterize the benefit -- potential benefit from lower fuel cost, and is that included in your guidance? And just update us on any direct or indirect oil exposures on your revenue side. I know there are some -- a bit in transport, but how would you characterize those?","Michael T. Speetzen","Yes, I guess, I'd characterize not only energy cost but, I would say, overall commodity impact. We saw inflation rates that had averaged out around 2.8% throughout the course of 2014. Right now, built into our guidance is inflation that's just around 2%. So we are certainly seeing the benefits coming through across the board in the business. And I would say, in terms of exposure, we have less than 5% of our revenue that's exposed to oil and gas, and it's primarily, Deane, as you well know, in our dewatering business. And I would say the majority of that exposure is actually against natural gas. We've taken a view that we are likely to be down and that is obviously built into the guidance range of 1% to 3%.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Davis of Barclays.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just trying to get a sense of your level of conservativeness in the guide on top line, and the 1% to 3%, it looks like -- from Slide 3, I guess, it is, orders up 3%. I mean, are you seeing something in January that causes concern or is this just a lack of visibility and just trying to remain reasonably conservative?","Patrick K. Decker","Yes, Scott, let me -- this is Pat. Let me take that one. I mean I'd say, first of all, we were pleased with solid second half growth in the business. I would say, though, we need to recognize that we're still operating in a pretty low-growth environment. So we do feel that we're taking share but it's in a low-growth environment. And while we are seeing some pockets of improving conditions, they are balanced with other markets where there's greater levels of certainty, especially in parts of Europe. We do have good visibility into Q1, both revenue and earnings. Obviously, we're being impacted, as Mike indicated, by a number of shipping days. So don't want to get into the -- ahead on that one, but it does have some impact for us. So there's no real concern if we go into Q1 from a revenue standpoint. But as you pointed out, it's a very short-cycle business, and while we do see a number of bright spots, there are challenges. And so we want to be appropriately balanced in our outlook for the full year, given that short-cycle nature and, therefore, we think it's a good balanced outlook for the year.","Michael T. Speetzen","And Scott, what I would add to supplement Patrick's comment around the short cycle, our backlog is up as we head into 2015 but it only represents 17% of our anticipated shipments for the year. So just gives you a sense of how much is left to go, and even when you look at the first quarter, I've got roughly 40% sitting in backlog. So we're kind of watching things on a day-to-day basis.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Sure, sure. Understood. My follow-on question just relates to the balance sheet. And there's things you can and can't control. The one thing you can control is your capital structure. And the comments of bolt-on acquisitions but more back end of the year variety, it just leads me to believe -- I mean, what is the risk for sitting here kind of 12 months from now and the cash balances are again building on the balance sheet and we're leaving a key lever that you guys can use on the table? So I guess my question is, is that why not step up repurchases or think about a more progressive use of the balance sheet to try to control some drag from the earnings growth here?","Patrick K. Decker","Sure. So Scott, this is Patrick again. We do have $70 million left in our authorized share repo program and so whenever we sit back and talk about and think about our capital deployment framework, we still see our top opportunities here being to continue to invest in the growth of the core business. And so we are making investments in CapEx and R&D, consistent with the past. We did have the increase in the dividend and we'll continue to pull that lever. We are very actively looking at and pursuing the development of our M&A pipeline. So we're going to continue to remain focused in that area. Obviously, we want to balance that between execution there in our own internal operating execution. But I'm feeling better and better about that and the pipeline is looking more and more attractive. And we will use that remaining repo that we've got authorized if we find that things are not moving as fast on the M&A front as we'd like for it to. But I'm confident that you're going to see us be pretty active here in the back half of '15 on the M&A front, again, focused on bolt-ons.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones of Stifel.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","A question, I guess, as it relates to currency again. You do have a significant amount of manufacturing in Sweden, and the kroner has also taken a big dive, it's actually even worse than the euro at the moment. What kind of impact could that have in terms of a potential competitive advantage for you there with the manufacturing in Sweden?","Michael T. Speetzen","Yes, I mean, it certainly plays in especially as we start thinking about the pumps that are manufactured in Sweden and exported into the U.S. and Latin America. And I would say this has been a pretty fluid environment, I mean, given the fact that the rates really fell hard in the latter part of December and then constructively throughout January. We've got our teams obviously taking a hard look at what some of the competitive implications are across the board.","Patrick K. Decker","And I would just add to that, Nate, and I mean you're absolutely spot on that, as things move fast here, I think our folks in the field are pretty savvy and were very much focused on not just relying on hedging strategies to try to mitigate this FX impact but really, where there's an advantage, to take full advantage of that. But it's fluid and we'll move as fast as we can.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","And we've seen some of your competitors and some folks in adjacent markets talk pretty constructively recently on the U.S. municipal market. Can you talk about what you're seeing in that market and what your expectations are for potentially accelerating orders as we go through the year?","Michael T. Speetzen","Yes. I mean, we -- Nathan, as we talked about through the course of 2014, we definitely saw a pickup and it was more on the construction side, specifically around what we saw on our treatment business, which had orders that were up double digits. As we go into 2015, we're looking at the public utility market overall to be up low single digits. We do think the U.S. is an area of opportunity. We continue to be very balanced in how we're looking at that. I think one of the general concerns is, are we truly in a recovery or are we simply just catching up on the backlog of work? And I don't know that the jury has come back on that one. So I sure hope that it would represent additional opportunity, but we're playing it kind of right down the middle right now.","Patrick K. Decker","I mean, I would add that we are seeing the project funnel grow, particularly in our treatment business, which is being driven by that. But again, the timing of these things, many of them are longer-term, multiyear projects and so, again, we're just trying to take a balanced view here as to what to bake into '15.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","And on the $20 million of restructuring expense you're planning this year, can you talk about where that's targeted and what the potential impacts are? And that's excluded from your EPS guidance this year, correct?","Michael T. Speetzen","Correct. I'd say a fair amount of the restructuring component is actually associated with the actions that we undertook in 2014. So it's really tied into the $18 million worth of restructuring benefit that carries over into 2015. We also have additional realignment, which is a continuation of some of the ongoing transformation activity we have within the business. And then some smaller elements that are related to, what I'll call, a little bit longer-term restructuring activities that are within the business.","Patrick K. Decker","I would add that, I mean, we are absolutely committed to taking actions to improve the operating efficiency. As I've indicated before, I still stand behind the fact that we see a couple of hundred basis points at least of opportunity there in terms of cost out. I'd say this is on the heels of a good job by the team over the past few years in terms of taking cost out. But I would say that we're in the middle innings of developing what I would see as a multiyear and multifaceted plan. It's going to include Lean and global sourcing, much of which is already baked into our plan and it's really the driver behind the 50- to 90-basis-point operating margin expansion that we're talking about, before FX. But in addition to that, we have identified some strategic actions that are centered around business simplification that we think can reduce our structural costs. And lastly, I would say, with Tony Milando coming on-board now, together, he and I will be developing and executing a plan that's focused on strategic opportunities to reduce cost that cut across the businesses as opposed to the recent activity in the last couple of years, which is really centered on business unit by business unit. Now the opportunity is to look across the businesses.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chip Moore of Canaccord.","Chip Moore - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","I was hoping you could touch on Europe a bit more, I guess, particularly for the Water Infrastructure business. Sounded like it was pretty mixed; France down. Just talk about country-by-country a little bit. Confidence that, that business stays stable.","Michael T. Speetzen","Yes. I think, Chip, we've taken, I'd say, a fairly conservative view relative to Europe. I mean, Europe was a little bit better in the fourth quarter than we had anticipated. We were essentially looking for it to be flat, and we were up about 1%. As we look out into 2015, we're essentially counting on Europe to be, call it, flat. The Nordics continue to be strong. Economically, in the way they develop their water systems, we feel confident there. We're confident from a U.K. standpoint because we track with the AMP cycle, and we know that, that's going to be into more of a downturn here for the next year and then moving into an upswing. I'd say where the question marks start to come is around Western and Southern. We pointed out the fact that France was down. France is one of our larger end markets, and so we've seen a little bit of volatility there and we're keeping a close eye to make sure that we can understand and track that. Germany's remained relatively balanced and Southern Europe continues to be a net drag for us. And so at this point, I wouldn't say we're going to expect to see something that occurs through 2015, in our view, that's going to be dramatically different than that and, as a result, that becomes more of a drag on the top line growth.","Chip Moore - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Okay. Yes, that's helpful, Mike. And if we shift it to emerging markets, obviously, great results. Looks like that strategy is starting to pay off. Maybe you can just detail out a little bit where you're funneling some investments there?","Patrick K. Decker","Sure. So I -- do you want me to take this one, Mike? All right. We've identified -- I certainly don't want to suggest that we're only focusing on China and the Middle East. I mean, we're certainly sowing the seeds and building the capabilities in other critical emerging markets as well, and we're seeing good growth there. But we're taking a very focused strategy in 2015 and making investments both in China and the Middle East. They're largely driven by the need to further localize our manufacturing, some of our R&D work, the innovation that we're doing around the products and services that are tailored for those markets. And we're also putting some more feet on the street in those markets as well. So it really is more about localization and transferring some of the responsibilities and capabilities to those markets away from some of our core developed markets where the activity occurs today.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robert Barry of Susquehanna.","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","I wanted to just start by following up on some of the comments you made about accelerating some of the sourcing, Lean actions, perhaps, accelerating some structural cost actions. Do you mean to imply that there could be some upside to that $20 million bucket of restructuring that's currently in the plan?","Patrick K. Decker","I think these are actions that, first of all, would likely not benefit us until late in '15, predominantly into '16 and onward, because they are going to be a bit more difficult to get at structurally than some of the things that we've done the last couple of years. And we're in the middle innings of developing and finalizing that plan. And so I wouldn't necessarily see it as straight up upside to what we're guiding to right now. Obviously, we're going to accelerate and get these things as quickly as we can. And as I've mentioned earlier, we'll certainly be keeping you guys apprised of the progress over the course of the year.","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. Fair enough. And then I was wondering if you could just unpack a little bit the expectation within infrastructure growth of 1% to 3%? Anything there that stands out as maybe, within the businesses, as a little bit stronger or weaker? It sounds like maybe treatment, with some of the pushout, might be weaker; transport stronger. But just curious as to your views across transport, treatment, test. And within transport, dewatering I think has been stronger. Is that still the expectation?","Michael T. Speetzen","Yes, I think as it relates to dewatering, we certainly expect to continue to see growth, with the exception of the oil and gas exposure, where we do anticipate getting a little bit of headwind. I'd say as it relates to treatment, probably not as strong a growth as you would expect, mainly because the project sequence out over time. These can be 9-, 12-, 18-month projects. I'd really look at the core transport and test businesses as being kind of the key drivers. But again, looking at Europe as a potentially drag on the overall performance. And I think from a pricing environment perspective, although we did see a little bit of a positive price, about 20 basis points in the fourth quarter, we're not anticipating that to be a significant driver. We are anticipating some positive price but it's going to be below 50 basis points throughout 2015.","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. Is mining expected to be a headwind or tailwind or neutral? I think it's been a pretty big headwind, but...","Michael T. Speetzen","Yes, for us, I think in 2015, it's about net neutral. We saw most of the impact this past year or so.","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Fair enough. And then just maybe 1 final one, a housekeeping item. You talked about resi weakness, and calling out Europe. Just how much of that 7% of the business that's resi is in Europe?","Michael T. Speetzen","It's about 1\/4.","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","1\/4 of the 7%?","Michael T. Speetzen","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano of Cowen.","Joseph Craig Giordano - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Question, first, on the restructuring. At what point do we start taking that into operations and not call it up specifically that's more tailored towards like a Continuous Improvement type of initiative?","Michael T. Speetzen","Yes, I think I'll give you my perspective and then Patrick can certainly weigh in. I think we've got to get through what I'll call as next wave of transformation, which obviously we have not fully detailed out yet and need to understand the impact. But I do think, philosophically, we agreed that at a point here in the not-too-distant future, we need to start to incorporate that into the earnings profile of the business.","Patrick K. Decker","And I totally agree with that. We've talked about that internally, and it's really been -- and it's really been myself that said let's make sure that we have this window here in front of us, where we know that we're going to be doing some more transformative things, and I want to make sure that we're able to be as transparent as possible with all of you as to what that looks like. But we definitely want to get to a level of normalcy here in terms of just baking it into our results.","Joseph Craig Giordano - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then more of a high-level question. I'm just curious to hear what comments you had or what potential implications you think about some of the tax proposals being discussed in Washington now regarding accrued foreign income and things like that, and where's your cash position relative to the U.S. versus overseas, things of that nature.","Michael T. Speetzen","Yes, so I -- a couple of comments. One, tough to comment because nobody knows what's actually going to make it through. I think, obviously, we're supportive of any proposal that would enable us to get our cash back from overseas in an efficient manner, given the fact that we have 80% outside of the U.S. That said, we don't wait for tax changes. We've got a pretty active strategy from a planning standpoint and we've been pretty effective, since we spun off, with being able to repatriate cash in a very tax-efficient manner. So we'll obviously continue to watch it. We've got a strong tax team here that stays pretty plugged into what's going on in the regulatory, environment and we have demonstrated in the past that we can react pretty quickly to regulatory changes.","Joseph Craig Giordano - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","And then just lastly from me on M&A, just real quick. Where -- are you looking to increase -- I'm assuming Europe is where valuations have declined the most, are you looking to increase your exposure there if the opportunities present itself?","Patrick K. Decker","We certainly wouldn't rule it out. I wouldn't comment right now on a preference as to one geography versus another. I think that we're going through some very attractive kind of value mapping work, as we speak, in terms of laying out, really leveraging this industry vertical marketing capability we're building to really understand what the full range of water management needs are for our customers in different industries. And we're really doing that work along with pursuing some deals in the pipeline already. So -- probably wouldn't want to comment on geography at this stage.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of David Rose of Wedbush Securities.","David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to follow up, first of all, just on the restructuring and realignment. Just to be clear, so the $20 million is not included in the numbers. You have $18 million of savings from the '14 actions. And is that -- $20 million in total, that's an additional $38 million coming through?","Michael T. Speetzen","No. It's $20 million in total, $18 million of which is from the actions we executed last year. Some of that cost carries over into '15, and then we have $2 million of extra benefit from actions that are occurring in 2015.","David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","And so the $20 million in restructuring realignment cost, what sort of benefits should we see in '16?","Michael T. Speetzen","Yes, like I said, about half of that $20 million cost is actually related to the actions that started in '14 but, from an accounting standpoint, we weren't able to accrue for that. So if you look at what we incurred in 2014, which was about $26 million, that was below what we had originally guided to and it mainly had to do with the cut-off of what is accruable and not accruable on the restructuring. The balance has to do with realignment. So it's a variety of things associated with getting the Lean deployment, manufacturing footprint, those types of things under way.","David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay. All right, that's clear. And then just a couple of follow-ups. Just on the commentary around your residential assumptions. I mean, you've got just 1\/4 of that really is in Europe, so vast majority is in the U.S. So why wouldn't you see higher gross rates? I mean, what sort of assumptions are you -- do you have embedded in Europe for resi? I mean, if we combine...","Michael T. Speetzen","Yes, so definitely, David, the headwind in Europe, it is just 1\/4 but it does carry kind of a mid-single-digit decline with it. The thing that I think we always need to point out with our resi business as it relates to our U.S. exposure, given that it is about 1\/2 of what our residential business is, it is primarily a replacement market and it's primarily around borehole pumps. So while we do anticipate the residential market will be on an upswing in 2015, our ability to participate in that is really more on a replacement. Not to say that we don't participate in new builds, where they're putting in ground wells and things like that, but it's just not as big an opportunity as all the new construction going on.","Patrick K. Decker","David, I'd actually highlight, to the extent that there's a recovery in or a continued, if you would, progress in the residential market, that's actually going to benefit more that U.S. public utility [indiscernible] Water Infrastructure.","Michael T. Speetzen","Public utility, yes.","David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Sure. I was just looking at some of the peers that have had much more positive commentary around residential. And maybe if you could, lastly, on the treatment side. You've made a lot of changes in terms of product development on the treatment side coming up with small-system solutions. Does that change the nature of the cycle? I mean, greater short cycle, where you have less visibility. And I'm really kind of thinking about Water Infrastructure [ph] as an example. Does that sort of change your visibility in that market? I mean, the opportunity set seems to increase but you have less visibility. Is that fair?","Patrick K. Decker","I don't -- I think it's a fair question. I don't -- we certainly don't have a sense or a feel that it's necessarily going to reduce our visibility in terms of shipping mix that much. Actually, part of the work that we've benefited from in terms of, one, having integrated our front end commercially as well as the implementations of our CRM solution, is that we -- our teams, especially in North America where we -- we're implementing it first, are actually getting more visibility to building out the project funnel. So we've actually grown our project funnel pretty significantly here over the past number of months as well as having improved our win rate as a result of that. So I think there are going to be things that we do internally from an execution standpoint in getting better visibility and expanding the funnel that would mitigate any of the offset that you're referring to in terms of change of mix at short cycle.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Brian Konigsberg of Vertical Research.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Maybe touching a little bit more on just oil and gas. I understand it's 5% of your revenue exposure. Can you tell us what the contribution to operating profit is? I suspect that dewatering, higher margins, is it maybe closer to 10% of operating profit?","Michael T. Speetzen","Yes, Brian, I want to stay away from getting into the details but the couple of points I'd give you is, it is dewatering, it is rental. But I would tell you, it's in the lower end of the value-add spectrum on that, so I wouldn't anticipate the type of drop rates that we've seen in the past on rental. But as we indicated, it's less than 5% of our revenue. We do think that the team has some pretty good options in front of them to try and offset some of the potential headwinds through branch expansion and some of the activities that they have under way, just given the size of player we are in the market. But at this point, we really didn't call it out because we don't anticipate it being a significant headwind at this point.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","I guess, just following on that path [ph], I understand you said the exposure is more kind of on the gas production side, which gives you a little bit more comfort. Do you have, I guess, a sense of the exposure to gas production? I mean, is it on associated wells or is it dry gas wells? Because obviously, there's been a ton of production of gas coming from wells that are targeting oil than as a byproduct. So if we're going to going get a pullback on that type of production, have you done that type of analysis and is that being incorporated in your outlook?","Michael T. Speetzen","The team has definitely done that. And what I would tell you is that the majority of our exposure is going to be direct, not residual and, at this point, it's about watching what's going on with natural gas pricing and rig counts. And at this point, the thing I'd point out to you is we actually had very strong performance in the fourth quarter. So we have not seen any initial signs but, obviously, it can change relatively quickly.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Yes, I mean, I'd say that obviously, we took a fairly big leg down since Q4, but -- okay, just moving on. Maybe just on inflation, so I think you said in Water Infrastructure, up 3% from an inflation standpoint. I mean, so just with the commodity prices coming off, I mean, where is most of that inflation coming from? Is it wage and I guess other sorts of inflation? And shouldn't that start to moderate maybe [indiscernible]?","Michael T. Speetzen","Yes. So the 3% that I spoke to was relative to 2014. And as I think I answered to an earlier question, we think inflation's going to be closer to 2%. A big portion of that, obviously, is what we do from a wage perspective, which has not come down year-over-year in terms of what we give folks in terms of merit increases on an annual basis. And then there are parts of the component base that have not moderated as much as from a commodity pricing standpoint. So we've got a great strategic sourcing team. They've done a lot over the past several years to drive savings, and we're pretty confident that whatever residual inflation we see, we've got the ability to more than offset it.","Operator","And we have a question from the line of Jim Giannakouros of Oppenheimer.","James Giannakouros - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Yes, just a quick one on -- and I'm sorry if I missed it, if you can talk about the competitive landscape in both of your segments or by end market? You mentioned that you don't think price is going to be a headwind this year. Just some color around that. Is that reflective of more rational players out there or reflective of your value proposition relative to other products out there? Any color would be helpful.","Michael T. Speetzen","Yes. So I think as it relates to Applied Water, there's probably going to be a little bit of downward price by us. It's probably less about the competitive environment. It's more about what we've seen in the underlying commodities. That business tends to track more closely. We do anticipate getting positive price, but may not be at the same level that we've gotten over the past couple of years as commodity prices are settling down. I think within Water Infrastructure, it's probably a bit of the market calibration, and we're now entering a period where the market is growing, albeit at a very low rate, and that is taking a little bit of the pressure off. But I don't want to suggest that those competitive pressures have diminished dramatically. I think it's going to be about how do we make sure our teams fully understand and have the capability internally to do the right value proposition selling to make sure that we're getting paid the premium that we deserve given the performance of our products.","Patrick K. Decker","I would also add that one of the other things that the team is working hard to do is, one of the benefits from a pricing standpoint is when you're able to ramp up your launch of new products. And we have had a number of new products that we've launched recently and a number teed up for 2015. So it's always easier to go talk price when you've got something new to talk about in terms of technology and solutions. So that's going to be another lever for us to pull as well.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the floor back over to Patrick Decker for any additional or closing remarks.","Patrick K. Decker","Great. Well, thanks, everybody, for your time in the call today, and we appreciate your continued interest and we look forward to updating you on our next call. So safe travels and we'll talk to you soon.

We continue to see strong top line growth and healthy demand in the first quarter but frankly we were disappointed with missing our guidance for margin and earnings. Lower margin performance was driven by the mix of products that we sold and operational factors that we should have identified and planned for, most notably in our sales and operations planning process.","We take our commitments very seriously and we care deeply about doing what we say we are going to do as our track record has shown over the past five plus years and we have taken corrective actions to address these shortfalls. We are pleased with our continued growth momentum, remain very excited about our ongoing growth prospects and an achieving healthy margin expansion for the remainder of this year and well beyond.","Now, let me review some of the other key details. We once again delivered solid organic revenue growth of 6% in the quarter. We saw gains across all of our end markets, highlighted by the continued mid single digit growth in our largest sector utilities. This continues to represent above market growth in a healthy market. From a geographical standpoint, the U.S. market produced strong revenue growth with an 11% increase year-over-year. This included double digit growth in utilities and at least mid single digit growth in our other end markets.","The emerging markets continue to be healthy and build momentum as well up 12% overall with particularly, strong performance in Asia and Latin America. India and China saw strong gains once again. India increased 58% with growth in transport and treatment, as well as the beginning of our deployment of a large Sensus metrology project, China was up 14%. And looking forward, we remain very confident about long-term growth opportunities in these markets.","Turning to orders, we saw 4% increase in the quarter this is on top of 10% orders growth in the first quarter of last year. And there are clear signs of continued strength with a 10% growth in backlog. Another important achievement, which is reflected in our backlog growth, is our recent deal with Philadelphia Water, announced in early February. This project focuses on smart metering infrastructure that incorporates our FlexNet communications technology. It is an example of the synergistic deals since the acquisition of Sensus that we are now uniquely positioned to secure and execute by leveraging strength from across our portfolio.","It is also a key milestone because with this award, we have now won contracts that represent nearly $200 million of revenue synergies, which exceeds our previously stated revenue synergy goal from the 2017 Investor Day of between $150 million to $175 million. It further highlights the power and sustainable long-term growth profile of our portfolio. Based on the strategy we have executed and acquisitions made, we are now positioned to offer solutions that target the most crucial issues facing our customers, challenges by water affordability, water scarcity and resilience, this is accelerating demand for our solutions. Our advanced infrastructure analytics or AIA platform is a clear example of this. That platform saw accelerated market momentum in the quarter with orders growth of over 30%.","We are building a robust pipeline with increasing interest of utilities in U.S. and a growing presence in Europe and Asia. Now, let me turn now to our margin performance, which was impacted by two primary factors. The first was unfavorable revenue mix that was an expected test and European aftermarket and service revenues. The second was unfavorable overhead absorption in a couple of about key factories, due to some demand planning decisions we made to optimize our inventory levels. Simply put, we still had a better process in place to align forecasted demand with production, we have taken steps to address our sales and operating planning process and we are confident that these margin effects are largely behind us.","I am now going to hand it over to Mark, who is going to give additional detail on the quarter, Mark?","Mark Rajkowski","Thanks Patrick. Please turn to Slide 5 and I will begin with our first quarter results. I am pleased with the continued market momentum we saw throughout the first quarter. Organic orders growth of 4% was in line with our expectations, very solid considering the tough comparison to last year's 10% growth. Revenues were up 6% in the quarter in at the high end of our revenue guidance. We had strong revenue growth across the majority of our geographic regions, led by the 12% growth in emerging markets and the 11% growth in the U.S.","China continued its strong growth trend with revenues up 14% with growth across each segment. Western Europe declined 2%, which was in line with our forecast and driven by a tough comparison to last year's first quarter, where we had significant software sale in several large treatment project deliveries. Each of our end markets grew in the quarter with continued strength in utilities market up 6% and 12% growth in commercial building services, which benefited from strong price realization, better than expected market conditions, end products.","Industrial and residential end markets both delivered solid growth of 4%. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 10.8%, down 30 basis points from the prior year. Cost reductions from our productivity programs in accelerating price realizations of 170 basis points where more than offset by inflation, growth investments and weaker sales mix. Part of the weaker mix of revenue was driven by lower than expected sales in a high margin test in service and aftermarket businesses in Europe.","We also had lower than expected overhead cost absorption in our applied water and water infrastructure segments. This was driven by lower production levels during the quarter to better align inventory to our market demand to optimize working capital. As Patrick mentioned, we have taken actions to better align our sales and operating planning processes and put this operational issues behind us. Earnings per share in the quarter were 52 cents, up 12% over the prior year, excluding foreign currency translation.","Please turn to Slide 7 and I will review our segment results. Water infrastructure; organic orders grew 2% in the quarter. This growth is on top of a tough comparison with 13% orders growth last year, where treatment orders grew 27% from several large project wins. Segment backlog was $700 million at the end of the quarter with $525 billion shippable in 2019. This is up 5% over last year.","Our treatment bidding pipeline, which we view as a bellwether of the health of the underlying utilities market, grew mid single digits this quarter, driven by growing project work in India and new opportunities in North America. Water infrastructure revenues grew 7% in the quarter.","Transport application revenues were up 7% benefiting from high single-digit growth in both the utility and industrial end markets. The strength in utilities was fueled by strong aftermarket sales in storm water resilience work in the US and may change growth in China from wastewater project deliveries. Industrial revenues were driven by our dewatering business, which was up 12% in the quarter with good growth in the mining and construction workers.","Treatment application revenues grew 4% in the quarter from project deliveries in the US in emerging markets where momentum remains strong. Emerging market revenue growth was 10% driven by India, which grew 19%, in China, which grew 21% in the quarter. With many of the major utilities in China, now completing projects to comply with water regulations, we are turning our focus to smaller and medium sized utilities to build or upgrade their treatment facilities to meet these regulations. We see a significant opportunity for growth in this segment of the China market in a pipeline for these projects is expanding.","In Western Europe, revenues were down as expected from lapping large treatment project deliveries last year. However, sales from our aftermarket and service business was softer than expected, which negatively impacted our mix of revenues in March. Operating margin for the segment increased to 110 basis points,12.4% compared to last year. Cost reductions, strong price realization, volume leverage more than offset inflation, a weaker sales mix investments to grow our business and lower overhead absorption.","Please turn to Slide 7. The applied water systems segment delivered 6% organic orders growth over the prior year. Segment backlog was $222 million at the end of the quarter, with $194 million due to ship in 2019. This is up 12% over last year. Segment revenues in the quarter grew 7% versus the prior year and we saw solid growth across each end market led by commercial business services. Geographically, we saw broad-based organic growth with the U.S., up 7%, Western Europe growing 4% and we had very strong growth of 16% in the emerging markets led by China which grew more than 30% driven by new project activity.","Segment operating margin for the quarter was 15.6%, which reflects 110 basis points of improvement compared to last year. Cost reduction is 300 basis points of price realization more than offset higher inflation, lower overhead absorption and foreign exchange headwinds.","Now please turn to Slide 8. Measurement and control solutions had 5% organic orders growth in the quarter, which is on top of 12% orders growth in last year's first quarter. Total backlog for this segment was $980 million at the end of the quarter, up 16%, with $400 million shippable in 2019, which is up 19% year-over-year. We continue to gain momentum in the segment with new contract wins. We expect growth in margins to ramp throughout the year as previously announced contract wins, including our recent win with Philadelphia Water will begin to deploy later in the second half of this year.","Segment revenues grew 5% organically in the quarter. The water business grew 15% driven by strength in the North American market from continued demand for a iPerl meters and AMI deployments for smaller and mid-sized utility customers. SaaS and other service revenues were down 3% as expected as the segment lapse the large software sales in Europe during the first half of last year. Energy, which is a combination of our electric and gas offering so, revenues declined 7% due to low lapping of the Alliant project deployment from last year. Test application revenues were flat in the quarter and below our expectations as the shipment of a large project was delayed by customer into the second quarter.","AIA organic revenues grew 10% in the quarter with growth across multiple regions. Strong customer interest continues for these new solutions and we are penetrating new markets as we leverage existing Xylem channels in customer relationships. Segment operating margins contracted 420 basis points to 7.4%. Benefits from volume growth and cost reductions were more than offset by inflation, in favorable mix impact from last year, high-margin software sale and investments to accelerate the growth of our AIA platform.","We were also impacted by lower than expected revenues in our high margin test business. The good news is that we saw some improvement in the availability of components and expect that challenge to be largely behind us by the end of the second quarter. We continue to outlook strong margin expenditures for the second half of 2019, driven by improving mix, the scaling of our AIA platform in buying market. One new challenge we were working through all of our order processing delays that we are experiencing in getting product from our Mexican supplier into the U.S. The team is managing this well to minimize impacts to our customers.","Now let us turn to Slide 9 for an overview of cash flow in the Company's financial position. We closed the quarter with a cash balance of $275 million. We returned $83 million of cash to our shareholders in the quarter through share repurchases and dividends. We invested $69 million in CapEx during the quarter, which is modestly higher than our full-year run rate and primarily related to timing. Investing in the business remains an important driver of growth for us. That said, we will remain disciplined and continue to forecast full-year capital spending between $230 million and $240 million.","Our working capital increased [Technical Difficulty]. This is in line with our expectations and driven by the inventory build during the second half of 2018 to address tariff and component issues. These inventories will be worked down over the next two quarters and we expect our working capital and free cash flow conversion to continue to improve each quarter. Cash flow from operations improved over 30% from last year's first quarter and free cash flow conversion improved substantially.","As a reminder, the first quarter is our seasonally weakest cash flow period as we build inventory for the back half of the year. We continue on track to meet our full year target of 105% free cash flow conversion. On a final note, earlier this quarter we announced a new credit revolver tied to our sustainability performance. This is the first of it's in our sector, and we are pleased to be able to align the interest of our shareholders for more efficient financing with our focus on sustainability and social value creation.","Please turn to Slide 10 and Patrick will cover our 2019 end market outlook.","Patrick Decker","The view of our end markets for the full year remains largely unchanged from the guidance we provided on our last earnings call. While relapse some tougher year-over-year comparisons, the growth that we saw in the first quarter combined with healthy orders and backlog reinforces our confidence in our growth momentum for 2019. I will quickly run through some key points for each one of our end markets.","In the utilities market, we still expect solid growth in the U.S. where we continue to see strong project backlog and a very healthy aftermarket business. Even with tough comparisons through the balance of the year, we still expect mid-single digit growth in the U.S. We are moderating our outlook for Europe slightly as we saw some softening from uncertainty in the UK. In the emerging markets, China and India continue to lead the way, regulation is expanding in both countries and adoption of our advanced treatment technology and other core infrastructure work is accelerating.","We therefore, maintain mid single digit growth expectations in the overall utilities market. In industrial, we continue to expect low to mid single digit growth as we foresee moderation in the second half of the year. While mining and construction boosted first quarter growth, we do expect general slowing consistent with our last outlook. In commercial, we saw another quarter of strong growth, driven primarily by the activity in the US and China. We do expect that the market will moderate in the back half of the year and we will also face challenging comparisons.","However, our performance in the first quarter and outlook based on order demand gives us confidence to raise the outlook for commercial for the full year slightly to mid-single digits. Our residential outlook remains at low-single digit growth. Signs of a flattening U.S. housing market, low single-digit growth in Europe and a mixed outlook across emerging markets all remain unchanged from our guidance at last quarter.","Now, please turn to Slide 11 and we will provide an update on the rest of our guidance for 2019. As we just discussed, we started the year with solid top line growth and continue to expect to deliver organic revenue growth of 4% to 6%. We are adjusting our operating margin outlook to a range of 14.5% to 14.9%. This represents healthy expansion of 80 to 120 basis points. We expect similar improvement on an adjusted EBITDA basis which would bring it to a range of 20.3% to 20.6%. This updated outlook takes into account our performance last quarter and stronger dollar for the remainder of the year. Let me pause for a moment and talk about other actions we are taking to improve our margin profile.","We first talked at our 2017 Investor day about our overall approach to business simplification, which included two primary components. First, the implementation of a global business services platform, which represents the simplification of a number of our back office functions; I will come back to this in a moment. Second, broader organizational opportunities to do further management de-layering and elimination of other duplicate support functions; since that time, we have advanced this effort to reduce complexity, within the organization, allowing us to be faster and more agile, so we can serve our customers better. These actions are being taken as we speak and we expect to see modest savings this year with the bulk of the savings being realized in 2020.","Now, turning back to our full year guidance, we are revising the adjusted EPS to a range of $3.12 to $3.32 cents, which reflects a reduction of $0.04 for the stronger dollar and $0.04 for the shortfall in the first quarter. This represents solid growth year-over-year of between 8% and 13%. And finally, we continue to expect at least 105% free cash flow conversion in a long track to do so.","Let me now turn it back over to Mark to work in summary other full-year and second quarter details.","Mark Rajkowski","On Slide 12, we are providing the seasonal profile of our business, as well as highlights of our updated 2019 planning assumptions. We continue to expect 4% to 6% organic growth for 2019, which brings down by segment as follows. We expect 5% to 7% growth in Water Infrastructure, 3% to 5% growth in applied water systems and 4% to 6% growth in measurement and control solutions. We are now assuming a year rate 1.12, which was the average for the month of April and we have included that in our FX sensitivity table in the appendix.","We are increasing our forecast for restructuring and realignment costs for the year to $60 million to $70 million. The increase relates to the actions Patrick covered earlier related to organization simplification. The increase in estimated restructuring charges will largely be recorded in the back half of this year with the majority of savings being realized in 2020. Our estimated tax rate for 2019 remains at 19.5%.","Now moving to the second quarter. We expect total company growth in the range of 4% to 6%, led by continued strength in the U.S. municipal market, as well as broad-based growth in China and India. We expect second quarter adjusted operating margin to be in the range of 14.3% to 14.5%, representing 50 basis points to 70 basis points of expansion over the prior year. We expect continued strong margin expansion in both our water infrastructure and applied water system segments, driven by cost reductions, volume leverage and improved price realization. We expect margin expansion of about 20 to 60 basis points from our MCS segment, which reflects moderating impacts from the component supply mix challenges [Technical Difficulty]\u2026","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, please continue to hold till the conference is restarted. And you are live and you may resume.","Patrick Decker","Yes, so this is Patrick and sorry we have had some technical difficulties that I can assure you were not planned. So, we are going to go back to Slide 13. I realized that some of my comments may be redundant here, but it is important as we talk about this section of the call that you hear it in its entirety. A little over two years ago, we laid out our financial targets through 2020 at our Investor Day, we continue to make solid progress and are on track for the high end of our organic growth target of 4% to 6%, notably, having delivered 8% growth in 2018.","Our adjusted EBITDA margin target is on track as well having finished last year at 19.5% and an outlook for this year between 20.3% and 20.6%. This is clearly indicative of the strong operational expansion and volume leverage from growth that we've seen, which also stripped out the noise from purchase accounting amortization. Our adjusted EPS is also tracking at the high end of our target of mid-teens growth as we delivered 20% growth last year and 18% growth year before. Our outlook for this year is at roughly 12% growth at the midpoint of our range.","In the next year, adjusted operating margin. I realize there may be some questions about our ability to achieve our target in the 2020 time frame, while continuing to support our growth objectives. And while we have made significant progress, there are a couple of things have changed as we laid out those targets back in 2017. First, earlier this month we made the decision to delay the next phase of actions related to our global business services initiative. We decided to do this in order to optimize its implementation and minimize any potential disruption to revenue growth.","Having said that, we remain fully committed this opportunity and we expect these savings to be realized but delayed now into late 2020 and 2021; second, the target for set before we acquired few technologies and the other businesses that we have acquired to build our new AIA platform. This platform and the growing demand for our digital solutions across the entire company is helping us set the pace for innovation in the sector. This is reflected in the strong growth we are seeing and the excitement around are integrated offerings. As a result, we remain confident in the longer term margin expansion potential of this portfolio and expect margins to expand at least 100 basis points in 2020 with further healthy margin expansion in 2021 beyond as we scale the capabilities we have been building in our new platform.","With that, let us turn to Slide 14 to wrap up before questions. So in closing, we continue to see strong demand for our solutions and we are in the early stage of our digital journey, which is already reshaping the way water is managed for communities around the globe. While we had a disappointing quarter in regards to our margin performance, we have taken actions to ensure that we deliver our 2019 commitments, while investing in our business to realize the very attractive growth opportunities in front of us as well as longer-term margin expansion opportunities. We are firmly committed to executing and creating value for our stakeholders, which includes enabling our customers to harness the power of technology to solve their toughest challenges and helping them transform the future.","So with that, operator, we'd be happy to take questions now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.","Deane Dray","Maybe we can start with the, the first quarter and the margin miss here and Patrick I apologize I missed like the first a minute or so of your opening remarks, but the next layer of detail when you talked about your lower factory absorption and demand planning decisions that said we need more help there and are seeing what actually went wrong oftentimes that's an ERP decision or just in the chain of linking the demand with the actual factory deployment and inventory commitments and so what went wrong and how the degree of confidence that it's fixed?","Patrick Decker","I'll speak first then, Mark, add some color here as well. So you have to be very clear what we're targeting here is, as you recall, we built up inventories at the end of December ahead of the expected tariff increases and some component shortages. So we came into the year, knowing we had higher inventory levels and you recall that actually had led to some of the bullet and free cash flow conversion last quarter. So we made the conscious decision to work down those inventories are in the factory. The disconnect was in terms of that getting translated by couple of factories into a financial forecast that we would have built into our guidance originally as we came out of the quarter. That's where the miss occurred and we've taken the actions now within our supply chain organization and the finance team at the factory level, make sure that disconnect was resolved and does not reoccur.","Mark Rajkowski","I want to add anything. And part of it is making sure we have the right folks involved in those conversations at the right levels. Also as we work through this beginning of April and the team working on to make sure that we've completely through where some of the gaps were so we make sure that does not happen again.","Deane Dray","And can you size for us between those three factors, mix factory absorption. I understand the mix had to abandon that order pushout at AIA but size for us the mix of the 3 including FX?","Mark Rajkowski","In terms of the mix and it wasn't AIA, that was our analytics business or test business and also we saw softer than expected revenues in our aftermarket service business in Europe. And that impact in the quarter was roughly 25-30 basis points. And then on the absorption and just on this absorption point I want to make sure that you understand that investors. This is an isolated incident in a couple of our factories, it is across all of our factories and we do have our hands on it, but it did impact both AWS in Water Infrastructure by approximately, 45 to 50 basis points in the quarter.","Deane Dray","And then the second question on the push-out of the margin target, the 17% to 18% by 2020. It sounds as though one of the tripping factors was this slower roll out in the global business services. So, yeah, what was its contribution expected to be, was it 100 basis points there and why was it not ready. So maybe start there?","Patrick Decker","We had, yes. So if we go back to Investor Day in 2017 and we laid out, the various drivers of the margin walk to that expansion target of that are 100 basis points was going to come from what we called broader business simplification of which part of that was global business services, which is all about the back office simplification, what we are talking about finance, IT, HR, work implementation etc.","The other piece of that 100 basis points was be with broader organization simplification, which are the actions that we just announced here in the call today and foreshadowed back in the last earnings call. So those are the two big drivers. We are still going forward with both, but what we said I have said in the past that doing a global business services implementation. We have the experience in doing this and we understand the importance of getting it right and not letting it become a distraction or disrupt the front end of the business in terms of top line demand.","We are in the midst of that implementation, we have learned some things in the first couple of phases of roll out that caused us early this month to say, we are not putting a hold on it. We simply spreading of the time frame to make sure that we do not rush and then we get it right, and that is the single biggest driver too why we are pushing out the margin target expectations beyond 2020. And then as you can also see, we have been making other investments behind this new AIA platform that was not in the original 2017 Investor Day discussion.","Mark Rajkowski","So maybe just a little bit of color in terms of where we're at. We had our initial wave implementations in January of this year in the U.S., so it's a meaningful part of our revenues and that included new ledger, new master data, new processes for quarter-to-cash quarter with floors procure to pay and parts of the implementation are going well, other parts are not where we want them to be and it is taking a little bit more effort and time then we like relative to getting our financial information. So, we have work to do to optimize these processes and as Patrick said, we are going to get this done, we are going to get savings, but we are going to do it right and so we push the waves out that we had scheduled for currently to later in the back of the year and that is going to push out the entire implementation.","Patrick Decker","So Deane, one other thing I would add, and this is I am sure on the minds of others on the call. I would not be clear we could have made the decision to take a bunch of other additional cost out including cutting some investment to make our '17 and '18 margin targets that is not our approach, because of the growth in the health that we see in the portfolio and the attractive margin accretion from this growth over time. So, I just want to be clear, there is not as if we did not have areas as we could go back, but that is not going to be our approach here.","Deane Dray","And just one last clarification and then that will be all from me, but the clarification on the delayed implementation on global business services. Patrick, you said in the prepared remarks, I was one to make sure I understand where the timing of the initiatives starts and when the savings start coming into the P&L, just to clarify that?","Patrick Decker","So we had very modest amount of savings in 2019, big part of the savings in the original timeline in 2020 with the remainder flowing through in 2021 and now that has moved out, almost a year.","Mark Rajkowski","Effectively, about three quarters is the phasing out being so, as to why we would not get nearly as much as we would expected in '20, we will get that in '21 at a larger scale being at originally planned.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Nathan Jonson, Stifel.","Nathan Jonson","I guess we can stop endlessly talking about the 17%, 18% percent margin target now, just a question on the miss and the internal part of that in 1Q, you guys are certainly have a reputation for not making those internal errors. Maybe Mark, you can talk a little bit more about what was behind that, how isolated you think it is, have you reevaluated the internal FP & A process to make sure that this thing does not come up again. It is pretty unusual for you guys to have this thing?","Mark Rajkowski","It is a really good question. And as I mentioned just a moment ago, we have got a lot of factories, a few dozen or more around the Company and it was really in 3 factories and we all gets down to this sales and operations planning process right signals into from our commercial teams into the factories and then translating that into financial outlook and we had, missed there were communication around that process needs to be really, really tight particularly, as you are going through some changes in as you trying to balance inventories and making sure that we, do what we say we are trying to do and not more, but also making sure we are getting good signals from the commercial teams into the factory.","So there, as a whole line of communications, including finance that is required and quite frankly they innovate, they were not as tight as they needed to be. And part of that is making sure we have got the right leadership in that process to make those calls. So it is isolated, we know where the breakdown occurred and I can assure you this is a hot topic with our Senior leadership team and Senior finance folks to make sure that it does not happen again. And it boils down to really good communication.","Nathan Jonson","I think our net all I would offer up here is not to further pile up on the [Technical Difficulty]\u2026","Operator","And again, ladies and gentlemen, this is the operator, today's conference will resume momentarily.","Patrick Decker","Okay, sorry about that, Nate. I don\u2019t know how much of the answer you heard.","Nathan Jonson","We cut out right as you started talking, Patrick.","Patrick Decker","You missed some good stuff. You missed the best part of the call. So your comments around -- this is very much unlike us. As I said, we take these things very seriously and we own this, we were on it. I think the thing that was unique here not to so much explained, but why this time around, I think it is the first time in a long while that we have been in a situation where we were purposely working off so much inventory toward our working capital numbers in a couple of our factories and it was net in terms of the hand off and communication, in terms of what the absorption impact would be on the back as a result of that. So that is the piece that mark in the finance team are all over and we got the right leaders involved in the commercial side in the factories to make sure those things it incorrectly do not happen again.","Nathan Jonson","So I guess my second question here is going to be back to the fundamentals of the business now, order rate in the quarter still pretty healthy 4% against a pretty tough comp of 10% last year. Are there any markets where you are seeing any slowdown in order growth? I thought maybe Europe Industrial. Yeah, I mean, I thought maybe commercial but you are taking guidance for that up, just any color you have around the order trends you are seeing?","Patrick Decker","So really the only area that we have seen some level of order softness and it impacted in the quarter, we think it will be for the balance of the year is some softness in Europe, which is really driven by the uncertainty in the UK. And so again, the UK was down 3% on its own in first quarter and we are expecting to be down, mid single digits or so in Q2, and maybe low single digit for the full year, so that would be the one area I would say we are seeing some softness, we think it is still just purely a timing issue as we work through the uncertainty there in the UK.","Other than that we saw strength across the board, I will also give color on the 4%. Not only is that against a harder compare from last year, 10. But we also had a large treatment project that we would expected to win and we expect to win, did not get awarded in March. It is likely to get awarded here in Q2 that would have normalized back up to probably mid-single digit, so in order growth. So, we still feel quite confident about the momentum behind the business.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your next question comes from Scott Graham with BMO Capital.","Scott Graham","The MCS margin was obviously pretty difficult in the quarter, and I know you explained some things that you are expecting from at least what I heard before you cut off that you are expecting the margin to be up in the second quarter and maybe just a wreck that bridge for us is that is a big swing.","Patrick Decker","Unfortunately, you cut out. I think what I heard, Scott was a bridge in terms of how things get better in Q2 for MCS.","Scott Graham","So there is a couple of things, one is the fact that the, we will continue to scale our AIA platform and there is good margin drop there. We will also seen improvement in mix as well as we will start to see some moderation of the impacts on tariffs, but it is really a combination and component shortages, but it is really mix better mix, better scaling around our AIA platform in a little bit less challenge, if you will in our supply chain.","Mark Rajkowski","Are you still there, Scott?","Scott Graham","When you say you expecting better mix, mix is always difficult to predict. I know that you gave some explanation, but you are seeing in your delivery book, a better mix for the second quarters, is that\u2026","Mark Rajkowski","Yes, a couple of pieces to that nature pieces are the lapping of the alignment installation, which had low margins on the installed because subcontract in a work out, so that is a big chunk. And then we expect a much better mix and a higher mix of water and that carries higher margins than in the energy, electric and those are really the two big factors.","Patrick Decker","So in this business, we have got really good visibility into backlog, because of these large deals that we won in the margin profile of those, and when the installs are expected to occur. And then we have got good insight into what the day to day replacement businesses and so in that regard. That is what gives us great confidence that we are going to see the margin expansion in the second half of the year relative to Q1.","Mark Rajkowski","The other thing too, we got off to a late start in price driving price in the business, and really did not have much, if any, last year we had a little bit in Q1. We have gone out and raise some prices and that those rent bump in Q2 in the second half of the year, so that will be some help as well.","Scott Graham","So, the preponderance of the guide down on the margin is MCS largely\u2026","Mark Rajkowski","First, let me make sure I understand that question we see the guide.","Patrick Decker","Now that you are actually the guide down. Scott is really tied to two specific thing, but I know with the call dropping here a few times it made invest the guide down specifically $0.04 for currency and that just is actually re-striking it at the latest Euro rate and then the second is just the in Q1 we recover, maybe a candidate. We are basically saying right now, we are not counting on recovering that we are not going to go slash cost just to recover that it would come back on other investments we need to maintain.","Operator","And your next question comes from John Walsh with Credit Suisse.","John Walsh","I guess maybe the first question, just thinking about the strong order growth. The strong sales, I think you guys have done a very good job explaining what is happened with the margin, but it does lead to the question what is actually in the backlog in terms of the margin and if that still relatively healthy, if you are seeing margin backlog still expand year-over-year. Any color around that would be helpful.","Patrick Decker","We do feel good about margins and backlog. We have got good visibility on that, I would say is, again it is a function of the mix between project work and day-to-day book and ship business is healthy. Two; we have seen very good pricing traction. Again, as you will recall over the course of last year and that continues as we go forward here. When you look at the mix of MCS business that Mark alluded to, where it is going to be much heavier water business, which is substantially higher margin than electric and gas. Those are the projects that we see in backlog in the second half.","John Walsh","So is it fair to say that the margin in the backlog is actually up year-on-year. And then maybe just a question around the pipeline as you think around what is out there in the market in terms of acquisition opportunity?","Patrick Decker","I think as we have said before, we maybe just reiterate the key focus areas for us. We have talked before about we do think that there continue to see opportunities, if I think about it first from the utility space perspective we think we have got a great platform here. We do think there are opportunities as we continue to build out our AIA platform that there are both opportunities there to build out an even stronger decisions intelligence type offering to utilities.","We just did a small acquisition in Germany, it is very, very small, but it is a terrific artificial intelligence capability for inside the treatment plant and we closed that deal just about a month or so back small deal, but really excited about leveraging that on a global scale. So, in the utility space, I think it will largely be just a series of tuck-ins and bolt-ons that will not be material from a financial perspective, but be material in terms of strength in the solution to the customer.","Beyond that, again, we continue to look at opportunities across the industrial water space. It is a fairly fragmented area, we do see there being some interesting ideas out there, not foreshadowing or signaling anything there. We will continue to be disciplined there from a valuation standpoint, I do not see anything in the immediate term, but that is an area we continue to keep our eyes and ears close to the ground on.","Operator","And your next question comes from Joe Giordano with Cowen & Company.","Joe Giordano","So, I just wanted to start on free cash flow. So you guys are maintaining your target for 2019 here, but you are also doubling our percent effectively the restructuring for the year. So, talk us through given the some of the issues you faced here in 1Q, how conservative is that target to get incrementally more aggressive by keeping it flat.","Mark Rajkowski","Joe, that is a good question relative to the impact of restructuring, a lot of that was that really gets at is the timing of the accounting impact and not necessarily all of the cash flows. So, we think that in terms of the cash flow related to restructuring, it may be up a little bit, but we are not expecting that to have material negative impact on that free cash flow conversion.","Joe Giordano","So you went from 30 something to 60 to 70 in restructuring, but you are saying most of that incremental increase the cash impact of that is next year.","Mark Rajkowski","And most of that is will be late in the year and not all of that is going to be paid out in cash. And I would say, Joe. What also gives us confidence around that cash conversion is literally just be the decisions and working with made in Q1 to work at inventories, and so that will have a conversion benefit in terms of helping to get to our working capital numbers.","Patrick Decker","And I would say that there is still inventory built up there, related to tariffs that will continue to warrant down through the course of the year.","Joe Giordano","And then next, I know so we are not supposed to talk about 2020 targets anymore, but I am going to ask one. So you pushed the operating target which I think our people are hoping to see you kept the EBITDA target. So I am just curious now. Are you effectively just pushing out the amortization and not the simplification benefit because like the EBITDA target staying the same, so just curious as to how that how you square that?","Mark Rajkowski","Our EBITDA has been running ahead of it more in line with our targets been than our operating margin. Obviously, a chunk of that is related to the related to the amortization. So, we are still expecting to be within the range of the EBITDA target that we put out there for 2020.","Joe Giordano","But effectively, like the operating margin change was because of amortization and because of the push-out of the global business areas and the simplification\u2026","Mark Rajkowski","So obviously the global business services impact is going to impact both operating margin and in EBITDA margin. The amortization related to our acquisitions continues to be part of that calculation is also in others taxes there is interest, all of those are components of the EBITDA.","Patrick Decker","Joe, we will finish this year, roughly around 20.5% EBIT in EBITDA. So, we are committed to a 100 basis points for next year that will be on both, right. So we will finish roughly in that target was about 21.5 to 22.5 on EBITDA from the Investor day.","Operator","And your next question comes from Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Lee","You maybe if I could just squeeze one last one in my maybe hopefully the last one in for you guys on the, in the long-term margin targets. Is this effectively just a one-year push out? Are you committing to those original targets in the 2021 time frame or where we might be to finite in China pigeonhole you guys.","Mark Rajkowski","I mean I think what we are committing to here Brian is we confident around 100 basis points of margin expansion next year. We think that trend line can continue in terms of just continued healthy progression on margins for some time to come, not in a position here today to declare new targets for '21 and beyond, will do that obviously later this year as we are get closer within the year and we are talking only about 20, but we are getting new longer-term target to that point.","Brian Lee","And then just second question, you mentioned a couple of times throughout the call, this Philadelphia win, which is encouraging, especially in the context of the water business that part of the mix picking up, so it could you guys give us some frame of reference in terms of how big this deployment is in relation to other water deployments in your backlog and then maybe related to that. I noticed the SaaS business was a bit weaker in the quarter, I know there were some tougher comps, but does that reverse in the second half with this Philadelphia deployment or are there other deployments that drive that part of the business and MCS back to double-digit growth later in the year. Thanks guys.","Patrick Decker","So the Philly water deal, it is sizable and it is in our backlog now and it really, it is not yet in orders. So, we secure the contract, but we have got the orders as they place them on us and we expect that really to be happening later this year mainly into 2020. The general size that we have here is similar to other deals we have been out the, you can take somewhere between roughly $60 to $90 million is the ballpark out if it moves around a bit, depending upon the final specs, etc., but it is a meaningful size deal.","We do still see a number of other large deals out there in the pipeline with the team is going after both in North America, but also we are still pursuing a number of them on the international side, there are also both the combination of AMI metering deployments, but also broader link between that in our new AIA platform around things like water losses, non revenue water, etc. So, those would likely be announced either late this year, early next and so and those would certainly be an attractive margins to the current portfolio.","Brian Lee","And just quickly on the SaaS. The SaaS makes any any views into when those trends pick back up moving through the year.","Patrick Decker","We think certainly we are already. We saw a little bit of, I mean the issue in the quarter was simply specifically a compare of a large software sale that we did in Europe last year was one project, again we do not want to get into spend two quarters and so that will be behind us. If you look at the rest of our SaaS offering, which is predominantly coming out of our AI platform, as well as my side of the business with Sensus, we continue to see very good growth in healthcare. We talked about the 30% orders growth in AIA in the quarter. We see that accelerating based upon the market demand and the deployment that we are doing and expect that to be in converting into organic revenue really in Q2 through the end of the year and onward.","Operator","And your next question comes from Brett Lindsay with Vertical Research.","Brett Lindsay","I wanted to go back to the margin bridge and specifically, the cost inflation bucket that actually worsened relative to Q4 and just wondering what some of the moving parts are in terms of the underlying components there. And then just on the strategic investments that was actually a positive swing in water infrastructure applied with delta of about 150 bps relative to last Q4 just timing on investments you throttle back a little bit. Any color would be good.","Mark Rajkowski","In terms of inflation is that is, it is largely in line, it might be up a little bit I mean there really was not any incremental impact related to tariffs we been seeing that already in the fourth quarter same thing with components, maybe a little bit in freight, but nothing material, and certainly, as we look out over the course of this year, we would expect that to trend down as we lap some of those tougher comparisons in the back half of last year, so that will decrease. Now, the second part of your question related to investments with AWS\u2026","Brett Lindsay","No, specific to water infrastructure and applied, just looking at the delta that was a drag it all of 2018 in Q4, but it was actually a tailwind here in the Q1.","Mark Rajkowski","Well, we still have some investments in Water Infrastructure. So, we certainly did throughout on an enterprise-wide basis, most notably when you look at MNCS. So we are continuing to invest, particularly in that segment, but in other parts of our business as well.","Brett Lindsay","And then just shifting to the restructuring, up about $35 billion at the midpoint, I know it is back-end loaded, but where are the targeted opportunities by the at the segment level?","Mark Rajkowski","Yes. So, all refrain from getting into too much of the Inside Baseball on details of the work moves as we are in the midst of doing those as we speak. It is broad based, it is not really targeted, I would say on any one segment. Each one of our three segments have opportunities here that we are going to streamlining and it is a broader de-layering and elimination some of the duplicate support from we got so, I probably would not want to go into more caller than that right now and if you could share more with you on the next call.","Brett Lindsay","And then maybe just one follow-up on the U.S. growth, it has been very strong across the board. What is your sense of the underlying market rate or run rate here in those pieces of the business. And then as you examine those out growth factors, what the big drivers the channel products in any color would be good.","Patrick Decker","So, I would say the predominant drivers that we are seeing are really I would say threefold. First is because that U.S. number is a companywide number. So, in the U.S. you see first of all, a continued healthy utility market and we believe the utility market is growing really a mid-single digit level and what we are seeing there in terms of faster growth in that we do believe is market share gain and that is predominantly within our transport business, but also treatment. Second driver is we again continue to see accelerated growth of especially in orders on the new AIA platform, which is heavily concentrated right now in the U.S., as well as some of the project wins within piece of the organization.","I think in those in both areas we see those as being sustainable. The one that I would say we are expecting to see some moderation of growth would be within our applied Water business on the industrial side in the U.S. where we have been running pretty hot there for the past year, year and a half all of that has come from a couple of things. One, we made at the organization move about a year and a half ago, where we integrated the commercial teams around our applied water and in our water infrastructure businesses and we have been getting a large amount of revenue synergies there that reflects share gains by expanding channel, streamlining our distribution channels and just incentivizing people to go out and sell the portfolio.","And so, there comes a point where you start lapping that and so, we would say that part of the business would begin to moderate down to probably more low-mid single digits at the back half of this year. So, when you do the math on all that that is why we are saying for the full year while we did 11% in Q1. We do expect that to be more medium to high-single digits in Q2 and then blends out for the full year at somewhere in that high-single digit level for the full year aggregated.","Operator","And your next question comes from Walter Liptak with Seaport Global.","Walter Liptak","Just have a quick follow-up, the first quarter margin issue, I just want to clarify that was a problem they get taken care of and that is behind us now.","Mark Rajkowski","As both Patrick and I mentioned and there is a couple of follow-ups on that you may not have been on online at that point, but yeah, we have done quite a bit of work around that in terms of our sales and operations planning process, we know what the root causes are and we have taken corrective action, so we do believe that is fully behind us.","Walter Liptak","And then it sounds like despite some of the macro international things that are going on that your order intake internationally, still looks pretty stable for this year, and I wonder if you could just talk about that especially on the larger systems side.","Patrick Decker","So yes, we definitely are seeing continued robust demand pretty much consistently across outside of North America. I would say the one exception to that would be I did mention earlier some softness in the UK that affected our European results. So, we are guiding Europe and the low-single digits for the full year. But the rest of international certainly across Asia, we see continued very robust growth there in terms of orders and bidding pipeline. The same is the case within Latin America. We see some great results there. We see strength continuing in Eastern Europe. And I would say the Middle East has moderated but is healthier now for us than it was last year and so, it feels pretty good, right now touch wood. And again the things we look at our things like line and backlog and that is where we have our comments.","Operator","And your next question comes from Andrew Buscaglia with Berenberg. Andrew, your line is open. Please state your question. Andrew, your line may be on mute.","Andrew Buscaglia","Just wanted to just delve into your guidance. Obviously that is come out a few times on the call. Just given, it is still implies a big, I am questioning you how conservative if there is any contingency in place for some of the issues that occurred in Q1 and then you are talking about moderation in a number of areas, Industrial, Commercial talked about softness in the UK, Middle East moderating, Applied Water even, so why, so your guidance is only reduced by the mix and the FX, but where do you get this confidence, are you being conservative enough to meet your expectations for the year.","Patrick Decker","Obviously, we go through a lot of analysis and digging into these things before we put together a guidance for the full year. And certainly as we look to do adjusted downward, by definition, we make sure that we build in appropriate [Technical difficulty] to be able to cover for a rainy day, obviously we are not proud and missed that in Q1 for the reasons that we described. But we feel confident that we have got an appropriate range there and the issues around the words moderation that I used, those are all embedded in the 4% to 6% organic revenue guide, which still gives us some room in the case of things or soften, it also addresses that the top of some the comps do get tougher in the second half of the year from a growth standpoint, but we feel we have got all that reflected in embedded in our guidance.","Mark Rajkowski","Well, I would point out big certainly a big part of that is also our MCS segment. We had -- the comps are certainly much easier there and we know we have a ramp big ramp in higher margin water business scaling up AIA, so we have good confidence in that. We continue to drive productivity and we expect that to ramp in throughout the course of the year. So, as Patrick said, particularly after not hitting your numbers. We were particularly focused on making sure that we identified all of the potential risks out there and we had sufficient contingencies address.","Andrew Buscaglia","And maybe just one more on your MCS side, that disappointing this quarter, but where some of the things get like the energy applications due to lapping a volume project, the softness, it sounds like you had a tough comp in the SaaS piece what maybe where did it, we would not have expected or where you missed in that in your guidance or your steering us to where that margin would be this quarter.","Mark Rajkowski","The miss in the quarter, we were a little bit below what we had out and that was primarily a function of mix and just, we expected better sales growth in our high margin test business, that is our analytics equipment sensors and it was flat. And that was really the difference between what we outlook and what we delivered from a margin perspective.","Patrick Decker","And just be clear, again we are not talking about the AIA platform, we are talking about the traditional analytics piece of the MCS segment, which is very high gross margins for us and it was a specific project in Europe that got pushed out. And that drove the shortfall there, it hit margin hard just because the gross margins in that business.","Operator","Thank you. And your final question will come from Shereen Undavia with Raymond James.","Shereen Undavia","This is Shereen on for Paul. If I'm not mistaken, it's been over a year since your last acquisition announcement. That as a pretty long M&A hiatus for you, so I was wondering if there is an indication of private company valuation that have gone to rich or should we read anything else into that?","Patrick Decker","I would not read anything into our year passing in terms of not doing M&A to do anything with valuations. I mean obviously, valuations move around and they vary depending upon the target that you are exploring. But I think, we just important to pause on anything of significance, over the last year, while we continue to focus in on the successful integration of both as well as pure and building up this new platform, this new AIA platform. And so since, then we have done a few small tuck-ins and bolt-ons that are not material from a financial standpoint that are strategically. We continue to explore and we will continue to be active in terms of M&A, win the right opportunities present themselves are strategically and financially. But no, I would not read anything into it being a commentary on valuation.","Operator","Thank you. I will now turn the floor back over to Patrick Decker for any closing remarks or any additional remarks.","Patrick Decker","Sure will again thank you all for bearing with this here this morning on the technical difficulties. I know it was painful on this end and so, appreciate your patience and for this and also by hanging on the phone a bit longer than we normally planned. Appreciate the ongoing support. Look forward to get back to you after our Q2 results. We appreciate your support. Safe travels and we will be in touch soon. Thank you.","Operator","And thank you.

Please go ahead, sir.","Matthew Latino - Xylem, Inc.","Thank you, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to Xylem's Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. With me today are Chief Executive Officer, Patrick Decker; and Chief Financial Officer, Mark Rajkowski. They will provide their perspective on Xylem's second quarter 2018 results and discuss the full year outlook. Following our prepared remarks, we will address questions related to the information covered on the call. I'll ask that you please keep to one question and a follow-up and then return to the queue.","As a reminder, this call and our webcast are accompanied by a slide presentation available in the Investors section of our website at www.xylem.com. A replay of today's call will be available until midnight on August 30th. Please note, the replay number is 800-585-8367 and the confirmation code is 5289-886.

And I will turn the call over to our CEO, Patrick Decker.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Thanks, Matt. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today to discuss our second quarter results. We delivered another quarter of strong results at both the top and bottom line. Our teams' strong execution again led to share gains in key end markets. They were also very disciplined in their approach to pricing actions, leveraging our strong positions in the marketplace, and I'm quite pleased with the traction we've already achieved. Importantly, these factors contributed to an excellent operational performance, one in which we expanded margins and delivered strong double-digit earnings growth. The momentum we've built broadly across our businesses is continuing and supports our updated expectations for the full year.","Let me now read you a few of the details. In the second quarter, we again delivered solid broad-based orders and revenue growth across all of our major markets. Orders increased 8% in the second quarter, making this the third consecutive quarter of high single- to double-digit orders growth. Our Water Infrastructure business, again, was a standout in this regard with treatment orders up 25% in the quarter and transport up mid-single-digits. Our treatment project bidding pipeline was also up double-digits in the quarter.","Revenue in the quarter grew 8% organically with strength across nearly every end market and region. As I mentioned earlier, we made good progress in our price realization efforts in the quarter. The combination of our strong brands and positions in the marketplace as well as the health of our end markets helped us gain and sustain significant pricing traction. These efforts are continuing and are an important part of our effort to offset the impact of rising input cost.","In addition, we continue to deliver on our continuous improvement initiatives. This helped us drive a 70-basis point year-over-year increase in both our adjusted EBITDA margin and our operating margin in the second quarter and we delivered a 24% increase in our adjusted earnings per share. So, across the board, a very strong quarter, in fact a very strong first half of the year.","Before I turn over to Mark, I want to provide a few comments on our strategic work. Our consistent performance building quarter-after-quarter really reflects the focus our teams have on executing our strategic priories, which provides a roadmap to evolving our company to a faster growing, highly innovative and more profitable enterprise. These initiatives are advancing our progress towards our long-term financial targets and helping us foster a culture that is united in our purpose.","Let me quickly review our progress. First is accelerating profitable growth. We address this first by driving commercial excellence. We've made significant strides over the past three years to improve how we do business with our customers, making it easier for them to work with us. While obvious on its face, it's much more complicated to change the way previously independent business teams and brands work together to harness the full scale and power of Xylem solutions to solve our customers' challenges. But success breeds success. And today, our teams have better tools and are collaborating in new ways to maintain focus where it should be, which is on the customer.","Furthermore, this shift in how we execute in the marketplace is advancing our progress on revenue synergies. These synergies are of varied size and scale. Some take considerable time to bring to fruition, while others are already occurring in the due course of business. Year-to-date, we won about $30 million in synergy deals which largely will be recognized in 2019 and beyond. By way of example, one is a communications network deal leveraging our FlexNet platform along with smart meters for a consortium of water utilities operating in the Midwestern U.S. Another deal is one of the larger leak detection projects for a utility in Southeast Asia in which our Visenti technologies will be deployed across more than 6,000 kilometers of pipe.","These deals are great demonstrations of how Xylem's financial strength and longstanding customer relationships can be leveraged to drive additional opportunities. In addition, we are in late stage pursuit of finalizing a couple of medium-sized deals with larger deals in our sights. Some are expected to be announced by the end of the year or early 2019. The bigger picture is that this type of collaboration is happening across our global business teams and it's yielding results. We have a growing number of pilot projects in the field and we've already expanded this collaborative effort to our Advanced Infrastructure Analytics platform.","The second component of our accelerating profitable growth priority is capitalizing on growth in the emerging markets. In the second quarter, our organic growth increased 13%, bringing our first half total organic growth to 10%. Our targeted approach investing first in China, India and the Middle East has helped us establish a strong foothold in each market. Year-to-date, our business in China is up nearly 30%. Revenues in India are up in the high-teens and the Middle East is up mid-single-digits. And our product localization strategy is paying multiple dividends. It's enabling a closer relationship with our customers as we are better able to meet their unique needs, and it's helped to reduce the impact of a dynamic global trade environment.","The third component of accelerating profitable growth is to strengthen innovation and technology at the company. We've significantly increased not just our investment in this area, but we also changed our approach in order to capitalize on the enormous expertise we have across the company, providing focus in order to speed results. We closed out the second quarter with another increase in our Vitality Index both sequentially and year-over-year. And we have not hesitated to use M&A as a proxy for R&D.","Our acquisitions have provided immediate access to different vectors of technology and science, but the real impact is happening as our teams and technologies come together to create new solutions that will fundamentally transform how water and wastewater is managed in the future. Many of these efforts are made possible by our focus on driving a continuous improvement culture. We have exceeded our savings targets each year since we announced them back in late 2015, and we are on track to continue that trend in 2018.","One part of this work is our business simplification initiatives. For example, our global business services program is taking dozens and dozens of varied processes in our back office functions and placing them on common platforms and centralizing this work. This will drive cost efficiency and significantly raise our level of execution, improving cycle time and the quality of this work. We're still largely in the implementation phase, but we have clear line of sight to significant savings and resulting margin expansion next year and beyond.","Finally, we must have the right teams in place to deliver on our ambitious goals. That requires the right leadership and development at all levels of the company, and it requires that across the organization, all of our roughly 17,000 colleagues understand not just what we're doing but why we're doing it. Harnessing the collective passion of a global organization around the united purpose is something we focus on every day.","There's one other area of strategic importance that I want to mention and that is our ongoing investments in longer-term growth opportunities. I'm specifically referring to our increased investments in our newly acquired businesses as well as in the communications platform that will support solutions from all areas of the company.","During the first few months of owning these businesses, we've learned a lot, particularly from the very strong receptivity they've gained from our customers. They're looking for us to move faster and think bigger in terms of scaling these businesses and bringing them new solutions. This is particularly true around the build-out of more software-enabled solutions as well as network-as-a-service. Their feedback has reinforced our view that we have a first mover advantage in this area and we intend to capitalize on that.","The strength of our operational performance along with our continuous improvement savings are affording us the opportunity to make these investments while remaining fully committed to our near- and long-term margin expansion targets. It's very clear to us that we have significant opportunities that we need to pursue now to accelerate the growth profile of Xylem to deliver what will clearly be margin-accretive initiatives over the medium- to longer-term.","Now, let me quickly address our updated outlook for the year. On the top line, our revenue growth in the first half, combined with orders and backlog strength, gives us confidence to raise our revenue outlook from 4% to 6% growth to 6% to 7% growth. We are also increasing our EPS guidance operationally by $0.04. This improvement is offset by a couple of non-operational items which results in maintaining our EPS midpoint. We will take you through these details later in the presentation.","So, now, please turn to slide 5, and Mark will review the quarter results in more detail.","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Thanks, Patrick. I'm very pleased with our team's performance in the second quarter. Overall, revenues were up 13% year-over-year. This represents 8% organic growth, 3 points of growth from foreign exchange tailwind, and 2 points of growth from acquisitions. From an organic perspective, the strength in revenue was broad-based across most of our end markets and in all key geographies. The utilities end market led the way with 11% growth. This was slightly above our expectations and was driven both by the timing of project deliveries in the Water Infrastructure and Measurement & Control Solutions segments, as well as continued strong performance in our pumps and aftermarket business broadly. We saw the strongest growth in the U.S. utilities market, which was up 12%.","We had another good quarter in the industrial end market with growth of 6% year-over-year. This was also slightly above our expectations. Market conditions remained solid in our Applied Water business as well as dewatering. And we benefited from some large industrial treatment project deliveries in the emerging markets where we saw strength across nearly all geographies. We also continued to see solid performance in our commercial end market, up 6% with strong growth in the U.S. and China. Finally, in residential, we were down 2% primarily reflecting a tough comparison to the prior year results when revenues grew 15%.","Moving to operational performance. Our teams delivered an increase to our adjusted EBITDA of 70 basis points to 19.3% in the quarter. This improvement was primarily driven by increased productivity savings, volume leverage from strong organic growth, and price realization, which was partially offset by cost inflation, unfavorable mix and investments. Price realization improved 60 basis points in the quarter, and we're very encouraged by the rapid acceleration that we saw on price realization during May and June.","Adjusted operating margin increased 70 basis points to 13.8%, which includes 20 basis points of non-cash amortization related to purchase accounting for the acquisitions in our advanced infrastructure analytics platform. Our teams continue to execute on our productivity programs, and we delivered $41 million in cost savings during the quarter, an 8% increase from the prior year. This 310-basis point improvement offset inflation and enabled us to continue to fund strategic investments to support revenue synergies in other growth programs. Strong revenue performance and operational execution drove earnings per share of $0.73, an increase of 24% year-over-year, which was slightly higher than our expectations.","Please turn to slide 6, and I'll provide additional details on our segment performance. Let's turn to our Water Infrastructure segment, which had a strong performance across all key metrics. Orders of $580 million in the quarter were up 9% organically year-over-year and reflect strength in all applications within the segment. Treatment orders were up 25%, the second consecutive quarter of more than 20% orders growth, reflecting the continued upward trajectory of our pipeline which has expanded double-digits versus the prior year.","The results also speak to the continued overall health and strong demand in the utility market. It is important to note that the majority of the treatment orders are for projects that require longer lead times and will not ship until 2019 and beyond. We exited the quarter with total backlog for this segment of $672 million, up 16% organically year-over-year. Water Infrastructure revenues of $546 million grew 11% year-over-year on an organic basis. Foreign exchange was a $13 million tailwind. In the U.S., the segment grew 11% driven largely by double-digit growth in the utility end market, reflecting solid underlying demand and share gains.","We're continuing to see strong market performance across all of our businesses. Treatment benefited from the timing of several project deliveries and transport continued to benefit from strong aftermarket sales and achieved share gains. Dewatering also generated mid-single-digit growth from increased municipal bypass work. Outside the U.S., performance in this segment was also very strong. Emerging markets were up 18% including double-digit growth in China, the Middle East, and Latin America.","The majority of the outsized growth we saw in emerging markets came from our treatment business, which was up more than 50%, driven both by the timing of project deliveries and strong underlying demand. In general, we continue to see growing bid activity and demand as government mandates on water quality continue to drive spending across the emerging markets. In addition to the robust treatment growth in emerging markets, we also saw high single-digit growth in our wastewater transport business, which continues to benefit from our product localization strategy.","Finally, we also saw a second consecutive quarter of improving market conditions in Western Europe where our business grew 6% overall, primarily driven by growth in transport in the Nordic region and the UK. It is also worth noting that our industrial end market in Water Infrastructure was up mid-single-digits during the quarter. The growth was largely driven by our dewatering business, which continues to see strong activity in construction and oil and gas markets. Additionally, we benefited from the delivery of several large industrial treatment projects in Latin America and Europe.","Operating margin for this segment increased 140 basis points to 17.8% driven by cost savings from our productivity programs, higher volumes, and greater price realization, which accelerated through the quarter. This more than offset inflation and unfavorable mix from a higher portion of treatment projects this year versus last year.","Please turn to slide 7. Our Applied Water segment also had a very good quarter. Orders of $400 million were up 6% organically. Our book-to-bill ratio was 1.03 in the quarter, which is in line with our historical performance. We exited the quarter with backlog of $221 million, which is up 17% organically compared to last year. While this is still predominantly a short cycle business, the growth of our backlog continues to give us confidence in our ability to deliver our mid-single-digit organic growth outlook for the year.","Revenue for Applied Water was $388 million, up 6% organically versus the prior quarter. Foreign exchange was an $8 million tailwind.","In the emerging markets, revenue grew 14%, reflecting strong growth in China, which was up nearly 30%, driven by increased industrial project business and solid demand in the commercial building market.","Revenues in the U.S. grew 5% driven by strength in the segment's commercial and industrial verticals which were up 9% and 7% respectively. In commercial, we continued to see strength in the institutional building sector and demand for our new products. Industrial growth was driven by the continued recovery of heavy industrial project demand as well as growth in our specialty flow business which serves the food and beverage and marine markets.","Residential was down slightly as we lapped mid-teens growth in the prior year. Segment operating margin in the quarter increased 150 basis points to 16.2% year-over-year. The strong year-over-year margin expansion was driven by cost savings from productivity programs, higher volumes and accelerating price realization, which more than offset inflation and unfavorable mix from a higher portion of lower margin, large industrial projects compared with last year.","Now, let's turn to slide 8 to discuss the performance of Measurement & Control Solutions. Our Measurement & Control Solutions segment saw growing momentum in its markets as well. Orders of $397 million in the quarter were up 11% organically, the third consecutive quarter of double-digit order growth. Segment revenues were $383 million, up 8% on an organic basis year-over-year. Foreign exchange was an $8 million tailwind and acquisitions added $29 million.","U.S. revenues grew 10% primarily due to the deployment of the Nicor Gas deal we announced earlier this year, and we saw a return to growth in the water vertical in the U.S. We continued to see strength in the North American water pipeline and orders, which were up 40% over last year, and we continue to expect to deliver high single-digit revenue growth for the full year. The segment's European and emerging markets businesses each grew low single-digits in the quarter.","We're also very encouraged with the significant momentum we see in the market with our new Advanced Infrastructure Analytics platform, which is reflected in accelerating orders and pipeline growth, both of which were up over 20% in the quarter. In the short time that we've owned this portfolio of solutions, we're seeing increased opportunities and excitement from our customers to leverage these capabilities to solve their most critical problems.","A great example of this is the recent win in Southeast Asia, which Patrick mentioned earlier. This win is noteworthy not only because of its size but also in the shorter sales cycle enabled by leveraging existing Xylem relationships. Adjusted EBITDA margins increased 140 basis points \u2013 decreased 140 basis points to 18.5%. Adjusted segment operating margin in the quarter declined 150 basis points to 9.1% year-over-year. Our margin performance in the quarter was expected and largely reflects planned investments we're making to build and to scale up the technologies and commercial capabilities of our Advanced Infrastructure Analytics platform to capitalize on our first mover advantage. We also continue to invest in networking and software tools as well as commercial resources to support the pilots underway to enable us to win at least our fair share of the large international deals in our pipeline. Q2 is also impacted by unfavorable mix in the Sensus business primarily due to the deployment of two recent large project wins in the electric and gas verticals which have lower overall margins than our water business.","Now let's turn to slide 9 to discuss cash flows and the company's financial position. We closed the quarter with a cash balance of approximately $320 million. I was very pleased with the team's strong performance in the quarter on cash flow as we delivered 800 basis points of year-over-year improvement and free cash flow conversion which positions us well to deliver our full year target of more than 115%. Year-over-year increase in second quarter cash flow reflects a 39% increase in operating cash flows. Investment in CapEx in the quarter is up modestly year-over-year driven largely by investments in product software.","We continued to expect capital spend in the range of $190 million to $200 million for the year. We also returned $63 million to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We opportunistically repurchased another $25 million of shares in the second quarter to manage dilution. We continued to make solid progress on working capital with a 250-basis point reduction year-over-year as we continue to improve our processes and discipline. I'm very pleased with the focus and traction that the team continues to make on this metric. We remain committed to maintaining our investment-grade credit rating and began to repay the short-term debt we used to fund the Pure acquisition. We expect to completely pay down the Pure debt by the end of this year.","Please turn to slide 10, and Patrick will cover our updated outlook.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Thanks, Mark. Let me begin with a look at our end markets. Overall, our end market view for the full year has changed slightly from the guidance we provided on our last earnings call. We had a strong first half in certain end markets. And while we do expect some of that growth to moderate as we get into the second half of the year, we are updating our outlook to reflect the momentum we're seeing particularly in the utility and industrial end markets.","So let me quickly run through our projections. Our utility end market continues to show strength, particularly in the U.S. and key emerging markets. For full year 2018, we now expect revenue to grow in the high single-digit range overall. Our businesses performed well in the industrial end market year-to-date. Looking out for the full year, we see continued solid growth in the U.S. and Europe with the heavy industrials in North America continuing to strengthen. In the emerging markets, we continue to see stronger conditions in China and India and somewhat softer conditions in parts of Latin America. We project industrials to be up mid-single-digits. We expect 2018 organic growth in the commercial end market to be in the low to mid-single digit range. We see low but stable growth in the U.S. and some moderation from recent strength in Europe. Our emerging markets should continue to benefit from increased government spending.","Finally, in residential, where we have softer results in the first half of the year, we now anticipate full year 2018 revenue growth in the low single-digit range. We continue to see competitive dynamics in the U.S. market where demand tends to be replacement driven and we have tough prior year compares. We also anticipate solid demand to continue in China and other Asia Pacific countries as well as Western Europe.","Now please turn to slide 11, and I'll address our updated outlook. As we discussed this morning, we are well-positioned to deliver on our full year commitments while continuing to invest in our longer-term growth initiatives. Given the strong revenue growth to-date, we are raising our full year revenue expectations to an organic growth rate of 6% to 7%. We remain on pace to deliver about $160 million in cost savings for the full year which will help fuel our operating margin expansion. We now expect to deliver adjusted operating margin expansion of 60 to 90 basis points to between 13.9% and 14.2%. This expansion excludes about 20 basis points of margin dilution from purchase accounting for acquisitions. Adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to improve by 110 to 130 basis points, which will bring the full year range between 19.8% to 20%.","At the bottom line, we've narrowed the range of expected adjusted full year earnings per share to $2.85 to $2.95. This excludes integration, restructuring, and realignment cost of about $45 million. Adjusted EPS growth is projected to be in the range of 19% to 23% for the year.","Please turn to slide 12, and I'll expand on this guidance. As you can see on the slide, we've laid out the puts and takes on our full year earnings guidance in detail. We started the year with a $0.15 EPS range and $2.90 per share at the midpoint. As I've already addressed, we outperformed in the first half of the year, delivering growth, price realization and a strong operational performance that exceeded our expectations. We expect this momentum to continue resulting in a $0.04 operational increase for the full year. However, we expect this improvement to be offset by an equivalent amount by the stronger dollar and the divestiture of a non-core business. So we've narrowed the range and raised the low end of our guidance, while maintaining the midpoint.","So please turn to slide 13, and Mark will review our planning assumptions and seasonal outlook.","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Thanks, Patrick. I'll provide some additional highlights on our other planning assumptions for the third quarter and full year outlook. Given the popularity and interest in the topic of tariffs, I'll start there. There are a number of tariffs that have been proposed and a few of which have been implemented. Some of these have had little or no impact on Xylem. With regard to China, we benefit from our product localization strategy. The vast majority of the product we produce in China is sold in China or into the broader Asia region.","That said, we do have a global supply chain, so we're not completely immune. But the impact is expected to be fairly modest. We are proactively managing both the direct in the indirect impacts. Our teams are on it. They thoroughly understand the potential impact and have developed and continued to execute mitigation strategies including price recovery actions. With the measures we already have underway, we do not expect the impact in the second half of this year to be material to our results and have contemplated this impact in our updated outlook.","Now, moving to our other planning assumptions and seasonal profile of our business. As you can see on this slide, we've increased our expectations for growth in the full year and have updated assumptions on currency as well as restructuring, realignment and integration costs. For the third quarter, we expect growth in the utility market to continue at high single-digit growth with the industrial market steady at the mid-single-digit level. We expect commercial to continue to grow in the low to mid-single-digits with residential flattish in the quarter.","We anticipate this will result in overall organic revenue growth in the range of 6% to 7%. Consistent with the dynamics we've seen in the first half, we anticipate that project mix will continue to be a margin headwind in the third quarter.","Now, I'll turn it back over to Patrick.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Thanks, Mark. So we had a very good first half the year. Our strong execution led to higher-than-expected revenue growth coupled with solid price realization. With focus on our productivity for growth initiatives, we're driving margin expansion while continuing to invest in strategically important initiatives that will accelerate our growth and margin expansion profile in the future. I'm very proud of our teams, and we will continue to maintain our focus, which is continuing to create greater value for our shareholders.","So with that, operator, we'd be happy to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And your first question is coming from Mike Halloran of Baird.","Michael Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hey, good morning, everyone.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Good morning.","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Good morning, Mike.","Michael Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","So with really healthy demand momentum internally, and starting to see some normalization on the price cost side here, the only area that sticks out is the MCS margin side. And a couple of things in that. One, it sounds like the core margins, if you strip out all the onetime things, are tracking how you guys would hope, so a little commentary on that would be appreciated. And then also provide some context to how you expect those investments to layer through, give some context to how much we're talking, and then when you can start seeing the benefits of those hit the bottom line.","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah, Mike, let me \u2013 this is Mark. Let me take that one. I think you've captured the essence. There are a couple of things taking place particularly in this quarter that are impacting the margin profile. The first is around investments, and that really comes in a couple of flavors, the first being the inclusion of our Applied \u2013 our Advanced Infrastructure Analytics platform this year as well as investments we're making in that. And that is dilutive to margins in the current quarter, a little over 100 basis points. Now, as we scale that business up and it grows, as we get towards the end of this year, that impact is relatively modest in terms of the dilution to margins. And in fact, as we continue to grow that business and the momentum we see there, we expect that to be a contributor to margin expansion in 2019 and beyond.","The other piece of it is investments that we're making in both technology capability, commercial resources to win a number of very large attractive international deals as well as continuing to build out our product and software platforms around our \u2013 both water as well as electric and gas. And that impact for the quarter spends roughly $5 million, and we'd expect that run rate to continue certainly through the end of this year, but it's also \u2013 we do expect to win some of these deals. And as we win those deals and we see the revenues come in later in 2019 and beyond that they're going to have an attractive drop and certainly be accretive to margins.","I think the other point to take away is just through the first half of the year, EBITDA grew 22% year-over-year in the segment and we did see margin expansion of 70 basis points in EBITDA. And we expect that trend to continue for the full year. We expect strong growth in the segment EBITDA, 20%, and continued margin expansion for the full year as well. So this is more of a \u2013 you have the confluence of now we have our new businesses in our platform. We haven't scaled revenues there, and we also have some mix that hit us in in the quarter that we do expect to see a little bit more of that in the third quarter, but that will be less of an issue in the fourth quarter and beyond as our water business grows faster.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah, so Mike, this is Patrick. I'll just touch a couple of points (00:36:38). I don't want to belabor it here, but I realize it is the probably one primary spot that people are focused on that may have been a little bit of surprise for some. It was not a surprise to us. So the receptivity that we're getting from our customers and clients on these new offerings is fantastic. And what we're really doing here between now and really through the back half of this year, which we've reflected in our guidance and outlook and it still gets us to MCS EBITDA margin growth of near 20%, is to really be funding some of the scale that we need to do here around the new analytics platform and pursuing some of these large international deals.","As we turn this order growth into revenue, it's going to come to really high accretive margin. And so, as we get through this year, you won't see that impact next year because the margin fall-through on the revenue we're getting is going to more than offset that, as well as we hopefully win some of these larger international deals, these are onetime development cost to win the deal, so they don't recur other than the fact that if we're pursuing other international deals down the road. So we also felt like, look, the business overall in Xylem is performing well in terms of our productivity for growth. And we felt comfortable that we could deliver on our margin commitments and our growth commitments while funding this new platform. And so that's what we're doing. We're taking advantage of first mover advantage here. And we expect to continue.","Michael Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yeah, no, that makes a lot of sense. Essentially what you're saying is the upfront investments are this year, but there's a pretty quick payback and quick turnaround to getting that momentum back in the margin progression and mitigating the impact as you scale these assets.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah.","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Good summary.","Michael Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","So the second question then is on forward visibility as you think about your order patterns. Over the last couple of quarters, you've been talking about the backlog starting to expand, pipeline of business getting better. It certainly seems like the forward visibility is stretching out. Could you just talk about that backlog curve as you look over the next one to two years? How that's starting to fill out and how you would compare that towards maybe a normal build on a forward basis with the orders you're bringing in in the pipeline?","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Sure. I'd start with that first, Mike. I think, obviously, we continue to see high single-digit, double-digit orders growth overall here. Our bidding pipeline for treatment as we indicated was up double-digit in the teens again. Look, I certainly would not want any of you to expect that we're going to continue to see double-digit growth in the bidding pipeline and funnel or the order rate. But I do think for the foreseeable future here, certainly over the next several months and even the next probably year or two here, we expect to still continue to see that order backlog continue to grow.","We are \u2013 when we look at the markets right now, a follow-on to that question, Mike, would be, how much of this growth is market versus share. And I would say that certainly with respect to the \u2013 we take a look at the commercial market, the industrial market, those are continuing to grow at pretty healthy clips right now. We're talking about mid-single-digit in both of those for the full year and the second half. I would see that continuing. I mean, obviously, the compares are going to get a little more difficult as we get into Q4 and next year, but it's still going to be a healthy trend line there.","Public utility, I think, which is really where you're focusing, we see that continuing to be in the high single-digit certainly this year. I think we'll probably come out and talk about mid- to high single-digits next year as well, but that's premature. But we're gaining share there, and we feel very good about the progress we've made both on the transport and the treatment side in terms of new product development impact and the fact that since we do have in transport the market-leading position in terms of installed base, by definition, we're going to get more than our fair share of growth when you see a very healthy level of break and fix activity taking place in that market as well.","Michael Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Very helpful. Appreciate the color as always.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question is from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Good morning, Deane.","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Good morning.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, I'd like to start on the pricing this quarter which was a nice improvement sequentially from the first quarter and maybe just talk about where you have pricing power, how did you exercise it, and what's the client receptivity to it and is that \u2013 are there more pricing actions that you have to go in the second half if needed?","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah, hey, Deane, it's Mark. Yeah, we talked a little bit about this on our last call, and we've been talking about it with our business leaders for some time and recognizing that we \u2013 as Patrick just said, we do have strong market positions in a number of geographies and product sets, and we felt certainly in a very strong demand environment. And with those strong positions, we should be more aggressive. We have been.","Listen, customers never like price increases. They understand it, and it gets to \u2013 it also gets the value proposition and in service levels. And so we've seen good traction largely in the U.S. across almost all of our businesses. And as I mentioned in my remarks, we really saw that trending positively throughout the quarter. So, in the first quarter, we had 20 basis points of price realization. April was 30, and then we went 60 in May and 70 in June. So it really provides us with some good momentum headed into the second half of the year.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","And, Deane, this is Patrick. So it was pretty broad-based across all of our businesses. Again, it was largely focused within the U.S. But we're \u2013 quite frankly, while customers don't like it, they're obviously attuned to what's going on with the tariff discussion and rising input costs. And so this is not the first time they've gone through this cycle and the criticality of what we sell to them makes it easier. A couple of other comments, one, so we saw like 70 bps in Water Infrastructure, 80 bps in Applied Water as an example, and so very healthy increases. I would say it was also very healthy whether it'd be our direct channel or our indirect channel through our distribution partners. They've been leaning in as well and been very helpful in driving that aggressive activity. And then lastly, I would say part of the reason I think we saw the pickup in May and June and obviously we're staying close to it here in Q3 is there were a few of our competitors that were a little bit later in following on the pricing actions. And so that \u2013 now that they've done, that simply further strengthens the action that we've already taken.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","That's all good to hear. Just as a follow-up, one of the other numbers that really jumps out at us is the China up 30% year-to-date. We just had a field trip in China and Singapore, and we hit three China cities. And this whole theme of the China government ratcheting up enforcement of water pollution laws is really having a big impact. Just maybe you can expand on that because the plants we saw were \u2013 even the ones that you guys didn't host had Wedeco UV, Wedeco Ozone, and you just saw an interest in these western technologies.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah, well, I think we feel we're very bullish on China. As you know, I have been for some time, Deane. And as you do, we have to take the long view on these markets like China and India and others. So I think it's a convergence of the government prioritization, not just on the connected treatment and obviously dealing with the water quality issues and mandate. But it's also, as you well know, it's a big mandate on reducing non-revenue water, which obviously plays into our new analytics platform. You take all that coupled with our localization efforts which is a really big deal, that helps mitigate this whole tariff discussion for us. But it also really speeds our delivery to market and we now have products that are really fit for purpose in that market as opposed to many companies relying upon importing kind of western technologies, so very pleased, very proud. We realize it's not going to last forever. We're not going to grow 30% a clip forever. But I think we're very much in a healthy trajectory there right now. I know one of the questions we've had from investors is, does the whole trade tension between China and the U.S. create a overhang to the economy there, et cetera. And we just don't see that affecting the businesses that we're strongest in which really is on the utility side which is a good two-thirds, almost 80% of our revenue now in China is in that space.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yeah, you kind of stole my follow-up on the not seeing any fallout. But just maybe, does that differ at all between the public utilities versus the industrial customers in terms of their \u2013 how that mandate is affecting them?","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","It's hard to say right now. We haven't seen it. We've seen good growth in the industrial and the commercial billing side. Having said that, we all went through \u2013 the whole industry went through a rough patch there, not more than two years ago when you had the whole downturn in that part of the segment. So we're coming off of a bottom. So we're still seeing growth there. So, if there was a part that could be \u2013 that would not be immune to that overhang, that would certainly be it. But that's a relatively small piece of our overall business.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","That's real helpful. Thank you.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question is from Nathan Jones with Stifel.","Nathan Hardie Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Good morning, everyone.","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Good morning, Nate.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Good morning, Nate.","Nathan Hardie Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","I think the $30 million in revenue synergies or orders taken related to revenue synergies is probably the first time that you've actually put any numbers around this for us. Can you maybe give us a little more color on what these types of products are now that they're out of pilots? You talked about some medium-sized and larger orders maybe later in the year into 2019, size of the opportunity there for us?","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Sure. Yeah, so we are pleased. And we felt it was the first time we felt comfortable putting in the number around it, because we wanted to have something of some size and scale. This is consistent with the timing that we talked about, maybe a little bit earlier than we had originally anticipated. We were generally thinking it was going to be more back half of this year, and then the larger deals coming through more in 2019. That's still our thinking as to the timing of those larger deals.","The types of things we're talking about here, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, one of them is obviously leveraging our very strong relationships with one of the large utilities there in Southeast Asia that Xylem had a longstanding relationship with that Visenti had kind of struggled to get in there. But obviously, with the great work they've done with the Singapore PV, that's a great reference for them and ourselves. So that's upwards to close to a $10 million deal that's related to that. Again, that's going to be the rise of right now the largest leak detection monitoring deployment, I believe, around the world. And so we're very proud of that. But it's still early stages.","Secondly, the one in the U.S., which I think is really exciting as well, is building out a new network-as-a-service capability to where we're actually able to leverage our FlexNet platform to not only serve one utility but the entire consortium of utilities to where we effectively own the network. And we simply lease that off to them at a fixed price and really good value in margins in those kinds of projects, and we're certainly looking to see how we might be able to roll that in to some of the larger international deals as well to boost the margins and our chances of winning.","The larger deployments are, as we've talked before, these are \u2013 it's really predominantly going after non-revenue water challenges of the utilities. And we think we're one of the only companies that are out there that has an end-to-end solution right now to really be able to draw the data all the way from the water coming out of the treatment plant to its consumption and being built and work with utilities to be able to reconcile that and pinpoint where their biggest needs are as opposed to them not guessing, but certainly making their best estimates on where they should be spending their money. So a lot of work we have to do. We're in the early stages on this, but we are excited by the prospects here.","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","And the pipeline is growing.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","And yeah, the pipeline is growing.","Nathan Hardie Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","I think you had a 2020 target for revenue synergies of $100 million. Are you on track to hit that, see upside to it, anything like that?","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah, I wouldn't adjust my look on that right now. I mean, we'll do that certainly in a future kind of outlook and update. But I'd say our confidence certainly is stronger than ever that we would hit and exceed that number.","Nathan Hardie Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","And then I think on the gas and electric meters obviously negative mix there, lower margin there. I think you guys have some initiatives to improve the margins in that side of the business. Can you talk about any time frames for getting the margins there up and things that you're doing to improve the margins on that side of the business?","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah, hey, Nate, it's Mark. Yeah, part of our investment in R&D is not just these pilots for international deals, not just our Advanced Infrastructure Analytics, but we're also continuing to spend money and develop new products to get at exactly that point, not only provide richer features to our customers on the gas and electric side, but also significantly look to take cost out of those products. So we can drive margin expansion as well.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","And hey, Nate, just back on just to clarify, Matt shot me a note here, so just to remind us all. The number that we had laid out before I think after the \u2013 around revenue synergies is actually by 2020, we would be doing somewhere between $150 million to $175 million, I think is what we laid out. And my comment remains the same. We are just increasing our confidence and the ability to deliver on that number.","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah, it points on the board with more to do but certainly the pipeline is growing fast and there's a lot of opportunity.","Nathan Hardie Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Well, that's much better than the $100 million I had in my mind. Thank you very much for the help. I'll pass it on.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","No worries.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question is from Joe Giordano with Cowen.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hey, guys, good morning.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Good morning, Joe.","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Good morning, Joe.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","So, Patrick, kind of following up on that. Have you guys like figured out how to sell these kind of solutions, like what's the best way economically to frame this out? Because it is \u2013 you said it's a unique end-to-end solution that kind of doesn't exist in the market today. So what does this look like? Is it some sort of recurring fee? Is it a upfront sale? Like have you guys kind of gotten a little bit closer to figuring out what makes the most sense there?","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Yes, so we're in the midst of really testing that. That's part of the work that our teams are doing around some of these pilots as well. The network-as-a-service idea that I \u2013 the opportunity that we kind of posted here is just one of the many approaches that we're taking. Some of these are basic subscription models. We're also looking at ways in order to perhaps share in some of the higher level value creation that we're doing with the utilities here. I don't want to really go too much more into that from a competitive standpoint. Plus, we're still testing some opportunities here. Either way around, the revenue is very attractive from a margin standpoint. And I'm just really excited by the level of receptivity that we're getting from the customers quite frankly which is part of what's fueling the need to make some investments here is to make sure we can support that at scale.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Yeah, given like what's going on with price and costs and tariffs, generally, your businesses have a pretty substantial ramp into the back half of the year on a margin standpoint. Is that still kind of fair to think about?","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah, so what really gives us confidence in the second half outlook, Joe, is as you said, I mean, despite the headwinds coming in from multiple fronts, we tightened our outlook and operationally raised the midpoint to offset some of the currency and divesture impact. And it really is coming from the incremental margins on the top line and the growth momentum that we've got. It is the traction on price and that we'll be getting the full on impact of that in the second half of the year. And then third is just our ongoing productivity efforts that always \u2013 they always ramp a bit in the second half of the year especially in the procurement side.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. And then last for me, and maybe I can push you a little bit here. On the utility side, everything looks great. I mean that was very impressive performance again. How do you feel on industrial? You mentioned market probably growing around mid-single-digit. This is the second quarter running around 6%. Look, that's not a terrible number, but we've seen faster growth in general industrial at other companies. How do you feel like you're doing there? Do you think the share take is the same as what you're seeing in kind of the utility business where you clearly are taking share?","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah, I would say, third question, maybe just to remind everyone again of what our industrial business really is today. But before I go there, I would say, no, I wouldn't suggest that we're gaining share across the board in industrial. I think we're certainly growing with the market. I mean, there may be some pockets here or there where we picked up a little bit and maybe given up a little bit, but on average, I wouldn't describe the industrial performance as a share gain play.","Having said, your comment about relative to other industrials, you probably see \u2013 bear in mind again that the lion's share of our industrial business is what we call light industrial. And so this is a product that is not tied to production output, typically grows at a kind of GDP plus a point or so kind of growth depending upon where we are in the replacement cycle, but these are pumps basically. People just run to failure and then they replace them. And so as long as the sites are up and running, they're using our pumps. So, just like when you didn't see that part of our business go down when the rest of the industrial sector was down a couple of years ago, I wouldn't expect us to be growing at a recovery level kind of rate in this market as well. So that 6% growth that we've seen, I'm very pleased with that. That really is a bit of uptick that we saw in that small portion of our business that's heavy, which is mining and oil and gas. But that's again only 4% of our total revenue as a company. So kind of hard for us to move the needle in a big way in industrial. So we're in this kind of mid-single-digit space. That's a good space to be. Now, we do know some of that is from new product rollouts as well, and those products are coming in at very attractive margins and very attractive growth rates relative to the businesses or products they're replacing.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","And I would lastly say \u2013 I'd lastly say, Joe, that the localization that we've done in emerging markets, particularly in the Middle East, has also given us the opportunity to win some larger opportunities in industrial, some projects that we would not have been able to win because the lead times are too long or the cost position was not in the right spot.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question is from Chip Moore with Canaccord.","Chip Moore - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Hey, good morning. How's it going?","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Good morning, Chip.","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","(00:57:00)","Chip Moore - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","So it certainly sounds like there's an increased emphasis on innovation just given all the opportunities you're seeing and a pretty nice first mover advantage, how are you thinking about organic investments as you look to evolve the company over time? You talked about inching R&D closer to 5%, I think. So how should we be thinking about pace of investment versus potential inorganic opportunities? Thanks.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah, I would say overall in terms of the rate of spending that we've talked about in terms of increasing, between now and 2020, increasing by 100 basis points or more in R&D where R&D is a proxy for other investments, it may not all go to the R&D line. It would remain unchanged. I mean, we still feel the same way about that. We're not looking to take that up any more than what we were looking at before. That'll be a healthy level of spend. Especially, given the fact that you may recall, Chip, that we talked about we're also getting much more \u2013 much larger bang for the buck out of the R&D dollars in our base spend, because we're doing a lot more of that in emerging markets.","Closer to market, it's bigger bang for the buck given the \u2013 where we're spending it in India, China, the Middle East, et cetera. Two, we've also done a good job at leaning out our new product development pipeline and getting rid of a lot of the smaller, longer-term kind of things that people might have been working on to really focus in on the things that matter most. So we just got more R&D productivity overall than we had before.","In terms of your comment around organic versus inorganic, the way I would lay it out for you all would be as you think about the utilities vertical, think about that as being predominantly an organic play now. There will be some bolt-ons and tuck-ins that we do, but we don't have line of sight right now to any other big move that we'd be looking to make. It would be really just rounding out the platform that we've got here. I think as we've talked before, the other areas of inorganic would largely be banned (00:59:06) in various aspects of industrial water management. That's a broad market, very fragmented. There's a lot of opportunities that are out there, takes two to tango. And we're going to be very disciplined as we have been. Not kind of flashing lights on anything right now. Just letting you know that that would be the part of the business that would be probably more of a inorganic play over time than organic.","Chip Moore - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Great. That is helpful. Thanks.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question is from Walter Liptak with Seaport Global.","Walter Scott Liptak - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Hi, thanks. Good morning, guys.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Good morning.","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Good morning.","Walter Scott Liptak - Seaport Global Securities LLC","I wanted to circle back on pricing and specifically in Water Infrastructure. And maybe if you could help us understand a little bit more about what you did during the quarter. And I'm thinking about some of the project work and if you were able to circle \u2013 if you were able to get back to the customers and raise prices on projects that are already kind of in your project funnel or in your pipeline versus book and ship business in Water Infrastructure?","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah, Walter, it's Mark. It's largely the book and ship business. It's pumps, it's replacement components, it's aftermarket service mixers. Project work is unique, and you got to go out and bid it. So it's mostly those book and ship components. And that doesn't mean we're not looking to improve our margin profile on these larger projects, but they're all unique. They're all different. But that's not where the price is coming from.","Walter Scott Liptak - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Okay. And kind of along those lines in the back half of the year, are there any projects that we need to be concerned about where you were unable to raise prices or they were longer lead time that might compress the margin?","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","No.","Walter Scott Liptak - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Okay. Fair enough. Thinking about residential, outside of the comp that you've got, any other trends that you can talk about that's lowering that growth rate?","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","I think that we talked about it in the prepared remarks. It's largely tough compare to last year, which was mid-teens. There was a lot of disruption in the channel last year, which drove some of that. So we'd expect that it's a competitive business environment, and we expect this to grow in the low single-digits through the rest of this year.","Walter Scott Liptak - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Okay. All right. Fair enough. And then the last one for me is, your inventories kind of overall, I thought was going to be up a little bit more that maybe you'd be opportunistic and bring some product into the U.S. ahead of any sort of tariff or threats of tariff. And I wonder if you had any reaction like that to kind of position for the back half and any benefits we could get from any lower cost product that came into the U.S.?","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah, Walt, we're trying to be smart and make sure we don't get caught short relative to components and supply. So there's certainly some of that going on (01:02:33) and that would be one of the headwinds. But we're also \u2013 we've been working hard on improving our SNLP (01:02:39) and our processes and stock levels that are more time to real-time market needs. So, overall, while there's more work to do, the team has performed fairly well there despite some of those challenges and actually reduced the number of days of inventory on hand year-over-year.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah, I mean, I think (01:03:00) \u2013 this is Patrick. I think the overall comment and theme on working capital in general is we changed the management incentive structure for our top few hundred people about two years ago and embedded a third of that payout is tied to working capital ratio, so working capital percentage of revenue. And I would say it took probably the better part of the first year for it to really kind of take hold. It really has been last year and this year that you've seen significant moves downward in terms of working capital investment. That really has helped fuel the free cash flow conversion that you've seen here. So I think a lot \u2013 there's a long way to go. We feel a lot better where we are now than we did a few years ago. And I would say of all of the areas, it's the most challenging inventory, certainly is and it probably still has the biggest area of opportunity in front of it.","Walter Scott Liptak - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Okay. That sounds great. All right. Thank you, guys.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question is from Scott Graham of BMO Capital Markets.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi, good morning.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Good morning, Scott.","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Good morning, Scott.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","I want to maybe somehow get underneath this mix\/price sort of waterfall that you've given us, these bridges. Because it looks like all three segments, price mix is better than it was in the first quarter. And you're talking about negative mix impacting all which would therefore suggest that pricing was a lot better in each of the segments. Yet you're taking down your operating margin guidance for the year. I know you're just pinching it (01:04:42). I know you talked about a couple of the reasons. But what's the other side of the equal sign there? Are you expecting the inflation piece to increase in all three from here? Maybe kind of connect those dots for me.","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah, yeah, so we did see mix impact across the enterprise. Probably the biggest piece of it was in our Measurement & Control Solutions, but we had a little bit in the other two segments. So that's a reality. We do expect that to continue into Q3 given how we see the mix setup in backlogs. But to your other point, we have done very well in terms of driving price that will continue to \u2013 we're going to see some acceleration into the second half of the year. But there is a reality and inflation does tick up a little bit as well, and what we're trying to do is get ahead of it to offset it. So it's really \u2013 it's nothing more than that. Mix did impact us in the second quarter, will continue to impact us in the second half of the year. And on your point in terms of the guidance, we've not taken it down. We've narrowed it. And in fact, on an operational basis, we're up $0.04 to where we were last quarter.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Fair enough. I guess what I'm trying to get at here is it seems to me as if with mix having run negative for a couple of \u2013 a number of quarters now, a lot of that is planned of course, because of new products, projects coming through or what have you. I'm not sensing that that's going to get worse in the second half of the year. So it would seem as if the inflation you're essentially saying will get a little worse, yes?","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","That is what I said. We ran about 220 basis points impact through the first half of the year, and there's probably another 30 basis points or 30, 40 basis points higher inflationary impact that we expect to see in the second half of the year. Part of that from tariffs, part of it just from general supply and demand. But we \u2013 that's why we got ahead of the price curve.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","But again we're maintaining the midpoint of our (01:07:13).","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Absolutely.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Yeah, okay, fair enough. I guess my other question would be on M&A and thank you for the clarification of kind of looking more into the industrial areas. I was just wondering also though that there does seem to be perhaps some opportunity in commercial areas unless you're including that within industrial. And maybe you said water management, is this something that maybe \u2013 that specificity implies that you've got some things really on your radar right now?","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","No, I wouldn't read. I mean, obviously, we always keep a very healthy active M&A pipeline and funnel. We've got a very experienced M&A team here that's working with the businesses to always be staying close to that. So I wouldn't \u2013 but I wouldn't read into it that there's anything that is more near end that we're looking at or contemplating here. So don't read anything to the word change there. I used the word broadly water management and industrial as opposed to \u2013 in the past, we've talked about treatment, we've talked about broad-based water services. And so that is an area that we're certainly spending a good amount of time just making sure we understand what the opportunities are.","And to your point around commercial, I mean I do think that the nomenclature on some of these things is a fine line. I think sometimes we use different words to describe things. So we're not \u2013 I'm not necessarily describing the scenario where we're going to be going out and doubling down in parts of the market that we're already in. These would be adjacencies that we think may be attractive and we have a right to play in.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Very good. Thank you.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your final question is coming from Brian Lee of Goldman Sachs.","Brian Lee - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey, guys, thanks for squeezing me in here.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Sure. Good morning.","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Good morning, Brian.","Brian Lee - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Good morning. Good morning. A couple of things from my end. I guess first on the utility market, just when you're talking about the high single-digit growth outlook for the year, can you help parse sort of what your view is on the underlying market growth and then how much you would attribute to company-specific factors, namely share gains? And then I guess in the U.S., you're tracking even higher at that sort of low double-digit growth, so wondering if you can also parse out in that region what you think is the market growth versus what you're doing on a share gain basis.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah, I'd say that, look, it's always hard to get precise share data within any one quarter or even a year for that matter. But based on what we're hearing from utilities and what we're sensing right now is I would say the market itself is overall growing about mid-single-digits, and that typically is about where it is when you have a healthy CapEx cycle underway and you've got a kind of normal OpEx cycle underway. I'll come back to the U.S. versus the rest of the world in a moment, but I would say globally, mid-single-digit market growth, we're seeing high single-digit growth. So there's probably a point or two of growth there that I would say is coming definitely from either share gain per se or we're just outgrowing the market because of our established base that's there.","Secondly, I would say that in the U.S., that would be more like a high single-digit growth of the market. And again, there's probably a couple three points coming from Xylem specific and the things there that I think are really \u2013 now, this is not limited to the U.S. It's just it's been more of a recent phenomenon. We had integrated our commercial teams across Europe and the emerging markets a number of years back. And while they went through their own growing pains, we learned a lot during that timeframe. And since then, we've seen really attractive growth by one commercial team, sharing leads and generating leads across the portfolio for their colleagues and getting incentivized to do so.","We just made that move last year, you'll recall here in the U.S. and North America. And we absolutely are seeing revenue synergies from having done that here in the U.S. We've seen a great increase in the bidding pipeline. We track these in Salesforce.com. We see what's there. We give people appropriate credits for passing leads across the aisle, and they are compensated accordingly. And so that makes them hungry. And a little bit of that with some new products to throw behind it. And then just getting more familiar with what's in the actual portfolio. We have a lot of stuff in the portfolio to sell that is relevant to the utility, and I think we are definitely seeing the benefits of that. And that will help buffer when the market maybe does moderate a little bit over time. And so, again, I can't give you a specific number of share gain. But directionally, that's what gives us confidence.","Brian Lee - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. No, that all makes sense. It's helpful. A second question just on MCS. I know the Sensus mix here has been skewing towards increasing the gas and electric, if you just look at the quarterly growth rate over the past several quarters. So just wondering at a high level if you guys are at all thinking differently about the composition of that business in the context of your longer-term organic growth targets for that segment? And then I know there are implications that you alluded to for margins, and you had a little bit of that in this quarter. Can you speak to whether or not that was very project-specific or is that just really end market-specific in terms of the mix issues you had there? Thank you.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah, let me take, Brian, the higher level. As always, I'll let Mark handle the near end question. But from a strategic standpoint, no change in view towards either the composition of that portfolio and\/or any worries around a shifting mix towards electric and gas biased away from water. This is purely a timing issue. Our growth in orders on the water side of the business and utility were up again.","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","40% in North America, yeah.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","I think 40%. 40%...","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","(01:13:28)","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","That's our biggest business here over 40%. We've got a really healthy bidding pipeline. We're getting close on a few more deals there of size in the water space that we hope we can announce here in the latter part of the half of the year that supports our long-term growth rate. That will skew the mix back to where it historically has been. At the same time, look, we love these electric deals that we've \u2013 electric and gas deals that we've won, and we'll continue to pursue them aggressively because while they may be a little bit less accretive than the water side, they're still very attractive from an economic value standpoint. So we'll take it across the board. It's just right now, what you're seeing is simply a timing issue within the year and within maybe an 18-month cycle.","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah. And I would \u2013 that's exactly what we saw in Q2. A little bit in Q1, but we'll \u2013 as those deployments continue to roll out, we'll see a little bit more of it in Q3. But as some of those orders translate into revenues on the water side, that is a much lesser issue in Q4 and moving into 2019.","Brian Lee - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","All right. Great. Thanks, guys.","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Thanks, Brian.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you.

Decker","Thanks, Phil, and, thank you, all, for joining us. Before we get started this morning, I'd like to acknowledge the earthquake in Nepal that occurred last weekend and the events that continue to unfold in the aftermath. The resulting devastation and suffering are profound and we, along with so many other global citizens, are responding with immediate resources to assist with their most urgent needs. We are also actively working to identify additional means and funds to help in this recovery. That spirit is core to our mission here in Xylem, and we're keeping all those who've been impacted in our thoughts.","Now let me turn to our results. We started off the year on a sound footing, generating solid first quarter results. This morning, I'll share some highlights with you. I will also provide a brief update on a few of our key priorities for the year and discuss our 2015 outlook. I'll then turn the call over to Mike to share additional details, and we'll wrap up by addressing any questions you might have at the end.","We delivered another quarter of solid operational performance, as our team steadily increased their focus and elevated their execution to deliver a 7th consecutive quarter of margin expansion. While growth rates in the immediate term are not particularly impressive, I am pleased with their execution, particularly as we faced mixed economic conditions, including weak industrial markets. And looking ahead, we see some encouraging signs in certain end markets we serve as well as attractive investment opportunities that will position us well for stronger growth over the longer term.","As market conditions and macroeconomic variables fluctuate, we remain focused on the factors we can influence, mainly building stronger customer relationships to fuel sales and build backlog, driving better performance and executing a disciplined capital deployment strategy. This is how we will create more value for our customers and our shareholders.","As I discussed previously, we have rolled out our integrated commercial IT platforms in a couple of regions now. We're still in the early stages, but I'm very encouraged by the results I've seen. These tools are enabling our sales teams to increase lead generation across the portfolio, reduce the time required to produce a quote and simplify the administrative burden with a streamlined ERP system. For example, our CRM system, salesforce.com, was implemented across our Americas region and will be rolled out globally over the course of this year and next. This tool facilitates the immediate sharing of contacts and business leads across our commercial teams and growth centers. This is feeding our pipeline of projects, which over time we expect will result in a higher growth rate.","A key component of our overall progress is our work in the area of continuous improvement. We are squarely focused on driving a continuous improvement mindset across the enterprise.","In other words, broadening the deployment of lean beyond the 4 walls of the factory. Already, we see pockets of success across certain geographies as teams lean out various processes. So we know, there's more that can be achieved, and we have some high priority projects to advance this agenda. One example is an end-to-end supply project -- supply-chain project on one of our largest product lines that should yield a 25% reduction in inventory. And by centralizing our global sourcing activities, we know have visibility to identify meaningful savings on indirect spend, such as contingent labor and freight. These initiatives drive performance, and they generate measurable savings that can also be reinvested for growth.","Last month, we announced that Steve Leung had joined Xylem as Senior Vice President and President of Emerging Markets. The emerging markets are particularly important to our growth strategy. They encompass some of the fastest growing areas of our business as development in these regions fuels the building of new infrastructure, which presents us with the opportunity to develop new installed bases of our water technology solutions. Steve is well-positioned to lead our efforts to capture and maximize those growth opportunities. One of his immediate areas of focus is to advance our strategy of further localizing our supply chain and R&D in critical growth markets, beginning with China and Middle East. Steve brings more than 2 decades of management and commercial expertise as well as deep knowledge of the unique needs in these regions. I had the opportunity to work with Steve previously, and I know he will bring new ideas and perspective to the good work that's already underway. I also expect to be able to announce a new Innovation and Technology Officer in the coming weeks. This leader will help us to coordinate and accelerate our R&D efforts, focusing on breakthrough technologies and innovation in services and business models. As I've said before, we intend to invest some of the productivity savings we generate back into growth opportunities, including innovation.","Now let me quickly review of our first quarter performance. Orders were flat organically, but they were up 4% in our Water Infrastructure segment. This growth reflects several key project wins with notable progress in our treatment business, which delivered order growth of 13% in the quarter. And while Applied Water orders were down 4%, we did expect a deceleration in this segment following the strong bookings generated during the fourth quarter of last year.","One of our big wins in the quarter was a $16 million order for a major municipal project in Canada. The order for flight custom pumps along with accessories and spare parts is part of a multi-year project to upgrade this municipality's drinking water treatment plants and distribution systems. This win reflects both the superior quality of our products and the benefits accrued made strong customer relationship. In addition, our teams will be able to bring forth the applications expertise needed to craft a customized solution that met the unique requirements of this multi-faceted project. This comprehensive approach also helped lay the foundation for potential collaboration on future phases of this endeavor in the years ahead. This order contributed to a 10% year-over-year increase in total backlog in constant currency.","Our teams are spending more time in the field, more time with customers understanding their needs, and the result is that we are building a richer pipeline of projects. Earlier this month, I had the opportunity to see some of that work in action on a visit to Southern California. As all of you know, the State of California is now into its fourth year of record drought conditions. The Governor recently issued an executive order that among other things imposed mandatory portable urban water use restrictions and accelerated funding for certain drought mitigation initiative, including the development of water reuse projects. Xylem is very well-positioned to help the state and its many municipal viable water reuse projects. We have the leading technologies, the applications expertise and the proven experience to develop solutions to create a sustainable source of water. In San Diego, I visited the Advanced Water Purification Facility at the North City Water Reclamation Center. This site is the focal strength of the city's demonstration project, which is a pilot study to determine the feasibility of water reuse technology to supplement local drinking water supply, both indirectly and directly. Our technologies are integrated throughout this pilot, and our team has worked closely with the customer on all phases of this venture. This along with other pilots in California is helping to feed our reuse pipeline. That said, even with accelerated state funding, these projects take time to develop to bring them to the point of an actual order. But our teams are working with the right people on the ground to influence and advance these initiatives.","Now getting back to our results. Organic revenue grew 1% in the quarter, which was in line with the guidance we provided in February. Operating margin expanded 40 basis points year-over-year or 60 basis points, excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange translation. This margin expansion was driven by productivity gains and cost reductions from our continuous improvement initiatives. It also reflects our disciplined approach to investments. We delivered earnings per share of $0.33, up 9% year-over-year before the impact of foreign exchange translation. Considering the muted top line growth, we're pleased with our team's ability to generate the strong bottom line performance. We also improved free cash flow generation after funding and increasing growth-enabling CapEx investments. And finally, on the capital deployment front, we increased our quarterly dividend by 10% and opportunistically repurchased $50 million in common stock. In total, we've returned $76 million in capital to our shareholders.","As I mentioned previously, we do expect to execute on some bolt-on acquisition opportunities later in the year.","Now turning to Slide 4. There's no change to the operational outlook in our guidance. Given the deterioration of the dollar since we last provided guidance and the ongoing volatility in the currency markets, we believe it's prudent to update our 2015 full year guidance only to reflect additional foreign exchange translation headwinds.","To recap, consistent with the guidance we provided in February, we anticipate 2015 organic revenue growth of 1% to 3%. Similarly, we continue to expect our adjusted operating margin to grow in the range of 50 to 90 basis points, reflecting a carryover benefit of our broad-based restructuring efforts last year as well as additional efficiencies we expected to drive in 2015. We are updating our adjusted earnings per share guidance to a $1.80 to a $1.90 for the full year, which includes $0.26 of negative foreign currency translation impact. This is a little more than we previously anticipated. Excluding this headwind, year-over-year EPS growth is still expected to be in the range of 5% to 10%.","Finally, we will continue to execute a disciplined approach to capital deployment, which is expected to result in a 100% free cash flow conversion.","With that, let me now turn the call over to our CFO, Mike Speetzen, to walk you through the results and full year guidance in more detail. Mike?","Michael T. Speetzen","Thanks, Patrick. Please turn to Slide 5. We generated revenues of $837 million, down $69 million for the prior year. The year-over-year decline reflects the anticipated foreign exchange translation headwind turned by stronger U.S. dollar and the impact of our valves divestiture in the third quarter of 2014. Excluding those items, organic revenue increased 1%, in line with our expectations and the outlook we provided during our last call.","From an end market perspective, commercial led the way, up 9%, with both public utility and residential up 2%. Partial offsetting these gains were declines in the industrial and agricultural markets of 1% and 13% respectively. From a regional perspective, we continue to see strong growth in emerging markets, up 9% and modest growth in the U.S., up 2%. This was partially offset by declines in Canada and Australia, which were each down 12%. Lastly, Western Europe was flat for the quarter. Operating margin increased 40 basis points to 10.8%. Excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange translation, margins increased by 60 basis points, which demonstrates our improved cost base as this is a strong performance given the limited operating leverage on 1% organic growth.","Focus and strong execution on continuous improvement and business simplification initiatives reduced costs by $23 million in the quarter and resulted in 270 basis points of margin expansion. Partially offsetting these reductions were inflation of nearly 2%, higher pension expense and the unfavorable impact from the divestiture of our valves business last year.","Earnings per share declined by $0.01 to $0.33, however, excluding the foreign exchange translation headwind of $0.04, we grow EPS 9%. Now let me cover each of our reporting segments. Please turn to Slide 6.","Water Infrastructure recorded orders of $562 million, up 4% organically, including a $16 million project win for transport custom pumps. Book-to-bill was 1.12, our strongest since the first quarter of 2010. As a result, we exit the quarter with total backlog of $585 million, up 12% on a constant currency basis. Of this amount, 75% is due to ship this year, with the balance of nearly $150 million expected to ship in 2016 and beyond. Revenue of $500 million was flat year-over-year on an organic basis.","From an application perspective, we saw 3% growth in treatment while transport was flat and test was down 3% due to a tough compare.","Regionally, we saw the most significant growth come from emerging markets, which were up 10%. The U.S. was also positive, up 1%. Offsetting these gains were declines in Canada, Australia and Western Europe.","In summary, strength in emerging markets was driven by our ability to capitalize on the development of water and wastewater infrastructure in these regions. Treatment, for example, increased more than 40% in China, driven by the delivery of ozone and filtration projects. Transport applications also grew, up 9% in emerging markets, and test generated positive momentum but not enough to overcome a comparison to a $3 million project delivery in Brazil last year. The great news is that we expect to deliver on another sizable project to the same key account later this year.","The U.S. contributed organic growth of 1%, driven by strength in test applications. Offsetting this favorable performance was lower public utility spend and lapping of prior year projects in Canada and Australia. Furthermore, we saw weakness in Canada, driven by the softening on the oil and gas market.","Operating margin increased 10 basis points from 10.5% to 10.6% due to cost reductions and positive price realization. Restructuring savings of $4 million coupled with sourcing and lean initiatives more than offset the negative effects of inflation, pension and foreign exchange transaction (sic) [translation] losses. Foreign exchange translation unfavorably impacted operating income by $6 million but was neutral to margin.","Let me now turn to Slide 7. I'll talk through our Applied Water segment. Applied Water recorded orders of $353 million, down 4% organically. We do not believe this is an indication of any significant changes in this segment's end markets but rather due to timing, as Applied Water reported organic order growth of 9% in the fourth quarter of last year. As a result, we entered the second quarter with total backlog of $208 million, up 4% on a constant currency basis, more than 60% of which is expected to ship within the quarter.","Revenue was $337 million, up 2% organically from the prior period. Building service applications were up 6%, irrigation was down 13%, and industrial water was down slightly of 1% year-over-year. Regionally, we generated growth in emerging markets and the U.S., which were up 7% and 2% respectively. Europe was flat overall for the quarter.","To further summarize our revenue performance, I'll highlight growth in building services was driven by strength in U.S. commercial of 9%, where we have seen distributors restocking in advance of what we anticipate could be a recovery in the institution of building sector. Additionally, we continue to see growth in emerging markets regions like the Middle East and Asia-Pacific. Residential was up 2% globally as our new energy-efficient ecocirc XL pump drove a 20% increase in Europe. U.S. residential was down 4% as cold weather negatively impacted construction and demand in well pumps. Both irrigation and industrial water applications were down from tough comparisons due to project shipments combined with overall softening market conditions.","Operating margin expanded 60 basis points from 13.3% to 13.9% year-over-year. Excluding foreign exchange, margins were up 90 basis points. Margin improvement was driven by the favorable impact of cost reduction initiatives and volume leverage. These factors were partially offset by lower price, the unfavorable impact of last year's valves divestiture and nearly 2% cost inflation.","Now let's turn to Slide 8, and I'll cover the company's financial position. Xylem maintains a strong cash position with a balance of $554 million at the end of Q1. Our net debt-to-net capital ratio is a healthy 27%, and our commercial paper and revolving credit facilities remain in place and continue to be unutilized. We remain committed to our balanced capital deployment strategy, which is to maintain and grow the business while enhancing shareholder returns through dividends and share repurchases.","During the first quarter, we invested $37 million into capital expenditures and we returned $76 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. The Q1 return of capital to shareholders included 10% increase in dividends per share and $50 million of share repurchases. This leaves us with approximately $50 million of additional potential repurchases under our authorized programs. Free cash flow was $2 million, which marks an improvement of $5 million from the prior year and is driven by improved working capital performance.","That said, please turn to Slide 9, and I'll cover 2015 guidance. At the segment level, we expect Water Infrastructure revenue in the range of $2.2 billion to $2.3 billion, reflecting organic growth of 1% to 3%. And for Applied Water, we expect revenue of $1.4 billion, with organic revenue flat to up 2%. Segment margins are anticipated to be in the range of 14.3% to 14.7%, and operating margins are projected to be in the range of 13% to 13.4%, reflecting margin expansion of 50 to 90 basis points, excluding the impact of foreign exchange translation.","At the bottom line, we anticipate earnings per share of $1.80 to $1.90, excluding restructuring and realignment cost of $20 million. As Patrick noted earlier, we are reducing our full year outlook to reflect the potential for incremental foreign exchange translation headwind. As noted on the slide, we continue to expect EPS growth of 5% to 10%, excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange translation.","As mentioned earlier, we are driving to 100% free cash flow conversion in net income, and this takes into consideration expected capital expenditure outlays in the range of $120 million to $130 million. We expect our return on invested capital to remain at approximately 11%, given the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange translation on operating income and an assumed higher tax rate. Excluding the anticipated impact of foreign exchange translation, we would expect approximately 50 basis points of improvement in 2015. Our operating tax rate is expected to be 21%, approximately 1 percentage point higher than 2014 given the expected mix in regional revenue, specifically higher growth in the U.S. where we have our highest effective tax rates. Lastly, fully diluted share count is expected to be at 183 million.","Turning to Slide 10. We've provided a summary of our first quarter performance by end market along with their current full year outlook, which as you can see remains consistent with our original guidance. In summary, industrial, which represents 44% of total revenue, is expected to grow at low single digits. Our projection assumes growth in emerging markets but moderately lower than performance last year. And with the exception of oil and gas, we expect growth in the U.S. While oil and gas represents less than 5% of total revenue, it does have a higher profit margin. This end market is expected to decline approximately 40% year-over-year. The public utility sector, which constitutes 33% of our total revenue, is anticipated to grow at a low single-digit rate. Here, we expect continued growth in emerging markets as well as the U.S., where we see encouraging signs in terms of municipal funding strengthening in the second half of the year. We anticipate Europe to be stable.","For the commercial market, we see growth in the low to mid-single-digit range. Again, the U.S. market appears to be improving, and we continue to anticipate strength in the emerging markets. We do expect growth to moderate over the balance of the year, given the restocking activity we saw over the last 2 quarters. We expect Europe to remain soft.","Despite the positive start to the year, the residential market remains challenged, particularly in the U.S. and Europe. New product launch in the third quarter of 2014 will provide a boost and partially offset the market headwinds in Europe during the first half of the year. But ultimately, we expect global residential to be flat to down low single digits for the year.","Finally, our smallest end market, agriculture, is anticipated to be flat for the year.","Turning to Slide 11. Given the continued focus on foreign exchange and expected incremental headwinds, we thought it would be appropriate to revisit the information we covered the last quarter.","So first, let's begin by discussing Xylem's foreign exchange transaction exposure. This is true economic exposure and as such, we have in place a comprehensive hedging program that substantially mitigates our overall transaction exposure. Our strategy is to proactively hedge and mitigate up to 75% of net cash flows for our 7 largest currency pair exposures. We do this on a rolling 12-month basis. Furthermore, we hedge the monthly mark-to-market exposure on our balance sheet, and all of our hedging activity utilizes forward instruments.","Finally, as it relates to foreign currency transaction exposure, I would highlight that any residual impact not offset by our hedging program is reflected in our underlying operational performance.","Now let me address foreign currency translation exposure, which is the impact resulting from translating our financial statements of foreign entities back into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. Given the nature of this exposure and the anticipated impact on our financial results in 2015, we will continue to isolate the impact so that you will be able to better judge the operational performance of our company and progress against strategic initiatives. The table illustrates our top 5 currency exposures. It provides you with the average exchange rate for each currency last year and the rates assumed in our previous guidance as well as the average rate during the first quarter. Perhaps more importantly because foreign exchange rates have continued to significantly fluctuate, we've also included the rates we assumed in our guidance update, taking into consideration the average euro-to-dollar rate in April of $1.07.","Similar to last quarter, the table includes the full year expected impacts on revenue and operating income. To summarize, based on the rate assumption used for our guidance update, full year revenue will be negatively impacted by approximately $320 million and operating income by $59 million, which will result in $0.26 of EPS headwind. As you can see from the slide, we already saw revenue negatively impacted by $73 million and operating income by $10 million in the first quarter, and we expect second quarter results to be negatively impacted by $100 million on the top line and $18 million for operating income.","Turning to Slide 12, I'll further illustrate this impact. As you can see here, we expect organic revenue growth of 1% to 3% before approximately 8 percentage points of negative foreign exchange translation impact. This is 1 percentage point or $40 million higher than we previously anticipated. Operating income is expected to be in the range of $528 million to $553 million, resulting in margin expansion of 50 to 90 basis points, excluding the $59 million negative impact of foreign exchange translation noted on the slide. Again, this includes an incremental headwind of $11 million relative to our prior guidance.","Turn to Slide 13. Let me cover our second quarter outlook. As we've done in prior years, I'd like to highlight the seasonal profile of our business, which you can see on the left-hand side of the slide. For the second quarter of 2015, we expect organic growth of approximately 2%. We anticipate foreign exchange translation headwind of approximately $100 million of revenue. On a sequential basis, total revenue should grow approximately 10%, which will result in a first half-second half profile of 48% and 52% for revenue respectively.","Overall, we anticipate operating income to be down year-over-year, primarily due to $18 million of expected foreign-exchange translation headwind. Unfavorable mix and normalized corporate run rate cost will dampen profitability and as a result, we anticipate incremental margins of approximately 25% on a sequential increase in revenue. Lastly, we anticipate that continuous improvement activities and restructuring savings will fund strategic initiatives as well as cover year-over-year inflation.","With that, let me turn the call back over to Patrick for closing comments. Patrick?","Patrick K. Decker","Thanks, Mike. As I said, we're off to a solid start to the year. We're excited about the direction Xylem is headed and look forward to sharing more details about our future plans at an Investor Day meeting later this year.","For now let me get reiterate that we remain focus on driving stronger operating performance even as we face some uncertainty in the marketplace. I'm pleased with the progress the team has made in that regard and the continued momentum of that work. We do see some positive signs ahead, and we will continue to invest to ensure that we are well-positioned to capture new growth opportunities later this year and into 2016. We remain committed to delivering on our financial commitments and executing a broad-based capital deployment strategy. Our operational outlook remains unchanged, and we're on the right path to realizing the full potential that this company is capable of delivering.","So operator, we can now begin the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.","Deane M. Dray - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Given all the macro anxiety, that's an awfully nice clean quarter from you guys. First question is help me understand the order cadence for the past 2 quarters. So it looked like Applied was up nicely in the fourth quarter, but now I'm looking at flat organic orders starting off the year. And does that in any way challenge you to hit this 1% to 3% organic revenue growth for 2015?","Michael T. Speetzen","Yes, Deane, this is Mike. I think from an Applied Water -- and I'd made a couple of comments in my prepared remarks. We had order growth in the fourth quarter about 9%, and we think that the performance in the first quarter is just indicative that a lot of folks, given some of the promotional programs and things that are under way probably did quite a bit of restocking, ordering back in the fourth quarter. And so as we look at what the projection for the balance of the year is, as it relates to Applied Water, we don't see anything from an end market standpoint that says we're going to see anything play out any different. It looks like the commercial market is in a recovery mode. The Architectural Billing Index, specifically around institutional, has remained above 50 now for some time, and so we think that's driving some of the advanced ordering that we saw in the latter part of last year.","Deane M. Dray - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And on the -- your comments on oil and gas. Now I'm not surprised, except for your exposure is less than 5%. But the expectation that, that business is -- could be down 40%, that's much higher than our sensitivity model suggests. And maybe expand on the comment that this as one of your higher-margin businesses.","Michael T. Speetzen","Yes. So Deane, it's -- we have obviously some oil and gas exposure in our Applied Water business, but the predominant exposure really comes out of our dewatering business where we're working on the frac pads for whether it's oil or gas, which is a pretty even blend between the 2. That business was down about 25% in the first quarter, and based on our current projections, we anticipate being down around 40% for the balance of year. We've taken some of that into consideration as we had worked through guidance, but we've obviously made sure that the teams are working the actions that they need to do to try and offset that risk. I think the good news is our dewatering business had such a broad portfolio in terms of exposure to construction, muni bypass disaster recovery that we've got the ability to mobilize and redeploy assets, and that's a lot of what the team is really focused on right now.","Deane M. Dray - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And just if I can have one last question. Just to clarify, your comments on the increased business in China on the treatment side. You cited ozone and filtration. And is the filtration piece, is that part of your licensing agreement with GE?","Michael T. Speetzen","No. This would not be related to the Zenon membrane. This is around our Leopold gravity filtration business.","Deane M. Dray - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Great. So that's for your core legacy filtration side...","Michael T. Speetzen","Exactly, exactly.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Connor (sic) [Ryan Connors] with Boenning and Scattergood.","Ryan Michael Connors - Boenning and Scattergood, Inc., Research Division","I wanted to -- Patrick, you mentioned this effort, that you'll be announcing a new Chief Innovation Officer. I thought that was an interesting comment. And our understanding was that the product development pipeline had actually begun to regain some momentum and that, that was kind of a positive part of the story. So can you give us a little more color about what drove the decision to sort of more institutionalize that? And what exactly that person's mandate will be? And what the kind of goals are in terms of metrics to drive any kind of material improvement on that front?","Patrick K. Decker","Sure. No, I'd be happy to, Ryan. So certainly, I'm very pleased with the progress that each 1 of our 5 growth centers have done over the last few years in revitalizing the pipeline. And you have heard more and more of our new products coming to market. This really is less about a leader coming in and kind of dipping into what each of our business units are doing. There are still some efficiency gains to be achieved there by way of localizing more of our product design and our innovation and technology in some of our fast growth emerging markets, whereas right now that's still large -- a large part of that is happening in the heritage markets in which those brands originated. So certainly driving it towards emerging markets is going to be part of that person's role and responsibility. But this is as much about some of the value mapping work that we've done over the course of the last few months, where we've engaged in a fact-based effort to really map out what the full array of what our -- kind of what our value chain needs are that our customers are managing each day in different end markets, whether that be in the muni market, whether that be in the oil and gas, power, mining, food and beverage. There's a whole list of markets that we have focused in on. And what this person is really going to be doing is working with our marketing teams and others to identify where are some of the white spaces that we want to be driving both organic innovation and technology but also helping inform some of our M&A activity. As you know, M&A is oftentimes a proxy for R&D in an industry where the IP is so fragmented. So those are probably the 2 primary areas that I have the innovation\/technology lead focused on.","Ryan Michael Connors - Boenning and Scattergood, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And I guess my related follow-up would be related to your last point there, which is as you look at the M&A environment, I mean, you mentioned that the company will likely become more active there over the balance of the year. What is the core? Obviously, you can't share with us any specifics, but are you more looking at acquisitions that add to your distribution or product portfolio in developed markets? Or is it more of a technology M&A? Is that really the focus?","Patrick K. Decker","I think it will be a combination of the 2. I would say our predominant interest will be in adding new technology and capabilities to the portfolio, but certainly, where there are opportunities for us to strengthen the core, we'll certainly take advantage of that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano with Cowen.","Joseph Craig Giordano - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","A couple of questions from me. I wanted to talk about pricing. How would you gauge that in 1Q maybe across the different segments or maybe it's better to talk across geographies? And how you view that going forward? I think there's some concern in the industry in general about how much of revenue declines are price generated and when that -- with decrementals associated with that, things like that.","Michael T. Speetzen","Yes. So we -- for the quarter, pricing was essentially flat for us overall, but it's a tale of old segments. So the reality is in our Water Infrastructure segment, and we talked about this last year, we were undertaking quite a bit of activity to really boost our ability to get price in that segment. And we started to see traction. We started to see that in the fourth quarter. We've seen it again in the first quarter, where we got about 40 basis points. So it's not earth-shattering, but it's good progress. I think the area where we're seeing certainly a lot more pressure, and I don't think we're alone in this in terms of the commentary we've heard from many of our peers and competitors, we had close to 90 basis points where the headwind in the Applied Water segment. That market's very competitive. Given some of the dynamics around the end markets and the weather conditions, we've seen that amplify. I would say that it's remaining at this point disciplined, but it is an area that we're keeping a close eye on and obviously, the teams are very actively working countermeasures. As you think about the full year guidance, we talked about expecting price that would be somewhere less than 50 basis points. There's a chance that could be pressured, but it's early in the year, and we're going to be pushing the teams to do what they can to offset it and quite frankly making sure that we're hitting the right value proposition out there to get the price that we think we're entitled to, given the products that we have.","Patrick K. Decker","I would just add that 2 other areas that I think we're very much focusing on in helping mitigate this is, again, you heard us talk about ramping up our global procurement and sourcing efforts. So taking advantage of this low growth and kind of deflationary environment to put that pressure back on our suppliers. Secondly, this is an area where, again, rolling out new products is very helpful to us in terms of arresting the price declines, if not even driving some level of increase. So all the more reason for us to be bringing new products to market.","Joseph Craig Giordano - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Yes, that's fair. On the emerging markets side, that's been up double digits, high singles for quite a bit now. When do we start rolling into comps that become a little bit more challenging to keep that kind of pace?","Michael T. Speetzen","Yes, we actually had our most difficult comp in the first quarter, where we had 18% growth last year. And as we indicated in our initial guidance and obviously what we've reiterated today, we expect strong growth in the emerging markets, high single digits. We just don't anticipate it being at the level that we recognized last year, where we were up about 13%. So we've kind of lapped the most difficult compare, but obviously, there's dynamics going on in China around the commercial markets and so we think the guidance level that we've put out there is pretty consistent with what we experienced in the first quarter and is driving quite a bit of the growth for the company.","Patrick K. Decker","I would just add that I do want to just remind everyone that we're still very much in the building installed base mode, and so it's heavy project activity. It will be choppy and lumpy from quarter-to-quarter, but we do see a steady stream of new products coming.","Joseph Craig Giordano - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Yes, that's good to hear. Maybe last from me. On the industrial outlook, minus 1% for the quarter. That includes big declines in oil and gas, and you're still looking for up for the full year. And there's been a wide variance across earnings so far this season, I feel, on industrial segment guidance. So why do feel that your products are kind of more resilient in this environment? And what makes you -- what gives you comfort that you could still see growth despite the 40% decline in oil and gas there?","Michael T. Speetzen","Yes. So I'd say it's a couple of things. One, within the segment that shown about [ph] oil and gas dewatering, as I mentioned earlier, even though we are facing significant headwind from that particular vertical, that business serves a variety of other end markets that we do see continued strength in. So I think from a dewatering standpoint, we certainly have the diversity of the portfolio. From a more broad-based industrial perspective, I would say the geographic and ultimate end market breadth that we have. So if you remember some of the charts we've displayed in the past, our industrial segment is very diverse in terms of general industrial, food and beverage, construction, et cetera. And so we think by that diversity, that's given us a little bit of insulation relative to the low single-digit growth rate that we're expecting for the year.","Patrick K. Decker","And this is also where we, I think, are very well-positioned from an emerging market standpoint, especially with the install build in the Middle East and China. And so while we're doubling down our efforts in those areas, I certainly don't want to diminish the great work the teams have already done historically to build our base there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Rose with Wedbush Securities.","David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","I had a couple of questions on the margin profile, both, you know, from kind of above the unit level. So first of all, the R&D reduction that you had year-over-year, is that something that you see as structural what you've done to improve the productivity and return on investment in R&D? Or was this more discretionary?","Patrick K. Decker","Yes. I'll take that one. I would say it's largely timing of spend within the quarter. It certainly is not a trend line that we're focusing to continue. If anything, over time, we'll be marginally increasing the amount of investment we spend in R&D. There is also the opportunity we've been driving here to be more efficient and effective in our R&D spend. So as we again further move to localize more and more of our R&D investment in some of the emerging markets, that's a more efficient spend that we're going to get because that will be able to support not only those local markets but also some of our global activity. So it will be a mixed bag going forward, but I wouldn't read anything into the modest decline in the quarter.","Michael T. Speetzen","And, David, there is also some foreign exchange translation tied up in this. If you remember, we have overweight in terms of our engineering that's outside of the U.S., in areas like Stockholm, where we're benefiting from a translation standpoint. Even if we pull that out, we are down, so the comments that Patrick highlighted absolutely apply, but it's being amplified by foreign exchange rate now.","David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay. So in Q2, that will be set back to a normalized level?","Patrick K. Decker","That has declined, yes.","David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, lastly, within the margin contacts, on the Water Infrastructure side, you seem to make some pretty good progress despite the FX headwinds and some of the sluggish commentary you made about the overall market. Where did you see most of the traction front end or within the 4 walls? Maybe you can provide just a little bit more perspective on that?","Michael T. Speetzen","Yes. I think, David...","David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","I'm sorry -- and then lastly and within that context, if you can also give us some color on how the pipeline looks within the backlog going forward.","Michael T. Speetzen","Sure. I think from a margin standpoint, certainly the continued effort and focus that we have across the business on making sure that we're driving the lean and the global sourcing productivity. And I would say for Water Infrastructure, you don't see all of the margin leverage come through because as we indicated, as we're growing in emerging markets, which for that segment, we're up 10%, while there are attractive margins, they're obviously at a lower rate because it's primarily OEM business versus having the after-market content. We are getting that volume leverage off of the growth within the platform and so that's obviously aiding to the margin profile.","David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","So then the backlog...","Michael T. Speetzen","And then -- yes, so the backlog for Water Infrastructure, so orders were up 4%. The backlogs, it one of the strongest levels we've had. As I indicated in some of my remarks, when you look at our shipments for 2016 and beyond, we are up over 50% and so we're continuing to see the strength. Our treatment business was up about 13% from an order standpoint and that was pretty evenly spread across the globe. So at this point, we're not calling a full-on municipal recovery, but we are certainly seeing a continued growth and order strength for that business, not only in treatment, but also in our large transport business.","Patrick K. Decker","I think we've also been pleased. We've seen our win rate improve in the treatment business as well, which is a leading indicator for the rest of the business. It's gone now from 40%, up to 45%, driven by a number of factors, but it's pretty encouraging sign for us.","David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. And I guess really what I was getting at was that the margin profile, that backlog as you start to sell. Continue in emerging markets, as you pointed out, is there margin pressure there or do you see some margin improvement because of the product mix that's changing?","Michael T. Speetzen","Yes. So we actually took a snapshot of that and continued to look at it. And it supports the gross margin level that we have that's just shy of 40%. Because at the same time that we are obviously winning in the emerging markets with margin that may be a little bit lower than the average, we also have some of our higher-margin business coming through in that backlog as well. So overall, the blend is in supportive of the outlook we have for the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chip Moore with Canaccord.","Chip Moore - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","As you get ready to roll out the new sales tools globally here, can you talk a little bit about what you've seen so far in the U.S.? And then when you couple that with some of the newer energy efficiency products, et cetera, how are you thinking about potential share gains?","Patrick K. Decker","Sure. I'll take the first part of that and maybe let Mike comment on the second piece. I mean, we're very pleased with what we've seen in terms of the collaboration that our new sales tools drive. I think the benefits are in a few areas. One is it does make it easier for our commercial teams to get visibility as to sharing leads across the portfolio. As you've known for a while, we -- oftentimes, our businesses have served the same customers, but we haven't always glanced at those customers in a coordinated fashion. So the salesforce.com tool is certainly helping in that regard. I think it's also getting us more visibility to projects that are out there. So the combination of better visibility and improving our win rate is obviously a powerful combination. I think ultimately, over time, this is also about simplifying the lives of our sales teams and taking a lot of the administrative burden off of them. We are in the very, very early innings of that. So that's all opportunity in front of us to allow them to be able to spend even more time out in the field in front of customers. In terms of again rolling out new products, our vitality index is roughly around 20%. And that dipped down a little bit in the first quarter just by way of mix, but we do feel good about a number of the new products that we have that we've already rolled out and some others that we're going to be announcing here over the coming few months. And if you might add, Mike, on the...","Michael T. Speetzen","Chip, I assume your question was in relation to the deployment of salesforce.com in terms of the shipping?","Chip Moore - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","That's right..","Michael T. Speetzen","Yes. So I think, when we look at things like the ecocirc that I talked about in my prepared remarks, we obviously are taking share in the European markets. And as we look at having a tool that enables, as Patrick said, our sales force to be able to communicate opportunities and execute on those, we think that, coupled with the energy-efficient proposition that we have in our products or that we're developing for our products, and given the climate we're dealing with with our customers in terms of trying to reduce costs, we think that's going to give us a very strong platform. As we've talked in the past, being able to outperform the market by 1 point or 2, that's going to be a key part of that equation.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thielman with D.A. Davidson.","Brent Thielman - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","You've had a few quarters now of strength in the commercial nonresidential product area and seems to be some momentum in that market. Is this a group that can be as meaningful as 20% or more of your sales mix, if the market gives you enough tailwind all else kind of generally equal in the other applications?","Michael T. Speetzen","I don't think so. I mean, it's 13% of our revenue today. And when I think about the growth potential that we have, say, in industrial and even public utility growing at a moderate rate, it's going to be tough for it to surpass that. I mean, we had 9% growth in the first quarter, but as I indicated in my comments, we think that's going to moderate to kind of low to mid-single digits. Some of that is being driven by advanced stocking. But it is going to be a great part of the portfolio for sustained growth as that market continues through over the next several years.","Brent Thielman - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Okay. And then in terms of your guidance, are you expecting cost inflation to kind of stay a headwind throughout this year? It seems some of the movement in commodities last several months would help in that regard.","Michael T. Speetzen","Yes. I mean, at this stage, we're calling it less than 2%. So relative to last year, we actually saw the starting decrement towards the end of last year. But relative to last year, it's actually a net benefit for us. It's also -- there's also a sizable component of wage inflation in it as well that needs to be addressed. And I think Patrick's comments earlier around the strategic sourcing organization, I mean, we are really driving hard to continue what we've already had a strong performance to more than offset that. So back to the earlier point, even if we do start to see some of the price downward pressure coupled with inflation, we're still confident that we can drive margin expansion in that environment.","Operator","Your next question come from the line of Brian Konigsberg with Vertical Research.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Question on restructuring. So you kept that at $20 million. Correct me if I'm wrong, I think that there was maybe, what, $17 million, $18 million that wasn't done in '14 that actually you're just doing in '15 and you added a couple of million more when you provided your initial outlook. I guess I was under the impression there that, that could become more aggressive. Can you just maybe talk about where that stands? Is there an opportunity to maybe kind of hit the gas pedal on that this year? And where those opportunities might be, if you could?","Patrick K. Decker","Sure, Brian. I mean, again, I -- we certainly announced that there remains a couple of hundred points of opportunity as a percent of revenue to reduce cost. You see that most notably in our G&A line, but there's also costs that are hidden within our gross margin infrastructure. I would say we're taking a very strategic approach, rather -- that's far more proactive rather than reactive, and it's actually tied in to our overall broader strategy. We will be sharing more details on what that plan would be as part of a multi-year, multi-faceted approach later this year at our Investor Day.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","So not likely much more this year, is that takeaway?","Patrick K. Decker","Still reins open. We'll have more to share. We're in the late stages of developing those plans. As you saw, we announced a few months ago, we appointed Tony Milando as our Head of CI and Business Transformation. So Tony's working very closely with Mike, myself and the leadership team to finalize those plans.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Got it. And secondly, just on the guidance, maybe you could help a little bit with the bridge. So the performance in Q1, you gave a pretty fairly detailed guidance for Q2 and the full year operating profit. Just kind of looking at the revenue trends for the second half of the year, you're looking at down maybe $100 million-or-so at the midpoint, but you're looking for flat operating profit. Could you talk about what is layering in in the second half that's going to help buffer still a decent sizable revenue headwind?","Michael T. Speetzen","Yes. So one of the items is actually where you started, which is the restructuring. So we ended up picking up about $6 million in first quarter, we'll probably get another $5 million in the second quarter. And then the balance of the $20 million is going to end up showing in the second half. So you're going to have elements of that as well as just the mix of the portfolio in the second half and our continued focus around making sure that we've got the discipline around sourcing and the lean deployment within the business.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Robert Barry with Susquehanna Financial.","Unknown Analyst","This is [indiscernible] on the call for Rob today. So my first question goes back to dewatering. So you mentioned oil and gas. I was wondering what was the performance in the other verticals, in particular mining, utility and construction.","Michael T. Speetzen","Yes. So our dewatering business overall for the quarter was flat, and it was primarily obviously driven down by the performance in the oil and gas. So the balance of the portfolio was probably up around 4%, 5%.","Unknown Analyst","Okay, great. So my second question regards more on the geographical basis. In Canada, the weakness that you saw in 1Q, how much of that would you say is related to direct and indirect input of oil and gas? And then in Europe, Europe was flat. And have you seen any improvement in Europe? Or is it too early to say?","Michael T. Speetzen","Yes. It's on the Canada side, it is driven by oil and gas. We had a big distribution order last year that went into that particular segment. So we do anticipate having headwind through the rest of the year, but it was overtly pronounced in the first quarter. And as it relates to Europe, I mean at this stage, I would say things are progressing. I don't know that we're in a position right now to make a call other than what we've talked about the year being flat.","Operator","At this time, there are no further questions. I will now turn the floor back to Patrick Decker for any additional or closing remarks.","Patrick K. Decker","Great. Well, thanks again, everyone. Once again, as I said earlier, it's very early in the year, but I do feel that we're off to a very solid start. And I look forward to our next call in late July, where we will be updating you on our progress. So in the meantime, thank you again, and safe travel to everyone.","Operator","Thank you.

McClain","Thank you, Phil. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. We appreciate your interest in Xylem. Today is a special day for us as it marks our 1-year anniversary as a separately traded public company. As we were getting ready to celebrate this week, Hurricane Sandy hit the East Coast, leaving a path of devastation behind. I'm sure many of you and your families have been affected as many of our Xylem employees have been, so please know that our thoughts are with you.","I'm always reminded in the aftermath of crisis situations such as this of the importance of the work we do. In many of the areas where flooding is a huge issue, Xylem is there with our equipment and with our expertise, helping to bring things back to normal as quickly as possible. As I reflect back over the past year and on our accomplishments, I'm proud of our team and how we've come together, staying focused on our customers, advancing our strategic initiatives, all while standing up a new company and in the face of some very difficult economic headwinds. This has been a challenging year by any standard, but a satisfying one as well. The team has sharpened its execution, tightened spending and continues to drive cost reductions to navigate through these challenging times, and as a result, our business operations continue to improve even with lower-than-anticipated revenues.","But our journey has just begun. We are laying the path for growth with investments to provide customers with new products, services and solutions they're looking for. We're investing to expand geographically so we can reach our entire servable market and realize our full market share potential. And we continue to expand our portfolio with our disciplined acquisition process. And today, I'll highlight our latest addition, Heartland Pump. So special thanks goes out to our 12,000, 5,000 -- 12,500 Xylem employees around the world. They're dedicated to this business and are driving Xylem forward with long-term goals in mind.","Now I'd like to walk you through our third quarter results. Our team delivered another solid quarter of operating performance. Today, we're reporting third quarter revenue of $931 million, reflecting growth of 3% on a constant currency basis. Organic growth was 1% with acquisitions adding another 2%. Revenue in Europe grew modestly despite underlying market weakness. For the third quarter, organic revenue in Europe were up 1% year-over-year.","Exiting the second quarter, we've highlighted our expectations that U.S. growth would moderate during the second half. In the third quarter, U.S. organic revenue declined 3%, relative to a strong prior year performance where we posted revenue growth of 20% and organic revenue growth of 9%. This was driven by slowing industrial markets and continued drought conditions.","Emerging markets continue to drive growth, up 9% on a constant currency basis, driven by strength in the Asia Pacific and Latin America regions. Our continued focus on acquisitions -- attractive acquisitions is helping us drive top line growth, adding 2% during the quarter. It is important to note that in September, we celebrated our 1-year anniversary of the YSI acquisition, and as a result for the quarter, those revenues for the month of September are now included in our organic performance.","We received orders of $882 million, down 5% in constant currency resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 0.95. Under normal market conditions, we would have expected a book-to-bill ratio of approximately 1.0 for the overall business. This puts pressure on the top line, leading into what historically has been the strongest quarter of the year. When I look at the project funnel, I remain cautiously optimistic that orders will be released, that activities for capital projects will continue to increase, but the release of orders still remains much slower than anticipated.","The key focus for us has been margin expansion. Despite the lower demand, we continue to reach higher levels of profitability. You may recall from our Investor Day last fall, we had set a long-term target in gross margins of greater than 40%. We've made significant progress towards this goal in 2012, including 130 basis point improvement for the third quarter compared to prior year and surpassing the 40% mark for the first time.","Operating margin was 12.9%. Excluding the impact of standalone costs, operating margin was up 50 basis points. Earnings per share were $0.44. Core operations and YSI performance drove earnings up $0.02 but were offset by foreign exchange and higher operating tax rate. Overall, our operating performance was solid, particularly in light of the market dynamics around the world.","Please turn to Slide 4. Let me provide you an update on the business and the progress we've made on our strategic initiatives. We continue our focus on acquiring businesses that fit with our strategic objectives for growth and make strong additions to our portfolio. During the third quarter, we announced the acquisition of MJK and we've been successfully integrating the business into our analytical instrumentation platform. We're still in the early stages but I'm very pleased with our progress.","Just last Friday, we announced the acquisition of Heartland Pump, a perfect fit for Xylem as it expands the geographic reach of our dewatering platform. These acquisitions and those that we completed over the last few years have positioned us in 2 very attractive areas, mainly dewatering and analytics.","Before I move on to highlight some of our latest product launches, I'd like to recognize that during the third quarter, Xylem was selected to the Dow Jones Sustainability Global Index where we were one of 340 companies selected out of 2,500 applicants and we're also included in the North America Index, an important step in a long journey to demonstrate Xylem's focus on sustainable solutions in our business and in the communities we live.","We continue to make great progress in deploying innovative new product applications and services that differentiate Xylem in the marketplace. Earlier this quarter, at the West Tech Trade Conference, we launched our Sanitaire Bioloop Oxidation Ditch into the U.S. market. Globally, this is roughly a $1 billion market. Importantly, in the time of limited CapEx spend -- expenditure by the public utilities, this offering is targeted to retrofit the significant number of aging oxidation ditch treatment plants around the globe, requiring energy-efficient solutions to address needed repairs, higher affluence standards and population growth.","Bioloop's extended aeration process effectively removes nitrogen and total phosphorus, but more importantly, by combining our aeration and mixing expertise with our controlled technology that Sanitaire Bioloop can deliver energy savings of more than 50%, providing us with a clear competitive advantage. I'm happy to report that this product has captured the market's attention and we received our first order from the city of Liberty, Kentucky.","In Europe, we launched our energy-efficient Lowara Ecocirc, in advance of the EU new eco-design directive, which mandates certain energy efficiency standards for the region beginning on January 1, 2013. Ecocirc not only meets the 2013 standards, but also the more stringent energy efficiency standard set forth by the directives for 2015. Our year-to-date sales for this product line are up 13%.","Lastly, I'd just like to quickly highlight that our Flojet business has been recognized by the Coca-Cola Company as supplier of the year. The recognition stems from all of our team has done in terms of strategic execution, product innovation and customer intimacy.","We continue our journey to increase our presence in emerging markets. For example, growing industries and the need for water and wastewater infrastructure are driving year-to-date organic growth rates of 20% in the Latin America and Asia Pacific regions, respectively. We're also working on a number of areas to ensure that we achieve the growth and margin potential our businesses are capable of delivering independent of market conditions. Progress continues against our key priorities as evidenced by our growth and operating margin expansion.","Through operational excellence initiatives, we are driving faster efficiencies, lowering production costs and improving on customer satisfaction. For example, continued progress improvements have significantly increased our on-time delivery at our Auburn and Dallas manufacturing sites this year. Our global sourcing supply team has increased our efforts in low-cost countries where we currently have over 100 parts under development to lower our product costs. These projects are focused on expanding and improving the quality of our emerging market supplier base for future growth in the region and globally.","Finally, we recently completed a project to reduce packaging costs, and as a result, we have decreased the consumption of wood by 36 tons at our Buffalo facility. This is just one example of the many projects our teams are working daily to reduce costs and implement sustainable solutions throughout Xylem.","On the front end of our business, the processes and disciplines we've implemented around pricing through our Customer Excellence programs continues to pay off. We're delivering strong price realization in our results, approximately 1.5% during the quarter, after delivering 1.7% in the first half of the year. And in order to better position us for growth in 2013, we're executing on the restructuring and realignment actions we mentioned during last quarter's call.","Turning to Slide 5. Last Friday, we announced the $29 million acquisition of privately held Heartland Pump Rentals & Sales with 2011 revenues of $33 million. This acquisition is consistent with our strategy to expand our dewatering business globally, including in the United States, and provides the additional opportunities to leverage our portfolio. With 40% of revenue coming from rental equipment and services, we further enhanced our position in attractive profitable space. With our dewatering platform now over $600 million, this acquisition will benefit from scale advantages around costs and CapEx. Similar to Godwin, Heartland serves a wide range of customers including industrial, public utilities and agencies addressing disaster recovery situations.","Turning to Slide 6. Before we look ahead to the fourth quarter, let's take a quick look back and review our performance on a year-to-date basis. Orders of $2.9 billion have slightly outpaced revenue of $2.8 billion. Revenue has increased 4% on a constant currency basis. Gross margin was 39.7%, up 110 basis points over the prior year. Operating margin was 12.7%, up 60 basis points versus the prior year after adjusting for standalone costs. To put this in perspective, our year-to-date operating margin of 12.7% is the same as where we ended 2011, after absorbing $26 million of standalone costs as an independent company. And finally, we reported EPS of $1.29 and generated $171 million of free cash flow.","Turning to Slide 7. Looking ahead, I'm confident we're taking the appropriate actions and have the plans in place to position Xylem for growth in 2013. Because we've not seen any significant signs of turnaround in the marketplace, we've accelerated additional restructuring and realignment actions and now expect to be at the high-end of our previous range, approximately $20 million in 2012. In addition, we are focused on integrating MJK and Heartland quickly and effectively into our portfolio, while continuing to deploy capital in the disciplined and thoughtful fashion we've demonstrated thus far, an approach focused on delivering sustainable long-term returns on investments for our shareholders.","So from a full year perspective, we still expect to deliver revenues of $3.8 billion, reflecting 1% organic growth, the low-end of our previous guidance. Despite volume challenges, we will deliver solid operating performance with margins in the range of 12.7% to 12.9%, and we expect EPS in the range of $1.72 to $1.79, a midpoint of $1.76, including the $0.01 dilutive impact at Heartland.","Now let me turn the call over to our CFO, Mike Speetzen, to walk through the detailed results. Mike?","Michael T. Speetzen","Thanks, Gretchen. Please go to Slide 8. In the third quarter, Xylem revenues were $931 million, reflecting 3% growth on a constant currency basis. Organic revenue growth contributed 1 point to the total and acquisitions added another 2 points of growth. Foreign exchange translation was a headwind of 4 points. Let me provide you with some perspective of our third quarter revenue performance and how we see the remainder of the year by end market and by region.","First, in our largest end market segment, industrial, organic revenue was down slightly year-over-year versus expectations of low-single digit growth. The North American region continues to be negatively impacted by dry weather conditions versus the prior-year period, which had seen double-digit growth in dewatering activities. European industrial market weakness continues for the second consecutive quarter. These results were partially offset by strength in mining, particularly in Latin America and South Africa.","On a sequential basis, industrial declined low-single digits in the third quarter, driven by weakness in North America and Europe versus our previous expectation that these regions would be relatively flat. We now expect full year organic revenues for industrial to be flat to up low-single digits year-over-year. This range assumes fourth quarter revenues will be down low-single digits.","We continue to see and expect resiliency out of the public utility market. Third quarter revenue was up high-single digits with growth coming across most regions, but generally in line with expectations and flat on a sequential basis. We expect second half 2012 revenue to be up low- to mid-single digits over the prior year. The timing of deliveries favorably impacted our third quarter performance and we expect fourth quarter revenue results to be down as a result of project deliveries in 2011.","While bidding activity continues to improve, we continue to see capital expenditure delays. Based on the order activity we've seen this year and the strong fourth quarter performance in 2011, we expect fourth quarter organic revenue to be down low-single digits. For the full year, we anticipate public utility revenues to be flat to up low-single digits compared to the prior year.","Commercial building services were down high-single digits, reflecting challenging market conditions in Europe, a sluggish recovery in the U.S. and a tough prior-year comparison when we delivered 9% global organic growth. We expect the commercial market will continue to be challenged. We project full year performance to be flat to down low-single digits. This assumes low-single digit growth in the fourth quarter.","Residential was down low-single digits in the third quarter compared to a very strong third quarter of 2011, where we saw double-digit organic growth in the U.S. As we look forward to the fourth quarter, we expect low-single digit growth in the U.S. and double-digit growth in Europe, driven by high energy-efficient circulator demand. Overall, we now expect residential revenue to be flat to down slightly for the full year.","As for agriculture, we were up high-single digits for the third quarter, driven by better-than-expected results out of the U.S. given continued drought conditions. Overall, we expect full year agriculture to be up low single digits.","Let me spend just a few minutes on our overall geographic performance. The U.S. was down 3% on an organic basis, up 1% year-to-date. As a result, we expect flat year-over-year organic performance for the full year. Europe was up 1% for the third quarter and is now flat year-to-date. We also expect full year organic performance to be flat in this region.","Emerging markets continue to drive top line growth, up 6% for the third quarter, with double-digit growth coming from both Latin America and Asia Pacific regions. Year-to-date emerging market revenue growth is 9%. We are now projecting full year organic growth to be up high-single digits.","Organic order rates were down approximately 7% and book-to-bill was 0.95. Orders were down year-over-year, reflecting large project order delays, drought conditions driving lower demand for dewatering applications and continued softness in the U.S. commercial market. Adjusted operating income was up 2% when adjusted for incremental standalone ramp-up costs incurred in Q3 of 2012.","Despite lower-than-expected organic revenue, third quarter operating margins came in at 12.9%, up 50 basis points after adjusting for the impact of standalone costs. Gross margin was 40.2% for the third quarter, up 130 basis points versus the prior year as price and cost improvements more than offset inflation and unfavorable mix. By driving gross margin performance, we're able to continue to invest in our business while expanding operating margins. Investments in the third quarter impacted operating margins by 40 basis points.","For this quarter, our value GAAP, measured as our operating margin contribution from price versus material cost inflation, was positive, adding 60 basis points and the impact of foreign exchange translation and transaction negatively impacted operating margins by 60 basis points.","Please turn to Slide 9. This slide shows our EPS walk for the third quarter. This is a transition year for Xylem, and as such, there are a lot of moving parts. So I want to spend some time this morning, as we have on previous calls, describing the components of our performance. As the middle section of the chart depicts, we've adjusted both 2011 and 2012 EPS to a normalized basis to provide a clearer picture of how we performed operationally versus last year. The walk starts with GAAP EPS for 2011 and ends with GAAP EPS for 2012.","In between, we made 2 sets of adjustments. For the third quarter, on the left side of the chart, we increased 2011 GAAP EPS of $0.42 by $0.03 to show how 2011 would have looked had Xylem been a standalone company with the interest expense on debt and required independent company costs. We have also adjusted the numbers to exclude the 2011 impact of one-time separation costs and special tax items.","For the third quarter of 2012, on the right side of the chart, we adjusted GAAP EPS of $0.38 by adding back the net negative impact to 2012 one-time separation costs, restructuring and realignment costs and special tax items. Making these adjustments put both third quarters on a comparable normalized basis to allow for a better view of operational performance. The analysis shows that normalized EPS decreased 2% or $0.01. Core operations and the net impact from acquisitions provided $0.02 of EPS growth or 4%, but was more than offset by higher operating tax rate and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange translation.","Now let me provide a little bit more detail on our reporting segments. Please turn to Slide 10. For the third quarter, Water Infrastructure reported revenue of $595 million, up 7% over prior year on a constant currency basis and up 3% organically. Acquisitions contributed 4 points to the top line growth and foreign exchange with a 5 point headwind. Beginning in September of this year, YSI revenues are included in our organic growth performance.","Transport grew 1% for the quarter, driven by favorability in the public utility market where we saw mid-single digit growth for the quarter, which was slightly better than our expectations. In the U.S. and Europe, we continue to see a stable environment with growth driven by aftermarket sales and services. In addition, we continue to see strong emerging market growth. Industrial transport was down low-single digits as U.S. drought conditions continue to negatively impact dewatering rental services.","Treatment revenues grew 11% for the third quarter, driven by public utility strength. And we expect that public utility treatment revenues will be up on a sequential basis in the fourth quarter. However, due to significant project deliveries last year, revenues will be down low-single digits year-over-year.","From an orders perspective, we continue to see large robust bid and quote activity but conversion of booked orders continues to push to the right. We've increased our focus and set forth a specific initiative targeted at increasing our share in the high potential industrial treatment market. For example, we highlighted a large order win within the pulp and paper market in the second quarter and we recently won a large Ozone order for aquaculture in Canada.","Test revenues were up significantly, driven by the inclusion of the YSI and MJK business. Excluding acquisitions, the test application was up 7% organically year-over-year due to strength in the U.S. and Asia Pacific regions, partially offset by continued weakness in Europe.","Third quarter operating margins came in at 15.5%, down 80 basis points from 2011, excluding the impact of standalone costs. Our operational and customer excellence initiatives more than offset the impact of inflation and provided flexibility to continue to invest in the business. Our margins were, however, negatively impacted by the previously mentioned lower rental dewatering volume.","Let me now turn to Slide #11 and talk to our applied water segment. Applied water's third quarter revenue was down 2% on a constant currency basis. Building services was down 6%, driven by the commercial and residential performance I articulated earlier. Industrial water was up 1% due to favorable general industrial market conditions across most regions. In the U.S., revenue declined low-single digits due to shipment delays. We expect these shipments to be delivered in the fourth quarter and as a result, anticipate high-single digit growth in the U.S. And lastly, irrigation was up 9%. U.S. revenues increased by double digits, reflecting strong demand given current weather conditions.","Third quarter operating margins came in at 13.2%, up 70 basis points from 2011, excluding standalone costs. Excluding a $2 million asset impairment charge recognized during the third quarter of 2011, and the benefit from foreign exchange, our operating margins would have declined only 20 basis points despite a 2% reduction in volume. Price and productivity actions more than offset the impact of lower volume, unfavorable mix and inflation, enabling continued investment in the segment.","Now let me turn to Slide 12 and review our financial position. We generated $171 million in free cash flow year-to-date, a conversion on adjusted net income of 73%, reflecting typical seasonality for our business. Our cash flow is down from Q3 of 2011 as anticipated, driven primarily by incremental interest payments of $38 million related to the debt put in place as a result of the spinoff from ITT. In addition, we had incremental U.S. federal and state tax payments in 2012.","As a reminder, the 2011 figures are a result of the carve out financials provided in the Form 10 and reflected in allocated portion of U.S. tax payments that were deemed a Xylem obligation for the purposes of the full intent statement. Note that adjusting for these tax payments would bring the 2011 conversion in line with our current year performance and normal seasonal trend.","As you can see from the slide, working capital as a percent of revenue has increased year-over-year. The majority of this increase is driven by foreign exchange rates, but additionally, we are carrying slightly higher inventory levels to ensure we can meet shortened customer lead times.","As it relates to our capital structure, we ended the third quarter in a strong position. Our available cash on hand was $424 million, up from the second quarter. We have a solid net debt to net capital ratio of 28% and our credit metrics are in line with expectations and our credit ratings. Our commercial paper and revolving credit facilities remain in place and continue to be unutilized. And last week, the credit rating agencies affirmed their previous ratings of Xylem.","Now let me just turn to Slide 14 and talk about our guidance for 2012. This chart illustrates the walk from our previous guidance midpoint for EPS to our revised guidance. Our previous guidance was for a midpoint EPS of $1.77. FX continues to fluctuate. Based on quarter-end currency spot rates, we expect a $0.02 tailwind when compared to rates assumed in our previous guidance. For example, our current guidance assumes a dollar to euro exchange rate of $1.28 for the balance of the year versus $1.22 assumed in our previous guidance. As you can see from the chart, these tailwinds, coupled with additional cost savings actions, enable us to offset the impact of the volume decline. So before we update our full year guidance for the newly announced Heartland acquisition, I would highlight that the midpoint guidance remains at $1.77, consistent with our previous guidance.","As we highlighted earlier, we recently announced the acquisition of Heartland, which will add approximately $4 million in revenue and will be $0.01 dilutive due to acquisition costs and purchase accounting impacts in 2012. We expect the acquisition will be accretive in 2013.","Please turn to Slide 15. This slide provides all the relevant details for our guidance range. I'd like to highlight just a few key points. We're now projecting full year organic revenue growth of 1%, which is at the low-end of our previous guidance. We expect approximately 1% organic growth from each of our 2 business segments. Because we've lowered the top end of our revenue guidance, we are also lowering the top end of our operating margin range. We now expect operating margins in the range of 12.7% to 12.9%, flat to up 20 basis point over the prior year, including the impact of incremental standalone costs. Excluding standalone costs, this represents an 80 basis point year-over-year improvement.","As Gretchen mentioned earlier, we have taken initial steps to address the softening European economic environment and have initiated several restructuring and realignment actions. We anticipate these charges in 2012 to be approximately $20 million. In the third quarter, we incurred $5 million of these costs. We still anticipate that these actions will be substantially completed in 2012, with approximately $3 million of additional costs being incurred in 2013. The run rate savings will be approximately $11 million beginning in 2013. We anticipate less than $1 million of savings in 2012. Year-to-date, we recognize $15 million in onetime separation costs and we expect full year separation costs to be approximately $20 million. Please note that our EPS guidance does not include any impact from restructuring and realignment costs, onetime separation costs and unannounced acquisitions and related costs.","Let me now turn the call back over to Gretchen to wrap up.","Gretchen W. McClain","In summary, we had another strong quarter of operating performance. We are and will continue to position ourselves for long-term growth. By investing in our growth platforms, executing a disciplined acquisition strategy and advancing our geographic growth initiatives, I am confident we will deliver long-term growth and higher returns for our shareholders.","We continue to launch new products and have the financial ability to continue to invest for future growth. And for our customer and operational excellence initiatives, we will continue to expand operating margins. And as I mentioned at the beginning of the call, we have a series of restructuring and realignment actions under way and are developing plans should the market deteriorate further.","By making these difficult decisions today, we're preserving investment capabilities and defending and improving our competitive advantages. This will lead ultimately to higher levels of profitability. My last point, we're entering the fourth quarter and shortly thereafter, 2013, with a strong financial position and the flexibility to continue to execute our long-term strategy.","With that, we'll be happy take your questions. Brandy?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Deane Dray with Citi Research.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just first question is regarding the impact of Hurricane Sandy. And of course, we're still early in the process, we understand, but from a disaster recovery standpoint, can you comment on any business interruptions that Xylem has had and then balance that with what are the opportunities for the company on the recovery process. Every time I heard you say low dewatering rentals in the quarter, I'm thinking that obviously you see the big reversal this quarter and even Heartland should participate as well. But if you just talk about what the opportunities are in residential, commercial, industrial and maybe comment on -- I heard on the radio that you all were shipping pumps on an emergency basis and you got a shout out, so maybe comment on that as well.","Gretchen W. McClain","Sure, Dean. Let me talk about Sandy. In terms of your first question, interruptions to the business, I can't really comment right now. What we've been mostly focused on is making sure that we're deploying our equipment and we're trying to get expertise to those who obviously are in need at this time. We've shipped over 200 pumps into this whole North East region. And we have, I understand, another 100-some pumps and we also made sure that some pumps and if we're low on pumps, water system pumps are available to our channel and trying to help them as quickly as we can. So it's a horrible situation, but it's an opportunity for us to be able to engage with our expertise and our equipment. In terms of where we are with fourth quarter, as we're going into the fourth quarter, our orders are not where we want them to be, so this is an opportunity to backfill that. There will be some things that will be offset because things will be pushed to the right because of the disaster. So we'll kind of have to look at it through this quarter and into next -- and first of 2013 to see what the overall impact will be.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then just as a follow-up, on your point about some of these order pushouts, maybe you can take us through the different markets, what types of pushouts are you seeing, on the muni side both in and on the industrial side? Are these pushouts as a result of funding issues or a lack of confidence in the outlook, the fiscal cliff and so forth, but a color on the motivation behind the pushouts and potential timing?","Gretchen W. McClain","Yes, let me first start with industrial. I mean industrial, what we're seeing now is the capital expenditure being challenged. A lot of that's driven by the uncertainty in the economy, people holding back to see what happens here, so where we're seeing a significant part of project delays within the industrial side. As we've been talking about on the capital expenditure side on the public utilities, we saw nice orders in the second quarter. We've seen our bid activity in the third quarter increase. But again, we're not seeing the orders being released at the level that we would have anticipated. So that's the result of the CapEx in the public utilities being down. I don't think it's down any further. I think, right now, they're trying to determine which projects to let go out since they've got a backlog of activities. Commercial area, we saw the same thing in terms of capital expenditures pulling back, people pulling back because of the confidence in the region.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","But no pullback on what would be the break-and-check side of your media business, which is about 70%? Is that still the aftermarket percentage?","Gretchen W. McClain","Yes, I think our business in terms of operations, maintenance, repair, services has been robust, continues to be resilient in Europe, and our large installed base in those relationships we have with the customers continue to be strong.","Michael T. Speetzen","Dean, I'll add our aftermarket services are up 4.5% through the first 3 quarters of the year as evidence of that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Summerville with KeyBanc.","Joseph K. Radigan - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","This is Joe Radigan on for Matt. Just in terms of the bidding activity that you talked about, Gretchen, what are you seeing in terms of the pricing dynamic on that project side? Is it -- do you see folks chasing that business so it's getting more competitive pricewise? Or just given the pent-up demand now and as you project capacity out as some of these orders theoretically let in the future, is it actually firming up and getting better?","Gretchen W. McClain","So I wouldn't say the competitive nature has gotten any worse. I really think there's a lot of activity. Of course, our customers are making sure they are looking at choices and getting options. But they're looking specifically on how to resolve the issues. And the bidding activities there, our funnel is as rich as it's been in quite some time. Now the question is a matter of getting those released and getting them actually turned into firm orders.","Joseph K. Radigan - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, if I could just -- a quick follow-up on Deane's first question around Sandy, how much do you typically bake into your guidance for severe weather cleanup? I mean, I know it's impossible to predict the number of storms and where they are geographically, but there is a hurricane season, so there's some regularity there. Can you just give some color on maybe more broadly your thought process on how much -- when you think about guidance and how you bake in that kind of unpredictability?","Gretchen W. McClain","Yes, so in the third quarter, when you think of the dewatering business, third quarter is typically a large time for seasonal effects. You've got the storms, the hurricanes coming in. And we only saw Isaac this third quarter, part of the reason why our orders and sales are down in our dewatering business. Typically, you'll see 3 or 4 different types of storms and we would react appropriately. So you'll see that typically more so in the third quarter. Going into fourth quarter, you typically don't see that type of seasonality. So we try to factor in an average amount of storms. So in some cases, you'll be down; other cases, you can actually benefit from it like we saw the year before.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Maczka with BB&T Capital Markets.","Kevin R. Maczka - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","A question on gross margin, obviously, very strong here at 40%, matching your long-term goal. It sounds like, Gretchen, from what you're describing in terms of your order cadence and initiating new restructuring, maybe the top line gets a bit more challenging here before it gets better. I'm just wondering on that gross margin line, can we sustain this type of level in that environment? Or was there anything unusual in terms of mix or one-offs that really helped profit up this quarter?","Gretchen W. McClain","So I would comment just in general on how we're driving the growth margin. I mean, it's coming from several different things. One, we've been driving our commercial excellence activities, which is driving price and we're seeing nice price. We're also seeing the shift in our portfolio through the acquisitions that we've done. The other benefit is we're seeing the sales that we are getting from our new product launches and our new product launches have higher margins. And we're also, of course, doing a lot of the things I talked about in my opening statements, is a lot of activities and there are many of them around continued productivity in our factories, in our supply chain, sourcing and so forth that are giving us benefit. When I look forward and say what's in front of us, we still have a lot of work to do around product rationalization, which will continue to propel us in the future. But volume does have an impact and we're living right now in a low-growth environment and I don't see that changing anytime soon.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Rose with Wedbush Securities.","David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions. One is going back to an earlier question on sort of the read in terms of why are projects being delayed. Is there any commentary, as I understand part is fiscal cliff, any potentially election-related?","Gretchen W. McClain","I can't comment on that. I just think it's the uncertainty in the market in general. I think in most of our customers, they've got constrained budgets, they're trying to make the choices in the public utilities. What they're trying to determine is which project do they let loose first before the other ones and so, they're going through that now, I think, on a daily basis.","David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay. So there's really not a sense in terms of does this go live in December or January or February? So there's no sense of timing?","Gretchen W. McClain","No.","David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay. Secondly, if we could, going back to the notion of dewatering, clearly, you've benefited in the past by -- in the oil and gas shale plays as we've discussed, you're expanding into other markets. Can you discuss sort of the strategy in dewatering as it relates to both opportunities, risk management and working capital requirements? Clearly, you're going to have to step up inventories if you have a lot of storms. And as you go internationally, what sort of inventory will you have to have for emerging markets like China, et cetera?","Gretchen W. McClain","Yes, so a great question. And just let me take a step back in terms of our dewatering strategy. The one thing we acquired when we acquired Godwin was a very good business model around 24\/7, and -- in terms of being able rental and services with equipment not only for public utilities, but also in the industrial market being mining, whether it being shale, whether it be disaster-related activity, and most of that equipment can be deployed in multiple uses. So far, that's the positive part of it. Typically, in the U.S., you would typically see maybe the East Coast being a drought and the West Coast being wet or vice versa, and you typically wouldn't see the whole U.S. in a drought situation like we've seen this year. Typically, that will offset itself. One of the things we're trying to do with our dewatering strategy is to take that model and now take it geographically. And we've talked about expanding in Brazil. We've talked about expanding in other regions around the world. And we think that ultimately will allow us to better utilize our footprint, get maximum utilization in terms of our assets which, it is a costly model, but is a very profitable model when deployed appropriately.","Michael T. Speetzen","Hey, David, the other thing I'd add is, we've mentioned before, we manage that business in a different manner just given the nature of the CapEx that's involved. And so for example, when we see lower volume rates, we dial back the investment because we're looking at utilization rates and return on assets. The other thing I'd point out is, given the nature of the equipment, it can be moved pretty easily between applications. So it can be moved from construction to municipal bypass relatively easily. So that allows us to get some efficiency, whether it's in the CapEx or the inventory that's used to support the equipment. So it's definitely an area that we watch very carefully. And as we go into new markets, we're very deliberate about how much investment we make and we monitor that closely against the utilization rates we have in the business.","David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","So as the footprint expands, you'll probably see less volatility in top line in margins, I would take it?","Michael T. Speetzen","That's one of the benefits from the global expansion, absolutely. That and the diverse end market exposure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chip Moore with Canaccord.","Chip Moore - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","So back to Sandy, I guess once you get past sort of the immediate disaster recovery cleanup efforts, what does it look like longer term for you guys in terms of the infrastructure investments? What you see back with Katrina in New Orleans, is there any opportunity there for the rest of the portfolio?","Gretchen W. McClain","The area that I'd say where we play is in building services, we will have a lot of businesses that we'll have to go back and retrofit some of their services, whether it be boilers, heating, ventilation, air conditioning and so forth, so there's opportunity in the future as that expands out. But that won't be the first need. Obviously, the first need will be the initial cleanup.","Chip Moore - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","And then just as a follow-up, on the M&A side, clearly, the balance sheet is very strong. Can you just talk about the thought process, analytics, dewatering, where you're looking, what we should be looking for?","Gretchen W. McClain","Yes, I'd just comment that we have a healthy pipeline. We have been continuing to work our -- the different candidates that we're cultivating. I feel very good about the process in which we are on. I'm very optimistic of what's in front of us. We continue to use the same process. First, start with our strategy. Our strategy has been to expand in these nice profitable growing areas like dewatering and analytics. We will see that continuing to play out. We'll continue to use our demonstrated process that we have and make sure that we're managing and integrating and getting the value out of the acquisitions that we've executed so far. So I see it as a ripe pipeline and an opportunity in front of us to continue to expand.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Connors with Janney Montgomery Scott.","Ryan M. Connors - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","I apologize if this has already been covered, we've been kind of shuttling between calls with Sandy-related conference call delays here. But pricing, I wonder if you could just talk a little bit about your strategic pricing initiative and the goals you've laid out for us there and how you believe the current environment and the book-to-bill kind of headwind you talked about, Gretchen, and how that impacts your short-term ability to meet the sort of guidance you've given us on pricing, annualized, through strategic pricing. And then just longer-term, update us on what kind of contribution you think pricing can make to the top line.","Gretchen W. McClain","Yes. As we've talked about, we've said pricing, we'd like to be able to get 1 to 2 points from pricing each year. Our whole commercial excellence activity has really driven our whole strategy, our strategic pricing thought process and the actions that we're driving throughout the organization in a very positive way. As I mentioned, in third quarter, we've had 1.5% price after the first half of the year being 1.7%. Now we're going into the fourth quarter. It's going to trend downwards. We're wrapping around from some of the price actions we got from last year and we're also in a tough environment in terms of competitive nature with the low growth markets that we're living in. But that's not going to get -- make us step back. We believe we've got strong products, we've got a strong understanding of where we play. We've got a good discipline. We continue to look at our losses and our wins and readjust appropriately. So we think we've got the right position to go after price in the right strategic differentiated areas. In other areas where it make sense, we'll aggressively play so that we can make sure we don't lose market share.","Michael T. Speetzen","Ryan, I'd add to what Gretchen said in the sense of the mechanics. One of the things we're doing is making sure that as we see price increases on the back end of the business, as I commented about the value gap, that those are being built into the pricing model. But I'd also point out, this pricing initiative is not a broad initiative in terms of the way we apply it. It's very targeted in terms of end markets and products. And it helps that we have such a healthy pipeline of new products, that gives us the ability to differentiate and get improved pricing in the marketplace. So I think Gretchen's absolutely right. We're going to continue to see headwinds given the economic environment, but we're pretty confident that we've got a good process in place to maximize our potential.","Ryan M. Connors - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Great. And then just a kind of follow-on to that, I mean, one of the things we've been trying to figure out is whether there's been a change -- a sort of sea change in the public utility channel, in particular in terms of resistance to price increases and how hard utilities are sort of driving a bargain on pricing just given all that they've gone through from a financial standpoint the last couple of years. Any color you can provide on that would be helpful. I mean, do you sense any difference today versus 2 years ago? Even for your customers that are spending, do they have a more -- are they more sort of aggressive at the bargaining table than they used to be?","Gretchen W. McClain","So let me address it from this perspective. I mean, we're seeing price in both our Water Infrastructure and our Applied Water. So we're seeing it both in the public utilities, as well as across our end markets. Your question around public utilities, and there's no question, they're challenged for -- to be able to do all the projects they want to do. Now the one thing is, their budget continues -- because tariffs still continue to go up, but they are -- the real strategy here in my mind is helping them understand how we can help them reduce their operating costs. That allows them to ultimately spend less in their maintenance and operations and be able to free up money to be able to put on their capital expenditures. So if you have the dialogue, you can demonstrate it in terms of the energy efficiency, cost of ownership. They're inclined to go after quality reliable parts because they're talking about water and wastewater that's critical for all of our health.","Ryan M. Connors - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","And then just a follow-up, lastly, to a prior question there on the M&A environment, there's been a lot of talk about the tax changes at the beginning of 2013 and how that's driving some smaller business owners to actually seek an exit prior to that. Is there any -- do you believe that could drive some deal activity for you all in the near term and then maybe a little bit of a fall-off in the first half of next year?","Gretchen W. McClain","No, I wouldn't say that. I mean, when you look at our pipeline and what we're cultivating and working on, it's not driven by the need to tell a company because of tax reasons. It varies depending upon what the candidate is doing, if they need more investment in terms of their business, ultimately if they want, and they don't have something, a successor, to hand the business off to. Whether they'd like to be part of a bigger business that's focused around water, that has played to our advantage. So I wouldn't say it's the tax issue and things will fall off after next year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Halloran with Robert W. Baird.","Michael Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","So orders were a little tougher in the quarter, but you talked encouragingly about bid activity improving sequentially here. Could you talk about the composition of that bid activity and if there's any inflection one way or another that's different from the broader trends you're seeing on the underlying order rates? In other words, any pockets where you're starting to see things get a little bit better from a quoting activity, but aren't seeing in your core numbers at this point?","Gretchen W. McClain","Right now, I'd say the bidding activity across most of our end markets, both industrial and the public utilities, are probably the largest area. Industrial is encouraging to us. Again, we've not seen the release of it, but I'm encouraged when you think about where we played in our treatment business to be able to expand more in the industrial side. Our teams are going after a number of activities and I do believe they're going to break loose. It's just a matter of when.","Michael Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And then on the restructuring side of things, other than the ongoing initiatives you have in place to meet those long-term targets and just specifically focusing on some of the actions you're taking to respond to the shorter-term environment, any way to delineate, at least qualitatively, how much of that's more permanent in nature and how much of it is just the desire to flex up or to flex down to meet the demand levels?","Michael T. Speetzen","Mike, I guess the way I'd answer that question is the restructuring, that $20 million that we're executing this year, the majority of that is permanent in nature. So we're taking the opportunity given the fact that we have a view that Europe's going to be a challenging market for the foreseeable future, that we'll be looking at restructure. You can see it in the payback, quite frankly, in terms of the payback being around 2 years, that we're taking some more difficult cuts that are going to position the business better for the long term and are more sustained in nature.","Gretchen W. McClain","I would just add, when we think of Europe, and that's where the focus has been around, the restructuring, is really aligning ourselves as one Xylem team. I mean, we take -- we go to market in very different ways today. We have the opportunity to leverage our portfolio to position ourselves even more effectively with our customers. And so part of what we're doing is helping us get to our long-term strategies.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thielman and with D. A. Davidson.","Brent Thielman - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","It sounds like you've obviously talked about some continued order delays in treatment though the pipeline is getting larger. Are these projects in any specific region? And then it sounds like the private industrial treatment jobs are moving a little faster than the public utilities side. Did those jobs offer the same opportunities to leverage sort of other products in your portfolio as you'd see on the public utility side?","Gretchen W. McClain","Yes, so let me just talk about the orders and so forth. I mean, geographically, U.S., there's a lot of bid activity. The emerging markets, there's significant activity. Europe's a little weaker from an activity base and that kind of plays with the economics we're seeing. I'd say a lot more of the projects are smaller in nature as they are compared to large in nature. And today, when we look at large projects, we look at the full capability of our portfolio and how we can bring that together where it makes sense.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Jim Krapfel with Morningstar.","James Krapfel - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","What kind of returns on invested capital are you expecting out of your YSI and MJK acquisitions? And how have the acquisitions tracked relative to your original expectations?","Michael T. Speetzen","Yes, Jim, we're actually going to spend some time in our Investor Day talking through the performance of the acquisitions, because it's an important part of the story that we have. But the criteria that we set out in clearly, YSI and the other acquisitions falling through, is we look for returns in the midteens. The way I would characterize the series of acquisitions that we've done, Godwin, Nova and a string of analytics deals, is they are outperforming our models despite the economic environment. And the reason that we do that is when we go through justifying the acquisition, we obviously don't load in all the expected synergies and then we obviously put more aggressive targets inside the business to ensure that we drive the growth. As we've talked in the past, we've got a pretty robust integration model where we're measuring the business against those original plans, meeting with a business in the initial 30, 60 and 90 days of the integration to make sure that gets integrated well and then doing periodic check-ins after that. So I would answer the question broadly, that they're performing better and we intend to get into that in a little bit more detail when we have our Investor Day next year.","Gretchen W. McClain","And I'd say in both our dewatering and our analytics business, they're now becoming a large platform in which not only can we do -- continue to expand with acquisitions to expand them, but we also now have a core competence level to do organic growth. And so you've got the benefits of both.","James Krapfel - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay, and you mentioned that your acquisition pipeline is still pretty strong. Are you seeing anything to the size of what you did with the YSI?","Gretchen W. McClain","Our approach has been a bolt-on strategy. But in our pipeline, we look at all sizes, all shapes and all regions. We'll continue to look at it from a strategic perspective and how that can help us accelerate our strategic vision. So again, mostly, a bolt-on strategy, but we don't preclude looking at larger acquisitions as well.","Operator","That was our final question and I'd now like to turn the floor back over to Gretchen for any closing remarks.","Gretchen W. McClain","Yes, I'd just like to say thank you for your interest and your time this morning and really sharing our first year anniversary with us. As I mentioned, the business operations will continue to improve even with the lower anticipated revenues. We're aggressively positioning Xylem for the future with immediate [ph] actions that we've talked about this morning. And while we do that, we remain, of course, very focused on good earnings and solid cash flow. So again, thank you for your time. We appreciate your interest.","Operator","Thank you.

We've positioned Xylem to perform at a higher level. Just as we saw orders and execution in the third quarter, I believe our fourth quarter was a continuation of that trend. We're proud to report that even in a less-than-robust market environment, we achieved record revenue, our first $1 billion quarter.","Overall, revenue increased 7%, with the core up 5% over the prior year. We booked orders of $986 million, up 6% overall and up 5% organically over 2012. Although the market conditions were slightly more positive, our teams stepped up to the challenge and delivered another solid quarter of revenue growth.","We also achieved operational improvements, resulting in $145 million of operating income, which was a 12% increase over the prior year. Operating margin of 14% was up 60 basis points over the prior year and up 50 basis points from the third quarter. Our renewed focus on business accountability and cost actions also had a positive effect, and you can see that in our incremental margin drop of 38%, excluding FX and acquisitions.","Generally, we continue to see some market stabilization, and we've seen minor signs of improvement, including a slightly brighter outlook for industrial and public utility. But we continue to be cautious about these markets and expect, at best, slow overall market growth, but at least we see it trending in the right direction.","The bottom line, we achieved 19% earnings per share growth over the prior year and a 14% improvement on a sequential basis over the third quarter. So as you think back over the full year, revenues were relatively flat, up just about 1%, coupled with an 8% operating income decline and margins down 110 basis points. In retrospect, there's no question that we had some tough market conditions coupled with some execution issues, but we feel like our second half performance is more representative of a proper trajectory, building a solid base to begin 2014.","For the full year, we also generated free cash flow of $198 million, a bit disappointing on the conversion, but that was mostly a buildup of working capital due to unforeseen sales declines. And this year, as you will imagine, we have put aggressive recovery plans in place to address this issue.","In addition to our solid operating results, we also executed several important milestones last year. We put a new operating model in place, one that emphasizes speed, accountability and simplicity and enables the entire organization to drive for higher performance. Every growth center and region contributed significantly to our overall performance, and each plans to accelerate their performance this year. We've worked to aggressively take cost out of the business, and this will continue.","During the fourth quarter, we continued our disciplined capital deployment with another $25 million in share repurchases, matching our third quarter investment and increasing our total return of capital to shareholders by 83%, including dividends. And as you saw, we're increasing this amount again in 2014.","Throughout the year, we continued to increase organic growth investments. These investments brought forth a number of new products, particularly in the areas of energy-efficient pumps, like the new Goulds Water Technology industrial pumps and the Bell & Gossett e-1510 and ecocirc HVAC pumps we just launched a few weeks ago. These are substantial additions to our portfolio and precisely what our customers are seeking: smarter solutions to their most critical water issues. The achievements at London's Heathrow Airport, where our Flygt pump systems cut the airport's wastewater pumping energy use by 50%, demonstrates the meaningful results we're providing our customers. And another example was our $2.7 million win to supply high-technology equipment for a New Jersey storm water drainage system after Superstorm Sandy. These are just a number of examples of the size and impacts of the wins that we are achieving.","I remain confident in the potential of this company. We've got a strong and comprehensive portfolio to meet compelling market fundamentals around water, and our product brands are the most respected in the industry. I'm very pleased with our team's second half response to the first half challenges, and I expect our businesses to continue this execution and performance as we move forward into 2014.","And now let me turn it over to Mike Speetzen to review the balance of our performance in Q4.","Michael T. Speetzen","Thanks, Steve. Please go to Slide 4. We generated revenues in excess of $1 billion, up 7% from the prior year, primarily driven by 5% organic growth and additional 2% from acquisitions. It's worth noting that we are comparing to a prior year fourth quarter where we experienced negative growth. Industrial and public utility end markets showed strength relative to poor performance last year.","We have seen the positive effects of rebounding industrial production in the U.S. and Europe, and we see public utility markets stabilizing, with customers focused on OpEx and small project activities, but we have not seen a meaningful recovery in larger CapEx projects. The commercial end market was down 5%, driven by a tough compare to the prior year, where we first saw the channel start to restock product and we had some benefit from Super Storm Sandy.","I'll cover up more specifics by segment, but generally speaking, we saw growth across our key geographic regions, up mid single digits in both the U.S. and Europe, and continue to see growth in emerging markets, driven by timing of project business.","Turning to operating income, we delivered strong operational performance. Operating income of $145 million was up $15 million or 12% over last year, and margins reached 14%. Operating margins increased 60 basis points despite headwind from foreign exchange, continued price erosion and acquisitions which are in their early stages of integration and slightly dilutive to margins. These headwinds were more than offset by strong incremental margins, coupled with the favorable impact of cost actions initiated in 2012 and early 2013. Core incremental margins were approximately 38% after excluding the impact of foreign exchange and acquisitions, strong performance considering this includes absorbing the impacts of setting up our European headquarters and remaining onetime spin-related costs.","Price pressure has become a bigger challenge, and in the quarter, it was a 40 basis point headwind against the overall operating margin improvement. Offsetting the price pressure were cost-reduction activities, which drove 410 basis points of margin improvement, including $11 million of restructuring savings from actions executed in 2012 and 2013. Inflation had a 210 basis point negative impact on operating margin. In summary, operating margins increased 60 basis points over the prior year.","EPS expanded 19% to $0.56, exceeding our guidance midpoint of $0.51 and the high end of our range of $0.53. Favorability was primarily driven by volume and additional productivity savings from lean activities. Core operations drove strong operating margin improvement, contributing $0.09, driven primarily by organic volume growth combined with execution on productivity and cost management. Included in this performance was restructuring savings of $0.05. Our European realignment actions, including sustainable tax benefits, provided an additional $0.01 benefit in the quarter. I should note these benefits more than offset a $0.04 unfavorable impact of price and mix in the quarter.","Now let me provide more detail on each of our reporting segments. Please turn to Slide 5. Water Infrastructure reported revenue of $691 million, up 8% over the prior year and up 6% organically. Acquisitions contributed 2 points to top line growth. Transport grew 9%, test was up 3% and revenue from treatment applications were flat year-over-year. Regionally, we saw growth across key regions like the U.S. and Europe, which were up 10% and 5%, respectively, and emerging markets were up 6%.","I would summarize our revenue performance as follows. Growth was driven by strength in industrial applications, including water and wastewater transport and dewatering, the latter up slightly despite continued headwinds from a challenged mining market and a tough prior year compare resulting from Super Storm Sandy. Supporting this growth, we generally saw improved market conditions in Europe and the U.S. and increased project activity in emerging markets, such as Latin America and Asia-Pacific.","I would also add that our focus on growing our industrial market share is also gaining traction. For example, as part of our Sustainable Water Infrastructure initiative, we focus on packaging products from across the Xylem portfolio and promoting automated systems and services for the aquaculture market. By presenting Xylem's full portfolio of solutions to customers, we're accelerating our growth in this market. For example, we landed a $1.4 million order that included both Flygt pumps and WEDECO UV and ozone systems.","In addition to industrial growth, we also saw strong performance from our water and wastewater transport business. Specifically, we saw our flagship brand, Flygt, drive double-digit growth in the U.S. and mid single-digit growth in Europe. Test applications were up 3%, driven by strength in Europe, specifically growth in Germany and neighboring countries.","And lastly, I would highlight that the year-over-year treatment revenues were flat, following 4 consecutive quarters of being down. The reality of this long-cycle business is that capital projects have declined due to the recession. While today, confidence appears to be building, we expect to continue to face some headwinds into 2014. I'll address this in more detail later in the call.","Operating margin contracted 30 basis points from 16.5% to 16.2%. Margin performance was impacted by foreign exchange as we saw the euro strengthen against the U.S. dollar, and we experienced continued price erosion given overcapacity in the market and a highly competitive environment. Our overall performance was also impacted by increased investment in growth initiatives and higher costs associated with the relatively new European organization.","Let me now turn to Slide #6 and talk through our Applied Water segment. Revenue was up 3% overall, with organic growth at 2%. It's worth noting that this performance is against a strong comp in the fourth quarter of last year, where we posted 4% organic. As you can see, industrial water applications grew 8%. Irrigation, while relatively small, was up 14%, and building service applications declined 4% year-over-year on a tough compare. Regionally, we saw growth across key regions like the U.S. and Europe, which were up 2% and 4%, respectively, and emerging markets were up 1%.","I would summarize our revenue performance as follows. Growth was driven primarily by project strength for industrial water applications in Europe and Asia-Pacific regions. Specifically, we delivered on several northern European projects, including strong multistage pump sales, and we continue to see increased demand for industrial fire pump systems in China.","While we saw double-digit growth in the U.S. residential applications, global residential and commercial end markets continue to exhibit volatility and weakness, particularly in Southern Europe. Our U.S. commercial business was down year-over-year on a tough compare, and as you may recall, Superstorm Sandy drove an increase in shipments last year. Currently, we see a commercial channel that has restocked inventory levels in advance of a market recovery. However, we see the timing of this recovery as uncertain.","Operating margin expanded a healthy 120 basis points from 11.6% to 12.8% year-over-year. Margin improvement was driven by volume leverage coupled with the favorable impact of cost-reduction initiatives. Although price was positive, we have continued to see a downward pressure given current market conditions.","Now let me turn to Slide 7 and review our full year performance. Orders for 2013 were over $3.9 billion, representing total growth of 3% over the prior year, up 1% organically. Orders slightly outpaced shipments, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.02. We ended 2013 with $697 million of backlog shippable in 2014, up 16% versus where we were last year and a solid indicator of an improving market.","For the full year, revenues came in slightly above $3.8 billion, up 1% versus 2012, including 2 points from acquisitions. As Steve mentioned, we faced significant market headwinds in the first half of the year, and despite posting organic growth in the third and fourth quarters, full year organic revenue declined by 1%.","From an end market perspective, we saw the largest revenue declines in our 2 largest markets, industrial and public utility, down 2% and 1%, respectively. First half revenue was down 7% in both those markets. We saw growth accelerate to 4% for both in the second half. Since they represent approximately 80% of total revenue, we are cautiously optimistic as we look forward into 2014. We saw revenues flat in commercial and down overall in residential, driven primarily by weakness in Europe, which was down double digits in these markets. In the U.S., we posted 6% growth in residential.","On the commercial side, full year revenues were down 1% as weakness in large institutional building projects were only partially offset by revenues from new products and restocking activities. On a full year basis, revenues in the agriculture market have grown 8%, another strong year for this niche business. Overall, on a regional basis, the U.S. and emerging markets were flat year-over-year and Europe was down 2%.","Operating income decreased 8% in 2013. Full year operating margins came in at 11.8%, down 110 basis points. Second half leverage on revenue growth, coupled with cost-reduction execution, partially offset first half margin declines, which were heavily impacted by our first half organic revenue decline of 5%, and is a nice setup of the European headquarters. I would note that European realignment we started in the first quarter resulted in a pickup of $0.04 of EPS after absorbing the additional European headquarter costs and lowered our tax rate 300 basis points to 21%.","The last point, and it's an important one as we look out into the first quarter, is that price drove margins favorably by only 10 basis points, approximately 90 basis points short of what we thought coming into the year. While price was positive for the company as a whole, we saw the overall contribution decline through the first half and turn negative in the second half. We expect that overcapacity in the market will drive very competitive dynamics and that pricing will remain challenged.","To wrap up on 2013, I'll make one final point. The results for the full year do not reflect the drastic dynamics between the first and second half of the year. You can see from the fourth quarter, we have gained traction on the top line and have continued to drive significant cost reductions in the business to impact the bottom line. Our efforts and recent performance provide for a solid base to drive growth from and continue to improve operational performance.","Turning to Slide 8, I'll cover the company's financial position as of year end. Xylem maintains a strong cash position with a balance of $533 million at year end, with approximately 80% held outside of the U.S., consistent with our geographic business mix. Our net debt-to-net capital ratio is a healthy 24%, and our commercial paper and revolving credit facilities remain in place and continue to be unutilized.","We remain committed to our balanced capital deployment strategy, which is to maintain and grow the business while enhancing shareholder returns through dividends and share repurchases. We have invested $207 million in acquisitions and CapEx, and we have returned $154 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, which is up substantially from $84 million in 2012. Key drivers were a 15% increase in dividends announced earlier this year and the ramp-up of share repurchase activity, which we continued through the end of the year, spending an additional $25 million in the fourth quarter, bringing repurchases to a total of $67 million.","Free cash flow was $198 million. The decline in free cash flow versus 2012 was driven by lower growth, unfavorable working capital and higher restructuring payments. As a percentage of revenue, operating working capital increased 170 basis points, driven by timing of customer collections given linearity of sales and slightly elongated customer payment patterns, as well as an inventory buildup to support shorter order lead times. I will note that we have not experienced any significant bad debts associated with these lengthened payment durations. While we are not pleased with our working capital performance, fourth quarter reflects an improved trend, returning to below Q2 levels, and we remain committed to further improve our performance in this area.","Before we turn to the guidance details, let me turn the call back over to Steve to provide you with the framework we're working with in 2014. Steve?","Steven R. Loranger","Yes, thank you, Mike. Let me start by saying that we are beginning 2014 well positioned to accelerate our performance. As Mike mentioned, some of the 2013 headwinds have dissipated a bit, and we are entering 2014 with encouraging signs for more consistency in top line growth. We also expect to deliver improved operating performance across all of our businesses, positioning ourself for strong earnings growth.","Let me highlight our top strategic initiatives for 2014. First, we're going to build our business execution. We will deliver on our 2014 targets, and we're going to be using a robust management process to accomplish that. We expect to deliver revenue growth in the range of 2% to 4% while improving operating margins between 12.6% and 13.2%. And at the bottom line, EPS will be in the range of $1.85 to $2, up 11% to 20%.","Free cash flow conversion will be 100%, along with a nice improvement in ROIC. These are aggressive but achievable goals, which will -- which we're going to meet by strengthening our sales capabilities and increasing our operating efficiency. To help us achieve our #1 priority, first, we're going to look to accelerate growth by optimizing our integrated front-end strategy. This entails leadership appointments, new customer relationship technology, digital marketing, more robust sales force metrics and aligned compensation plans.","Second, to improve our productivity, we are reinvigorating our Lean Six Sigma capabilities and creating a new global strategic sourcing organization. Lean Six Sigma already contributes several million dollars annually to our bottom line results, and we are actively extending its impact. Likewise, we're rolling out a new global strategic sourcing organization with a single leader. This is going to supercharge our already strong sourcing capabilities, with the goal of doubling our net productivity in 2014.","Next, we're going to be focused on capital deployment, including rebalancing our portfolio and investment decisions. We're going to provide advanced technology equipment and solutions to resolve our customers' most critical water challenges. And finally, as I mentioned, we are institutionalizing the Xylem management system, which synchronizes our key business processes in an accountable way. Those of you that know me know how much I believe in a disciplined management process, and this is a vital need at Xylem. This is going to help us translate strategy to execution with linked, standardized processes, all aligned to execute our vision.","So that's the set of our priorities for 2014 and our top level targets. Let me turn it back over to Mike to go over the details of our 2014 plan.","Michael T. Speetzen","Thanks, Steve. Turn to Slide 10. We anticipate 2014 revenues of approximately $4 billion, which reflects total growth of 2% to 4% and organic growth in the range of 1% to 3%. For Water Infrastructure, we expect revenues of approximately $2.5 billion, reflecting total growth of 2% to 3%. And for Applied Water, we expect revenues of approximately $1.5 billion, reflecting total growth of 2% to 3% and organic growth of 1% to 2%, with a 1-point benefit from foreign exchange.","Segment margins are anticipated to be in the range of 14.1% to 14.6%, and operating margins are projected to be in the range of 12.6% to 13.2%. At the bottom line, we anticipate earnings per share of $1.85 to $2, excluding 2014 restructuring and realignment costs of approximately $40 million to $50 million. Of the $40 million to $50 million, we plan to execute restructuring actions with costs ranging $30 million to $35 million, with an expected payback of approximately 1 year.","We expect approximately $10 million of savings to be realized in 2014 from these actions. This is in addition to the carryover savings of $25 million from the actions executed in 2013. If you'll recall, we originally expected $15 million of carryover savings in 2014. The increase reflects accelerated savings and should provide a higher degree of confidence in our expected 2014 performance.","Our operating tax rate is expected to be 21%, and fully diluted share count is expected to be approximately $185 million, which takes into account expected share repurchases of approximately $130 million in 2014.","Please turn to Slide 11. This slide summarizes our expected 2014 organic revenue performance by end market. Beginning with industrial, our largest end market, representing 43% of total revenues, we expect low single-digit organic growth. In the U.S., the industrial market continues to slowly recover and market reports suggest that demand conditions are generally improving, whereas in Europe, macro indicators suggest that the market may be near the bottom and sentiment is cautiously optimistic. However, partially offsetting growth in these regions is continued weak global mining market conditions. And while our business is sensitive to these market conditions, we believe we have the opportunity to increase our market share through new product introductions and a broad portfolio of technologies which can be further levered into providing a complete industrial solution to customers.","Public Utility, at 35% of total revenues, is our second-largest market and is expected to grow in the range of 1% to 3%. We continue to expect stability in required operations and maintenance activities, as spend is largely nondiscretionary and funded by tariffs to end users. As we've discussed during previous quarters, the portion of public utility revenue that is derived from CapEx project spending continues to be constrained by project delays and funding constraints.","In the U.S., we expect to see intense price competition and funding concerns to continue, thus having a more pronounced effect on our long-cycle treatment business. Given the longer lead times for treatment projects, our forecast does not reflect any recovery in 2014. We could see market conditions improve through the year, resulting in higher bookings which could lead to a better setup for 2015.","In Europe, continued strength in the Nordic region and a promising outlook for Eastern Europe is partially offset by the expected slowdown in the U.K. as a result of the end of the AMP5 cycle.","We expect building service applications in the commercial and residential markets to be up low single digits in 2014. While we sell to a wide range of customers, our largest commercial building concentration is in the institutional market, hospitals and schools, which have continued to struggle with spending pressures.","In the U.S., leading indicators have been mixed, and while there remains a potential for growth acceleration, our order bookings have continued to be sluggish. In Europe, we generally anticipate a slow recovery in the construction markets. Residential markets support low-single-digit growth as strength in the U.S. market is partially offset by continued weakness in Europe.","And agriculture remains a small market for us, and revenues are likely to be flat to up slightly given the benefit we received from drought conditions in the U.S. in 2012 and 2013.","Taken together, the low-growth economic environment, along with the relative stability of demand for the critical types of products we sell across a variety of end markets, we expect flat to up low single-digit market growth, with Xylem in the range of up 1% to 3% organically.","Turning to Slide 12. I'd like to spend a minute calibrating everyone on the call around what we expect our revenue profile to be in 2014. While we do not provide quarterly guidance, we recognize that it is helpful to highlight irregularities to the extent reasonably possible. So as we looked over our 2014 revenue profile, we recognized that it would likely deviate from historical seasonal patterns.","As you can see from the slide, we expect first quarter revenue will be approximately 22% to 23% of our total 2014 guidance. This is approximately 1 to 2 points below prior periods but in line with what we saw in 2009 and 2010. Given the level of volume we're expecting in the first quarter, the pricing dynamics in the market today and the benefits from cost actions, we would expect operating margin to be approximately 100 basis points higher than the prior year. You can also see from the slide, we expect approximately 28% of our revenue to come in the fourth quarter at the higher end of the 26% to 29% range we experienced in the past.","Let me make a couple of points which will help you better understand this profile. First, the first quarter of 2012 stood out as an exceptionally strong contributor, driven in part by the peak of natural gas frac-ing activity for our dewatering business. Second, this year, we will wrap up our first quarter with 1 less business day, which gets picked up in the fourth quarter. I won't spend any more time on this as there are more important areas I want to cover, but I did think it would be helpful to highlight that we're expecting a slightly overweight second half, reflecting both normal seasonal patterns and a couple of specific 2014 dynamics.","Turning to Slide 13. While we don't expect flat year-over-year revenues, the chart on this slide reflects the cost profile as if we did. The purpose here is to simply illustrate some of the cost reduction impacts without the added complexity of volume in the equation. Starting on the left side of the slide with our 2013 cost base, we expect inflation from material labor and overhead, coupled with increased investments and some level of discretionary costs returning to the business, to be approximately $100 million or a 3% increase over the prior year.","More than offsetting that and driving margin improvements are targeted cost reductions of $140 million. This represents a 4% reduction to our cost base, driven by essentially 3 components. First, we expect that global sourcing and Lean Six Sigma actions will drive $100 million in savings, essentially offsetting the cost of inflation and providing for incremental investments in new product development, sales force initiatives and new information technology infrastructure.","Secondly, we expect to deliver $35 million of incremental restructuring savings in 2014. As you can see from the chart, approximately $25 million is attributable to carryover savings from our 2013 actions. Again, you should note this is $10 million higher than we had originally anticipated. In addition to the carryover savings, we expect to realize $10 million of restructuring savings attributable to new 2014 restructuring actions, most of which are planned over the first half of the year, with related savings kicking in, in the second half of 2014. Finally, we incurred $4 million of onetime spin costs in 2013, and we do not expect these costs to recur in 2014 and, therefore, will also drive year-over-year savings.","Turning to Slide 14. We have a fair amount of information laid out here, so I'm only going to highlight a few key points and then turn the call back over to Steve. Let me begin by first summarizing our top 2014 capital deployment plans. Our first priority remains organic investment as this is the highest-returning investment we can make. To this end, we see investing $110 million to $120 million in CapEx, which represents 3% of revenue; approximately 3% of revenue into R&D; and approximately $40 million to $50 million into restructuring realignment to enhance our competitive position.","Second, we plan to enhance shareholder returns by an expected 10% annual dividend increase and approximately $130 million from our share repurchase programs. Lastly, inorganic growth remains a key element of our long-term strategy. We expect to continue to cultivate and potentially acquire bolt-on acquisitions later this year.","Free cash flow conversion is forecasted to be in the range of $310 million to $345 million in 2014, up in the range of 57% to 74% year-over-year and 100% of expected GAAP net income. The year-over-year increase is driven by higher income, working capital improvements and overall lower CapEx spend.","To wrap up, I would highlight that we're targeting a 100 basis point improvement in our return on invested capital, up to approximately 11% by year end.","With that said, let me turn to Slide 15 and turn the call back over to Steve.","Steven R. Loranger","Yes, thanks again, Mike. Just to wrap this up before questions, we clearly delivered a solid fourth quarter and a very strong finish to the year. But more importantly, I'm really pleased with the direction that Xylem is headed. Building on long-term market fundamentals and aiming for the best possible business performance, we're acting on several fronts to advance our ability to execute as a high-performing organization. I've been here now for just under 5 months, and I really am pleased with our top leadership team and the trajectory that we're on.","To be sure, we do have plenty of operational challenges ahead of us, coupled with improving but still overall slow markets. What I'm really excited about is our collective leadership attitude and ambition. Our sales people want to win, and they want to satisfy customers. Our growth center leaders want to lean out the efficiency of their operation and get our SG&A and material costs where they need to be so that we can afford the vital investments for our future. Our teams accept the execution challenges of the past year and using this as a basis to springboard our competitiveness.","So given this, as Mike outlined on Charts 11, 12 and 13, we have constructed for you an appropriate advance in our operating metrics for 2014 with measured and balanced execution conservatism. This gives us great confidence as we internally aspire to even higher performance. We have a new operating model with terrific leadership at the top, fueled to drive organizational speed, simplicity and accountability.","We are building our sales and marketing capability to better leverage our leading brands and technology. Our investments in digital capability and product technology have been increased for 2014, a very positive reward for our teams as they eliminate unnecessary overheads. I'm quite encouraged by where we are. It's true, I do toss and turn at night given the execution challenges ahead of us, but I have the confidence that our global team is aligned and aspiring to achieve our vision.","I'd like to now ask our operator to turn it over to the folks on the call for any questions that may be on your mind.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Scott Davis of Barclays.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Steve, you mentioned, several occasions, price in somewhat negative context, and you did last quarter as well. But do you have a sense of prices getting -- can you give us a sense whether price is getting incrementally worse, or do you see things kind of flatlining here?","Steven R. Loranger","Yes, Scott. If anything, it's probably more in the flat line. The issue is the entire industry is slightly overcapacity, as you know, and so all the competitors are duking it out on an incremental basis. And so while we do have a number of -- while we have already executed a number of price increases on the catalog basis, these get competed pretty intensely. And as a consequence, we're not realizing as much price as we'd like to the bottom line. So I would call it more or less flat at this situation. It is obviously a concern, but it's one that we're shoring up with our material cost takeout to make sure we balance our operating margin.","Michael T. Speetzen","Scott, I think we're -- Scott, we're trying to be conservative in the view we have for next year, so we planned for it being down about 0.5 point. Obviously, internally, we're driving higher expectations for that. And the other thing I'd add is, one other headwind relative to pricing is we have seen inflation come down, which is a good thing. We had been averaging just over 3% in the prior years, and this past year, we've gotten down to just over 2%. And we're anticipating core inflation in the business in that same area as well.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, that's really helpful. And then you guys talked -- you spent more time this quarter also talking about cash reinvestment, buybacks and M&A. And I mean, this has always been a tough industry to do deals. There's just not a lot of great assets that are available out there. I mean, what gives you the confidence that there are deals to do? And I guess the natural side part of this question is, would you consider going outside of water to other flow-type businesses?","Steven R. Loranger","So let me take a shot at that. Remember that the water industry is highly fragmented, and so there are opportunities. And while we have taken a respite, as we mentioned, to make sure that we get back into a solid operating rhythm, we have kept our pipeline open. And I wouldn't conclude that you can't do deals right now, although we have taken a bit of a rest. With respect to outside of water, I would say not as a strategy. I mean, clearly, we have the ability, because of the breadth of our technology and the capability of our selling marketing distribution, is to be a very, very strong provider of this technology that resolve customers' water challenges. The water market is sufficiently large to play in, and it's fragmented, and it's equally as profitable as other industrial segments. So because we are a pure-play water company, we feel very committed to continue to drive water solutions to our customer needs. In order to do that, we're going to have to do some of the things I mentioned, which is strengthen the distribution and marketing organization so we can flow more product through the front end, continue to invest in innovation and to rebalance into probably the most attractive segment of water, which is really the industrial and the international side. So Scott, we want to stay in water. We're extremely well positioned there, and it's what we do, and we think we can do it well to achieve our vision.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Deane Dray of Citi Research.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I do have some questions on the guidance, but the first topic is a bit more sensitive for you, Steve. And you're now in this interim role for 5 months, and from our perspective, that process, the search has taken a bit longer. But if you listen to everything on the call and the outlook for 2014, you certainly don't sound like an interim CEO at all, and this is the Steve Loranger we knew of old, managing with intensity. So it begs the question whether the board might be considering you as, let's call it, the medium-term solution for Xylem, and how should we be thinking about that?","Steven R. Loranger","Yes, thanks, Dean. I appreciate the view on my attitude, and you've got it exactly right. I only know one speed, and that's full speed ahead. And whether I'm here a day or much, much longer, I'm going to be doing my very best to provide leadership and direction for the company on the basis of creating long-term value. So that's my approach. The CEO search is underway. We have -- we're probably at a point where I would say we are just concluding the Phase 1, which is the broader interview of a number of terrific and qualified candidates. And as we turn into our first quarter, the board certainly wants to focus and narrow and definitize the search down to a couple of qualified candidates. So the search is well underway. There's nothing really to report. The good news is that I am here, serving at the board's pleasure as long as it takes. And I have also committed to the board to provide whatever appropriate or needed transitional leadership in such a fashion. But I really can't be any more specific than that. That simply is where we are, and in the meantime, I've got my head down with the team to focus on executing this long-term strategy.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Great. And then for the guidance, 2 of the metrics you've provided that -- if I could get some more color on, is the $100 million in sourcing savings as well as the $35 million restructuring savings. And maybe share with us what sort of upside there are to those numbers, your confidence. You've got every project identified. Is there an internal stretch goal? And maybe just walk us through those, please.","Michael T. Speetzen","Yes, so Dean, let me start, and then Steve can add any color. On the core sourcing and Lean Six Sigma savings of $100 million, that's pretty consistent with what we have executed in the past. We've looked over the past several years, and our teams have been pretty effective at going out and doing everything they can to essentially offset inflation and provide some room for reinvesting in the company. On the restructuring, $25 million of that, you can count on, is hard savings in the sense that we locked it in by executing more aggressively in the fourth quarter than we had originally provided externally to get a jump-start on 2014. And then the additional $10 million that we're counting on from restructuring, we've got a high degree of confidence. We've got the areas identified. We have dampened the number a bit for any potential slide in execution timing, but it feels good from our perspective. We are driving more aggressive plans internally. I mean, I think a safe way to think about it is we aren't counting on the revenue growth to get us home in terms of making the EPS range that we've put out there. Similar to what we did in the latter part of 2013, we are driving internal assurance plans that are more aggressive from a cost perspective. And we feel we've got a good line of sight and a good trajectory on them and, at this stage, feel very good about what we've got lined up in terms of cost reduction.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So are there internal stretch goals higher for both of those 2 metrics?","Steven R. Loranger","Yes, Dean, of course there are. And these stretch goals are hardwired into our growth center plans, so the teams actually are working to numbers that are higher. The challenge is obviously bringing the ball home to score. You mentioned projects. Take the sourcing, for example. We have identified the areas of all $100 million, but I would say, safely, probably only 70% or 80% of that $100 million is detailed in terms of clear execution plans. That's where businesses normally are at this time in the year, but at the end of the day, I think it outlines the point that there's a bit of execution ahead of us. So I'm not concerned at all about whether or not the opportunity is there, but my interest and our -- is to make sure that we stay very, very focused on the execution. And yes, as you would expect, our internal plans that the teams have committed provide some conservatism.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Halloran of Robert W. Baird.","Michael Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I just want to ask a couple of questions -- well, a question on the dewatering side of the platform. If you strip out the mining side of that, what do the core trends look like there? And then also, specifically, how is the rental component of that business tracking here?","Michael T. Speetzen","Yes, Mike, it's -- if you pull out mining, I would characterize it as improving. We certainly, coming out of the 2011, 2012 timeframe, the natural gas frac-ing bubble that essentially created a bit of a distortion there, I'd say we're returning back to more normal patterns. We've seen a little bit of an uptick here and there from construction. Public utility seems like it's relatively stable. At this stage, the only area we've seen any downward movement in is primarily around the mining segment. So we're not anticipating dewatering accelerating at rates that we saw back in 2011. I think the nature of the frac-ing industry has changed in terms of the way they look for water services, and so we see a little bit more moderated growth trend there. But all the other indicators look promising at this stage.","Michael Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And then on the commercial construction side, maybe you could frame the commentary from the folks you're selling to here, what they're seeing when they're starting to stack a little inventory, as well as maybe, when you're looking through the year here, where is the incremental caution coming, from your perspective, on the timing of the recovery? And what are some of the things you're seeing out there?","Michael T. Speetzen","Yes, so I think, one, the caution is we've seen this game play before. Two, I think when we look at the commercial market and where we're exposed in terms of the institutional, I mean, we sell into all the different markets, but institutional, we're a little bit more overweight to. We really haven't seen much move in terms of project orders. I think the channel is encouraged because they are seeing more design activity being done, more quotation activity being put into the marketplace, so they've obviously moved forward and taken a position on that. We are just being cautious, with a low single-digit growth expectation, that, that market could be a little bit slower to ramp up. And certainly, some of the trends coming out at the end of 2013, with the Architectural Billing Index coming down a couple of months in a row, and just some of the external commentary says that there is still enough apprehension around the market that counting on it being at a high rate of growth is probably not the right thing to do right now.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Summerville of KeyBanc.","Matt J. Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions. First, can you just provide a little more specificity around the $40 million to $50 million in restructuring spend for '14? In the slides, you talked about, over the course of '12 and '13, there was a rift of about 8%. You closed 24 facilities. What's sort of this next wave entail, if you will, and will this be the conclusion of it in '14?","Michael T. Speetzen","Yes, so I think our expectation, Matt, is that we will substantially get through the majority of the work. I think if I look back a couple of years ago, we were expecting a market that was going to grow 4% to 6%, and it's actually contracted. And so we've been very aggressive about going in and really surgically addressing the cost structure. I think in light of the performance over the past couple of years and the new structure that we put in place in the latter part of 2013, we feel like these actions, which gets to that total workforce reduction, are going to essentially conclude the majority of what we would need to do. Now we're always going to be looking for opportunities to go in and surgically get at the cost base, but in terms of the large programs, I definitely think this is going to be some of the bigger areas that we'll go.","Matt J. Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And then just a follow-up question. If you look at the free cash flow improvement, from roughly $200 million to upwards of $310 million to $345 million, I think, how much of that change is coming from working capital? And I guess working capital as a percent of sales is around 24%. What should that be longer term?","Michael T. Speetzen","Yes, I mean, I think longer term, we would expect to have that, in terms of what the industry operates at, probably in the 22% range. And if you look 2 or 3 years ago, that's where we essentially were. It's been this -- really over the past year or so that we've seen the working capital bubble up a bit. So there's going to be a substantial portion of the improvement in 2014 that comes from that. We're talking about taking our working capital from just over 24% down to about 23%, and that equates for basically about $40 million, about 1 turn of revenue. We've got pretty detailed plans behind what we're doing there. Steve and I are engaging more deeply with the businesses on a monthly and quarterly basis. But we've got plans identified around the inventory side and the receivables side, and we're going after the payables side in terms of getting more robust around our supplier payment term management process. Long term, we'd like to see working capital get down into the high teens. We think that's the hallmark of a very well-run company, but we clearly have a ways to go. So right now, our sights are setting on reversing the trajectory which we saw in the fourth quarter. We saw ourselves get back down to levels that we had earlier in the year on improving revenue trends, which was a good thing. And we're going to continue to drive that into 2014.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones of Stifel.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Just starting off on the lean and sourcing side of that, you've been taking about $100 million out of that a year. You're talking about, I think, approaching that in a little different and a little more aggressive way. Can you continue to take $100 million of cost out through lean and sourcing in the medium to long term? Or have we picked some of the low-hanging fruit there and that number needs to come down over time?","Steven R. Loranger","Yes, it needs -- and obviously, the answer of that is yes. We're not at any asymptotic point on lean. The better you get, the better you can get. So clearly, there may be a point of diminishing returns at some point, but not for the near future. When you think about it, if you look at our material savings as a percent of spend, you look at our total net productivity and you look at our SG&A and even working capital, as Mike mentioned, we've got opportunity. So I would say I would love to entertain that question a couple of years from now, but for right now, I don't think that there's a limit on our opportunity. There's obviously limits on your organizational capacity to execute in a given amount of time, but if you take a look at the operating metrics we're turning in for full year '14, we've certainly got opportunity for further improvement.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I think you partially addressed it there. You're talking about a new targeted global sourcing organization. How is the talent level there? Are you able to fill everything you need internally there, or do you need to bring in some talent to round that out?","Steven R. Loranger","It's a bit of both. We've got some awfully good talent in our sourcing organization throughout the world. We will probably bring in some selective people. We've recently hired a gentleman that comes out of Mercedes-Benz and a couple of other folks that come out of the automotive industry as well. So we'll probably be selectively looking for some help on the outside. We've got a lot to work with. The biggest challenge we have is to integrate our sourcing activities so that we can take advantage of commodity purchasing and long-term contracting across the diversity of our businesses. We know the opportunity is there. We do some of that today, of course, so we've got some selected sourcing and commodity groups. We just believe we can do so much more.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. And my last question, 3% into R&D, which is, I guess, percentage-wise, a fair decline from 2013. Was 2013 overspent on growth investments, R&D investments, and 2014 is more rightsizing it? Or are you cutting back just in soft markets, and you would intend to grow that? And kind of what's the right level, long term, for the company?","Michael T. Speetzen","Yes, we're actually spending a little bit more on a dollar basis in 2014, call it $115 million versus just over $100 million in 2013. So I think more than anything, it's more a factor of the revenue growth dampening the percentage. Our plan is to continue to invest, and we're obviously doing a lot more to prioritize the investment. The area that you do see our investment coming down is around CapEx, coming down to about 3% of revenue, and that is...","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Sorry, it was CapEx that I meant.","Michael T. Speetzen","Yes, so for CapEx, CapEx is coming down. It really reflects some of the onetime items that we had to deal with in 2012 and 2013 coming out as a new company, primarily getting into a new headquarters per the spin agreement, as well as disconnecting from several systems that we were leveraging from ITT. I feel like we're through that. 3% still feels a little high to me. We're still doing a lot around our dewatering rental bank globally. And so over the next year or 2, I would anticipate it continuing to come down a bit. We're still at a positive reinvestment ratio, so we're still in a positive trajectory from that standpoint.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Konigsberg of Vertical Research.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","A couple of questions, maybe just starting with Q1 guidance. I know, Mike, you want to stay away from this a little bit. But just thinking about kind of modest organic growth in Q1, I mean, you kind of highlighted there were some tough comps from Superstorm Sandy and dewatering, and there's an extra -- or 1 less day of selling. But at the same time, I mean, you're looking at a negative comparison. I mean, you were down over 7% in Q1 of '13, and obviously, you did a good job exiting the year at fairly decent rates. I'm just curious, maybe there's some other items that you could just kind of provide color on that kind of support the notion that only 1% to 3% is where it should be.","Michael T. Speetzen","You bet. Yes, I made some comments in my prepared remarks about our ending backlog being up 16% versus where we were last year, which is certainly encouraging from a full year perspective. One stat that I didn't provide was our Q1 shippable backlog. It's essentially flat to where we were last year. And I think when you think about the overall revenue guidance, it is a bit conservative given the volatility we've seen in the market, and I think you see that playing out from quarter-to-quarter. Our January performance has essentially lined up consistent with that in terms of that flat year-over-year performance, although we are comparing against last year, which was down substantially. The initial indications for what we anticipate seeing in the first quarter are pretty consistent with some of the comments that I had made. I think it's important to also think about price as a headwind as we go into the first quarter relative to where we were in the first quarter of 2013. Despite all that, we do anticipate seeing our margins expand, and I think in my prepared remarks, I talked about margins being up around 100 basis points.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Got it. And then just secondly, just thinking about the full year guidance, I mean, if I remove the expected savings from restructuring that you highlighted, the $35 million -- you talked about higher R&D. I think on prices, you're saying about a 50 basis point headwind. Productivity is offsetting inflation. If I kind of just dial down to what your core -- what you're suggesting for core volume, you're looking at conversion of well over -- or easily over 40%. Actually, I mean, if I look at Q1, it looks like the conversion on your volumes were probably less, maybe around the 10% area, if I exclude some of the investments and the European headquarter investments as well. I'm just curious, why is the incremental on the core volume -- maybe can you comment on maybe why Q4 was fairly weak and why, 2014, the core volume conversions get that much better?","Michael T. Speetzen","Yes. So I guess you had -- there was a lot in there, so let me kind of step back. Let me talk about 2014 versus '13, and then I'll come back. And I think when you strip out the restructuring and you get to the core underlying incrementals that we're anticipating in 2014, so the core operations of the business, it's around 30%, which is quite strong given the fact that we're actually facing what we anticipate is negative price contribution. And again, a lot of that has to do with the mix. We're anticipating a higher growth rate coming out of our Water Infrastructure business, and we're building off of the cost base that we've worked on over the past couple of years, so we get that nice volume leverage off of the fixed cost position that we're in. If you look at our fourth quarter, we were about 20% on the face from an incremental standpoint. There were a couple of items that we had to contend with within the quarter. They were small, but when you add them in, they make a difference. We had some cost issues on a project coming out of India that was worth a couple of million dollars. And then coming out of Europe, we had low-margin project shipments in the fourth quarter that were overweight relative to what they typically are, and so that diluted the margins down. All in, we still had over 20% incremental, so we still feel pretty good about that, excluding restructuring and all the favorable benefits that we had built in the quarter.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Am I interpreting wrong, though? I mean, if I'm looking, for instance, at your Water Infrastructure, you're saying that the volume mix and other was a 50 basis point headwind, Euro headquarters was 30 basis point headwind and this whole investment was 10 basis points, so obviously, there's a 20 basis points relative headwind on your volume. So I mean, I guess that would suggest that your margin is probably less than 16.5% on that segment. Is that the wrong way to interpret it? I guess I just wanted to get a little clarity on how to read that.","Michael T. Speetzen","Yes, no, like I said, there were 2 things that gave us a bit of a headwind. It's the additional cost in our India project, which shows up in Water Infrastructure, as well as the projects that shipped out of Europe at a low-margin rate, which again is Water Infrastructure. So I think that's what's contributing to the dynamic you're pointing out.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Joseph Giordano of Cowen.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Just maybe anecdotally, can you talk about how you see the size incrementally in the municipal budgets in U.S. and Europe '14 versus '13 and then how your margins tend to be levered to the size change year-on-year? Because, I mean, we talk here, your operating margins, you say 80 to 140 bps improvement. And the restructuring alone, it looks like, on a $4 billion revenue basis, somewhere around $90 million. So I just want to see how that relationship -- kind of how you see that playing out.","Michael T. Speetzen","Yes, so I guess just backing up and talking about the muni market overall, we're not anticipating a significant change in the overall budgets. I think if we start to see that movement, it will more than likely occur in the middle of 2014. And given the long order lead nature of our business, it will typically result in something that's more favorable in 2014 -- 2015, I'm sorry. So there is a leverage component. And I would say, when you think about the margin performance between our segments, you've got to remember that Water Infrastructure, obviously, is heavily weighted to public utilities. Within Water Infrastructure, it's a tale of 2 different developed markets. You have the U.S., which goes through more distribution, and Europe, which goes through more of a direct channel. So you end up with a little bit different margin leverage equation when you look at it from that perspective. I think the other thing to take into consideration when you think about that basis point improvement year-over-year is price is a headwind. So we're flipping to a negative 50 basis point impact from pricing versus what we have historically seen, anywhere from 10 basis points this past year to as much as almost 200 basis points in years past. So we're offsetting that, as Steve mentioned earlier in the call, with aggressive cost actions, but some of that is getting diluted by the pricing pressure we're seeing in the market.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Do you think, if you start seeing some of that budgetary positivity towards the second half of the year, does that have -- would impacting that price dynamic?","Michael T. Speetzen","It really depends. I think first of all, it's probably not going to have an overly dramatic effect on our business initially, meaning most of that would probably get booked as business that has anywhere from a 6-, 9- to 12-month lead time. Certainly, an improving market is going to help on the price side. As the capacity utilization starts to improve in the industry, the competitive dynamics take on a different shape, and so we should start to see pricing move in the right trajectory. But again, we've been conservative, assuming that we're not going to see that type of dynamic play out, and that's why we've essentially built in assuming that we're going to have price pressure through 2014.","Steven R. Loranger","Yes, okay. So let me just close the call out. We've gone a couple of minutes long here. I just want to thank all of you for your interest in the company and for your support as we transition from a challenging 2013 to what we believe is going to be a very, very solid and attractive 2014. We've got a good plan in place. We've got, more importantly, a very, very -- an excellent team that's going to execute it, but we have a lot of work ahead of us. So we'll be in touch throughout the season on this and looking forward to talking to you at our next earnings call. But in the meantime, we're going to have our heads down. We're going to stay busy on executing this plan and, hopefully, continue to drive the kind of performance that we know we're capable of. So I want to thank you all and wish you well. We'll talk to you next. Bye.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today's Xylem Fourth Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call.

Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Thanks, Matt. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us to review our second quarter results. Overall, we delivered a solid performance in the quarter, operationally and with healthy margin expansion, and robust order performance which increases our visibility to stronger performance ahead.","In the second quarter, we generated top line growth in our base Xylem businesses and in Sensus. We're continuing to execute well, building momentum in the markets we serve. This is particularly notable in several of our emerging market regions. Our progress in driving productivity continues to generate impressive results with another quarter of significant year-over-year gains. The more focused approach we've applied in innovation and technology, partnering with more customers and external institutions, is accelerating our progress towards pilot-ready solutions to meet our customers' challenges. And the integration of our Sensus and Visenti businesses is proceeding well with our teams capturing new opportunities as they collaborate together.","The investments we've made in these and other activities are beginning to bear fruit and our second quarter results offer further proof points that our focus and discipline strategy will yield not only the short-term results we expect, but also produce the improved growth we've embedded into our longer-term expectations.","So, let me take you through our results from the context of the key priority areas we discussed at our Investor Day early this year. There, we laid out our clear focus on increasing profitable growth, and that begins with driving commercial leadership. In the second quarter, we delivered pro forma organic revenue growth of more than 1% with the base Xylem and Sensus businesses each generating positive results.","Our strong growth in orders illustrates the momentum that's building in the business. Globally, we generated an 8% increase in orders in the base Xylem business and double-digit order growth in Sensus. Within the base Xylem business, the growth was broad-based across all of our businesses. These results reflect in part the investments we've made in strengthening our teams and providing them with the right tools to increase their effectiveness in serving our customers. Importantly, this type of order growth sets the stage for improved top line performance beginning in the latter part this year and 2018.","I want to take a moment to thank our sales teams and those who support them around the globe. They are the ones out in the field day after day, working hard to develop the right solutions to help our customers and win the deals. And it's certainly not lost on me who the real drivers are of these results.","Now, before I move to the second priority, I do want to address a couple of our end markets, as I know it's on many investors' minds. First, the public utility market where we delivered particularly strong results, up 15% last year. In the second quarter this year, we saw a modest decline in public utility revenue in our base business. It's notable, however, that our treatment orders grew 21% and wastewater transport orders were up 10% in the quarter. This momentum, along with market intelligence and strong bidding activity, speaks to a positive outlook for the public utility end market, and it reinforces our confidence that our business in this sector will return to low- to mid-single digit growth in the second half of the year.","I'd be remiss if I didn't address the welcome upturn in our industrial business. This was driven principally by our dewatering business, which benefited from strength in the construction industry, as well as improved conditions in mining and oil and gas. It's still early days to declare a complete turnaround in this area, but it is encouraging to see solid results beginning to take hold.","The next priority area in our growth strategy is driving our business in emerging markets. Now, as I've said many times, I take the long view on these regions of the world. There will be periods of variability, as we saw over the past year, so we have been steady and disciplined in our continued investment in these areas and now, as market conditions are improving, we are well-positioned to grow our business and capture share. During the second quarter, emerging markets revenue was up 7%, and orders grew 27%, nearly double the order's growth rate we achieved in the first quarter. Clearly, we are building momentum in this part of our business, and our longer-term outlook remains positive.","I'd like to update you on three of our priority markets. Our team in China is continuing to outperform, delivering better than 20% year-over-year growth in both revenue and orders. This strong performance reflects solid growth in public utility, and the team is beginning to reap the benefits of our product localization efforts.","In addition, our teams are working closer together to capitalize on our broader portfolio of Xylem, Visenti, and Sensus solutions. In June, I was in Zhenjiang, China, to celebrate the signing of a new agreement with a large Chinese water utility for a pilot project utilizing our smart water network solutions to help them solve their non-revenue water issue, which is a growing challenge for water utilities around the globe.","The outlook in India is also quite positive. Our team delivered 12% revenue growth in the quarter and a triple-digit increase in orders. The order strength extended across both Water Infrastructure and Applied Water, and we expect product localization to further expand our opportunities there. We're also making good progress in building out our new India tech center in Bangalore, which is enabling us to tap into a rich combination of local and global expertise to drive innovation.","The Middle East remains soft, but we see some leading indicators of a turnaround in the market. Order growth in the region was up double digits in the second quarter, and this follows a 9% increase in orders in the first quarter. The presence of our Dubai factory is helping us better meet our customers' needs more quickly, and we expect that to have an increasing impact on future growth.","Our progress in driving innovation and technology continues. We're already seeing some exciting ideas come out of the collaboration between Xylem and our new Sensus colleagues as we maintain a sharp focus on solving specific customer pain points. In fact, we're already moving from the research lab to the pilot phase on certain solutions, and we look forward to deploying prototypes of those solutions with select customers in the coming months.","That's a nice lead into our progress with the integration of Sensus, which is proceeding on track with our plans. Our teams are working well in targeted areas, ensuring we remain focused on delivering our near-term financial commitments while beginning to execute against the revenue synergies we've identified. We also continue to track on pace to deliver the cost synergies we outlined of a net $15 million in 2017 and $50 million-plus by 2019.","The team delivered a signature win this quarter, valued at approximately $100 million over the life of the contract, with the deal Sensus struck with Alliant Energy, which serves electric and natural gas customers across Iowa and Wisconsin. This multiyear deal represents one of the largest deployments to date of FlexNet and includes both electric and gas smart meters.","This deal is another compelling illustration of the value that the electric and gas businesses bring to Xylem. It also highlights the importance of our continued investment in electric and gas to develop the solutions our customers need. As we continue to innovate, we expect to have more solutions that can be seamlessly connected to our network solutions, increasing the value we can bring to our customers across the water, electric, and gas utility sectors.","The last area I'll touch on is continuous improvement, which continues to deliver quarter after quarter. We generated nearly $40 million in cost savings in the second quarter, up significantly from the prior-year period. These savings continue to help fund the growth initiatives that are key to our longer-term objectives. We're also seeing an uptick in the use of tools to reduce some of the complexities that still exist throughout our operations.","Our adjusted EBITDA was up 150 basis points to 18.6%, and this reflects both strong operational performance as well as the Sensus contribution. We delivered adjusted earnings per share of $0.59 in the quarter, an increase of 23% year over year. We also delivered solid improvement in free cash flow year over year and continue to be well-positioned to deliver full-year free cash flow conversion in excess of 110% of net income.","And finally, as you saw in our press release, we are raising our full-year earnings guidance to reflect primarily our updated assumption for foreign exchange impact, which has strengthened recently. We increased our adjusted EPS guidance and narrowed the range to $2.30 to $2.40 per share. I'll come back to this when we discuss the outlook in a few minutes.","We delivered a solid performance in the first half of the year and are well on track to meet our full-year commitments. Importantly, we've built strong momentum across many of our businesses that we see continuing through the second half. That, combined with improving end markets, is increasing our confidence for stronger growth ahead.","Now, with that, I'll turn it over to Mark for more details on the quarter.","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Thanks, Patrick. Let's turn to slide 5. I continue to be pleased with the progress against our strategic initiatives and the commercial momentum we're building. As Patrick detailed, our teams executed well in the second quarter, and their performance, along with improving order growth, positions us strongly as we move into the second half of this year.","Overall, revenues were up 25% to $1.2 billion in the second quarter. On a pro forma organic basis, this represents more than 1% growth, with Sensus contributing 2% and the base Xylem business increasing 1%. Foreign exchange reduced revenues by $19 million or about a point.","In the base Xylem business, the 1% growth in revenues reflects solid performance in the residential and commercial end markets, up 15% and 3%, respectively, largely driven by strength in the U.S., as well as a 2% increase in our industrial end market. This growth was partially offset by a decline in public utility, which reflects a particularly challenging comparison from the prior-year period, when we delivered 15% growth globally.","Regionally, the U.S. was flat year over year, as the strength in residential and commercial was offset by the softness in public utility. Western Europe performance was down 3%, with specific pockets of weakness including the U.K. Emerging markets continued its momentum into the second quarter, when we delivered 7% revenue growth year over year.","In the Sensus business, the 2% growth in revenues was in line with the high end of our expectations. This reflected strong double-digit growth across all applications, with the exception of water, where there was a challenging prior-year comparison due to significant distributor stocking of a new product in North America.","Moving to operational performance, we increased our adjusted EBITDA margin by 150 basis points to 18.6% in the quarter. This increase was driven by strong productivity and operating results from our base Xylem business, as well as the continued solid performance from Sensus. Adjusted operating margin was 13.3% in the quarter. Excluding the 70 basis points of purchase accounting amortization for the Sensus acquisition, our adjusted operating margin increased 100 basis points year over year in the quarter.","Our teams continue to execute well on our productivity programs, delivering $38 million in cost savings in the quarter. This is an increase of 27% from the prior year. The acceleration of our cost savings enabled us to more than offset inflation in a modestly weaker revenue mix, while continuing to fund investments for growth. The strong operating performance in our base Xylem business, along with the significant accretion from the Sensus acquisition, enabled us to deliver adjusted earnings per share of $0.59, a 23% increase year over year.","Please turn to slide 6, and I'll provide additional details on our segment performance. Beginning with our Water Infrastructure segment, we recorded orders of $521 million, up 10% organically year-over-year. This includes double-digit growth in both transport and treatment applications; and as Patrick mentioned, treatment delivered an impressive 21% increase in orders. This performance builds on an already positive trajectory and sets us up for a solid second half of 2017, as well as a strong 2018, as many of these orders carry longer lead times.","We exited the quarter with total backlog for the segment of $589 million, up 14% year-over-year. Of this amount, more than $400 million is due to ship in the second half of this year, an increase of 12% year-over-year on an organic basis. This gives us good confidence in our ability to accelerate revenue growth and deliver low- to mid-single digit revenue growth in the third quarter. Water infrastructure revenue of $482 million represents a 1% increase year-over-year on an organic basis.","In the U.S., the segment was down 1% primarily due to a difficult comparison against the 22% growth in our public utility markets last year. This was partially offset by the strength of our dewatering business, which grew 4% globally, with the return to growth in North America being the biggest contributor to this improvement. The team capitalized on opportunities in construction as well as stabilizing mining and oil and gas markets in the U.S. and Canada.","The strength in these sectors in particular is reflected in the strong growth in Canada which was up 37%. This is our second consecutive quarter of meaningful improvement in these markets which is a very encouraging sign. Western Europe decreased 4% overall, primarily reflecting softness in the U.K. We have seen some slowing there due to a shift in timing of deliveries as well as delays in investment related to the AMP6 public utility investment cycle. However, based on recent order momentum, we believe that much of this weakness to be a case of volume shifting from the first half to the second half of the year.","Our emerging markets results were strong with revenue growth of 11%. We saw continued strength in China and India where government investment remained strong. Our Middle East business remained soft in the quarter, down 15% year-over-year. However, we are seeing encouraging signs of increased investment and funding, which is supported by the double-digit order growth we secured in the quarter. Operating margin for the segment increased 150 basis points to 16.4%, driven by productivity benefits and volume leverage which more than offset inflation and investments for growth.","Please turn to slide 7. Our Applied Water segment booked orders of $375 million in the quarter, which was up 6% organically. We exited the quarter with backlog of $193 million, which is up 7% organically compared with last year. Of this amount, more than $140 million is due to ship in the second half of 2017, up approximately 6% on an organic basis. Our backlog level and order momentum provide us with confidence in our ability to deliver low- to mid-single digit growth in the second half of this year.","Revenue for Applied Water was $361 million, up 1% organically versus the prior-year quarter. Emerging markets revenue increased by 3%, reflecting solid growth in the Middle East and Eastern Europe, partially offset by weakness in Latin America. In Western Europe, revenue decreased 2% as the growth in residential was more than offset by a decline in commercial building.","In Western Europe, revenue decreased 2% as the growth in residential was more than offset by a decline in commercial building revenue, reflecting a difficult year-over-year comparison against the 14% growth we achieved a year ago. We expect that the investments we've made in our European sales capabilities and channels, as well as the new product investments we made over the past 18 months will drive improved growth in the second half of this year.","In the U.S., Applied Water segment revenue was flat. Our U.S. commercial building services business grew 3% in the quarter, and that was without the benefit of any major project releases, which we do expect to see later this year. Our U.S. residential business grew 14% in the quarter. In addition to solid market growth, we also benefited from promotions and channel restocking. The strength we saw in both in commercial building services and residential was largely offset by the decline in agricultural product sales due to market softness and challenging weather conditions.","Segment operating margin in the quarter increased 20 basis points year-over-year to 15%.","The increase in adjusted operating margin was due to cost reductions from global procurement and continuous improvement initiatives as well as lower year-over-year investment due to the completion of our Middle East expansion last year. This was partially offset by cost inflation, unfavorable mix, and currency impacts.","Now, let's turn to slide 8 to discuss the performance of our Sensus & Analytics segment. As a reminder, these segment results now reflect the combination of our Sensus and Analytics businesses. Prior-year results have been restated to include our Analytics business, which was previously in the Water Infrastructure segment.","Let me start by saying that we're very pleased with the underlying momentum in our Sensus business. In the first half of the year, the business generated about 5% growth on a pro forma basis, and orders increased more than 10%. I do want to highlight a point related to our orders numbers. Some of our large, multi-year contract wins, such as the Alliant deal that Patrick mentioned are not yet fully reflected in our reported orders. We will report orders under these contracts as they move closer to the execution date and purchase orders are issued. That said, we're clearly building strong momentum in this business that we expect to result in accelerated sales growth in the second half of this year.","Now, back to the second quarter. Revenues for the segment were $321 million, up 2% on a pro forma organic basis over the prior-year period. For the Sensus business, revenue in our electric sector increased 53% with growth primarily attributable to the deployment of several large projects. Further driving the strong performance was demand for new products including the Stratus electric meter which is helping us gain share.","The water sector was down 8% in the quarter; however, this reflects a very challenging comparison with the prior-year period during which the water sector grew 20%, as it benefited from the very successful launch of the new iPERL water meter and channel stocking. In addition, in last year's second quarter, the business generated significant service revenues related to the initial deployment of the Thames Water contract.","Shifting to our Analytics business; this business delivered 2% growth in the quarter, with increasing demand in environmental monitoring in North America, which is a trend that we expect will continue through the second half of the year. Orders in Analytics increased by 8%, led by 20% growth in emerging markets and strength in the U.S. We expect the orders momentum to lead to improve growth in the second half of the year for this business.","Now, moving to our segment operating margins. Adjusted operating margin for the segment increased 210 basis points from 8.5% to 10.6%. The increase in adjusted operating income and margin was due to the inclusion of a higher relative year-over-year margins from the Sensus business and the benefit of significant cost reductions in Analytics business. To assist investors in better understanding the performance of this segment, we've included an additional slide in the appendix, which reflects comparable sales and margin information on a pro forma basis.","Given the significant impact that amortization from purchase accounting has on this segment's margins we have presented this analysis on an EBITDA basis. On a pro forma basis, EBITDA margins in the quarter were down 170 basis points year-over-year to 19.9%. The reduction was primarily driven by increased R&D and commercial investment for new product development and to drive revenue synergies. Cost reductions more than offset inflation, and mix was slightly negative year-over-year.","Now, let's turn to slide 9 to discuss cash flows and the company's financial position. We closed the quarter with a cash balance of $288 million. Free cash flow on the quarter increased almost 20% from the prior year to $70 million, and was driven largely by the addition of Sensus. Free cash flow conversion was 56% for the first half of the year, which is on track with our expectations to deliver greater than 110% conversion for the full year.","We invested $34 million in capital expenditures in the second quarter, and returned $52 million to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, of which $21 million was for share repurchases to manage dilution. Working capital improved by 170 basis points year-over-year, largely driven by the strong performance in the Sensus business. We remain committed to maintaining our investment-grade credit rating, and as a result, our capital deployment is focused primarily on debt repayment at this time.","Please turn to slide 10, and Patrick, will cover the update to our 2017 outlook.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Thanks, Mark. We delivered a solid performance over the first half of 2017, which strengthened our confidence in our ability to deliver on our financial targets for the year. The changes in our 2017 guidance reflect primarily updates to our foreign currency assumptions.","At the top line, we now expect to deliver full-year revenue of $4.65 billion to $4.7 billion. On a pro forma basis, we project organic revenue growth of 3% to 4%, which includes organic growth from the base Xylem business of 2% to 3% and organic growth of 6% to 7% in our Sensus business. Here, we've raised the bottom end of our total company and base Xylem business growth expectations by 1 point.","Our Sensus organic growth rate expectations are unchanged. We anticipate achieving $130 million in cost savings for the full year, a 10% year-over-year increase, and we remain on pace to meet that target. Our adjusted operating margin is now forecast to grow in the range of 30 basis points to 80 basis points, excluding roughly 70 basis points of margin dilution from Sensus purchase accounting. This is an increase of 10 basis points in operational margin improvement over our previous guidance.","At the bottom line, we now expect to generate earnings per share of $2.30 to $2.40, which excludes integration, restructuring, and realignment costs of approximately $40 million. We've increased our projection for those costs from our previous forecast of $30 million, as we've accelerated certain activities that we now plan to execute in the fourth quarter.","Excluding foreign exchange impact, EPS growth is projected to be in the range of 13% to 18%. Finally, as we discussed previously, we expect to deliver free cash flow conversion of at least 110% this year. This contemplates anticipated capital expenditures of approximately $190 million to $200 million.","Now, please turn to slide 11, and I'll walk you through our end market assumptions. Please note that our commentary and growth estimates on the slide reflect pro forma organic revenue from 2016 for Xylem and includes the impact of Sensus. Public utility constitutes 47% of total pro forma 2016 revenue. In 2017, we expect pro forma organic revenue to grow in the low- to mid-single digit range. We continue to forecast organic growth in our Sensus business of 6% to 7%.","As we've seen in the first half of 2017, Xylem base businesses are lapping a very strong public utility performance in 2016. As a result, we expect organic growth for the base business for the full year to be up low single-digits. The year-over-year comparison in the U.S. market is particularly challenging as we delivered 17% growth in 2016. As a result, we believe growth in this region will be in the low- to mid-single digit range. Large project activities are expected to drive mid- to high single-digit growth in the emerging markets, primarily in China and India; and in Europe, we anticipate low single-digit growth.","Our industrial end market represents 37% of pro forma revenue. In 2017, we continue to expect that full-year organic revenue will be up low single-digits. While the year started off soft, we are encouraged by the modest growth we saw in the second quarter. As a result, we are cautiously optimistic that this is the beginning of a market recovery, and we anticipate modest growth over the second half of the year. We expect emerging market performance to be mixed with strength in China and Latin America, offset by continued weakness in the Middle East.","Moving to commercial, which represents 11% of pro forma revenue, we project organic growth to be in the low- to mid-single digit range in 2017, with a solid U.S. market. In Europe, new energy-efficient products and our continued investment in our sales channels are expected to help drive growth.","Residential revenues reflect 5% of pro forma revenue. Based on the strength we've seen in the first half of the year when we grew 14%, we are now anticipating full-year growth to be in the high single-digit range. In the U.S., we did have a better-than-expected first half of the year, but we believe that growth will moderate somewhat in the second half. We do continue to see an increase in residential building permits in the European market, which should help drive modest growth.","Now, please turn to slide 12, and Mark will walk you through more details on the outlook.","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","I'll take a few minutes to update you on the seasonal profile of our business, as well as the updates to our 2017 planning assumptions. For the third quarter, based on orders momentum, improving backlogs, and favorable compares, we expect the public utility market to grow mid-single digits on a pro forma basis and our industrial businesses to grow mid-single digits as well.","We expect commercial building services to accelerate modestly to the mid- to high single-digit range, and we anticipate moderating growth in residential, up mid- to high single-digits. All in, we anticipate this will result in pro forma organic revenue growth in the range of 4% to 5% in the third quarter. We expect foreign exchange translation to favorably impact revenue by $15 million.","Acquisitions are expected to add approximately $230 million to $240 million, with Sensus growing organically at 6% to 7% in the third quarter. As for our third quarter operating margins, we expect margins to be flat to up 20 basis points, excluding the 70-basis-point reduction due to the non-cash amortization of Sensus purchase accounting.","There are a couple of items that will put some pressure on our operating margins in the third quarter. The first item is driven by higher cost of batteries that we have secured from alterative suppliers for our Sensus water meters. As we discussed on our last earnings call, an accident in the spring required our previous battery supplier to temporarily close its plant. The team has done a fantastic job identifying alternate suppliers on short notice to largely mitigate this supply issue and minimize customer disruption; however, the costs are substantially higher.","Third quarter margins will also be negatively impacted by a significantly higher mix of sales in our treatment business and large project revenues in the emerging markets. Finally, please note the summary of our FX assumptions on this slide, which includes our updated euro guidance assumption at $1.15 from $1.07. This adjustment puts us in line with the July month-to-date average actual rate of $1.15. Aside from our currency assumptions, all other assumptions remain unchanged from our previous guidance.","With that, I'll turn the call back over to Patrick for some closing comments.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Thanks, Mark. We've had a solid first half of the year. We're increasingly encouraged by the momentum we see continuing to build in our businesses, and a number of our end markets are showing signs of improvement. Our Sensus integration work remains on track, and we continue to uncover new growth opportunities based on the combined offerings from Xylem and Sensus; and as we do so, we're remaining focused and disciplined to ensure that we execute our near-term plans and continue to deliver on our long-term financial commitments.","There is no doubt that we are still in the early days of realizing our strategic ambitions, as we outlined at Investor Day, and we look forward to continuing to develop significant further value creation for our shareholders.","Now, operator, we can open up to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","The floor is now open for questions. Our first question comes from the line of Ryan Connors of Boenning & Scattergood.","Ryan M. Connors - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc.","Great. Thank you. My question is on the public utility market. Obviously tremendous order performance there, but obviously the underlying markets aren't growing that pace, 21% for treatment and 10% for transport. So do you think you're taking any market share there, and can you give us some color about how you analyze the respective contributions of market growth and your own competitive performance?","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Sure. Good morning, Ryan. Thanks for the question. So, I'd break it down into the two most meaningful businesses that operate in the public utility sector and that today is our treatment business and our transport business. And I think the answer to your question is different for each of the two. I would say where we saw the significant orders growth in treatment, that really in my view is more attributable to timing of projects being awarded. And so I wouldn't necessarily attribute that to a share gain per se, although we do feel good about our share position in that market.","The flip side of that, on the transport side, where we had 10% orders growth in the quarter, again, predominantly attributed to the public utilities sector, that one we do believe is a level of share gain that's really being driven by, one, new product introductions. But also, we've got a very large share position in terms of installed base. And so, as we've seen continued healthy growth in the repair and replacement part of the business, we obviously benefit differentially in that sector. So I would attribute a portion of that to share gain.","Ryan M. Connors - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc.","Got it. Okay. And then my other question was on oil and gas and mining, and two questions there. One, how big a contributor was Godwin to the improvement there on the rental side? And then why not more bold in calling a recovery there? It seems like a couple straight quarters of pickup. What would it take to raise your conviction level and get more bullish on that energy market?","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah. I think it's a fair question, Ryan. I think that our view, I guess we've been down so long in what is an otherwise a small part of our total revenue base on a business that obviously is one of our most profitable. I think we'd like to see another quarter of continued momentum here to be able to declare a definitive turnaround. Where we saw particularly healthy growth this last quarter was in our indirect channel with our distribution partners, with some restocking there as well as they were deploying capital again, which is obviously a very healthy sign. And so, rig count's going our way, a number of other positive signs there, but we just think it's prudent right now to keep our expectations very level-headed here.","Ryan M. Connors - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc.","Okay. And Godwin, any color there?","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah, Godwin was the predominant contributor to the growth in that area. Actually, we've got a little bit of softness in our Applied Water business in more of the downstream applications there. That was down a little bit, not much but a little bit, but that was more than offset to drive growth in dewatering.","Ryan M. Connors - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc.","Got it. Thanks for your time.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Good morning, Deane.","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Good morning.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, maybe we can start with China. I wasn't expecting to see that kind of growth coming out of the region, up 20% revenues and orders. And maybe part of your answer is what kind of range of products are you seeing, because the facilities we visited in Shanghai seemed to be enamored with your UV treatment, some of your advanced treatment products, so how is the take there? And then also, industry reports have been saying China is really ramping up its focus on non-revenue water, more so than anyone expected. And so, maybe that's part of your growth rate you're seeing and will you use any of the combination with Pure Technologies and Visenti there?","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah. Well, thanks, Deane, for the questions. So, a couple of things in there that I'd point to. If you look at our growth in the quarter, it was really outpaced with transport and treatment. We were actually up about 50% year-over-year in that part of the business. Actually our Applied Water business was down about 10%, as we're still lapping some of the weakness there on the industrial commercial building side.","So, it really is heavily oriented towards the water sector and the wastewater sector specifically. And that really is being driven by the continued focus, as you well know, on top policy mandate around water and environmental quality, and so we really have continued to see the money flow there. Now, we're also facing some easier comparison last year, but nevertheless, we see good, solid momentum continuing there.","To your second point, on the non-revenue water mandate, your industry intel is absolutely spot on. When I was over there just several weeks ago, a number of the water utility CEOs were letting me know that the last five-year mandate has been extended now to include a targeted reduction in non-revenue water, which right now is about 27% as estimated, and they want that number to be down below 10% over the next handful of years. That's an ambitious aim, but certainly it will lead to money flowing.","The pilot that we announced that we signed there in Zhenjiang is the first one of those. And so, the good news here is the non-revenue water opportunity is all in front of us as a sector, Deane. And so, it absolutely is going to be the opportunity for us to leverage our partnership between the Xylem Analytics business, Visenti, and Sensus, but also perhaps leveraging the Pure combination as well.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","That's great to hear. And then, on Sensus, really interested in hearing anything you can share on this transition to some of the pilot stage of the products. That's what everyone is watching. The extent you can comment like what kinds of applications in these scenarios like watershed monitoring, but some color there would be real helpful.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Sure. I'll give you the color that I can from a competitive standpoint, Deane, in terms of how much detail I share there, but let me speak directionally. So, we've got some pilots that are just about ready to go forward in Asia Pacific, as well as some here in the U.S. with some of the leading water utilities. And we are piloting, quite frankly, different solutions \u2013 or we'll be piloting different solutions with each customer.","I would describe them as cutting across a few different areas. One is absolutely focusing in on the watershed management and the ability to connect our outdoor water quality monitoring capabilities there. Second would be across the wastewater part of the network in terms of our pumping stations, et cetera, et cetera. And then third, I would say there are, again, the opportunities that I talked about around non-revenue water being a big future play for us. So, those are three of the areas. There are a couple of others that are out there that we're still in the early stages of developing.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Right now, we're really focused on getting the technologies enabled and making them pilot-ready, then go out and begin to commercialize them.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Good to hear and just last question, I really like seeing this new segmentation with Sensus paired with Analytics. And just \u2013 Patrick, if you could just a moment take us through where Analytics focus for growth is from here? A lot of people just think it's immediately a chemical test, but it's much more on the environmental side. So, where and how do you expect to grow the Analytics piece from here?","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah, it's a great insight, Deane. It is a business that is very much focusing on environmental quality monitoring, the whole outdoor water management space. The acquisitions that we haven't talked about in a while with HYPACK and Tideland, ocean and coastal monitoring is another opportunity for us in that area.","And I think that what we are really excited about right now with the Sensus\/Analytics combination is the leverage and power we get out of the combined R&D engineering efforts. And so, you'll see an accelerated ramp and some new product introductions there over the coming \u2013 I'd say, over the next year or two. And we've been a little bit stale, quite honestly, in the Analytics business, and I'm encouraged by the opportunity the team sees there now to refresh the portfolio.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thank you.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones with Stifel.","Nathan H. Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Good morning everyone.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Good morning.","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Hey.","Nathan H. Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Just following up on some of Deane's questions here about the Sensus business and, more directly, on some of the overlap that you can get with Sensus and the legacy portfolio. What kind of level of investment do you see ramping up to? I mean, it looks like a very fertile area for investment. Where are you kind of now? Do you need to ramp up the number of engineers you've got? What kind of investment could the business take where it's at now? How should we think about the trade-off between these investments for growth and delivering margins?","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Sure, Nate. Let me start, and then I'll have Mark chime in here as well on some of the numbers. So, at Investor Day, you'll recall we talked about between now and 2020 that you would see an uptick between 100 basis points to 150 basis points of R&D over that timeframe. And as I commented at Investor Day, that was really a proxy for overall investments that we would need to make in the business, whether it ends up in the R&D line, whether it ends up in sales and marketing support as we look at different solutions offerings, but we talked about somewhere between 100 basis points to 150 basis points of margin \u2013 or sorry, cost investment that we had embedded in getting to our margin targets over 2020.","We'll continue to modulate that and see what is needed. We've made some of that investment in Q2 and we'll make some here in the second half of the year. Our efforts right now have really been building out a center of excellence around systems intelligence in Raleigh-Durham that you would have seen the early stages of. And we'll certainly be adding some sales and marketing resources in targeted areas to really support and drive the deployments over time. But again we'll modulate that as we go along.","Mark, do you want to add anything?","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah, just a couple of other points. The teams are now at the point where they have a much better understanding of what they really need to deliver and execute. And so, Nate, you will see some ramp-up in the R&D spend levels. To Patrick's point, as we develop those products and solutions, we'll also need additional commercial capabilities to bring them to market. But we're also looking at significantly enhancing what we're bringing in terms of data analytics, data scientists, and we certainly see that as a big opportunity going forward for the company, Software-as-a-Service. And \u2013 but we'll also try and do it smartly, so we will be taking advantage of building out our India tech center which can support some of that at a lower cost as well. So, you will bottom line see some ramp in our R&D spend as a percentage of sales as we go through the remainder of this year.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","But, Nate, to be clear in what we've said here is, what we're talking about in terms of any level of investment is not different than what we talked about at Investor Day. So, this is not incremental to what we had laid out back in April.","Nathan H. Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","I'm wondering, given the pace that this seems to be going at, if there's an opportunity to maybe accelerate some of these investments? I know maybe that will be a little bit of a drag on short-term margins, but are you seeing as you get deeper into this an opportunity to maybe accelerate some of those investments to accelerate growth?","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Nate, I think it's a fair observation. I think, right now, it really is more a function of bandwidth, not so much resources per se, but making sure that we're working with specific customers on prototypes and we have to move also at their pace as we develop some of these new solutions and technologies. So, if we see opportunities to accelerate, we'll certainly do that. We wouldn't be constrained financially, quite frankly, we see there being other opportunities on the synergy side as well that we can fund a number of these things. So, it really is not a financial constraint.","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah. And, Patrick, to that point, you talked about net synergies, a chunk of those investments are reflected as a reduction to the gross synergies that we're delivering. So, as you said, the more we can deliver in terms of gross cost synergies, it provides more opportunity for further investment.","Nathan H. Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then your order numbers are ramping up faster than your revenue outlook. Can you talk about maybe the sequencing of backlog, and how this is setting you up for growth in 2018?","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah. Yeah. We've got \u2013 we certainly have strong backlog going into the second half. For all of 2017, we're looking at 12% increase year-over-year, but the interesting thing is it's even higher in terms of our backlog going into 2018. And in 2018 and beyond, our year-over-year improvement is 17%. So, it really \u2013 and as I highlighted in some of my prepared remarks, we really see that as enabling us to provide really solid second half growth in 2017, but we're even more excited about what we see ahead of us for 2018.","Nathan H. Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Thanks very much.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Thank you, Nathan.","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Lee - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Sure. Good morning.","Brian Lee - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good morning. Maybe to follow up on that last one. If I do look at the end market outlook, all the segments here are getting a slight bump versus the organic growth views from the first quarter call except for public utility, but that seems to be an area where you had a couple straight quarters of pretty robust order growth particularly in treatment.","So, I'm wondering how should we think about maybe the timing of orders translating to P&L lead time-wise. You mentioned these can be a bit longer. And then maybe how you think about the potential for the outlook for public utility getting upgraded and moving through the second half of 2017 similar to what's happened here with your other end markets?","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Sure, yeah. So I would characterize it as such. So, we \u2013 our outlook and the expecting to be growing in the 4% to 5% growth range in the back half of the year to get to our base Xylem, kind of, growth here. And if you look at the orders that we delivered in Q2, and we're obviously pleased with that order performance, it was against a rather weak comparison last year, where we were actually down slightly in orders in Q2.","So, if you normalize for that, we're kind of in that mid-single digit range, all else equal, and that's pretty much in line with what we're outlooking in terms of organic revenue growth in the second half. And as Mark pointed out, there is some of this order growth that really extends well into 2018 which we view that as an encouraging sign, because obviously as we get closer to the end point of year here, our minds are turning towards the outlook for 2018. And I think the order performance that we've seen here really provides us with even more conviction of the longer-term growth targets that we laid out back in Investor Day.","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","And I'd add to that, Patrick, to the second part of the question, clearly, there is a \u2013 we're going to see a change in trajectory relative to growth in public utility. And we were down through the first half, but certainly, with that order growth, we'd expect to be up low single-digit to mid-single digits for the second half of the year; and on a pro forma basis with Sensus, squarely in the mid-single digit range.","Brian Lee - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then just second question, maybe a bit more of a housekeeping one. On the EPS guidance update for 2017, it sounds like a bit of additional organic revenue growth for base Xylem and then the new euro ForEx assumption of $1.15. But if I take just the new euro rate and flow it through, I get the entire EPS raise, which is consistent with your commentary. So wondering if there are some offsets to the slightly better organic growth, or if there's something unique about the incrementals on that new revenue? Any clarity there would help. Thanks.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","No. I think you've summarized it well relative to the driver of the increase. It is almost entirely FX. We have updated the range. We've narrowed it. We moved up the low point to $2.30, and that's reflective of, really, some of the improved water momentum and what we see as a improved growth profile in the second half. But just about everything in that updated guidance is all FX-related.","Brian Lee - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano with Cowen.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Good morning, Joe.","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Good morning, Joe.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","So I think with what's going on with Sensus and the synergy opportunities and how attractive that looks, I think part of what gets lost here is the opportunity ahead, just nuts and bolts with the standalone legacy businesses and the cost-out opportunities you have there. So can you kind of update us at where you are year to date versus some of your \u2013 whether it's the 2017 kind of internal target or relative to your comments you made at Investor Day on just the core Xylem cost-out opportunity?","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Sure, Joe. Let me go first, and then Mark can chime in here. So we feel very good about where we are in terms of the progress on the margin expansion goals that we laid out, not only for total company, but certainly the base business, which is really where the big productivity opportunity lies. And you see that with respect to the continued strong growth in our cost-out activities in Q2 as well as year to date.","And when you look at our overall margin expansion goals of up to 80 basis points in the year, that's a good pace for us in terms of margin expansion, particularly given the fact that we're really not seeing a meaningful level of net synergies from Sensus this year. I mean, we're calling for $15 million out of the $50 million over time here, only because the negative synergies hit us on day one, and that obviously minimizes some of the net synergy in year one. You'll see the full-on gross impact of that in 2018.","So, if you set that aside, very good progress on the margin side and, quite frankly, we feel that the best is yet to come. We talk about the business simplification work that we're doing, next-generation procurement, we're still early on in terms of our deployment of Lean and Six Sigma. So we remain very confident around the margin expansion goals that we laid out.","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah, no, we're tracking very well. And we saw a ramp in the second quarter year over year, and we'll see that continue in through the second half. So we're very confident about our ability to achieve those targets that we've laid out. And as we look at the net synergies from Sensus, that too will really start to ramp, particularly in the fourth quarter of this year.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. And then if I shift over, one of the themes that we've been hearing for a while now from a lot of companies is on rising input costs. So if you guys can comment on that. I'm guessing the commentary is very different when you're talking about maybe Flygt and Concertor versus some of the stuff in Applied, but how are you seeing cost inflation and your ability to compensate on pricing?","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah. Let me take that one. We're clearly seeing a bit of a ramp in inflation, and it's really driven by commodities. In the first quarter of this year, we saw a 150-basis-point impact year over year. On the second quarter, that did ramp up to 200 basis points, and that was really all commodity based, and we would expect that to continue at that level through the second half of the year, at that elevated level. And it's really being driven by copper, stainless steel. These metals are probably the most significant drivers, but the team understands that. We're pushing hard to drive additional opportunities of savings around procurement to offset some of that. And most importantly, to your question on price, year to date, it's been relatively flat, but there's a lot of movement under that flat result.","There are certainly areas in our business where we have opportunity because of competitive advantage, value proposition, to push for price and we're doing that; there's other products that are less advantaged where it's tougher to do that. But we are \u2013 this is clearly an area that we're working with our teams to get more aggressive on price because inflation is ramping, it's not going away in the near term, and we just need to be better at getting paid for the value that we're providing our customers in those instances in particular.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah. The good news, Joe, is we've seen this coming for a while now. So we've been working closely between our procurement team and our sales teams to make sure they understand on which product lines it's impacting us and, therefore, where we really want to emphasize going after price. And so, we do expect that benefit to begin to come through in the second half of the year going to next year. And, two, certainly in those areas where we are a definitive market leader, we will behave as such and make sure that we drive pricing in the market.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. And one just quick clarification; Mark, how much of that $100 million large order in Sensus was actually booked into orders in 2Q?","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","It was roughly 15% to 20%, just off the top of my head, and that's \u2013 really, a lot of that's for next year \u2013 a lot of that order will be realized next year.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","The key with this one, Joe, is on these large deployments, they're quite complex. They go over a few years of just getting the meters deployed and, obviously, the team work closely with the customer on exactly what their delivery schedule is. And so, the orders that we would have booked in Q2 would have been a small portion of the overall deal, very small portion of the overall deal, and those will be shipping out, quite frankly, later this year into 2018.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Perfect. Thanks, guys.","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jim Giannakouros with Oppenheimer.","Jim Giannakouros - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Hey, Jim.","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Good morning, Jim.","Jim Giannakouros - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Just tacking on to Joe's question there on that win. Any color on how we should be modeling that deployment? I understand it's weighted to 2018, 2019. Is that equal weight, is it ratable, or is it only weighted in 2018? Is it a net positive for Sensus or do you have projects rolling off that we should be mindful of that kind of offset that, and so they don't necessarily impact that 6% to 7% growth rate that you've guided?","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah. So, Jim, the \u2013 yeah, and just to clarify for everybody, so the deployment itself will take place. So, the way \u2013 it's a two-part contract. So, we got the actual deployment of the meters as well as getting the network built out that takes place over the course of the first two-and-a-half to three years of the contract. And then, we've got a service agreement, software agreement that goes on beyond that, over a 12-year timeframe, so both software and service.","And in terms of the modeling, so you're going to see the heavier revenue flow in the first two-and-a-half to three years. That was in embedded in the 6% to 7% growth that we had in the core Sensus business, partly because we do have contracts that potentially roll out, that will be up for bid. But, two, at the time of the acquisition, at the time of Investor Day, we had good line of sight to a number of these large deals that are out there and had \u2013 the team had pretty high confidence they were going to win this one. So, that was part of our confidence in committing to at least that 6% to 7% growth over the long range time.","Jim Giannakouros - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Understood. Thank you. And one follow-up if I may. Industrial exposure over a 30-year exposure, I understand you're seeing some modest \"improvement\" overall, but stripping out oil and gas and sticking with that general industrial bucket, where are you seeing increasing activity and where would you call out spending is slow to improve?","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah. I think we've certainly seen a modest level of improvement in capital spending in the U.S. industrial sector, as well as in, certainly, Canada had benefited there as well. And as we've said before, we tend to sell into more the general light industrial. So, not so much tied to the actual production activity itself, but as long as the sites are up and running, they will burn through some level of pumps that are there. You'll recall that we saw some unexpected softness there in Q4 and Q1. We had talked about that we would surpass that and things would normalize, and that's very much what we saw happened in Q2 and we expect that to normalize now for the second half.","Jim Giannakouros - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thank you, Patrick.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Walsh with Vertical Research.","John F. Walsh - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Hi. Good morning.","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Good morning, John.","John F. Walsh - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Hey. So, a lot of ground covered already; just two quick ones here. I guess, a quick modeling question around how to think about Sensus for the full year. A little bit of movement on the acquisition impact and the outlook, but is the low 10% still the right ballpark there from last quarter?","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","From an operating margin perspective?","John F. Walsh - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Correct.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah. So, Sensus as \u2013 on a stand-alone basis, that really hasn't \u2013 that outlook has not changed. So, there's nothing in the profile of the mix of our business or investment levels that would suggest that would be any different than what we had outlook previously.","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","And we're expecting to achieve that 6% to 7% revenue growth for the full year as well.","John F. Walsh - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Got you. And then I'm sure it's still very noisy, but I'd be remiss if I didn't ask, anything out of your customers around infrastructure or any thoughts around there? Obviously a lot of noise coming out of Washington, but any thoughts around that?","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Sure. Yeah. So, our view \u2013 and we obviously do stay close to this as best we can. In our view, it continues to be that any kind of infrastructure bill would likely be in the 2018, 2019 timeframe as clearly things are kind of shuffling around in D.C. these days. I would say that we wouldn't expect there to be a direct federal funding benefit on the water sector. There might be a little bit there, but we're not counting on that in our outlook.","I think where there could be positive impact for our customers would be \u2013 as you probably well know, oftentimes the local and state muni budgets when they're under pressure or under constraint, one of the first areas they tend to go after in terms of deferring or delaying is water. And so, obviously, any alleviation of funding pressure for them on other types of infrastructure would obviously help us indirectly from a water standpoint. But we're not seeing a lot right now other than chatter. There's been no real activity that we've seen in terms of projects moving forward that weren't otherwise going, but we'll keep you updated as we go along.","John F. Walsh - Vertical Research Partners LLC","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we've reached the allotted time for questions.

[Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the call over to Phil De Sousa, Vice President of Investor Relations.","Phil De Sousa","Well, thanks, Jacky, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to Xylem's fourth quarter 2015 earnings conference call. With me today are Chief Executive Officer, Patrick Decker; and Interim Chief Financial Officer, Shashank Patel. They will provide their perspective on Xylem's fourth quarter and full year 2015 results and discuss the full year outlook for 2016. Following our prepared remarks, we will address questions related to the information covered on the call.","So with that \u2013 so that we will have enough time to address everyone on the call, I will ask that you please keep to one question and a follow-up and then return to the queue. We anticipate that today's call will last approximately one hour.

I'll turn the call over to our CEO, Partick Decker.","Patrick Decker","Thanks, Phil, and good morning everyone. Over the course of 2015, we faced a dynamic economic environment on a macro level and in key end markets. I'm quite pleased with our team's performance as we remained focused on executing against our long-term objectives. We responded effectively to changing conditions and ultimately closed out the year with another quarter of solid results.","We delivered at or above our guidance on several key metrics. Organic revenue grew 2% in the quarter, resulting in 2% organic revenue growth for the full year as well. Adjusted earnings per share increased 3% to $0.60 in the quarter, excluding foreign exchange translation. This brought our full year adjusted earnings to $1.85 per share, a 5% increase year-over-year, excluding foreign exchange translation. And we delivered free cash flow conversion of 105% driven by working capital improvement.","Importantly, I am encouraged by the fundamentals and underlying trends impacting our business today and in the years ahead. External factors such as steadily increasing spend on water infrastructure, growing demand for intelligent monitoring and control systems, and climate related initiatives that require our water expertise and ingenuity all bode well for sustained profitable growth at Xylem.","As we continue to advance the key growth initiatives we laid out during our Investor Day last year, mainly stepping up our commercial leadership, driving accelerated growth in emerging markets and increasing our investment in R&D and innovation, I am confident that we are well positioned to deliver that growth. That work will be complemented by our ongoing focus on continuous improvement and business simplification, which will be significant levers for long-term value creation.","Xylem has a balanced global portfolio that we expect will further benefit from a number of current and emerging trends. Here are a couple of examples. The perennial battle to increase spending on water infrastructure is gaining some traction here in the U.S. A number of efforts are underway to produce actionable plans to break through the historical barriers of financing, political risk, and competing priorities. The urgency of the need is further punctuated by flash points such as the tragic situation in Flint, Michigan and the flooding events that continue to occur in various parts of the country.","Xylem is actively engaged in several of these efforts, including those that are focused on unlocking private capital for infrastructure investment. In addition, on the heels of the Paris climate talks, governments around the world are developing action plans to achieve the carbon emission reduction they signed on to in that historic agreement. Given that the management of water is a notable contributor to global carbon emissions, the water industry has substantial opportunity to contribute to emission reduction goals.","In light of that, last quarter, we issued a report titled Powering the Wastewater Renaissance. This study outlines how the adoption of readily available wastewater management technologies can cut related emissions by nearly half. The analysis further concludes that 95% of the electricity related emissions abatement can be achieved at negative or neutral cost, resulting in a win-win scenario for our customers as well as the governing bodies that are seeking viable solutions to implement in the near term.","We believe these activities are positive indicators for the continued recovery we see in the public utility market, which constitutes roughly one-third of our global business. Improving market conditions and our strong execution enabled us to gain market share in this end market as we generated 8% organic growth in the fourth quarter. This follows a solid performance in the third quarter, when we delivered 5% year-over-year growth.","The industrial end market is also significant for Xylem. Similar to other companies in this space, we continue to experience the impact of some negative underlying market trends. For the full year, overall industrial was down 1% organically. This however was largely driven by the steep declines in oil and gas, which was down 40% in 2015 when most of the impact fell in the second half of the year. To be clear, despite the fact that oil and gas represented a relatively small portion of our business, the combination of such a severe drop and its high profit margin resulted in a significant impact on our 2015 results. Specifically, oil and gas reduced our revenues by approximately 1%, compressed our operating margin by 40 basis points, and reduced our earnings per share by $0.12.","Looking ahead, we expect those headwinds to continue at least until we begin to lap the initial declines we first experienced in the second quarter of last year. Then, we anticipate the headwinds to moderate somewhat in the second half of the year.","Overall, we anticipate challenging conditions in oil and gas to continue, but the impact should not be as severe as it was last year. In addition, we expect ongoing headwinds in the mining sector. Collectively, these two sectors now represent about 8% of our total revenue. We will continue to manage and ultimately optimize efficiency and performance through the inevitable economic cycles that occur within this end market.","Fortunately, Xylem is better positioned than many. Our industrial market exposure is more heavily weighted to the light industrial sector. In fact, that represents roughly 36% of our total revenue. The benefits of this sector mix are evident in our 2015 results. Excluding the severe impact of the oil and gas declines, the remainder of our industrial-related business grew 2% for the full year. Driving this growth was the continued demand for industrial water applications such as pressure boosting, equipment cooling, and fire suppression. The critical nature of these products and services and maintaining operations creates more resilience in the light industrial sector, providing a counterweight to the cyclical volatility seen in heavy industrials.","One final point, the leading position we have in certain consumer demand-driven applications such as beverage dispensing and marine and RV pump applications helped us deliver solid growth. With combined revenue of more than $120 million, these businesses grew 4% in 2015 and are well positioned to continue growing in 2016.","From a regional perspective, we remain optimistic about the U.S. markets, particularly the public utility and commercial building sectors, which we'll address in more detail later on the call. Europe is stabilizing, and we expect a more favorable outlook there. We have a strong presence in the public utility market in Europe, and we're already seeing early signs of success with key product launches in the residential and commercial building sectors.","The emerging markets present a more complex story. As all of you know, many of these markets are already showing signs of slower growth. After posting 9% organic growth during the first nine months of the year, our businesses in emerging markets grew 2% in the fourth quarter. There are a few dynamics at play here. First, the 2% organic growth compares with 14% organic growth in the prior year period. Underlying this delta is a pattern of choppy project deliveries that can easily cause distortions in quarterly year-over-year growth.","Second, our Applied Water segment declined 4% in the emerging markets in the quarter, driven in part by the slowdown in China's industrial and commercial markets. However, given that our business in China is more heavily weighted to the public utility end market, we do expect continued growth ahead albeit at a slower pace than in most recent years.","Shifting gears now, as I mentioned previously, we are still in the early chapters of a multi-year self-help story that will enable us to drive margin expansion. Our continuous improvement initiatives, which include Lean and Global Procurement, along with a sharper focus on driving business simplification, will result in significant operating margin improvement.","Today, G&A costs sit at 8.5% of revenue, down 120 basis points over the past two years, but still an opportunity. We will continue to attack these costs in 2016 and beyond, as we execute the business simplification plan we laid at Investor Day, targeting $60 million to $75 million of structural cost reduction over the next few years. Our expectation is to invest approximately $25 million in 2016, from which, we anticipate realizing $8 million in savings in the second half of the year and $15 million on an annualized basis. We will touch on this in more detail later in the call.","We are driving productivity within the business so we can fund the necessary investments to achieve our longer term objectives. This includes increasing our R&D investment for future growth, the targeted investments in the Middle East, China, and India we highlighted at our Investor Day, and accelerating capital deployment on two fronts: returning capital to shareholders and acquisitions. Today, we announced a 10% increase in dividend and the acquisition of Tideland Corporation, our second acquisition in as many quarters.","Let's turn to slide five and I'll cover capital deployment and the Tideland acquisition in more detail. With our strong cash flow generation and capital structure, we are well positioned to create more value for our shareholders. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 1.4 million shares for $50 million. For the full year, we repurchased 5.1 million shares for $175 million and we have about $430 million available under our authorized programs. We also paid $25 million in dividends to shareholders in the quarter, bringing our full year total to $102 million, reflecting a 10% increase per share year-over-year. Combined, this represents a 24% increase in return of capital to shareholders in 2015.","Earlier this week, we completed our acquisition of Tideland, a leading producer of smart analytic solutions in the coastal and ocean management sectors. More specifically, the company integrates systems intelligence technologies with tools to enable a wide variety of marine and environmental monitoring capabilities to an array of customers. These offerings fit well with our existing analytics portfolio. We intend to further integrate analytics tools from our current portfolio into their systems, including a direct tie-in with our recent fourth quarter acquisition of HYPACK. The result will be a broader range of systems intelligence solutions that we can provide to the coastal and ocean water sector. Growth in this area will continue to be driven by the customers' need to comply with increasing regulations for a variety of operations in this space.","The acquisitions of Tideland and HYPACK illustrate how we plan to bring together distinct products and services to build intelligence, full systems capability and significantly expand the market we currently serve.","With that, let me turn the call over to our Interim CFO, Shashank Patel, to walk you through the results and the company's financial position in more detail. Shashank?","Shashank Patel","Thanks, Patrick. And since you already covered some of these full year highlights, I will make some specific points and then dive further into our fourth quarter results. For the full year, revenue increased 2% on an organic basis, consistent with the midpoint of our guidance at the beginning of last year.","We saw solid growth in the public utility, commercial and residential markets, all up 4% organically. Industrial was down 1% primarily due to the significant declines we saw in oil and gas over the second half of the year. Agriculture was down 8%, as unfavorable weather, namely the severe flooding conditions in the Southern U.S., wiped out this year's season. As a reminder, agriculture represents 2% of our revenues.","Regionally, we generated the strongest growth in the emerging markets where we posted a 7% increase over the course of the year. China led the way here, growing 14%. Worth noting is that our Water Infrastructure segment grew 17%, driving 80% of the overall growth as the local trend to invest in and improve water quality and wastewater treatment continued. The U.S. and Western Europe markets each grew 1%. In the U.S., growth accelerated over the course of the year and hit a high for the year in the fourth quarter, whereas Europe was relatively stable throughout the year. Canada rounds out our geographic performance. There, significant declines in oil and gas resulted in a 13% decline in revenue.","As for margins, productivity actions and volume leverage more than offset material, labor and overhead inflation and unfavorable mix. Excluding FX translation, gross margin expanded 40 basis points and led to a 30 basis point improvement in operating margins. Embedded in this operating margin performance is an investment in selling capabilities in key growth markets, partially offset by a reduction in G&A costs.","We reported earnings per share this year of $1.85, an increase the 5%, excluding the unfavorable $0.22 impact from foreign exchange translation. Just a reminder that this 5% increase is on top of the 18% growth and record EPS in 2014, a solid indicator that we have set Xylem on the right path to improve financial returns.","Another similar indicator is our free cash flow performance. This year, we generated $347 million, an increase of 17%. We also achieved 105% conversion of net income. We continue to make progress on reducing our working capital across the business. Strong focused execution improved working capital as a percentage of revenue by 80 basis points, excluding the impact of foreign exchange translation. This improvement, coupled with our commitment to accelerate capital deployment, allowed us to increase the return of capital to shareholders by 24% in 2015. That includes our fourth consecutive dividend increase in as many years and a record $175 million of shares repurchases.","Turning to slide seven, I'll cover our fourth quarter performance. During the fourth quarter, we booked orders of $913 million, up 1% organically. I'll cover our performance by segment in a few minutes. For now, I'll focus commentary on our ending backlog. We entered 2016 with total backlog of $716 million. Excluding foreign exchange translation impact, backlog is up about 4%. Of the total, roughly $575 million is due to ship in 2016 and about $335 million is due to ship in the first quarter. Excluding the impact of FX translation, our current year backlog is down 2%.","Jumping back to the fourth quarter results, we generated revenue of $994 million, down 5% versus the prior year, including a $70 million headwind from foreign exchange translation. On an organic basis, revenue was up 2%.","From an end market perspective, we saw significant strength in both public utility and residential. Revenue from the public utility end market was up 8% with double digit growth in the U.S., Asia and the Middle East. Project deliveries and an improved U.S. markets, coupled with share gains, drove our performance across these regions. Residential was up 10%, primarily driven by market strength and share gains in the U.S., where we have about 50% of our customer base. Commercial was flat for the quarter, but against a tough prior year comparison of 8% growth. The story within commercial remains the same. We continue to benefit from a steady recovery in growth within the U.S. institutional building sector.","The industrial end market was down 2% due to the aforementioned oil and gas headwinds. Agriculture was down 12%. Operating margin was flat at 14.7%, but up 20 basis points excluding the headwind from foreign exchange translation. Cost reductions, including Lean Six Sigma, Global Procurement and business simplification savings, offset inflation, driving 140 basis point improvement in segment margins. Volume leverage on the 2% organic growth was more than offset by unfavorable mix.","Wrapping up on the consolidated results, solid organic revenue growth and execution against our cost reduction initiatives resulted in EPS of $0.60, an increase of 3% before the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange translation.","Now, let me provide more detail for each of our reporting segments. Please turn to slide eight. Water Infrastructure recorded orders of $559 million, up 2% organically. A couple business mix dynamics worth highlighting. First, treatment orders grew more than 20%, including a large $30 million project order in Saudi Arabia, as well as an increase in both North American project activity and win rates. Nearly offsetting order growth was the overall declining in our dewatering business, again reflecting the oil and gas weakness.","Our book-to-bill ratio was 0.89 in the quarter, the same as last year. Overall, we exited the quarter with backlog of $544 million, up 8% on an organic basis. Off this amount, approximately $430 million is due to ship in 2016 with $230 million shipping in the first quarter. This leaves us with longer term project backlog shippable in 2017 and beyond of $115 million. This is a 48% increase over what we had seen last year on an organic basis.","While this is a relatively small portion of our revenue, it is a leading indicator of market health and trend stability and provide some confidence in our generally short-cycled business. We reported revenue of $629 million, up 1% on an organic basis. Regionally, we saw growth led by the U.S. and the emerging markets, up 4% and 5% respectively. Western Europe grew a modest 1% and Canada declined 21% due to the impact of oil and gas weakness.","I would further summarize our revenue performance as follows. Transport applications, which include our water and wastewater pump and dewatering business, were up 2% overall. Public utility water and wastewater pump sales and services grew 11% during the quarter, demonstrating both healthy market conditions and the strength of our Flygt brand, which continues to increase its share position. We also saw a double digit growth in the public utility sector for our dewatering business driven by a relatively large project delivery and, to a lesser extent, disaster recovery services in the U.S. and UK.","And as we have addressed, the unfavorable impact of oil and gas dewatering applications were down nearly 40% in the quarter. Test applications finished the year with a strong up 4% with particular strong of Europe, up 9%, with growth driven by industrial lab applications and several wastewater facility projects in the Nordic countries. Additionally, our delivery of critical, analytical instrumentation used in China's river cleanup project drove local revenue growth up by 24%. Finally, treatment revenue was down 3%, as we lapped a few large water project deliveries in Latin America. Partially offsetting these headwinds were growth in the Middle East.","We are reporting operating income for our Water Infrastructure segment of $110 million and a record quarterly operating margin of 17.5%. Performance was driven by the increase in cost reductions of $19 million, driven by sourcing and Lean initiatives, as well as $2 million in restructuring savings. This increase was able to more than offset labor and material and overhead inflation, as well as the unfavorable mix driven by lower dewatering rental volumes.","Let's turn to slide nine. Applied Water recorded orders of $354 million, down 1% organically. As a reminder, this compares with 9% growth in the fourth quarter of 2014. A book-to-bill ratio was 0.97 in the quarter, which is in the range we have seen over the last four years. Overall, we exited the quarter with backlog of $172 million. Of this amount, about $105 million is due to ship in the first quarter of 2016, down approximately 14% on a constant currency basis, which we expect will mute growth in the first quarter.","Applied Water reported revenue of $365 million, up 3% on an organic basis. Regionally, we saw strong growth in the developed markets with the U.S. and Western Europe up 5% and 4% respectively. Emerging markets declined 4%. As expected, our biggest headwind came from China, which was down 18% after posting 16% growth over the first nine months of the year.","I would further summarize our revenue performance as follows: Building services grew 3% as we continued to benefit from the U.S. institutional building market on the commercial side and market share gains in residential. Growth in the commercial building market was muted overall by weakness in China. Industrial water grew 5%, largely driven by project strength in the U.S. and modestly improving conditions in project shipments in Europe. Lastly, irrigation, which represents less than 10% of Applied Water revenue, declined 12% driven by unfavorable weather conditions and the lapping of a strong quarter in 2014, when we delivered 25% growth.","Operating margin declined 10 basis points year-over-year to 13.4%, including 20 basis points of headwind from foreign exchange translation. Material, labor and overhead inflation and unfavorable mix were notable headwinds this quarter, partially offset by cost reductions.","Despite volume leverage on 3% organic growth, unfavorable mix associated with a single industrial project significantly impacted our margin performance this quarter. The Applied Water portion of this project was sold at a negative margin. However, the project margin for Xylem overall was positive and reflected in the Water Infrastructure segment.","Now, let's turn to slide 10 to cover the company's full year performance by segment. Let me start first with the Water Infrastructure segment. Revenue was $2.2 billion, up 1% organically driven primarily by growing strength in the public utility end market in the U.S., and the continued build-out of water and wastewater infrastructure in the emerging markets. We grew 1% in industrial, excluding the significant oil and gas headwind.","Operating margin declined 10 basis points year-over-year to 14.2%. While cost reductions more than offset inflation in the year, volume leverage on the 1% organic growth did not compensate for the unfavorable mix impact attributable to the significant decline in rental services to the oil and gas market.","Moving on to the Applied Water segment. Revenue was $1.4 billion, up 3% organically, due to strength in the U.S. commercial and residential markets as well as growth in industrial water applications, despite facing significant oil and gas headwinds. In commercial, 4% growth was driven by an improved U.S. institutional building market. Residential also grew 4% as strong performance came from improvement in the home construction market and market share gains. Partially offsetting this growth was weakness in the agriculture end market, which was down 8% due to unfavorable weather conditions and the lapping of a strong prior year.","Operating margin decreased 10 basis points year-over-year to 13.9% due to unfavorable foreign exchange translation impact. Excluding this impact, adjusted operating margin increased 20 basis points as cost reductions and volume leverage more than offset inflation and unfavorable mix.","Please turn to slide 11 and I will cover the company's financial position. Xylem maintains a strong cash position, with a balance of $680 million at the end of December. We remain committed to our balanced capital deployment strategy, which is to maintain and grow the business, while enhancing shareholder returns through dividends and share repurchases. During the fourth quarter, we paid $25 million in dividends and purchased $50 million in shares. We generated $165 million of free cash flow in the fourth quarter, largely reflecting improved working capital performance. Relative to the prior year, our free cash flow performance improved by $44 million. Lastly, our return on invested capital decreased by 30 basis points to 10.6%, which is primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange translation.","Now, please, turn to slide 12 and I'll turn it back over to Patrick to cover our 2016 expectations.","Patrick Decker","Thanks, Shashank. As I said earlier, we believe we are well positioned to make significant progress against our top priorities in 2016 in order to drive long-term profitable growth at Xylem. We're driving substantial change at Xylem to strengthen our commercial capabilities, taking specific actions to improve our customers' experience at each touch point we have with them. This includes driving more expertise through industry vertical selling, and simplifying our commercial processes.","We have focused plans to accelerate growth in emerging markets, targeting increased investment of about $30 million in the Middle East, China and India. We plan to increase our R&D investment in 2016 by 30 basis points to 50 basis points to advance innovation. And as we drive our continuous improvement work deeper into the organization, we expect our Lean and Global Procurement initiatives to generate gross savings of $120 million, an increase of roughly 20% year-over-year.","The growth rates I refer to on this slide all exclude the anticipated negative foreign exchange impacts. Looking at the year ahead, we expect to generate faster than market growth, delivering 2016 organic revenue growth of 2% to 4%. The recently completed acquisitions are expected to add an additional 1% of revenue growth. Given that we expect stable conditions across roughly 90% of our portfolio, including growth across all geographic regions, we believe we are positioned to exceed market growth, despite the ongoing headwinds from oil and gas and mining.","Our adjusted operating margin is expected to grow in the range of 50 basis points to 80 basis points overall, despite roughly 20 basis points of margin dilution from the acquisitions of HYPACK and Tideland. This dilution is driven by purchase price accounting impacts such as non-cash intangible amortization. Excluding the diluted impact of acquisitions, our operating margin is expected to expand by 70 basis points to 100 basis points.","We anticipate generating earnings per share of $1.95 to $2.05, which excludes restructuring and realignment costs of about $25 million, but this projection does include $0.04 of negative foreign currency translation impact. Excluding foreign exchange impact, EPS growth is expected to be in the range of 8% to 13%. Finally, we will continue to execute a disciplined approach to capital deployment, which is expected to result in free cash flow conversion greater than 100%. This also contemplates expected CapEx in the range of $120 million to $125 million.","Please turn to slide 13, this slide outlines our expectations for 2016 organic revenue by end market. Industrial, which represents 44% of total revenue, is expected to be flat to up low-single digits. This projection assumes low-single digit growth in light industrial applications and double-digit declines in oil and gas and mining applications.","The public utility sector, which constitutes 33% of our total revenue, is expected to grow at a mid-single digit rate. Here, we anticipate growth led by the U.S. and continued investment across emerging markets. We also expect market conditions in Europe to remain stable and that the UK's multi-year AMP 6 cycle of infrastructure investment accelerates late in the second half of the year.","For the commercial market, we see growth in the mid-single digit range. Our expectation is that growth in the U.S. institutional building market continues to be here and that conditions in Europe modestly improve. Lastly, while we expect urbanization to drive growth in emerging markets such as the Middle East, we also anticipate weaker conditions in China. Residential should grow in the low-to-mid single-digit range driven by strength in the U.S. albeit at lower levels seen in 2015. We also expect continued low-single digit growth in Europe. Finally, agriculture will likely see a modest recovery from the significant weather events in 2015.","Please turn to slide 14 and Shashank will provide some calendarization insight for the year.","Shashank Patel","Thanks, Patrick. As we have done in prior years, I'd like to highlight the seasonal profile of our business, which you can see on the left side of the slide and our perspective on 2016 on the right. As for the first quarter of 2016, we expect 2% organic growth coupled with approximately 1% growth from acquisition. Foreign exchange translation is anticipated to be a 4% headwind.","As for operating margin, we anticipate it to be flat year-over-year as the oil and gas and mining headwinds will continue to offset volume leverage and cost savings. Our expectations also assume a modest level of increased investment for our growth initiatives. We are assuming that both Global Procurement and Lean savings accelerate through the year, whereby we realize about $20 million on gross savings in the first quarter and expect to deliver about $120 million for the full year.","Now, I'll turn the call back over to Patrick for closing comments. Please turn to slide 15.","Patrick Decker","Thanks, Shashank. So, we had a strong finish in 2015 as we faced some challenging conditions. Again, I want to thank our team for their performance as their focused execution against our strategic priorities helped us to deliver on the commitments we set forth at the beginning of 2015. I am confident in their ability and commitment to deliver against our organic growth targets and margin expansion opportunities.","Xylem is in a very strong financial position and we will continue to drive our balanced and accelerated capital deployment plans. I am very encouraged as I look ahead to 2016 and beyond. No doubt there are challenges in the near-term but I am confident that our team will continue to execute with operational discipline to drive our success. That commitment and focus will provide the foundation for future growth for Xylem and our shareholders.","With that, operator, we are ready to open the line for questions. [Operator Instructions]","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.","Deane Dray","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Patrick Decker","Good morning, Deane.","Shashank Patel","Good morning, Deane.","Deane Dray","Hey. So, you really checked all the boxes this quarter. If I look at it, you've got in line EPS, you've got free cash flow, you do a dividend boost, you do buybacks, you get a deal done, so hopefully you still got some feel-goods left for the rest of the quarters in 2016.","So, anyway, the question I wanted to focus on first is, interested in hearing a bit more about this large shipment that you disclosed in the Applied Water business, because it sounds as though the order spanned both Applied and Water Infrastructure, which is good to see, that suggests you're doing cross-selling. But the way the P&L gets tallied, Applied ended up showing a negative margin. So, to kind of put this project into context, is this solution selling? Do you have other business like this? And how do you \u2013 if you net the two out, how does that project look?","Patrick Decker","Sure. Well, thanks for the comments opening there, Deane, as well, we appreciate it. On this project \u2013 this is a project actually that has been in backlog for multiple years. And there've been some delays in the customer job site, in terms of ultimately delivering it. So it's been in backlog for more than a couple of years. The margin was net positive and attractive for us. I wouldn't say we have other projects like this that are out there. I mean, it was fine. It was an element of some solution sale. It was a bundled offering for an LNG application. But, again, it's a bit of a one-off. It's a large project and it's going to span over a few quarters here in terms of shipping it out.","Deane Dray","Got it. And then, the follow-up question is not so much Xylem-specific. But I'm really struck by and interested in hearing your comments on the ramifications for this water crisis unfolding in Flint, Michigan, and again, it's on the front page of the journal today...","Patrick Decker","Yes.","Deane Dray","So, how do you feel? What's your sense of what happens and the response within the municipal water community? Is going to be further congressional pressure here? What went wrong? What does this mean for the need for smart water networks? I know that's been a big focus for you and...","Patrick Decker","Yes.","Deane Dray","...just how you think this plays out? And what are the ramifications for spending on this backlog in U.S. Water Infrastructure?","Patrick Decker","Sure. It's a great question, Deane. And, as I had mentioned in my opening comments, I mean, it's obviously a tragic situation there in Flint. As you'll recall, we had similar situations, though maybe different causes in Toledo not long before that. And you've got a number of these flooding conditions that we see from a resilience standpoint. There is infrastructure that needs to be invested in.","As you've been following the water space for a long time, it's always difficult for any of us to predict the timing of when this will unlock some of the pent-up demand that's out there. But, I do believe, that there will likely be increased regulatory scrutiny. I think that will also lead to some increase in backlog movement in various communities across the U.S. It always seems to happen slower than any of us think it should occur. And so, it's difficult to predict kind of over what timeframe, we think, it will begin to free up. But I do think this will be a collection of flash points that begins to move things forward.","Deane Dray","That's really helpful. Just to sneak one last question in, the deal is another focus in the water analytics side, hydrology. What's the pipeline look for M&A?","Patrick Decker","Yeah. So, we're excited by both the HYPACK and the Tideland acquisitions. They are very nice additions to our portfolio and really tie in nicely with the capabilities we already have in the analytics space in that area of hydrology. The pipeline overall \u2013 I mean, that's only one vertical obviously that we're focusing in on. If I go back to Investor Day, we talked about smart water infrastructure or systems intelligence. We talked about advance treatment in industrial and we talked about making sure that we defended and protected some of our unassailable kind of core franchises. So, the pipeline continues to build. It's very attractive. It's pretty broad and deep.","As you know, it's always difficult to predict the timing of when things come forward. It always takes two to tango. But I am very encouraged by the work the team has done to further build out that pipeline and lines up really nicely with the value mapping work that we shared at Investor Day.","Deane Dray","Thank you.","Patrick Decker","Thank you, Deane.","Shashank Patel","Thanks, Deane.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Rose with Wedbush Securities.","David Rose","Good morning, both. Thank you for...","Shashank Patel","Good morning, David.","Patrick Decker","Good morning.","David Rose","Just a couple follow-ups on the restructuring actions, the $25 million. Can you break this down? And is this incremental to 2017 and 2018? How should we think about it? And then second question is, is your mention of unlocking private capital, I mean, you're overall in it, and I was hoping that you can elaborate on that.","Patrick Decker","Sure.","Shashank Patel","Yeah. This is Shashank. I will take the first question. As far as the $25 million, it is incremental, and it generates about $8 million savings in 2016 probably back-end loaded towards the second half. As far as where those actions are, I mean, that is restructuring and realignment. And it's in the areas of footprint, it's in the areas of the G&A and business simplification initiatives we had outlined during the Investor Day.","David Rose","And I'm sorry, how much is in Applied Water and how much is in Water Infrastructure?","Shashank Patel","Yeah. We don't \u2013 actually, we don't disclose how much of that is broken up by segment, but the total is $25 million.","Patrick Decker","One of the reasons for that, David, is some of these are shared locations, where it will impact both businesses.","David Rose","Okay. Great. That's helpful.","Patrick Decker","Yeah. On your second question around unlocking private capital, our role there is not necessarily being actively involved in financing and those type of activities. What I'm really alluding to there is we're involved in \u2013 it's our role as the thought leader in the water space, we are involved in a couple of efforts with other organizations in helping further this movement around things like public\/private partnerships, other models that exist in other parts of the world that are not quite as commonplace here in the U.S. We believe that there is a large role for the private sector to play in driving attractive investments there. And so, helping in some of the education effort in that area is really the role that I'm referring to.","David Rose","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.","Patrick Decker","Okay. Thank you.","Shashank Patel","Thanks, David.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones with Stifel.","Nathan Jones","Good morning, everyone.","Patrick Decker","Good morning.","Shashank Patel","Good morning.","Nathan Jones","I think, Patrick, in your prepared remarks, you talked about the public utility market. And I think you commented that U.S., Middle East and Asia were up double digits, and did not make any reference to Europe. Given Europe is the biggest end market there, could you give us some color on what you're seeing in the public utility market in Europe and what your expectations are for 2016 there?","Patrick Decker","Sure. Yeah. So, it's \u2013 we saw Europe really stabilize over the back half of the year, and I would describe it as stable at this point. I mean, it is still a mixed \u2013 it's a mixed bag. I would say we have not seen the continued deterioration in the southern part of Europe that we'd experienced in the kind of first three quarters of the year. That stabilizes well. So, I think we're on fairly solid footing.","One of the things that will benefit us in 2016, of course, is the impact in the UK of the AMP 6 infrastructure investments cycle there that you are all probably be quite familiar with in. That cycle was launched, I think, April 1 of this past year. It takes about 15 months or so for all of the engineering and design and spec work to happen on the part of our customers. And then, we really begin to see the revenue come our way in late 2016 through kind of 2018 or so. So, I think net-net, it's stable in Europe and kind of low-single digit growth for 2016.","Nathan Jones","Okay. Thanks. And if we just look at the light industrial, part of industrial, I think we're all fairly comfortable that oil and gas and mining are not going to be very good in 2016. You're talking about low-single digit growth there, which you need to get that flat or maybe up slightly. Can you talk about the different dynamics that are going on within that market that have you able to grow in what's probably a flat to may be slightly down global industrial market?","Patrick Decker","Sure. And that's a great question. I'd say, first of all, when you think about the nature of what the light industrial sector is, customers in that area are quite diverse. But across the board, they are very much focused in on energy efficiency to reduce their operating cost. Our volume there is not really like it would be in heavy industry. It's not really tied to the factory output, but it's rather more of an ongoing minimal operating cost. These are not large capital outlays that are required in the part of our customers. And so, it doesn't tend to be big on the radar screen, other than again, they play a role \u2013 these products play a role in helping them reduce their operating costs through energy efficiency.","So, we think we're pretty resilient. I think that was demonstrated through 2015, when that part of the business again was up 2%, organically. And we've seen really nothing here in the latter part of 2015 or early 2016 that would change our view on that.","Nathan Jones","How much of that light industrial market is driven by the regulatory environment rather than the operating environment?","Patrick Decker","I wouldn't say it's a large driver in that area. I mean, I would say that as some of the energy efficiency regulations that have already been put in place in the EU come to the U.S. over the course of the next few years, then certainly there will be somewhat of a driver there. But I wouldn't say it's a big driver today. It's really more just, again, the managing their operating cost.","Nathan Jones","Okay. Thanks very much for the help.","Patrick Decker","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Connors with Boenning & Scattergood.","Ryan Connors","Great. Thanks for taking my questions.","Patrick Decker","Sure.","Ryan Connors","Wanted to talk a little bit about the kind of price cost situation in this environment, if you might expand on that for us. Obviously, some of the raw material prices have come down and if you could talk about that impact on your P&L vis-\u00e0-vis what you're seeing on the pricing side, that'd be helpful.","Shashank Patel","Yeah. So, this is Shashank. From a pricing perspective, we expect fairly neutral conditions. So flattish pricing 2015 going into 2016. Clearly, we'd like to see more price in 2016, but it will be challenged based on current commodity environment. So that's a \u2013 so, as I said, it's flattish but, from a savings perspective, that does help because we do buy a lot of raw material, and the current environment helps drive more out of Global Procurement, and our target in 2016 is for higher cost-outs from Global Procurement perspective, as well as business simplification.","Patrick Decker","And I would just add, Ryan. I think that, as we've talked a little bit in the past, there's probably less than 10% of our revenue that is in end markets that are more challenged from a pricing standpoint that really being in the ag and resi part of the market. We continue to manage through that and maintain, I think, a very good discipline from a pricing standpoint. The area that we would suggest, over time, you would suspect the supply\/demand favorability to work in our direction would be on the public utility sector. But we're still so early in the recovery there that we're not really counting on that kind of price dynamic in 2016.","Ryan Connors","Okay. And so, might you \u2013 I mean, would it be \u2013 would you hazard a guesstimate at what kind of a basis point tailwind raw materials could be to the margins, if you are able to say hold your price flat in aggregate?","Shashank Patel","I would suspect it's probably about 20 basis points to 30 basis points.","Ryan Connors","Okay. Okay. That's helpful. And then my other question, just real big picture, Patrick. I mean, you issued your 2016 guidance today and talked a lot about some of the puts and takes and some of the positives. But what do you view as kind of the biggest risk factor that could cause things to not play out the way you've laid out today as you look out over the next 11 months here?","Patrick Decker","Sure. I would say that the area that we kind of called out in our prepared comments as clearly going to be \u2013 we've already built some of this into our outlook, and that is continued downward pressure in both oil and gas and mining. Again, those are now only 8% of our total revenue, so it's not a large portion of our business. But certainly, if we saw mining drop off dramatically, then that would put pressure on our top line. But we feel that we've reflected that in the bottom end of the organic growth range.","In terms of profitability, again, as we mentioned in our comments, these businesses are very high profit margin for us. Again, we feel that we've taken it in consideration in our guidance, but obviously, there are other cost out actions that we would take in the event that we saw that. And that's certainly something we've learned from this past year in our dewatering business.","Ryan Connors","That's great. Thanks so much.","Patrick Decker","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chip Moore with Canaccord.","Chip Moore","Good morning. Thanks.","Patrick Decker","Good morning, Chip.","Chip Moore","So, you touched on muni trends in the U.S. and Europe. Maybe we can move to emerging markets a bit. What gives you the confidence, I guess, that infrastructure spending holds up over there? And then maybe to follow up, talk about some of the softness you've seen on the commercial side?","Patrick Decker","Sure, on the \u2013 so, on the public utility side for emerging markets, the real key drivers there certainly at the moment, and we're still seeing this in our quoting activity and bidding activity, is the \u2013 again the fact that in our largest emerging markets, the whole issue of access to water and sustainability there are top policy issues and concerns, whether it'd be in China, whether it'd be in the Middle East, whether it'd be in India. And so, we are certainly not seeing any significant downward pressure there or slowing down of those large projects. But that certainly is something we're keeping a very close mindful eye on.","As we did indicate in our guidance around emerging markets and we saw it in the fourth quarter, certainly, a significant headwind and pressure on the commercial building side, especially in China, as well as some of the impact of lower commodity prices on the industrial business there in China as well as in Latin America. So, again, in our guide for 2016, we feel that we've taken a pretty balanced approach in that area. But again, we'll keep a close eye on that and modulate our cost base accordingly across the rest of the portfolio.","Shashank Patel","And just to add a little bit of color to that, for emerging markets in 2015, we delivered about 7% growth and it did slow down in Q4 primarily due to China. As we look towards 2016, we kind of moderated that to a mid-single digit growth. And certainly, we factored in the slowness in China especially on the commercial building side. But then, we got investments going in Middle East, South Africa as we've talked about, as well as we have some large project deliveries in India that help the overall emerging market picture.","Chip Moore","That's great. That's helpful. And maybe just a follow-up on oil and gas. Dewatering comps get better in the second half, 40% decline this year. I think you called out double-digit decline next year. Maybe you can just talk about sensitivities and what you're baking in there for declines on oil and gas. Thanks, folks.","Patrick Decker","Sure. Yeah. So, we've built in about a 30% impact in decline in the first half, and then obviously that stabilizes over the course of the full year. And so, it blends out in that kind of low-teen decline for all of 2016. And we've also factored in about a 10% decline in mining in that outlook.","Chip Moore","Great. Thanks.","Patrick Decker","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thielman with D.A. Davidson.","Brent Thielman","Hi.","Patrick Decker","Good morning, Brent.","Brent Thielman","I think most of my questions have been answered. But a question on Canada, it's shown some pretty sharp declines for a couple of quarters now. How large is Canada for you? And when do we start to see those comparisons ease?","Phil De Sousa","I'll give you guys \u2013 so this is Phil. I'm just going to just jump in here real quick. So just to put into perspective the declines that we've seen in Canada, both, fourth quarter and full year completely almost entirely tied to that oil and gas decline that we've got there. And so, for the year, of the top of my head, I want to say, it's down 13% \u2013 15% or so for the year. And in terms of size, it's about $150 million in revenue.","Brent Thielman","Okay. Great.","Phil De Sousa","And that's Canada overall, not the oil and gas within Canada, just to be clear.","Brent Thielman","Got it. Thanks, Phil.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Konigsberg with Vertical Research.","Brian Konigsberg","Yes. Hi. Good morning.","Patrick Decker","Good morning, Brian.","Shashank Patel","Good morning, Brian.","Brian Konigsberg","This might sound like a little bit of a crazy question considering the backdrop, but under the scenario where oil prices do say improve just modestly, and you do get a supply response out of the U.S., I'm just curious, maybe two things. Where do you think that oil prices actually need to go to, to actually initiate a supply response? And how quickly would you guys benefit, if that was to happen?","Patrick Decker","Yeah, Brian. I would say \u2013 I mean, I wouldn't want to kind of put a dollar amount out there in terms of the oil price to go there. But, the key is, it needs to be substantial enough that there is a meaningful increase in oil rigs. That's really the high correlator for us. And I think also, given our heavy exposure on the fracking side, again, I think that we would need to see a pretty notable move upwards in oil prices for us to be able to see a meaningful recovery there.","So, I don't want to sound too dour or sour on that because I do believe that, once we get a lift, and there will be a lift at some point down the road, the teams in that part of our business have done a fantastic job at managing the cost base, so we will certainly see a very healthy incremental leverage when we see any growth there. But we're not counting on any of that here in 2016.","Brian Konigsberg","Sure. Understood. And next, can you maybe touch a little bit more on the free cash flow. You're looking for 100% plus conversion. Maybe you just give us the outlook as far as what are the kind of meaningful contributors. Obviously, you've got D&A. I mean, are you counting on working capital coming through or are there other items we should be thinking about?","Shashank Patel","Yeah. I can take that one. And it is over 100% and the drivers there are the normal generation of cash plus, on the working capital side, we showed good progress in second half. That momentum continues and that momentum will continue for the full year so we expect \u2013 that's why we expect over 100% is all the working capital areas such as we had good progress on inventory and accounts payable. On the AR side, we actually got hurt a little bit with the heavy shipment in December. But that's an area we continue to attack as far as pass-through receivables and we saw a good progress there in the fourth quarter as well.","Brian Konigsberg","Great. If I could just sneak one last in, what's the update on status on CFO search?","Patrick Decker","Sure. Yeah. So, we've had a lot of interest in the role. Interviewed a large number of experienced public company CFO candidates. We're down now to the short strokes. And so, I'm confident we're going to be announcing something here in the very near future here.","Brian Konigsberg","Great. Thank you very much.","Patrick Decker","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nick Prendergast with BB&T.","Nicholas Prendergast","Hi. Good morning.","Patrick Decker","Good morning.","Nicholas Prendergast","I just had a quick question about your emerging markets. And I know you touched on this in the prepared remarks, but I'm not sure I entirely got it. You noted that growth was 7% in the year. It slowed down to, I believe, around 2% in Q4. What exactly drove that again?","Patrick Decker","Yeah. That was predominantly the sharp decline that we had in commercial building and industrial in China in the quarter, and we also had a tough prior year comp as well. We had quite a large growth in the fourth quarter last year in emerging markets.","Nicholas Prendergast","Okay. And then, if I heard correctly, in the Q&A, I think you said you've kind of moderated your view in emerging markets from the 7% in 2015 to somewhere around mid-single digits in 2016. Is that correct? And then, I guess, what gives you confidence that that will continue, and you don't continue to suffer from this China slowdown or whatever?","Patrick Decker","Sure. Yeah. That is correct in terms of what we laid out. And I think the \u2013 again, what we see there is confidence. I mean, first of all, I would say, I wouldn't focus too much on any one quarter because, again, the large of our business in emerging markets is still projects given these new greenfield things that are being invested and those can be choppy in terms of quarter-to-quarter movement or year-over-year comparisons. But again, we think that it's continued strength in public utility in China over the course of the full year, and it's the benefits that we're seeing from the investments we're making in the Middle East. And then, lastly, you may recall that last year we announced a $40 million project win in India. And a large piece of that ships out in 2016.","Nicholas Prendergast","Got it. Okay. Thank you very much.","Patrick Decker","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano with Cowen.","Joseph Giordano","Hey, guys.","Patrick Decker","Good morning.","Joseph Giordano","I actually can't believe I'm asking this question, but can you kind of refresh everyone on weak dollar implications for your business as expectations seem to be shifting a little bit here?","Shashank Patel","Yeah. I will take that one. As far as, from a euro perspective, which was a big headline about a year ago, the euro today is trading roughly what it was on the average for last year. Where we see the foreign exchange impact in 2016 is probably the British pound, the Aussie dollar and the Canadian dollar impacting us as well as emerging market currencies. There's some softness there which kind of blessed during the fourth quarter, still is there, and we've baked all of that in. And that's where we see the challenge. We do not \u2013 as long as the euro holds, we don't see the headwind from the euro like we did a year ago.","Joseph Giordano","No. I mean, if we're getting into a situation where people think the dollar is going to weaken going forward and \u2013 weaken versus the euro, how is that going to benefit you guys?","Phil De Sousa","Joe, let me just jump in here. Last year, we kind of gave the \u2013 a better rule-of-thumb schedule, if you would. If you want to kind of do it based on the outlook or based on where we are here in terms of the calendar, you basically think about it net-net, about for every [ph] cent (57:36) move in the euro, you got about $0.01, if you would, benefit to us or, if you would, headwind to us at the bottom line. So, it's about a penny for penny.","Shashank Patel","That's for the full year.","Phil De Sousa","For the full year.","Patrick Decker","Yeah, and I \u2013 obviously , as you well know, Joe, and everybody on the call knows, it's such an uncertain environment right now from a currency standpoint that we simply snap the rates here based on where we are today. And we'll continue to be transparent on moves either direction on EPS impact.","Joseph Giordano","Perfect. And then on the utility side, can you kind of talk about what you're seeing in larger CapEx-type projects versus what you are seeing in repair and replacement? More on \u2013 I guess, more on the order side, probably more on the forward look.","Patrick Decker","Sure. Yeah. I mean, we continue to see very attractive increase in quoting and bidding activity. We're seeing some increase in our win rates in that area as well. We are \u2013 we aren't seeing a major shift in the mix of our business just yet in terms of project versus more of the repair and maintenance. And part of the reason is the fact that as we still see that some customers kind of kicking the can down the road. We've seen a nice uptick in our break and fix part of the market as well. And so, that piece continues to grow quite nicely.","I would again reiterate, although it's a small portion of our revenue in a given year, our backlog shippable in 2017 and beyond is up 48%. And so, again, a small portion of revenue, but it's historically been a leading indicator as to what the growth should look like in terms of momentum two years, three years out. And so, I would be concerned if I saw that trend going the other direction. It just continued to build over the course of the last year as we've given you those numbers.","Shashank Patel","And just to add a little bit \u2013 yeah. On the treatment side of our business, in the fourth quarter, we did see plus 20% on the order side. Granted that's longer lead time and that's also leading into the 2017 backlog, but we did see strength in treatment.","Joseph Giordano","Yeah. Okay. And if I can sneak one more, on the deal that you've done on the analytic side, outside of near term dilution from the purchase price and allocation and things like that, how do you see margins of those businesses at scale kind of comparing to the segment average before this?","Patrick Decker","Yeah. Sure. So, without giving specifics on any one deal, I would say that to your point, as we get to the noise of the non-cash items that go through EPS, these deals we've done will be in line with our operating margins as a company, once we factor in synergies and other benefits. And those margins become even more accretive quite frankly, as we do further deals in the space because of the knock-on synergies and blended margins that we obtain.","Joseph Giordano","Great. Thanks, guys.","Patrick Decker","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Cassil with Seaport Global Securities.","Ryan Cassil","Good morning, guys.","Patrick Decker","Good morning.","Ryan Cassil","Most of my questions have been answered, but maybe you could talk about the book-and-ship business. It looks like you're anticipating that being a higher percentage of sale in 2016 or at least in the first quarter. And it's at a time when customers are being cautious on inventories and visibility as well. What gives you the confidence there on the short lead times stuff?","Shashank Patel","So I think \u2013 and you're right we are counting on a high level book-and-ship business and that's tied to the 2% to 4% growth we expect. And specifically the areas that we have a high book-and-ship for example, the Applied Water segment and that's driven by new products that we've actually launched and introduced over the last couple of years, and those affect both the European market and the U.S. market. So, that's going to drive that higher level of book-and-ship activity in the year.","Ryan Cassil","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Patrick Decker","Thank you.","Shashank Patel","Thanks, Ryan.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Robert Barry with Susquehanna.","Robert Barry","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Patrick Decker","Good morning.","Shashank Patel","Good morning.","Robert Barry","Thanks for taking the question. Just a couple of things, one on the tax rate. I think at the Analyst Day, you guided that it should be 21% kind of through 2020. I saw it was 18% in the quarter and you're guiding it to 20% for 2016. Is there anything to comment there? Is there more progress being made on tax initiatives? Or how should we think about that and in the context of the long-term guide too?","Shashank Patel","Yeah. The overall tax rate, and we are guiding to the 20% range realizing that any quarter is impacted by the mix of where the profit is from a global perspective because the tax rates do move around. But based on the tax structure we have and based on the mix that we projected in 2016, we're basically guiding to the same roughly 20%, it's on average 20%. As I said, it moves. It does move slightly quarter-to-quarter.","Robert Barry","Right. I mean, is the driver just based on the planned mix of business this year or should we now be thinking based on initiatives that the tax rate ought to track better?","Shashank Patel","It's the mix of the \u2013 the regional mix of the business is the driver.","Robert Barry","Got you. And then just finally, maybe if you could unpack the mid-single digit growth that you see in the public utility, how that's kind of shaped out between the transport treatment versus test verticals?","Patrick Decker","Sure. So, I would say that, on a relative basis, to that mid-single digit, we would expect that there be a slightly higher growth rate than that in transport and treatment. And I would say that the \u2013 thinking about the test side of the business, that would be kind of in line with what we guided to there. And then obviously, what kind of pulls that down a bit would be the dewatering piece of the business, which is still going to be dealing with the oil and gas and mining lap.","Robert Barry","Got you. Okay. Great. Thank you.","Patrick Decker","Thank you.","Operator","That was our final question. And now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Patrick Decker for any additional or closing remark.","Patrick Decker","Great. Thank you. Well, we appreciate the continued interest by everybody. Thanks for joining on the call today. Safe travels between now and the next time we see you, all. And we look forward to updating you on the next earnings call.

And I will turn the call over to our CEO, Patrick Decker.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us to review our first quarter results. We started off the year well, delivering solid results in the first quarter that were in line if not slightly better than our expectations. Once again our diversified product portfolio and end market exposure helped to balance our performance. This positions us well to deliver on our full year commitments.","We entered the quarter facing some challenging year-over-year comparisons, namely in our businesses serving the public utility sector. While those tough comps are reflected in our results, we remain encouraged by the underlying fundamentals in that end market, which I'll get to in a few moments.","Our Sensus business is off to a great start this year, delivering strong top line growth. We are continuing to integrate this business with early work underway to begin executing against the promising revenue and cost synergies we discussed at our recent Investor Day.","Lastly, our teams executed well. Our focus on driving productivity initiatives delivered a 33% year-over-year increase and continuous improvement savings in the quarter, further demonstrating that we are still in the early chapters of our self-help story. This progress enabled us to offset cost inflation and continue to invest in strategic growth initiatives.","At our Investor Day last month, we had a comprehensive discussion about our objectives and long term plans as well as market outlook. So for the benefit of those who weren't able to join us, I thought I'd touch on a few of the key points we made there and talk about our results for the quarter in that context.","A primary theme of our discussion in Raleigh was how we were driving growth. This is a critical lens through which we are prioritizing our activities. And we have a number of actions underway to accelerate profitable growth.","First, as we discussed there, we've made two significant organizational changes that are realigning sales teams and businesses to take better advantage of our scale and our broad product and service offerings. We've combined Xylem analytics, Sensus, and Visenti to create one optimized business that focuses on sensing technologies. This is a powerful combination that will enable to us to better leverage the strengths and capabilities of each entity and move faster in developing smart solutions for customers.","Second, we consolidated our various Water Infrastructure and Applied Water sales teams across North America into one commercial team that is now organized around what we refer to as industry verticals. Said another way, common customer sets. This structure will make it easier for customers to do business with us, because they have one point of contact who can provide easy access to our full portfolio of solutions that are relevant to their business.","We've already done this in Europe and the emerging markets, and the results give us confidence in the value of this structure. These organization moves are well underway. And we expect both to be growth accelerators.","Now as I mentioned earlier, our diverse end market exposure continues to benefit our overall performance. During the quarter, our total pro forma organic revenue growth, which includes Sensus, was up 1%. Our Sensus business delivered a 7% increase with growth across the water, electric, and gas sectors.","On an organic basis for base Xylem, revenue was down 1% for the quarter, primarily reflecting a particularly difficult year-over-year comparison, as we generated a 12% increase in the public utility sector globally in the prior year period.","We do continue to see signs of strength in public utilities. Orders were up 3% in the quarter, primarily driven by public utilities, and treatment orders more than double that. In fact, the treatment bidding pipeline was up double digits. And as I mentioned before, this project pipeline is a strong leading indicator for the longer term health of the public utility sector. Mark will give some more details on this in a few minutes.","So the demand in public utilities continued to be robust. And we expect that to manifest in stronger revenue growth later in the year and in 2018 and beyond. And with the increased exposure to this end market that Sensus provides, we're better positioned to benefit from what we believe will be a period of sustained growth.","Another pillar of our strategy is to drive growth in emerging markets. This is an area where we see momentum building after a period of softness. And importantly, we're very encouraged by the longer term growth prospects.","During the first quarter, orders were up 14% in emerging markets and revenue grew 3%. This is building off the early signs of growth that we saw in the fourth quarter and bolsters our confidence in being able to achieve our objective for the year and longer term.","In China, a year ago we faced very challenging conditions. But our team remained focused on our long term objectives. And now we're realizing the benefits, as conditions are beginning to stabilize and our business returns to growth. Revenue was up 4% in the quarter, and momentum is picking up in orders. We're also continuing to increase our product localization and we've expanded our supply chain there.","India continues to be a standout and we are growing our team there to take full advantage of the opportunities. Momentum in both revenue and orders continues to grow, as the government's commitment to investing in infrastructure supports a longer term growth thesis.","The Middle East continues to be a challenged market, but we remain positive on the long term prospects, given the obvious needs there: water scarcity, infrastructure demand, continued growth in construction, and more. In fact the project pipeline funnel in the Middle East is strengthening, particularly in the areas of construction and building services. Orders in the quarter were up 9% and we see that momentum continuing.","Shifting gears, another part of our growth strategy that we discussed at Investor Day is our focus on strengthening innovation and technology. One of the ways that we're accelerating our progress in this area is by building a broad-based ecosystem of partners to bring together ideas, capabilities, and new products to help solve our customers' challenges and add value to their operations.","We're doing this with a more integrated approach to our own internal R&D efforts by partnering with a wide range of academic and research institutions and by working directly with customers and other partners who can help us bring value-add solutions to the market more quickly.","Let me provide a couple of examples. Last week we announced a new agreement to be the exclusive distributor of Pure Technologies' water applications in key emerging market regions. We will sell these advanced solutions in the Middle East, India, Singapore, and Malaysia, primarily in the public utility and industrial sectors. Pure's portfolio of solutions is designed to address several of the more challenging pain points we know our customers are struggling to solve, such as non-revenue water, operational efficiency, and asset utilization.","Another example is the agreement we entered into this past quarter with our customer DC Water, a widely regarded thought leader in the water utility space in the U.S. This agreement outlines specific areas of collaboration on a wide range of research and future innovation initiatives. This includes field driven pilots that focus on new treatment technologies and increasing the productivity and resilience of their operations. We kicked off the collaboration by delivering their first Flygt Concertor pump for installation at their flagship treatment plant. This serves as an important reference case in North America.","Finally, our Sensus integration is well on track to accelerate our work in the area of smart water infrastructure. As we discussed at Investor Day, we are confident that we will deliver significant revenue synergies by leveraging the systems intelligence capabilities of Sensus to develop new offerings for Xylem's customers. Our teams are making good progress. And we expect to be piloting prototypes of new solutions at customer locations sometime during this summer.","To finish up on our first quarter results, let me quickly touch on our ongoing progress in the area of continuous improvement. As I already mentioned, our teams delivered a substantial increase in cost savings in the quarter, which enabled us to fund the investments needed to achieve our longer term value creation objectives. We are expanding training in various continuous improvement practices, which will further drive a productivity for growth mindset deeper into the organization. We are well on our way to achieving our full year goals in this area.","Our adjusted EBITDA was up 100 basis points to 16.2%. At the bottom line we generated adjusted earnings per share of $0.39 in the quarter, an increase of 17% year over year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange translation. We delivered solid improvement in free cash flow, which positions us well to deliver another year of free cash flow conversion in excess of 110% of net income.","Finally, we are raising our full year earnings guidance to reflect our updated assumption for foreign exchange impact, which has strengthened recently. We increased our adjusted earnings per share by $0.03 at both ends of the range to $2.23 to $2.38 per share.","So we're off to a good start in 2017. Our teams have made good progress, and we're encouraged by the momentum we see building in the marketplace and across our business. This gives us confidence in our ability to deliver on our full year commitments.","So with that I'll now turn it over to Mark for more details on the quarter.","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Thanks, Patrick. Let's turn to slide 5. I'm very pleased that we got off to a good start in the first quarter. And we've built solid momentum heading into Q2. Overall, revenues were up 26% in the quarter. On a pro forma organic basis this represents 1% growth with Sensus contributing 7% and the base Xylem business down 1%. Additionally, foreign exchange reduced revenues by $11 million or 1 point.","From an organic perspective, the 1% decrease in base Xylem revenues largely reflects a 4% decline in the public utility end market versus a strong prior year comparison that was driven by timing of project deliveries and favorable weather conditions. Partially offsetting this decline was strong growth in residential, up 14%, and a modest increase in commercial of 2%. Industrial revenues were down 2% overall, roughly in line with our expectations entering the quarter.","Market conditions were soft in our Applied Water business. And last year's results also benefited from a few large equipment shipments in Water Infrastructure. We started to see some positive signs in this end market with improving order rates and revenue trends as we entered the second quarter.","Regionally, the organic decline for the quarter occurred in the U.S., which was down 4%. Western Europe performance was flat as expected. And as Patrick mentioned, our momentum in emerging markets continued to build, as revenue was a bright spot, up 3% year over year.","Moving to operational performance. We increased our adjusted EBITDA margins by 100 basis points to 16.2% in the quarter. This increase was primarily driven by the strong operating results of Sensus and the continued ramp-up of productivity savings.","Adjusted operating margin declined 40 basis points to 10.5%, which includes 70 basis points of non-cash amortization related to purchase accounting for the Sensus acquisition. Our teams continue to gain traction in the area of productivity, where we delivered $33 million in cost savings in the quarter, which is up 33% from the prior year. This 310 basis point improvement enabled us to offset inflation and fund strategic investments for growth. Excluding the 70 basis points of dilution from the Sensus and tangible asset amortization, our operating margin expanded by 30 basis points.","Given the tough prior year comparison we faced this quarter, I'm pleased with our team's performance in delivering earnings per share of $0.39, an increase of 11% year over year and 17% excluding foreign exchange translation.","Please turn to slide 6 and I'll provide additional details on our segment performance. I'll start with our first quarter order activity and backlog position at the end of the quarter.","Water Infrastructure recorded orders of $546 million in the quarter, up 3% organically year over year. This reflects growth in all applications within the segment and was led by treatment orders, which were up 8%. This performance builds on a positive upward trajectory that we've seen in our pipeline and order activity. However, a majority of the treatment projects require longer lead times and will not ship until 2018 or later.","That said, we exited the quarter with total backlog for the segment of $584 million up 4% organically year over year. Of this amount, $262 million is due to ship in the second quarter, also up 4% year over year on an organic basis, which gives us good confidence on returning to positive revenue growth in the second quarter.","Water Infrastructure revenue of $496 million represents a 3% year-over-year decline on an organic basis. Foreign exchange was a $7 million headwind.","In the U.S., the segment declined 8% primarily driven by declines in the industrial end market. On a positive note we're seeing some stabilization in the U.S. oil and gas markets. And for the first time since the fourth quarter of 2014 we saw oil and gas revenues grow year over year in the dewatering business, which is an encouraging sign.","Our public utility business also declined in the U.S. by 4%, as we lapped the 22% growth in last year's first quarter. Further impacting revenue was an interruption at our manufacturing facility in Sweden, which was caused by a vendor supply issue that resulted in some shipping delays. We are addressing these issues, but expect some modest impact in the second quarter.","Western Europe decreased 2% overall, primarily driven by the timing of shipments in the UK. We continue to expect solid mid-single digit growth in the UK for 2017, largely due to the Amp 6 public utility investment cycle.","Emerging markets results were mixed but up 2% overall. We had 11% growth in Asia, which was primarily driven by the timing of revenues on several large projects. And growth in China was up mid-single digits. This was largely offset by the ongoing weakness in the Middle East, where the level of government spend for infrastructure continued to be constrained, resulting in a 20% decline in year-over-year segment sales.","Operating margin for the segment decreased 160 basis points to 10.5%, driven by lower volumes, unfavorable mix inflation, as well as increased strategic investments for growth. These items were partially offset by cost savings of 380 basis points, driven by our productivity programs.","Please turn to slide 7. Our Applied Water segment booked orders of $354 million in the quarter, which was up 2% organically. Our book-to-bill ratio was 1.06x in the quarter, which is in line with our historical performance.","We exited the quarter with backlog of $178 million, which is down 7% organically compared to last year. However, of this amount $108 million is due to ship in the second quarter of 2017, up approximately 6% on an organic basis, providing another proof point for our confidence in achieving year-over-year revenue growth in the second quarter.","Revenue for Applied Water was $333 million, up 2% organically versus the prior year quarter.","In Europe, revenue increased 6% with particularly strong growth in Germany, Italy, and the UK, where our recent investment in sales capabilities and channels continues to pay off. Continued traction with new products also bolstered performance.","Emerging Markets revenue grew 4%, reflecting growth in Asia and to a lesser extent Eastern Europe, partially offset by weakness in Latin America and the Middle East.","In the U.S., segment revenue was down 1%. This decline was primarily driven the segment's industrial vertical, which declined 8% from continued weakness in its oil and gas business, soft channel industrial applications, and a challenging year-over-year comp in revenues from fire pump projects.","Largely offsetting the industrial decline was 15% growth in the residential vertical, which was largely driven by the timing of promotions as well as modest share gains. Our U.S. commercial and building services business also grew 1% in the quarter.","Segment operating margin in the quarter increased 90 basis points to 13.5% year over year. Strong productivity drove a 390 basis point margin improvement, which more than offset 180 basis points cost inflation, unfavorable mix, and other minor headwinds.","So let's turn to slide 8 to discuss the performance of Sensus. As a reminder, these first quarter results reflect only our Sensus and Visenti businesses. When we report our Q2 results, we'll report the new segment that we announced at our Investor Day, which is a combination of the Sensus, Visenti, and Xylem Analytics businesses. We will provide restated historical segment financial information in advance of our second quarter earnings call.","Revenue for Sensus was $242 million, up 7% on a pro forma organic basis versus 2016.","In the U.S., revenue increased 9% with growth primarily attributable to the deployment of several large electric projects. Further driving the strong performance was demand for new products, including the Stratus meter for our electric customers and the iPERL water meter.","Our emerging markets business grew 20%, predominantly driven by smart water applications in the Middle East.","Western Europe was down 5%, which primarily reflects the lapping of significant service fee revenues related to the deployment of the Thames Water contract in 2016. As a reminder, the timing of project deployments in the Sensus business can create some lumpiness in quarterly growth rates. While we saw growth at the high end of our guidance range in Q1, we expect that to temper in Q2, which we'll cover in our outlook discussion.","Adjusted EBITDA margins increased 50 basis points to 19.8%. Margin expansion was driven by higher volumes, improved mix, and productivity savings, partially offset by inflation. Adjusted segment operating margin in the quarter decreased 160 basis points to 10.7% year over year. This decline is directly attributable to the non-cash impact of incremental purchase accounting, depreciation, and amortization. Excluding these non-cash items, margins expanded by 170 basis points.","Now let's turn to slide 9 to discuss cash flows and the company's financial position. We closed the quarter with a cash balance of $287 million. As you may recall, the first quarter is our seasonally weakest period for cash flow. However, the $26 million of free cash flow in the quarter increased significantly from the prior year and was driven largely by the addition of Sensus. Free cash flow conversion was 39% in the quarter compared to a 6% conversion last year.","During the first quarter we invested $43 million in capital expenditures and also returned $33 million to our shareholders through dividends. In February we announced a 16% increase to our dividend payout, our fifth consecutive annual increase.","While working capital increased overall, the improvement as a percentage of revenue primarily reflects the addition of Sensus versus 2016. As a reminder, Sensus positively impacts our working capital performance with their very efficient working capital model.","We remain committed to maintaining our investment grade credit rating, which will require that we primarily focus our capital deployment on debt repayment over the next 12 months.","Please turn to slide 10 and Patrick will cover the update to our 2017 outlook.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Thanks, Mark. As I said earlier, we're off to a solid start in 2017 and are well-positioned to deliver on our financial targets. With the exception of our foreign currency assumptions, our full year 2017 guidance has not changed.","On a pro forma basis we continued to anticipate organic growth of 2% to 4%, which includes organic growth from the base Xylem businesses of 1% to 3% and Sensus organic growth of 6% to 7%. As we drive our continuous improvement work deeper into the organization, we continue to accelerate our lean and global procurement initiatives and expect to realize $130 million in savings for the full year, a 10% year-over-year increase. With our Q1 results in this area we're on pace to meet that target.","Our adjusted operating margin is expected to grow in the range of 20 basis points to 70 basis points, excluding roughly 60 basis points of margin dilution from acquisitions. As I mentioned earlier, we've updated our foreign currency translation assumptions. As a result we now anticipate generating earnings per share of $2.23 to $2.38, which excludes integration, restructuring, and realignment cost of about $30 million. Excluding foreign exchange impact, EPS growth is expected to be in the range of 12% to 20%.","Finally, as we've outlined previously, we expect to deliver free cash flow conversion of at least 110% this year. This contemplates expected capital expenditures in the range of $190 million to $200 million.","Please turn to slide 11, and I'll walk you through our end market assumptions. Please note that our commentary and growth estimates on this slide reflect pro forma organic revenue from 2016 for Xylem and now includes the impact of Sensus.","Public utility constitutes 47% of total pro forma 2016 revenue. In 2017, we expect pro forma organic revenue to grow in the low to mid-single digit range. Sensus is expected to generate organic growth of 6% to 7%.","We anticipate 2017 organic growth of the base Xylem business to moderate after a very strong 2016 but to continue growing, up low single digits. As mentioned previously, we face a challenging comparison in the U.S. market, given the exceptional 17% growth we delivered in 2016. As a result, we believe growth in this region will be in low to mid-single digit range. We expect large project activities to drive mid to high single digit growth in the emerging markets, especially in China and India. And in Europe, we anticipate low single digit growth.","Our industrial end market represents 37% of pro forma revenue. In 2017 we continue to expect that full year organic revenue will be flat to up low single digits. The soft market conditions in general industrial that occurred in the U.S. last year are continuing into 2017, though we do expect modest growth over the second half of the year. We expect emerging market performance to be mixed, with some strength in China and Latin America offset by continued weakness in the Middle East.","Moving to commercial, which represents 11% of pro forma revenue, we expect organic growth in the low single digit range in 2017 with a solid U.S. market and a tough prior year comparison in Europe.","Residential revenues reflect 5% of pro forma revenue and we expect 2017 organic growth in the low to mid-single digit range. In the U.S., we continue to expect a flat to low single digit growth rate despite a stronger than expected first quarter. The European market looks to be modestly stronger as residential building permits increase.","Now please turn to slide 12 and Mark will walk you through more details on the outlook.","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Consistent with what we disclosed last quarter, we're providing the seasonal profile of our business as well as highlights of our 2017 planning assumptions. For the second quarter, we expect modest improvement in both the public utility and industrial markets sequentially with both returning to low single digit growth. We continue to expect commercial to grow in the low single digit range for the quarter. And we anticipate moderating growth in residential, up low single digits, reflecting the impact of the first quarter promotions.","All-in, we anticipate this will result in organic revenue growth in the range of 1% to 2% for the base Xylem business. We also expect foreign exchange translation to unfavorably impact revenue by $20 million.","Acquisitions are expected to add approximately $230 million to $240 million, with Sensus growing organically at 1% to 2% in the second quarter. Sensus has a tough comparison to the prior year, primarily due to the timing of distributor stocking of iPERL meters in North America last year, as well as higher prior year revenues from rollouts for two large UK contracts.","One other note regarding Sensus. One of its primary battery suppliers had a significant incident at its manufacturing facility, which has shut down production. We are making arrangements with other existing and alternate suppliers to minimize any potential disruptions in serving our customers.","Given our current inventory of batteries, which substantially covers our needs through the second quarter, and the initial commitments received from additional suppliers, we currently do not anticipate any material disruption in our ability to fulfill customer orders. Our teams are on top of this issue, and we're tracking the progress very closely.","As for our second quarter segment operating margin, we expect margins to be up 50 basis points to 70 basis points, excluding the 70 basis point reduction due to the non-cash amortization of the Sensus purchase accounting.","Finally, please note that the summary of our FX assumptions on this slide, which includes our updated euro guidance assumption at $1.07 from $1.04, which puts us in line with the year-to-date average actual rate of $1.07. Aside from our currency assumptions all other assumptions remain unchanged from our previous guidance.","And with that I'll turn the call back over to Patrick for some closing comments.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Thanks, Mark. So good start to the year. And we're encouraged by the growing momentum we see in our businesses. The market fundamentals are solid, and our teams are executing well. We remain focused on our long term strategy, while continuing to deliver on our full year commitments.","So with that now, operator, let's open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Your first question comes from Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Good morning, Deane.","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Hi, good morning.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, would like to address first some of the issues going on in municipal, both U.S. and Europe. And maybe we can start with did you see any of the project delays or some hesitation on project releases in both U.S. and Europe?","And then on the second quarter outlook, you are facing another tough comp, especially in the U.S. And is the expectation that you would post another negative organic in U.S. muni for the second quarter?","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks, Deane. So this is Patrick. Let me take the first \u2013 the second question first. So our outlook for Q2 is to be flat to up low single digits. And that's a global number. And so that does reflect some flatness to up low single digits in the U.S. as well as in Europe. So we don't see it presenting the same kind of comp that it did for us in Q1.","In terms of what we're seeing in both the U.S. and Europe, let me start first with Europe. Really the only timing issue that we saw there was really in the UK and the Amp cycle. And there was nothing for us to be alarmed about. It really was just timing of shipments that hit us there in the first quarter. And so we're still expecting that to be mid-single digits for the full year as we had originally guided to.","In the U.S. again nothing noticeable that we've seen in terms of any delay in projects being awarded or in the day-to-day activity. It really is simply the fact that we had such a tough comp versus last year, both due to again heavy spending activity, timing of projects, but also you'll recall we had unusably warm weather last year that drove some higher shipments and install in the quarter.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And then my follow-up on given all the items going on at Xylem today \u2013 the Sensus acquisition closing, the Analyst Meeting, raising all your long term targets \u2013 we got the most questions and the most excitement around this announcement with Pure Technologies. So maybe just spend a moment there. How did this partnership come together? Specifically about the go-to-market, how will you coordinate your technologies? Is there any interoperability within your technologies? And any plans to expand beyond these initial emerging markets?","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Sure. Well, thanks, Deane. I mean we're certainly very excited about the opportunity to partner with Jack Elliott and the team there at Pure. We've known them for a long time. Obviously we see them in the marketplace. We've been impressed by what their capabilities are.","We've \u2013 so we've been talking about this for a little while. They've got some capability gaps in very specific emerging markets, most notably Middle East, India, Singapore, Malaysia, which is really where we're starting to \u2013 we've got a strong set of channels to market there.","I think this really makes sense now in terms of complementary technologies, now that we've got both Sensus and Visenti in the portfolio, and we put those businesses together. So we're going to be exploring to see what other opportunities there are in terms of the complementary nature of those products in those markets. Again right now it's really exploratory. It's really focusing on a few key markets here and helping customers again with those very specific pain points that we laid out.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","How about from the technology standpoint?","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Remains to be seen. I mean I think there clearly is some interoperability there that we'll explore over time. But still very much in the early stages here.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Understood. Thank you.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Thank you, Deane.","Operator","Your next question comes from Scott Davis of Barclays.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Good morning, guys.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Good morning, Scott.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I feel like I need to ask about this battery problem, because you mentioned it at the end. But sometimes when we've seen supply chain challenges, they tend to linger and cause problems that are beyond sometimes what people anticipate.","And so you commented that you've got inventory and such for 2Q. And you don't see any customer disruptions. How about the cost side of it though? Is there other concerns that your cost of procurement are going to go up meaningfully in the back half of the year? And how long do you think this battery problem \u2013 or how long does your supplier think this is going to linger or take?","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Sure. No, it's a great question, Scott. So a couple of pieces there. One would be in terms of \u2013 so we have a qualified back up supplier already. And we were in the late stages of qualifying a third source already. And so obviously the teams are very much focused on accelerating that third qualification.","And we think the combination of getting them both up and running, as well as the inventory that both we and our current supplier have on hand, that certainly will help us bridge any of the supply chain gaps that we've got there.","To your point around the cost side, very, very minimal impact from a cost standpoint. There will probably be a little bit of maybe freight expedition in some areas. And the suppliers that we've got there have been very good with us in terms of remaining true to previous negotiations, et cetera. Obviously don't want to get into many more specifics other than that, just given the competitive dynamics and negotiations.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah. No, fair enough. So just as a follow-up. Since there's 10,000 water utilities out there, and we can't talk to very many of them, quite frankly, so it's tough for us to get a view. But how many of your \u2013 do you get a sense from your customers at all that they're thinking about projects in terms of waiting until there's a federal infrastructure bill? That waiting to see if money is available and potentially kind of delaying things until you get into 2018?","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","We don't see a common thread there, Scott, of people necessarily slowing down. I mean if anything we've seen quoting activity up double digits again. And our bidding pipeline up very strong. But obviously your question is more around when those things come to market.","I think certainly maybe in some of the smaller utilities, where they're relying on state funding and maybe to a lesser extent the possibility of federal funding, it's less about the money that may come to water projects. And it's more about the money that may come to other infrastructure investments that take a little bit of pressure off of their budgets, and therefore, easier for them to go ahead and move forward with the water spend.","But we're not \u2013 we're really not seeing a lot of that. That's really not what's impacting us here going through Q1 and into Q2. It really is simply the very tough year-over-year comp for last year.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got you.","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah. In fact our pipeline for treatment waters is \u2013 it's up 16%. So...","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah. No. I'm just trying to reconcile that and just thinking in terms of how they think about things like this. But anyways that was very helpful. Thank you and good luck to you guys.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Thanks, Scott. Appreciate it.","Operator","Your next question comes from Nathan Jones of Stifel.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Morning, everyone.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Good morning, Nate.","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Good morning.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","If we could go to the margins in Water Infrastructure. You were down I think 160 basis points there, which is maybe 50 basis points is decremental. But you did call out some additional strategic investments there. Can you kind of quantify what the levels of those strategic investments were? And how long we should expect those to continue?","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah, Nate, it's Mark. The \u2013 in terms of the investment specifically, it was around $5 million. And a lot of that was focused on continuing to add commercial capabilities, particularly in our emerging markets, some product localization as well. So that was the bulk of it.","There was also a little bit of investment in Europe as well, but that \u2013 and that was roughly 100 basis points. But the big impact on the margin profile was really a function of volume and mix. And we had a very rich mix of projects last year, particularly in our dewatering business, our highest margin \u2013 one of our highest margin businesses. And also had a lot of aftermarket business as well with the warm weather. So it was more of a volume and mix story there.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah. I think the \u2013 anytime, Nate, as you can appreciate, anytime \u2013 especially Q1 being one of our slowest quarters of the year. And given the fixed cost that we've got, especially on the Water Infrastructure side, any kind of volume softness there magnifies at least within the quarter. But we're very confident about getting to our margin expansion goals for the full year.","As Mark mentioned in his prepared comments, we had some self-inflected issues from a supplier in our Emmaboda factory. And so that revenue is very, very rich in terms of margin. And we'll get that back here partially in Q2 and certainly in Q3.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","And how long should we expect the investment to continue?","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","I'd say modest here through the rest of this year. There's really \u2013 I mean the only investments we'll be making for the most part would be \u2013 we'll continue to invest in some emerging market sales expansion, a bit more on the product localization, given that we do see a full on recovery in some of the emerging markets.","And then we've got a little bit that we'll be investing in the integration of Sensus in terms of going after some of the revenue synergies that we talked about. So there will be a little bit of an uptick in R&D. But all of that's been reflected in our guide for the year. There's no change in outlook.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then my follow-up. You've talked about treatment orders being the leading indicator. And we've seen the treatment pipeline be pretty strong for probably a year and a half now. Can you talk a little bit about if you're seeing some of that, the transport and test stuff that supposed to come behind that, strengthening in the pipeline as a result of those treatment orders leading that kind of revenue?","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah. We would normally see about probably an 18-month \u2013 kind of 12- to 18-month kind of lag between orders actually being received on a treatment as opposed to \u2013 our comments here are as much about bidding pipeline being up. Obviously we did see good treatment orders in the quarter, 8% growth. So we do think that bodes well for the test and transport piece of the business here.","But \u2013 and I think we're seeing some of that now in terms of our orders lift here in this last quarter. But that would really I think buoy us even more strongly for the latter part of this year into 2018.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. So that's kind of the timeframe that we should think about those orders ramping up would be mid to late this year?","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","That's correct. I'd say late this year into early 2018.","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah. And you might recall, Nate, we had a bit of a hole in our orders in the first half of last year. First and second quarter we were down organically 2% and 4% respectively. But that momentum has been building up in Q3 and Q4 of last year, Q1. And \u2013 but some of that is treatment, which does, as Patrick said, have a little bit longer incubation period in terms of actually manifesting itself in revenues.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. That's very helpful. Thanks, guys.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jim Giannakouros of Oppenheimer.","Jim Giannakouros - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Hey, good morning, Patrick, Mark.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Good morning, Jim.","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Hey, Jim.","Jim Giannakouros - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","A question on Sensus. Revenue increased 9% I think in \u2013 you said in U.S., those large electric projects. I'm sorry. They weren't on my radar, and I apologize if you had telegraphed it before. But does that mix I guess does \u2013 well, first, that aspect, does that setup for tough comps? Or is there acceleration elsewhere in Sensus, that 6% or 7% growth in 2018 isn't a stretch? And I guess any and all comments on mix, both organic growth contribution by component within Sensus and any impacts to margins we should be aware of?","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Sure. We'll take into pieces here. So on the \u2013 in terms of does it set up for a tough comp. Let me start first with even the rest of this year. And you'll recall that we've got a rather easy comp in Q4, because we had lower growth last year, because of some delays in Saudi on their shipments due to lessor credit, et cetera. So that sets up for an easier comp in Q4 that give us confidence of getting to that 6% to 7% growth.","No, we remain confident about the growth outlook for over the planning period of that 6% to 7%. We've got some large project deployments that are front-end loaded as we head into 2018. And so that will help us with this comp in Q1 next year but also through the entirety of 2018.","In terms of margin mix, I'll share a few comments here and Mark can certainly chime in. Not a unusually large mix issue organically within Sensus in terms of margins between, say, the water deployment versus electrical or gas. You get a little bit higher margin on the water side than electric. But given the fact that we had a large deployment here, that also tend to be favorable from a margin standpoint. So it kind of blends out to where there was no noticeable shift from my perspective.","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah. And you look at their margins quarter over quarter, they don't move that much. They're fairly consistent, because you might have a richer mix in terms of some of the rollouts of large projects. But you can also have some mix coming from Software-as-a-Service too, depending on the timing of that. So but they are \u2013 while the volume can be a little bit lumpy, the gross margins are fairly consistent.","Jim Giannakouros - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Got it. Thank you. And I guess sticking on Sensus or I guess the projected revenue synergies with Water Infrastructure, how should we be thinking about \u2013 and I apologize if I should know this. How should we be thinking about bucketing the growth between Sensus and Water Infrastructure? Is it pretty balanced over the next few years? Or is there greater potential in one or the other?","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","I'd say it remains to be seen. We haven't given that level of specificity yet. We're obviously still working through some of the prototypes. It'll be a combination of the two. There will be \u2013 the way to think about that is, where we are getting synergies by connecting our equipment in the field on the wastewater side, those revenues would flow through the Water Infrastructure. Where we are winning any of these large international deals by way of Xylem helping pull them through, that obviously will impact Sensus and Analytics as we go forward.","So that's the way to think about it. We haven't yet split the dollar amounts that we teed up at Investor Day amongst those buckets. But we'll have certainly more to share on that as we get later into the year, and we get some of these prototype deployments out in the field.","Jim Giannakouros - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Great. Thank you, guys.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Thank you.","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Thanks, Jim.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chip Moore of Canaccord.","Chip Moore - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Good morning. Thanks. Maybe look at...","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Good morning, Chip.","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Morning, Chip.","Chip Moore - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Morning. Obviously not a big part of the portfolio, oil and gas markets, maybe we could talk a little bit more. Nice to see dewatering turning positive. What sort of trends I guess you've seen into Q2 and has your outlook changed at all?","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah. And on dewatering while, as I had mentioned, it was nice to see growth for the first time since the fourth quarter of 2014. It was pretty modest. Okay. So the trend line has definitely changed. But it's really \u2013 we're seeing that some of that growth in pockets in some areas of fracking. Certainly Permian Basin continues to be a pretty hot area.","So while the inflection point is good, we don't see any significant takeoff in that part of our business, although the comps get a heck of a lot easier over the next several quarters.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah, I mean just to parse it a little bit more as well. You'll recall, probably I think it was the last quarter's call or even at Investor Day, we talked about the biggest challenge that we faced in the dewatering sector from an oil and gas and mining standpoint was more on our indirect channel side with our distributors.","We've seen flat to a little bit of growth in our direct channel for the last quarter or so. But it was being more than offset by double digit declines continuing in the indirect channel. And the good news was the indirect channel flatlined for the first time in Q1. So that's really what helped us get to a net positive growth on that piece of the dewatering business.","Chip Moore - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Great. Thank you, guys.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Thank you.","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Thanks, Chip.","Operator","Your next question comes from Joe Giordano of Cowen.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Hey, Joe.","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Hi, Joe.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","So I \u2013 unfortunately I had to jump on a little late, so apologizes if I kind of go over something that was already discussed. But I wanted to talk a little bit about the industrial outlook here, flat to up low single digits. I know you have some oil and gas and mining and stuff in there that's not your general industrial. But can you kind of scale that versus what we've seen in earning season so far, seems to be an acceleration there. That flat to low seems pretty modest versus what we've heard so far the last couple weeks. So kind of what are your thoughts there? Does that feel more conservative to you than the other outlooks for the rest of the end market?","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","It's \u2013 Joe, this is Patrick. It's hard to call at this point. I mean that business is rather short cycle for us. It's largely a replacement business through our Applied Water segment. And so because it is general light industrial being the lion's share of that, at the end of the day we've always said that it is very much kind of a GDP at best kind of business. Typically grows around that kind of 2% to 3%.","We've baked in the flat to low single digits simply because of what we saw in Q1 and therefore what would one have to believe for the next three quarters to get to a solid low single digits.","So there are some early positive indicators that we're seeing. But it is still early. And this is again a light industrial business. So it's not going to be nearly as volatile in ramp as you see in some of our peer companies.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Yeah. No, that's fair. And maybe just a higher level question, and maybe this is too high level for this call. But when I think about your portfolio now moving through Sensus, stuff with Pure, like how do you see Xylem becoming positioned over the next \u2013 I don't know \u2013 call it over your time as CEO there? It's kind of like more of a Smart City provider. And kind of fitting that niche more than a traditional equipment provider. How do you kind of see the business evolving into that sort of discussion?","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah. So I think, no, it's a great question, Joe. I think that the way I would describe it is, we believe strongly that there is clearly a number of large unmet needs from helping our customers, both in water but also across other elements of the utility space, provide smart solutions to them. And we think we're building a very nice suite of offerings here and capabilities, including the data analytics side. There are still gaps in those offerings that we will either get through acquisition or through commercial partnerships like we announced with Pure. There are more to come on those types of partnerships that are out there.","I would want to make sure, though, that no one ever be confused around the fact that I think it's critically important, that even though we are looking to build that kind of smart solution, we are not going to move away from our OEM heritage as a business. Because it's my experience that you really need to have the subject matter expertise around the equipment itself as well. So you can really bring a holistic solution to the customer, as opposed to only becoming a Software-as-a-Service or data analytics kind of provider.","So we'll continue to invest in making our equipment smart and \u2013 much as the other industrial companies are doing. So it'll be a mix of those two. And then lastly I would say it's not limited to the smart infrastructure around systems intelligence. There are \u2013 we've talked before about advanced industrial treatment. We talked about industrial services being a bigger part of our offering.","So there's more to it than just the smart infrastructure element. But that is certainly what mine and our primary focus is right now, in terms of where we invest our money both organically and inorganically.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. That's a good answer. Thanks very much, Patrick.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Thank you, Joe.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brian Lee of Goldman Sachs.","Brian Lee - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, guys, thanks for squeezing me in here.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Sure, good morning.","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Good morning, Brian.","Brian Lee - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good morning. Digging into the public utility trends, I know you guys have talked a little bit \u2013 ad nausea on this. But given the year-over-year decline is due to mostly tougher comps, particularly in the U.S., just wondering if you can maybe comment a bit on how much of the bookings pick up you're seeing in the U.S. versus elsewhere? And then what trends you can talk to geographically on bookings specifically?","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","I would say a lot of the booking momentum has been in emerging markets. But we are also seeing solid order growth in the U.S. as well, low single digits, but good momentum. But the \u2013 I'd say the biggest source of water growth has been in emerging markets. But a nice upward tick in the U.S. as well.","Brian Lee - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then I'll just do a quick housekeeping one if I can. The Sweden manufacturing issue you mentioned, could you quantify if there was any impact in the quarter? And then I think you had mentioned there may be a little bit of residual impact into Q2. Maybe what exactly that impact was? And then what the remediation steps are from here? Thank you.","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah. Brian, it was roughly $3 million in the first quarter on the revenue side. And we would \u2013 we're managing it as best we can. But it's probably \u2013 we think it's going to continue into the second quarter. We'll get it nailed down. But probably a similar impact in Q2 as well from a revenue perspective.","Brian Lee - Goldman Sachs & Co.","All right.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","And the good news is here we're not losing business, so the business comes back. It's simply a matter of timing of the shipment deliveries.","Brian Lee - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Super helpful. Thank you.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Thank you.","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Walsh of Vertical Research.","John Fred Walsh - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Good morning.","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Hey, John.","John Fred Walsh - Vertical Research Partners LLC","So a question around the margin. Clearly you've been able to more than offset cost inflation pressures with cost reductions. But given what we're seeing in raws, can you talk about your ability to kind of capture price in this environment?","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Sure. Yeah. This is Patrick. So I'll start here. And then Mark can chime in.","So we're very much focused on marrying up the views on cost inflation with pricing in the market. And so our supply chain teams and our commercial teams are joined at the hip kind of country by country, understanding kind of what the dynamics are.","Obviously in those businesses where we have a share leadership position, we're being very disciplined in terms of being the price lead and preserving that. That's much more the case in elements of water infrastructure, where we are seeing a more favorable supply\/demand dynamic coupled with inflation. So a little bit easier. Never easy to get price passed through, but a little easier there.","A little tougher at Applied Water, just given some of the competitive dynamics there and a little bit more softness in the end markets of industrial but also the resi business. And so you saw where we did some promotions there to drive share gain in that part of the business, albeit small.","So it's a mixed bag. But it's something we're very much on top of. And I would say again mixed results up to this point.","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah. We're making sure the teams get out ahead of it. We saw a modest bump on the raws in \u2013 when you look at it in Q1 compared to last year, 10 basis points to 20 basis points in our two operating segments, Water Infrastructure and AWS.","So but the first step is awareness. And we're making sure that the commercial teams are getting good information from global sourcing, so they understand in terms of specific product lines what that impact in terms of the creep in raws is, so they can be more effective in the marketplace.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","And I would just maybe wrap that up with the fact that when I look back over the last three \u2013 or certainly since I've been here, and I talk to the leaders in the businesses that have been around, I would say historically they've been very effective and very disciplined at understanding the inflationary dynamics and driving price discipline where they need to.","And what's simply gotten better I think is both our focus on cost out productivity, but also having enhanced and developed our procurement capabilities. Through Tony Milando and that team, we've got a lot more awareness now earlier on I think than we would have had historically.","John Fred Walsh - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Got you. Got you. Thank you. And then just a quick one on Sensus. Obviously directionally you helped us with the comps on the back half. But wanted to know if you kind of can provide the explicit organic growth comps for Sensus in Q3, Q4?","And then in terms of the margin, should we build off of the 10.7% in Q1? Or you called it, there was the benefit of that large project. Does this maybe, from an operating margin perspective, take a sequential step down? And then build in the back half of the year for Sensus?","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah. Let me take that one. I think so what we provided to date is \u2013 we provided the full year margin profile for Sensus. We don't see that changing. We still expect EBITDA margin to be in that 19.5% range and adjusted operating margin for the full year to be in the low 10%.","So as I said, it \u2013 while there's modest movement from quarter to quarter, it's not all that significant. And we did have \u2013 although I would say, given some of the mix that we had in the first quarter, it's probably a little bit higher margin mix than what we'll see throughout the remainder of the year.","John Fred Walsh - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Got you. Thank you. Very helpful.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah.","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Thanks, John.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Robert Barry of Susquehanna.","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Hey, guys. Thanks for fitting me in. Good morning.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Sure.","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Morning.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Good morning, Robert.","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Morning.","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Just a couple of things. We've covered a lot of ground. I think last quarter you talked about core growth on the legacy business of flat to up low single. Is that refined slightly better to 1% to 2% now? Or is it...","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","I think we...","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","...no changes?","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Which periods, Robert?","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","In 2Q.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Full year?","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","I think it was a flat to low \u2013 no 2Q. Kind of...","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah, that's right.","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah. Yeah.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But for Q2, Robert, yeah, it's up about a point from where we had guided before. And that's really just baking in the momentum that we saw coming out of Q1. And the \u2013 when we talk about what our shippable backlog within the quarter looks like, we'd support that number as well.","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Got you. Any change to the back half? I think it was 3% to 4% in 3Q and a little better than that in 4Q?","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah. I'd say it's in line with what we said before. Obviously we'll take a look at that again as we get through Q2 and see kind of what the momentum is. But right now we've held the back half as where we had it before.","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay. Just conservatism? Or anything you're seeing in the backlog?","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","No, I think it's just still early. And it's again we're still a relatively short cycle business, other than the visibility we have on treatment. So we're just trying to be prudent here.","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Fair enough. And if we could just chat quickly about this promotional activity in resi, up 14%, added almost a point of growth to the quarter. Just are you getting more aggressive there? Don't usually see that kind of growth in the resi looking back?","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah. Yeah. I mean it's \u2013 we \u2013 it's timing. .Some of it's terms. It's not all price. So we're trying to be aggressive commercially without giving away the store on price at all.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah. So we \u2013 I'd say, Robert, the \u2013 to me the \u2013 there's been a lot going on in that part of the market as you know, as you follow other companies. And so I think just keeping our teams focused on, let's win share, let's leverage things beyond price to do so.","There's always some timing issue. It's a relatively small piece of our business. So even a little bit of absolute dollar impact there can swing it pretty significantly either direction. So I wouldn't get too focused in on the 14% number in one quarter. I think what we're encouraged by was the fact that it was a good growth.","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","And we saw good backlog build in that business. And so hopefully it helps us normalize for the year. We've had a couple of rocky \u2013 couple of the lumpy years the last couple years due to weather and other things. And so we hope we're smoothing things out now.","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Yeah. Fair enough. Yeah. I was more focusing in on the promotional activity and just whether there was any change in kind of the pricing?","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","No, it's not a margin or pricing thing. It was really more on the payment terms.","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Got you. Okay. Thank you.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your final question comes from Jose Garza of Gabelli.","Jose Ricardo Garza - G.research LLC","Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for fitting me in.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Good morning, Jose.","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Good morning, Jose.","Jose Ricardo Garza - G.research LLC","I guess going back to that one of your competitors purchased some distribution recently in the U.S. on the groundwater side. Just wondering if you could give us your thoughts on any kind of impacts that you foresee? And then how you're kind of thinking about that business in the longer term, Patrick?","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Sure. No, thanks, Jose. So we were aware of this move coming for quite some time. And so we had been already building in backup plans in terms of what the future would be for us.","Just to put it in perspective, the impact on us on this one bit of disruption, it's less than 1% of our total Applied Water segment revenue. So even less than that for the total company. We've already got backup plans in place. We're working with Franklin on this. We have some other alternatives that we're working through as well. And so we don't expect any disruption at all on that part of our business.","In terms of the other questions that we've gotten in the past have really been around what's our strategy between direct and indirect? And does this move kind of change that? And I think it's important that I state here that we are absolutely committed to support our channel partner relationships. They have \u2013 they're valuable. They've got a long term relationship with us. They've got a lot of reach in the marketplace. And so we place a value on that, at least certainly within that part of the business.","And we think making sure that we've got a broad and diverse network, both direct and indirect, is our best way to serve the market both from a access standpoint but also from a cost-to-serve standpoint.","Jose Ricardo Garza - G.research LLC","Okay.

With me today are Chief Executive Officer, Patrick Decker, and Chief Financial Officer, Mark Rajkowski. They will provide their perspective on Xylem's fourth quarter and full year 2017 results and discuss the full year outlook for 2018.

Thanks for joining us today to discuss our strong 2017 results and our outlook for 2018. As 2017 unfolded we continue to strengthen our execution, which helped us accelerate our growth momentum throughout the second half of the year. We delivered on all of our financial commitments to the year and are on track to meet our long-term objectives. In both the fourth quarter and full-year we delivered solid top line growth in the U.S., Europe and Emerging Markets and across each of our key end markets. We made solid progress in each of our businesses with a number of standout achievements including successful new product launches, strategic project wins and the continued deployment of capital, all of which will drive our long-term growth and value creation for shareholders.","Yesterday, we closed on our acquisition of Pure Technologies and we couldn't be more excited about the prospects that we see ahead. We also acquired a small company called Emnet, which operates in the water infrastructure analytics base as well. I'll come back to this in a few minutes. We have a lot to cover today so I'm going to hit a few highlights and then turn it over to Mark to walk through the numbers.","In addition to our broad based revenue growth we also continue to drive increases in orders and backlog. Orders grew 10% in the fourth quarter up sequentially from the 6% growth we delivered in the third quarter, this catch-ups very well going into 2018. It is worth noting that a sizeable portion of these orders is for longer lead time projects and won't translate into revenue until 2019. We also delivered solid and broad based growth across our key end markets. Our performance in public utilities particularly stood out with 10% growth in the quarter.","We saw strong results in nearly every geography and across all applications with our Sensus business delivering 15% growth versus the prior year period. Another notable result was in our residential business. While it is a relatively smaller part of our overall business, it's worth calling out the double-digit growth achieved in both the fourth quarter and the full year. We'll discuss the outlook for this and our other end markets later in the call.","While we continue to enhance our execution in the marketplace, we also continue to execute our productivity for growth strategy. The team delivered another year of record results, about a $150 million in continues improvement savings, a 10% increase over last year's performance. A portion of these savings are being reinvested in the business by way of R&D, innovation and commercial initiatives to drive growth. We ended the year with adjusted EBITDA of 18.7%, an increase of 80 basis points year-over-year. This reflects a strong operational performance I just discussed as well as the Sensus contribution.","Our operating margin for the full year was 13.4% up 30 basis points excluding the impact of acquisitions. We delivered full year adjusted earnings per share of $2.40, an increase of 18% year-over-year. We also had another year of strong cash generation with free cash flow up 41% over the prior year. This is an area where historically we have underperformed so I'm quite pleased with the progress we've made and our outlook for sustaining this performance. Free cash flow conversion was 147% for the year, so all-in-all, a year of strong results.","I want to recognize and thank our teams throughout the company who stayed focused on the task at hand while also keeping an eye on the opportunities ahead of us and laying the foundation for our long-term success. None of this happens without their commitment and execution and I'm very proud of what we've achieved together.","Now, let me shift gears to spend a few minutes on the progress we continue to make on the strategic priorities. These are the highest order imperatives that will enable us to meet our long-term financial commitments and set the company on a path of sustainable growth and expansion for many years to come. The priority of accelerating profitable growth encompasses our initiatives to drive commercial excellence, grow in emerging markets and strengthen innovation and technology. The moves we made in 2017 to bring together our various U.S. commercial teams and re-orient our sales and marketing focus around vertical end markets is helping to increase our bidding pipeline leading to strong top line results. Specifically in emerging markets, we delivered 6% revenue and 15% orders growth for the year and momentum in our key markets of China, India and Middle East is building.","Accelerating innovation is a core element of our long-term growth strategy. The creation of new Centers of Excellence, a streamline approach to product development and smart acquisitions have fuelled our new product pipeline leading to a 500 basis points increase to 24% in our vitality index over the previous year. As I already mentioned, our continuous improvement program continues to generate impactful results. This is an area where we will continue to develop, creating new opportunities to unlock savings by eliminating waste and increasing efficiencies. These efforts not only show margin expansion, but they are funding investments that are vital to our long-term growth and improving our speed to market. Underpinning these efforts, are the programs we are expanding to further deepen our talent pool. The additional capabilities we brought into Xylem through acquisitions have also accelerated this work.","As I had outlined in my first Investor Day back in 2015, we will continue to put capital to work in smart disciplined ways to develop and acquire the solutions we need to best address our customer's challenges. Our acquisitions to date, fits squarely into our Smart Water Technology strategy. Finally, we continue to return capital to shareholders, today announcing a 17% increase in the dividend.","Now let's turn to the next slide to talk about Pure Technologies and the role this new addition will play in our long-term growth plans. As I mentioned, we closed on the Pure transaction yesterday and our team has been working on the integration planning for the past month. So we are ready to get started. Pure which until yesterday was a publicly traded company finished 2017 with strong results. In the fourth quarter and the full-year they delivered revenue growth of 15% and 11%, respectively. They also delivered strong adjusted EBITDA at 25% in the quarter and 18% for the full-year. This is a fantastic business that will expand our opportunities, fuel our growth and accelerate value creation for our shareholders.","Pure would be the foundation of a broad platform we're building, bringing together a portfolio of analytics capabilities and technologies that will address our utility customers' infrastructure [pain points] and significantly improve the economics of their operations. Challenges such as non-revenue water and aging infrastructure cannot be effectively address with a one size fits all approach, particularly as you move around the globe. Customers need a partner who can effectively assess and understand their unique challenges and then bring together the right solutions to address them in a way that adds value to their operations. Collectively our advanced infrastructure analytics capabilities will increasingly position Xylem as that vital partner and solutions provider, in addition to being a supplier of unmatched products and services.","Joining Pure in this group will be our Visenti and HYPACK businesses as well as a smaller acquisition we've recently completed of a company called Emnet and we will continue to fill in other gaps as needed. Emnet which is based in South [Canadiana] provides network modeling and optimizations solutions that enable municipalities to manage the urban water cycle and wastewater and storm water systems. This is a pivotal addition to Xylem as it significantly increases our ability to help customers' manage their wastewater network and storm water systems areas of growing concern. Both Pure and Emnet are excellent examples of M&A serving as a proxy for R&D that will help accelerate our progress.","This advanced infrastructure analytics business will be lead by Al Cho, our former Head of Global Strategy who also led the acquisition team for most of these businesses. It will be part of our Measurement and Control Solutions segment under Colin Sabel's leadership, but it will be an enterprise operation, partnering and collaborating with all of our commercial teams and business units around the world. We are very excited to bring together these capabilities to tap new opportunities. We will leverage the deep knowledge each team has along with our trusted customer relationships and global scale to accelerate the growth of our business.","Now I'll turn it over to Mark for a more detailed review of our results.","Mark Rajkowski","Thanks, Patrick. Please turn to slide 6. Patrick's already covered some of the highlights of our 2017 results, so I'll quickly touch on a few of the details. I'm very pleased with the team's performance this year particularly our strong revenue growth in the fourth quarter, which enabled us to deliver at the high end of our revenue guidance for the year, with 3% organic growth and 4% on a pro forma organic basis. This reflects strength across all of our end markets and solid growth in each of our businesses. Geographically, we saw the largest increase in the emerging markets up 6% with the U.S. and Western Europe up 3% and 1%, respectively.","Adjusted EBITDA margin was up 80 basis points to 18.7% which largely reflects continued traction from our productivity initiatives as we realized $148 million in savings, an increase of 10% year-over-year as well as the benefit of volume leverage. Partially offsetting these improvements are inflation, higher investments for growth and unfavorable mix driven by emerging markets' project revenues.","Operating margin for the year was 13.4%, up 30 basis points from the prior year excluding the purchase accounting impact from Sensus. Earnings per share this year of $2.40 increase 18%, a clear indication that we're on the right path to deliver financial returns in line with what we laid out at our Investor Day last April. Another important indicator and one that I'm fond off, is our free cash flow performance. This year, we generated $544 million of free cash flow an increase of 41% year-over-year. We also delivered 147% cash conversion which is well above our target of 110%.","An important driver of our cash flow performance is the progress and focus from our teams globally on improving our working capital levels. We reduced working capital to 18.5% of sales which is a 150 basis point improvement year-over-year. I'm proud of the work of our teams, however, there is further room for improvement and we have good confidence in our ability to achieve our long-term goal of reducing working capital to the mid teens.","Please turn to slide 7 and I'll take you through our fourth quarter performance. We recorded orders of $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter, an increase of 10% organically year-over-year with good growth across all three segments. Revenues were up 17% in the fourth quarter, organic growth was 7%, acquisitions contributed 6% and we benefited 4% from foreign exchange. From an end market perspective, public utilities were up 10% organically. While we had an easier comparison to the flat performance in the prior year period as Patrick mentioned, this growth reflects strength across nearly all regions in applications globally driven by continued momentum in our markets and some share gains.","Industrial was up 3% including mid single-digit growth in the U.S. and Europe as we continue to see recovery in those markets. Rounding out our performance we saw a continued strength in residential and commercial markets up 15% and 4%, respectively. I'll touch on these markets in more detail in the Applied Water segment discussion in just a few minutes. Regionally, the U.S. market drove most of the organic increase for the quarter and was up 9%. Emerging markets and Western Europe were up 6% and 3%, respectively. EBITDA margins increased 40 basis points in the quarter to 20.2%. This margin expansion was primarily driven by ongoing savings from our productivity programs and volume leverage. This was partially offset by inflation, unfavorable revenue mix and higher investments for growth.","Operating margin for the quarter was 15.2%, which is up 10 basis points versus the prior year excluding purchase accounting and amortization. Overall, I'm encouraged by the continued momentum in our markets and the strong execution by our teams in delivering fourth quarter earnings per share of $0.76, an increase of 15% year-over-year.","Please turn to slide 8, and I'll provide additional details on our segments. I'm just going to address our fourth quarter's segment results but the details of our full-year segment performance are included. Water Infrastructure recorded orders of $566 million in the quarter up 11% organically year-over-year. This growth was primarily driven by wastewater transport orders which increased more than 20% reflecting strong demand across all regions. We exited the quarter with total backlog of $610 million up approximately 17% organically over the prior year period and providing us with confidence in delivering our first quarter revenue outlook. It's also worth noting that a higher percentage of our backlog entering 2018 is shippable beyond one year due to several large project wins during the quarter.","Water Infrastructure revenue of $583 million in the quarter represents a 6% year-over-year increase on an organic basis, with foreign exchange providing a $21 million headwind. In the U.S., segment revenues were up 8% overall driven by strength in wastewater transport market and double-digit growth in our dewatering business, which has benefitted from the continued recovery in the industrial energy and commodities sectors. These businesses were also strong in Canada where we posted 22% growth. Emerging markets revenue increased 5% with mid-single digit growth in all regions. On a particular note with the demand in China and the Middle East for wastewater transport pumps as well as 60% growth in India for more custom pump projects.","Western Europe was up 3% overall primarily driven by treatment project deliveries in the Netherlands, Belgium and France. Operating margin for the segment decreased 70 basis points to 18.4%. Benefits from cost reduction and volume leverage were more than offset by higher inflation, foreign exchange transactional losses and higher year-over-year strategic investments to accelerate growth in product localization in key emerging market countries.","Please turn to slide 9. Applied Water booked orders of $373 million in the quarter, which was up 6% organically over the prior year period. Our book-to-bill ratio was 1 in the quarter, which is in line with our historical performance. Overall we exited the quarter with backlog of approximately $200 million up 20% organically compared to last year. Our shippable backlogs for the first quarter of 2018, increased 13% on an organic basis. This provides us with good confidence in our first quarter revenue outlook but it's important to remember this is a very short cycle business and backlog represents less than a third of our expected first quarter revenues.","Revenue was $373 million or 5% organically versus the prior year quarter. In Europe revenue increased to 7% driven by a double-digit growth in both industrial and residential applications. Our investments in new products and sales capabilities have enabled us to take modest share in these markets. In the U.S., segment revenue was up 6% year-over-year, this was primarily driven by the segment's commercial business which benefited from cold weather in the Northeast driving recycling of heating and circulator pumps. The industrial vertical was also strong in the quarter as the general industrial and oil and gas markets continued their recoveries.","Finally, emerging markets revenue grew 4% reflecting strong growth in China and other Asia Pacific countries from demand for secondary clean water sources. We had double-digit growth in the Middle East from large project volumes and some modest market share gains as we continue to benefit from the investments we've made to localize our supply chain. This growth was partially offset by weakness in the commercial business in Asia Pacific as well as softness in Latin America. Segment operating margin in the quarter increased 150 basis points to 17.2% year-over-year, the highest for any quarter for the Applied Water segment. Margin expansion was driven by 340 basis points of productivity savings as well as volume leverage. This was partially offset by 190 basis points of cost inflation and 70 basis points of growth investments.","Now, let's turn to slide 10. Measurement and Control Solutions booked orders of $331 million in the quarter which was up 12% organically over the prior year period. Revenues for the quarter, was $321 million up 10% on a pro-forma organic basis over the prior year period. This includes 15% pro forma organic growth in our Sensus business and 1% growth in our analytics business. For Sensus, revenue in our water business increased 11% year-over-year in the quarter, which was in line with our expectations as we lapped the challenging comparisons to the prior year from the restocking of our [IPro] water meters. And we also delivered higher growth from AMI deployments in North America as well as increased demand in Eastern Europe and the Middle East.","Our gas business was up 35% mostly from the growth in large AMI project deployments in North America during the quarter. Electric was down modestly in the quarter, due to the timing of large project deployments. We continue to see high demand for our solutions in this sector and in fact during the quarter we shipped our 1 millionth Stratus meter, a pretty impressive accomplishment for having been launched only a year ago.","Finally, the team delivered a 45% increase in revenues in our Software and Services business which was largely driven by a couple of major contract upgrades. Shifting to our Analytics business, it delivered 1% growth in the quarter, double-digit growth in emerging markets from strong demand in China and India for surface water monitoring applications was largely offset by a softness in Europe.","Now moving to segment margins; adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter improved 170 basis points year-over-year to 19.9%. The increase was primarily due to 290 basis points from productivity savings as well as benefits from volume leverage, partially offset by cost inflation and higher investments for new product development and revenue synergy programs. In the quarter adjusted operating margin for the segment increased to 130 basis points from 9.3% to 10.6% and was up 190 basis points excluding the impact of purchase account.","Now, please turn to slide 11 for an overview of cash flows and the company's financial position. We closed the quarter with a cash balance of $414 million. Free cash flow in the quarter increased 58% from the prior year to $261 million, and was driven largely by significant improvements in working capital across all of our businesses, as well as strong operating performance in Sensus. Free cash flow conversion was 147% for the year, the highest in our history as a public company.","We invested $51 million for capital expenditures in the quarter and returned $33 million to our shareholders through dividends. We also repaid $98 million of debt which was the remainder of our outstanding short-term borrowings. We closed the year with debt at 3 times to EBITDA which is below our original forecast for the year and we remain committed to maintaining our investment-grade credit rating.","Now, please turn to slide 12 and Patrick will cover the update to our 2018 outlook.","Patrick Decker","Thanks, Mark. As we discussed we entered 2018 with solid momentum. We are confident that this momentum and the initiatives we continue to invest in are advancing us to our long-term growth in earnings targets. At the top line we expect to deliver full-year revenue of approximately $5.1 billion to $5.2 billion reflecting organic growth rate of 4% to 6%. Pure will add approximately 2% to our reported 2018 revenue. Our continuous improvement initiatives will continue to generate savings which we expect to total about a $160 million in cost savings to the full-year. This is a 10% year-over-year increase and will keep us well on pace to meet our long-term target.","Our adjusted operating margin is forecasted to expand 60 basis points to 100 basis points to between 14% to 14.4%, this excludes about 20 basis points of margin dilution from acquisitions. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to improve by 70 basis points to 100 basis points which should bring that to a range of 19.4% to 19.7%. At the bottom line we expect to generate adjusted full-year earnings per share in the range of $2.82 to $2.97, this excludes integration, restructuring and realignment costs of about $35 million. Adjusted EPS growth is projected to be in the range of 18% to 24% for the year.","Finally, as Mark discussed, we expect to continue to generate solid cash from operations. This will enable us to deliver free cash flow conversion of at least 115% in 2018. This contemplates anticipated capital expenditures of $190 million to $200 million.","Now, please turn to slide 13 and I'll walk you through our end-market assumptions. Public utility constitutes about 47% of our revenue. We are entering 2018 with solid momentum in this end market and we continue to see indicators of sustain growth particularly in the U.S. and key emerging markets. For 2018, we expect revenue in public utilities to grow in the mid-single-digit range overall. The smart meter market is projected to generate slightly higher growth in the high-single digit range.","Industrial end market revenues represent about 36% of revenue. Here we continue to see a mixed environment. The light industrial markets specifically in the U.S. and Europe are solid and we see the oil and gas and mining sectors continuing to improve. That will be balanced by mixed conditions across the emerging markets where strength in China and India which are benefiting from increased government investments will be somewhat offset by softness in parts of Latin America. As a result, we projected industrial to be up low to mid single-digits.","Moving to the commercial end market, which makes us about 12% of our revenue, we expect 2018 organic growth to be in the low to mid single-digit range. Here we see low but stable growth in the U.S. and some moderation in Europe which is coming off of more than two years of strong growth. We expect to see some strength in the emerging markets where the Smart Cities initiative in India and solid growth in China continues to drive demand. We also anticipate greater success in winning larger projects in the Middle East now that we are able to produce products locally.","Finally in residential, about 5% of our revenue, we anticipate full year 2018 revenue growth in the mid single-digit range coming off of particularly strong growth in 2017. We expect the competitive dynamics to continue in the U.S. where demand tends to be replacement driven. We do anticipate a continuation of a solid demand we've been seeing in China and other Asia Pacific countries as residents seek a secondary clean water source.","Now please turn to slide 14, and Mark will walk you through more details on the outlook.","Mark Rajkowski","As we've done in prior years, we're providing a seasonal profile of our business as well as highlights of our 2018 planning assumptions. As Patrick just discussed, we're guiding to 4% to 6% organic growth for the company in 2018. This breaks down by segment as follows; 4% to 6% growth in Water Infrastructure, 3% to 5% growth in Applied Water and 7% to 8% growth in Measurement and Control Solutions. We're assuming an FX euro rate of 1.21 which was the average rate for January through the end of last week. For your reference, we've included our FX sensitivity table in the Appendix.","We're also updating our estimated tax rate to reflect our current view following the passage of the new tax law in December. Overall, tax reform will be modestly beneficial to our business, lowering our long-term structural tax rate from 22% to 20%. Also, during the fourth quarter we recorded a $45 million non-cash charge in connection with the new tax law, which reflects the cost of repatriation of foreign earnings, partially offset by the benefit from re-measuring our U.S. deferred tax liabilities at the new rate. We estimate that the cash taxes to be paid related to repatriation will be approximately $60 million. [Probably] over the years, and this will partially offset the benefit of lower cash taxes payable in the U.S. due to the rate reduction.","Now, moving to our first quarter planning assumptions; we expect growth in the range of 5% to 6% as we lap a relatively weak first quarter in the prior year and benefit from the strong backlog position exiting the year. We expect our first quarter adjusted operating margin to be in a range of 11.3% to 11.5%, this reflects a 110 basis points to 140 basis points of margin expansion excluding the dilution in share purchase accounting amortization. Also, the first quarter is Pure's seasonally lowest revenue period and is expected to result in a penny of EPS dilution.","With that, I'll turn the call back over Patrick for some closing comments.","Patrick Decker","Thanks, Mark. 2017 was a strong year for Xylem. We delivered on our financial commitments and made significant progress on each of our strategic priorities. Our teams are executing well and that is manifesting in stronger results in both the top and bottom line. I'm very pleased with the momentum that we've been building across the business. With a growing portfolio of smart solutions, we are forging deeper customer relationships, becoming a value partner and not just a supplier. We are in a very strong financial position fueled by excellent cash generation. This will enable us to continue to deploy capital in smart ways. We understand what our customers' challenges are and where we can create the most value in their operations and for Xylem. That's where we will continue to focus our innovation and M&A activities. We look forward to continuing this progress in 2018 further strengthening our performance and advancing on our 2020 objectives.","Now operator we can open up to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Nathan Jones with Stifel.","Nathan Jones","One of the things I noticed from the slide deck here is that the level of investments in the fourth quarter, are higher than they were to the whole year. Can you talk about what the incremental level of investments is -- increases in 2018? What kinds of things that you are investing in, where you are in the development process to those kinds of things? I know this transferring Sensus technology to the legacy portfolio and that kind of stuff. Can you just give us an update on what these investments are, where they are going, what kind of level we should think of as a sustained level of the investment in the businesses here?","Patrick Decker","Sure. So Nate I'll -- maybe I'll talk directionally as to where we are investing and so forth and timing of that and then I'll let Mark speak specifically to the rate of investments that we saw in Q4 and what we expect for '18. I think directionally what we're seeing here is we've made good progress. The teams have identified specific areas of investments to drive the synergies with respect to leveraging the Sensus technology and those new offerings to market. Two, we've seen opportunities to increase our investments in emerging markets and accelerate those growth investments as we focus on localization. And I would also say that we have made some good investments in building out some of our marketing capabilities as well, especially around our vertical marketing efforts. So those are a few examples. Obviously as we turn to 2018 we are not planning -- I mean if you look at our long-term targets we put out last April at Investor Day we are not looking at any kind of increases in investment levels above what we laid out there. A lot of this is timing within any given quarter depending upon how we thought about the performance to the business. But Mark you want to comment on specifically [dollars].","Mark Rajkowski","And I think Nate one of -- if you just look at the year-over-year one of the things you have to keep in mind is in 2016 we had fairly heavy investment in building out some of the capabilities in the Middle East and so that to some extent depressed if you will that year-over-year comparison. So we did ramp-up a little bit more in the back half of the year and some of that is just a function of being clearer in terms of what and where we need to spend money relative to building out our systems intelligence, centers of excellence. We are building out capability in emerging markets as well to take advantage of what we believe will be continued very strong growth rates in 2018 and beyond. So, some of it is just the timing of what we've spent in 2016 and how that ramped up and really just some of the time it's taken us to really make sure that as we do ramp up our spending we know what we're -- what and where we should be spending at.","Patrick Decker","To close out on that one, Nate, I wouldn't read anything into the kind of spike there in investment levels in Q4 as to any change and view on our investment strategy or our margin targets of the company. It's simply timing from anyone quarter or year to the next.","Nathan Jones","Okay. That's fair. And then I know -- I mean everybody fascinated with the opportunities for marrying the Sensus technologies together with the legacy portfolio. I know you've been doing some development and some pilot testing of that. Can you talk about where you are in that process? When we should start to see those things coming to market and what the commercial opportunities are?","Patrick Decker","Sure. Yeah, so as I've said before we've got pilots going in a number of locations around the world, the customers that obviously will remain nameless here for competitive reasons. But -- and we really are looking at capabilities or opportunities to leverage the Sensus technology from a comps perspective and a data analytics perspective and to the wastewater sector of the market. We talked about energy efficiency along the wastewater network as well as now we have the opportunity also to marry our capabilities within Sensus on the AMI deployment piece along with what we already have in the Visenti with Pure and Emnet to build out an even stronger offering there, not just in non-revenue water, but also as we go after one of the big [pain] wins at our utility customers space and city space and that is combined to overflows. The whole storm water overflow challenge is a big issue.","So, now we see an opportunity to even augment some of the pilots that we're already doing by bringing in these other capabilities. So, I think you should expect to begin, to hear about some of those wins here, I'd say in the early middle part of 2018 and that really begins to ramp at least in terms of project wins later this year into 2019. Those projects and they are not turn to revenue in 2018, but they are a longer lead time, but I would certainly be expecting to be announcing some significant wins there this year.","Nathan Jones","When do you think you'd be kind of at a run-rate kind of level of production of these kind of products?","Patrick Decker","Well, I mean each one of these projects and offerings are going to be unique. There is not a one size fits all, and so I wouldn't look at it -- I don't think the measurement is going to be so much, there is going to be a run rate of a product offering or technology offering. I think it's going to be when are we at a point where we got a steady stream of contract wins and revenues coming through on that. And I would say certainly late this year is the expectation. Doesn't mean we are not going to get any before then. But I think in terms of being able to say we're there now and we actually have an established offering that we're able to use reference account wins to win other projects [indiscernible]. Best thing about winning big projects is you win more big projects because of the reference and so that's the aim here.","Nathan Jones","Got you. And I'll pass it on. Thank you very much.","Patrick Decker","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Deane Dray, RBC Capital Markets.","Deane Dray","Thank you. Good morning everyone.","Patrick Decker","Good morning, Deane. ","Deane Dray","Hey, maybe to start with the record free cash flow and I was glad to hear Mark say he was very fond of that metric because I think the investors are too. So, and Patrick you said that a couple of years ago you were underachieving and I'll say you were like below 90% but you made it a priority. And so we're seeing it come through here. So for Mark you touched on the improvements in working capital 18.5 this year, mid-teens is your goal. Talk about the timeframe to get there, incentives for the management team and the sustainability of these levels because that would put you at like the top five of the multi-industry sector in terms of conversion?","Mark Rajkowski","We did make very good progress this year but as we look at the opportunities across our supply chain and inventory some of our processes in terms of the billing and collection of receivables and even in payables there is still good room for opportunity to improve. That mid teens target is certainly something that we think is achievable and out in 2020, but we're looking at making continued progress in 2017, so we would expect if I won't be a 150 basis points but another good chunk of progress. So a lot of work to do we've got opportunities around standardizing payment terms, cleaning up our processes and also in terms of on the commercial front just as we negotiate contracts getting more cash up front.","Patrick Decker","I would say Deane, a couple of things I would add, so you are right that you asked the question about incentives as well. When I made a comment a couple of years back about us underperforming, one of the changes that we made at that point in time was to simplify our annual incentive plan and to broaden the scope population of people that were in that. And one of the three metrics that we have; obviously one is organic revenue growth, the other being our operating expenses income targets. But the third was working capital as a percentage of revenue. And I would say it took -- and it is often times the case it took a good year or so for that to sink in and for the organization to really understand the levers that they could pull to drive that and the impact. And I would say where we've really felt good this year was really in the second half of the year.","They are really seeing to be a pivot across the organization in terms of things come together and the part of that was driven by us bringing some talent over from [2015]. Since it's been a terrific job historically because they had a crisis years ago in terms of having to deal with working capital and cash and to transfer those learning's has gone a long way. And I think the new frontier for us beyond what Mark laid out is as we bring more and more of this longer term contract mix into our portfolio on the smart water solutions our customers are usually willing to give you some payment upfront to really finance that. And so I would expect a mix of our revenues to be favorable there in terms of working capital.","Deane Dray","This is all good to hear. And for my follow-up I just wanted to follow-up on Nathan's last question there on these new smart infrastructure platforms. So we've heard all about non-revenue water. We understand how Pure fits in with Visenti and what's been done in Singapore and what the opportunities are. We've heard a bit, you've been cagey Patrick about the water shed opportunities but I've heard from customers. I know which customers are doing the pilot programs the feedback has been very good so we're excited about that. So maybe a bit more on the combined storm overflow, I know it's a pain and coming to this or not I was here in South Bend or excuse me I was in Austin for the big water conference. And I sat in the presentation from the South Bend Municipality and they talked about Emnet. And they gave -- they showed the dashboard, was pretty compelling and now turns now it's part of Xylem. So, take us through what that opportunity is?","Patrick Decker","Sure. Yeah, so I would and this is a big compliment to the Emnet team that in terms of what you've shared there. And we love the team, we love what we've seen there. I would almost view them as an equivalent of the Visenti of wastewater and storm water overflow. They've got a terrific distributed sensing capability and data analytics capability to really help cities and municipalities both predict and deal with surges around storm water overflow. So, as you are well aware and you would have heard there being heavy rainfall, snow melt, a variety of things cause serious systems overflow and exceed the capacity of the wastewater treatment plant or they run-off and they directly flood rivers and streams and so forth.","So, again Emnet provides this predictive analysis capability that helps the -- again the wastewater part of utility better design and prepare for those kind of events. We see that -- as you will know they have a number of these contracts underway across the U.S., but they are really just getting started. South Bend was their origin, these guys [can add another dam] to address that. And we really think that this is a great opportunity for us to leverage our channel to certainly not just here in the U.S., this is an issue that we deal with around the world. And it really is a new market.","Deane Dray","Yeah. Absolutely and it's great seeing you making an acquisition in this space. Just last point, just and related to this, the whole premise of using M&A as a proxy for R&D and it seems like Emnet fits that exactly and just talk about the funnel of whether Emnet type of acquisitions out there?","Patrick Decker","Sure. Yes we've -- one of the things we are really excited about here is the opportunity to have I am sure many of you have had a chance to meet and work with before, I really as I said in my prepared remarks they have been instrumental with myself and the team here and Colin and others too really kind of architect what this platform needed to look like based upon our value mapping of our customers a few years back. And so, I would say we already knew going into the acquisition of Pure and Emnet, we had a pretty good idea of what those pain points and our gaps were, so we already at a growing pipeline of things like Emnet and we've got a number of others that are out there that we are quoting right now. I would say that what I'm even we're excited about is, Jack Elliott, the CEO of Pure, has agreed to stay on with me as the Senior Advisor to myself, to Al and to Colin to really help us architect even further, what this broader universe of opportunities can look like as we drive even more of a complicated approach towards the utility.","So, while we think we've got a pretty good view on that, obviously the ability to get in there with these customers and further explore what their pain points is really just kind of inform further what that pipeline looks like. So, there is more to come, Deane.","Deane Dray","Thanks.","Patrick Decker","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mike Halloran, Baird.","Michael Halloran","Hi, good morning everyone.","Patrick Decker","Hi, good morning Mike.","Michael Halloran","So, first on the demand side obviously really dynamic orders and good to see the acceleration of orders to be here. The prepared remarks commented on a lot of those orders providing a nice runway through 2018 but more into 2019. So, could you parse out what you're seeing both in terms of cost to [repair] replace the shorter cycle stuff how the momentum carried in the fourth quarter and how you are thinking about that into next year? And then also large projects funnel customer willingness to put capital dollars forward and kind of compare contrast those two dynamics?","Mark Rajkowski","Yes, Mike let me take that one and I would say that the order strength was fairly broad based in terms of what we saw in bookings space. There was quite a bit of short cycle business, I mentioned transport was up 20% year-over-year and that's generally shorter cycle. However one of the things that we did see over the past quarter we were very successful in winning a number of larger projects and as a result as we decompose that backlog we had a much higher percentage than normally that will be shippable beyond 2018. So it wasn't there -- I would say it wasn't that we saw a decline in the shorter cycle business, that was still there but what was really encouraging was we are really starting to get traction on some of these larger projects. Treatment as well as industrial and in a number of those certainly our emerging markets countries where we have made investments to be able to be responsive to those types of opportunities.","Patrick Decker","I think that Mike, that if you -- and maybe to tie that back to what we're guiding to for 2018 and kind of what the cadence looks like over the course of the year, bear in mind that certainly Q3 and Q4 were a little bit easier compares to the previous year but they were strong in terms of order and growth overall. As we look at '18, I would say the way it shapes up is kind of 5% to 6% in both Q1 and Q2 and then probably moderates to 4% to 5% in Q3 and Q4 just because you get a little bit tougher compare at that point. But I think what we felt good about with those orders that go out to 2019 as well as the fact that when you look at our bidding pipeline and our treatment business looks, we've always uses a proxy for the health of the bidding market that continued to grow year-over-year. It is up north of $2.6 billion now in terms of bidding pipeline. So all indicators of that we are still well in -- we are still kind of in the early to mid-stages of this cycle of recovery and don't really see any signs there of any softening or weakness.","Michael Halloran","So just summing that up I mean essentially continued short-cycle strength excuse me and momentum on that side while you are building the project backlog at a pace that is better than you seen over the last few years with a still nice pipeline in front of you, that's fair?","Patrick Decker","That's what I said.","Mark Rajkowski","Yes.","Michael Halloran","And then on the margin side obviously really in gross margin in Applied and in the Sensus businesses maybe just talk a little bit about infrastructure. I understand a lot of the puts and takes there particularly on the growth side. So one that I was trying to get a little color on was the really the lack of volume, price mix, other leverage. I'm guessing the volume leverage is still there but maybe the price mix other components were a little less. So maybe what happened in the fourth quarter and just how you think about incrementals in the next year on a core basis there?","Mark Rajkowski","Yes, sure Mike and you are right I mean there was solid volume leverage. Price was flattish, it wasn't a big factor. Where we took a little bit of hit there was I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we did have some FX transactional losses. We do sell a lot of product out of Europe in US dollars and as we try and hedge as much of that as we can, but when the Euro really moves it has an impact. So, that was one factor. And we just talked a little bit earlier about the great success that we had in some of our emerging markets in terms of those growth rates particularly -- I mean India was up 60%, we had good growth in China and those do carry lower margins and, so that there was a bit of unfavorable mix as well. As we look forward, we expect continued margin expansion in that segment and would expect the drops on revenue growth to be more in line with what you typically see in that 25% to 30% drop.","Michael Halloran","Great. Thanks for the answers, Appreciate it.","Patrick Decker","Yeah. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jim Giannakouros, Oppenheimer.","Jim Giannakouros","Hi, good morning everyone.","Patrick Decker","Hi, good morning.","Jim Giannakouros","When looking at your margin progression goal of I think it's 17% to 18% by 2020. Does that adjust for acquisitions and just a clarification question out of the way?","Mark Rajkowski","It's reflective of the amortization that comes with Sensus but I think the important point here Jim is that we do have good confidence in getting to that 17% to 18% target. We're going to continue to generate solid volume growth. Productivity savings are going to be -- we continue to deliver strong productivity savings. In fact we've got significant opportunities around our back office that we're ramping up this year and will really be a big lift in 2019 and 2020. We really haven't seen any of the benefit from some of the volume leverage and revenue synergies that we'll certainly expect to be getting with Sensus. And so, we've got very good confidence in terms of our ability to deliver that 17% to 18% by 2020.","Jim Giannakouros","Got it. And since you touched on that Sensus legacy down revenue synergy opportunities that $150 million to $200 million or so, are you tracking on plan there? Or you I'm sorry if I misunderstood you anticipating revenues there?","Patrick Decker","No Jim I think that's right, I mean I think what I believe to earlier was I think the good indicator for us this year is we're definitely going to have revenue synergies that comes from Sensus, while revenue synergies that are coming also from the Pure transaction and the new platform we are building here. But I mean the real strong indicator is going to be what are some of the big project wins and order momentum that we have that we can talk to later this year and as we exit 2018 going into 2019. So not aware -- not counting on the revenue there, but that's not really reflected in guide for this year. I'm really focused more on what the order rate, momentum and the contract wins are as we get later in the year.","Jim Giannakouros","Understood. And one follow on if I may residential exposure within the Applied Water is subject to specific regional influences if I recall, but you're -- in your slide and Patrick you reiterated that you are calling for mid-single digit [growth] of 12% comp in '17 that's stellar can you frame that for us a bit more granularly? Appreciate thanks.","Patrick Decker","Yes, so I'll certainly give you my thoughts on that. I mean if you look at what happened in certainly 2017 and the fourth quarter, we had a lot of strength in China and across Asia Pac. We also had some share gains in Europe in some of the new products that we rolled out there. I would say growth in the U.S. is flattish in the fourth quarter but it was strong for the full-year. What happened I think to the full-year was you get that Asia Pac, Europe growth that's being driven there by domestic expansion, but it was also we've had some disruption as you all know in the competitive dynamic here in the U.S. in terms of one of our competitors buying our distributor and that created some disruption in the marketplace that our teams were successful in taking advantage of quite frankly and that got us nice path for 2017. We do see all that moderating as we go into 2018 but we expect here to be at least solid market growth in '18, I wouldn't be calling share gains in '18 it really is more of the market growth here predominantly in the U.S. and Europe.","Operator","Our next question will from the line of Joe Giordano with Cowen.","Joseph Giordano","Well just to start on the Sensus side, obviously things are well ahead of the growth rates that you have underpinning 2020. I wondered if and Patrick you just commented on the big piloting revenues are still ahead of you. But we've talked about I think you mentioned something of $100 million of revenue synergies would be almost a disappointment if you didn't get there. Are you seeing any of that right now?","Patrick Decker","In terms of the actual revenue synergy or in terms of conference and our outlook?","Joseph Giordano","Well, I guess both. I mean the growth rates here of 15% you are starting to see is that something that would have happened without the Xylem portfolio behind it? Is that just a -- how much of this is the stuff that you sure were able to in partnering to the company?","Patrick Decker","I would say there is nothing that has been achieved to date that we would explicitly call out as Xylem driven synergies. Now have there been cases where there is perhaps a bit of a halo effect in terms of winning some contracts and bids, perhaps, but the things that we call as a revenue synergy are going to be very explicit in terms of bigger deals that the team either wasn't even looking at before or were but didn't have the relationship and then some of these new offerings to the market that we've talked about earlier with Dan in terms of leveraging the Sensus technology across the portfolio. Those areas we continue to remain very confident. We get a regular tracking here each month from the team in terms of what those look like where they stand and those are not reflected in the Sensus growth rate to date nor are they reflected in the guide that we've given you for 2018.","Joseph Giordano","And then when I think about that market that new re-market in general obviously a huge fall off in terms of market share after you get through the first few major players there, big transaction in the space of [Indiscernible] and I just wonder did you see any of these like smaller players as complementary to your business from a technology standpoint is there an opportunity there to kind of consolidate a little bit of that industry?","Patrick Decker","I would say as I look at that sector right now I wouldn't -- as I look at it today things can obviously change. I wouldn't say that consolidation of the metering sector is a high priority for us. I think that the moves that have happen here, I think are good for the metering sector, I think it's a healthy move in terms of that consolidation. There are a lot of players in the space, but certainly when we look at our core offerings and what we're focused on, we don't see it really having a meaningful impact, if anything its net positive for us. But again I wouldn't see us being a major consolidator in the metering space as I look at it today in terms of what our overall priorities are for growth.","Joseph Giordano","Okay. And then Mark, you kind of talked about this a little bit earlier following this on just some of that but, when we think about the margin guidance for 2020, 17% to 18% maybe exiting 2018 at a lower levels than we thought part of that given the deals and things that you've done. Have the buckets that get you to that level changed somewhat? I mean revenues probably coming in a little harder than we thought and margins while exiting 2018 a little bit lower. So, how do you closing that gap with 17%?","Mark Rajkowski","I don't think the buckets have changed materially in any respect. So, I think there is a -- we are growing a little bit higher than we thought in 2017, some of that was stronger growth in our treatment business and in emerging markets which have a little bit more lower margin profile. But, the biggest driver productivity savings is right where we expected it to be and we expect that to continue as we outlined back in April at our Investor Day. The level of investments is relatively in line with what we expected, the timing might be a little bit off just in terms of the year-over-year compare, but relative to what we're -- the quantum about the spend is in line. And so -- there is -- it's very much what we expected and there is really nothing that we see looking at ahead that would give us reason to believe that those buckets in terms of what's driving the margin expansion are shifting.","Joseph Giordano","Great. And Patrick maybe if you could just comment on like your appetite for large scale M&A in this environment where multiples keep lining. So, and I'm going to leave it there. Thanks.","Patrick Decker","Sure. Yeah, so look we're going to continue to be strategic and our focus around M&A. Obviously, everything we do from an M&A standpoint really needs to tie into what our overall growth strategy is, not just for the sake of going and getting bigger or doing something. And so, I take us back to what I laid out at Investor Day last year in terms of the three focus areas; one being obviously building out the kind of smart infrastructure component. Two, was looking at the opportunities over time do expand our presence in the industrial part of the water sector. And then the third was where necessary obviously we would defend our core franchises here in terms of any consolidation necessary there.","In terms of capacity, we certainly have the financial capacity to be able to do this. We have the management capacity to do things of larger scale. But right now we really are just focusing in on integrating what we've got here, building out even new capabilities and really kind of again in my view hopefully establishing a first mover advantage in some of these spaces. So, that's where our focus and attention is right now, at this point in time Joe. Again, we'll continue to look at things in this space as need to and as they come along, but nothing specific that we're looking at right now of size and scale.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from the line of John Walsh with Vertical Research.","John Walsh","So thinking about the margin bridge for 2018 you've obviously covered a lot of ground. I mean cost inflation headwinds have kind of been pretty steady here through '17. Just wanted to get you view as we think about '18 there in terms of cost inflation and what are kind of the biggest pain points in that line either around people, inflation and\/or commodities?","Mark Rajkowski","Once again we are expecting the biggest driver of margin expansion will be the benefits from our productivity programs. That will be in that 300 basis point plus range. We do expect to see some nice volume drop. I mean with higher growth rates we will see a margin expansion from volume leverage. Some of that would be a little bit of unfavorable mix as we continue to grow our or see our size growth in emerging markets. Inflation we're seeing it tick up a little bit. Our expectations for the full-year is roughly 200 basis points of headwind. A lot of that is just it's a labor cost benefit cost. There is certainly a tick up we are seeing in some of the commodities but it's not rapid. I mean aluminum, steel, copper, but they are not huge components of our product build and we will continue to invest in -- at rates that are clearly consistent with where we've been in over this past year.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Lee","Not to beat a dead horse here, but I think you guys had targeted if I recall $40 million in revenue synergies with Sensus in 2018. Is that target officially shifting out some here? I just want to clarify, because it sounds like it's not part of the 7% to 8% of your Measurement and Control Solutions? And then I guess if it is pushing out maybe the reasons as to why that might be the case?","Patrick Decker","No, I wouldn't say it's shifting per se. I mean in my view it just we've -- these things take some time. We are talking I'm thinking more run rate to this point in time in terms of contract wins. Look we are going to get some revenue synergy here in 2018. We will be clear on mapping out what that is, but we're still I would say not in the early stages but we are still in the stages of pilots on a number of these areas. And that the pilots and these large deal efforts that we are going after -- I talked to you before about the dozen or more large international deals that we were pursuing those things shift around. They take time. There is a lot of investment upfront that we have to do in those areas in terms of time and resource. So, look I hope that leads at much if not more comes through this year. But we didn't feel it prudent necessarily to explicitly build that into our guide for the year.","Brian Lee","Okay. Fair enough. And then one quick one from me and I'll pass it on. And I might have missed this but, Mark I noticed that Canada was, it was highlighted as an area of strength in the Water Infrastructure segment. Can you give some context as to what drove that? How much exposure you have there and if that's the trend line that sustains into the New Year? Thanks.","Mark Rajkowski","Sure. Yeah. It's really a function of strong recovery in oil and gas and mining. Commodities are -- really picked up in that country over this past year and we saw the benefit of that. It's around a $150 million of revenue, so it's relatively sizable but not one of our largest geographies but it was -- it's good to see it bounce back there this year.","Brian Lee","And just any quick [falls] there on the trend line from these levels?","Mark Rajkowski","Well, listen with that kind of growth it's going to be tougher compare. The good news is that the -- those markets continue to remain stable and we'd expect low to mid single-digit growth in 2018, just a very tough compare when you're in the 20s, this year.","Patrick Decker","Yeah. I mean I'll just add that I think that what we saw in Canada this past year really was a recovery and catching up of things that have been differed and delayed because Canada has been on its back for the last couple of years, in recent times we saw our business going down year-over-year. So, we saw some of that recovery, but it really will be kind of low single-digit expected as that market kind of normalizes to typical spend. It's largely driven by again the public utility piece and then a little bit less in our new watering business.","Brian Lee","That's very helpful. Thanks guys.","Operator","Our final question -- our final question will come from the line of Scott Graham, BMO Capital Markets.","R. Scott Graham","Hey, good morning. Well done.","Patrick Decker","Good morning, Scott.","R. Scott Graham","So, I have two questions for you. I suspect you not enter 2017 with the level of inflation that we've seen as we exit 2017. So, I guess what I'm assuming here is that the cost reductions which have been extraordinary are maybe been a little accelerating. You've made some comments about there being off planning. It looks like a little above plan, but even still do you think that there is some stress on the organization Patrick because the price cost with you guys is negative by nature of the business and are the cost reductions maybe providing excess stress in certain areas?","Patrick Decker","Well, I think the short answer is no, I never want to understate the challenge you have in terms of the change management in any organization when you're driving a number of initiatives and cost take out and efficiency and so forth. But, what I'd say has really I think helped mitigate that's stress and anxiety is a couple of things. One, boy is it a whole lot of easier to do that when you are at least in a growth market and people can feel growth going on around them. It was tougher when there was not as much growth that's one. That's certainly helps with the sales team in terms of their motivation and inspiration. But I think it's also being clear and transparent with the organization as to what our priorities are. And that our cost efforts aren't just across the board go after a 1,000 things at one time.","We got programs around global business services implementation. There is a lot of change management going on around that in communication. Two, I think it's important to recognize that a big chunk of our cost savings are coming out of the procurement and the deployment of Lean and Six Sigma. So these are basic purchase capabilities and skills that we're teaching the organization, how to fish in these areas as opposed to being always with a block object and I think when you are giving people those skills and capabilities that makes it easier because they feel empowered to go drive change and make things more efficient. And our CI efforts continuous improvement is not just focused on the cost takeout. It's about making it easier for our customers to do business with us and be faster to market and that always makes an organization feel better.","So I don't want to come across as too much [indiscernible] because it's just easy because it's not this is hard work, it's heavy lifting. I would say if it was that easy it would have already been done. So I recognize that level of stress but no I feel that the organization is very healthy and healthier than it's ever been in my view but it's something you are right Scott that I pay a lot of the attention to and that's why I spent so much time down on the road with our teams in hearing how things are going.","R. Scott Graham","My follow-up question is one of the things that you indicate in your year ago Analyst Meeting was the desire to push up new product sales and development I think it was by that about a 150 basis points over a several year period. You also you personally championed the whole we need to get better in commercialization as well. I guess my questions are on those two metrics where do you think they are impacting the most and where do you -- which areas of the business are maybe lagging in those areas?","Patrick Decker","Yes, so I think the -- I would say that two dynamics or two [things] that are one on the driving kind of commercial leadership and the commercial excellence. Really in my view the whole purpose of me putting it out there was one of our top priorities was to move our organization away from where many industrial companies are and that is spending way too much time focusing on inside the four walls of the company and being an administrative company as opposed to a commercially driven company that is hungry, that understands why you losing order versus why you win one and that the center of gravity is with the sales team and the people that are serving the customer's needs every day. And so putting in things like a net promoter score, mechanism of sales force parameter, so one to measure how customers feel about us, two to measure how our sales teams feel about what we are doing, has I think been a big move forward for us.","It shows that we actually care about what's going on and we've got a lot of areas to improve and that's why that to me is all upside in front of us. We do not get score well and high on either one of those. But the good news is people are being very honest with us about where we can do better and that's what we are very much focused on. I would say an area that we can do also a much better job in is broadening our key account management skills and capabilities, and that's an area that we are now investing in as we go forward. I feel good about the progress in R&D and the spending there and the activities but now it's a matter of commercializing those and embedding those new skills on our selling organization as we sell different value prepositions here. And certainly the acquisition of Sensus and Pure, Emnet, Visenti, those are all very different DNA in terms of how they sell value to customers and that's simply been a nice change in dynamics in our commercial organization.","R. Scott Graham","Very good, thank you.","Patrick Decker","Thank you, Scott.","Operator","Thank you. I'll now turn today's conference over to Patrick Decker for closing comments.","Patrick Decker","Well, thank you all for your interest and your questions and hanging on here. And so, again safe travels, I wish you all Happy New Year. I know we're well into it, but I haven't seen all of you until I do, I get to say Happy New Year. And wish you all the very best.

[Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the call over to, Phil De Sousa, Vice President of Investor Relations.","Phil De Sousa","Well, thank you, Paula and good morning everyone, and welcome to Xylem's third quarter 2015 earnings conference call. With me today are Chief Executive Officer, Patrick Decker; and Interim CFO, Shashank Patel. They will provide their perspective on Xylem's quarterly results and discuss the full-year outlook for 2015.","Following our prepared remarks, we will address questions related to the information covered on the call.

Additionally, the call will be available for playback via the Investors section of our website under the heading, Presentations.","With that said, please turn to slide and I'll turn the call over to our CEO, Patrick Decker.","Patrick Decker","Thanks, Phil and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call. Today we reported another solid quarter for Xylem, with better than expected growth at both the top and bottom lines. We are also reaffirming our full year organic revenue growth expectations of 1% to 2% as well as our full year earnings expectations of $1.82 to $1.87 per share.","I'm pleased with our teams overall executions and we're continuing to build our capabilities. We are in the early stages of executing against the long-term objectives that we laid out at Investor Day last month and I look forward to updating you on our progress.","Before I get into the business highlights for the quarter. Let me start with some color commentary on our markets. As I've discussed previously, Xylem is well positioned in key end markets that have solid longer term growth profiles. Well some concerns do exists in the broader industrial end market and certain sectors of our emerging markets. I'm quite encouraged by the fundamentals and underlying trends impacting our business.","For example, we continue to see positive signs of steady recovery in the Public Utility market, which constitutes roughly one-third of our global business. We are seeing improvement in the Break\/Fix side of the market. This is an area that has been suppressed for the last few years as municipalities have deferred needed repairs and upgrades. But eventually, this equipment either breakdowns or reaches the end of its operational life and must be addressed.","In addition, project quotation and our longer cycle treatment business which we view as the bellwether for the more capital intensive investment cycle of the public utility market remains strong. In fact, our treatment bid pipeline has grown 17% versus a year ago. This is a positive leading indicator for continued order growth that should benefit our entire water infrastructure segment.","Our third quarter organic revenue performance in public utilities, up 5% demonstrates that we are successfully capitalizing on improved market conditions, and increasing our capabilities to gain market share. We are optimistic on the growth outlook of this important end market and we're confident that our strategy will continue to drive above market performance over the long-term.","Industrial was also a significant market for Xylem and similar to other companies in this phase. We certainly are impacted by the underlying market trends. However, we're better positioned than most. Our industrial market exposure is more weighted to the general industrial sector. Oil and gas which has faced extremely steep declines represents less than 5% of our total revenues.","So consistent with our performance year-to-date, we continue to anticipate modest growth in general industrial, offset by the near-term headwinds in oil and gas, which we begin to lap in the second quarter of 2016. From a regional perspective, I remain optimistic on the US markets. Particularly, the Public Utility and Commercial Building sectors which will address in more detail later on the call.","Europe is more stable than a year ago. And we expect to more favorable outlook given our strong presence in the public utility market there and early signs of success with certain product launches in the residential and commercial building sectors.","I also want to address the emerging markets, which I recognize has been the cause of much hand-wringing over the past few months. During the third quarter, our business and emerging markets grew 9% overall. Driven by continued investment in infrastructure and we remain on track to deliver high single-digit growth for the year.","As we discussed at Investor Day, we have a clear strategy to drive growth in these regions including localizing more research and development, building our manufacturing capabilities and strengthening lower local teams.","These initiatives will position us to continue to capture a larger share of the growing infrastructure investments being made in the emerging markets. While there has been some deceleration in the commercial building and general industrial sectors. Our business is overweighed to the water and wastewater utility sectors in the emerging markets.","For example, we posted 12% growth in China in the third quarter, significantly outpacing the market. That growth was fuelled by an 18% increase in our water infrastructure segment, well our Applied Water segment grew 3% year-over-year. In other regions, we continue to expand and further penetrate the markets.","Take India, where we grew more than 300% in the third quarter. I'm very proud of our team there, which during the quarter won a $39 million project order which we will begin to deliver to the customer next year. And we made substantial inroads with our Analytical instrumentation business on important government projects such as the Ganges River Cleanup.","Lastly, we continue to make good progress on our investment to expand our presence in the Middle East. These are just a few examples to illustrate why we remain confident that ongoing investment in water and wastewater infrastructure will continue to fuel growth for Xylem in these faster growth regions.","Now let's cover the business highlights for the quarter. Orders were flat organically year-over-year as well lapped last year's particularly strong quarter, when bookings were up 8%. We continue to build backlog existing the quarter with just over $810 million in projects. Of this, approximately $450 million is due to ship in the fourth quarter, representing 44% of our expected revenue.","The remaining $360 million in backlog is expected to ship in 2016 and thereafter. Which represents an 18% year-over-year increase on a constant currency basis, as well as 50% plus increase quarter sequential. We delivered organic revenue growth of 2% in the quarter, which was better than we anticipated coming into the quarter.","Our adjusted operating margins was flat year-over-year excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange translation. The biggest challenge we faced in the quarter was the incremental mixed headwinds from declines in our dewatering rental services and lower margin project deliveries in our Applied Water segment.","We were able to mitigate these factors through continuous improvement activities and by taking action on discretionary cost measures, which also enabled us to continue to invest in future growth initiatives. Given the impact of the significant unfavorable mixed issues. We were pleased with our team's ability to deliver earnings that were slightly ahead of our expectations for the quarter.","At the bottom line we delivered earnings per share of $0.49 up 4% year-over-year excluding the impact of foreign exchange translation. And finally, we delivered another quarter of solid free cash flow performance with conversion of that income of 132% for the quarter.","Now turning to Slide 4, those of you who joined for Investor Day will recall that I laid out a very clear investment thesis for Xylem. First, we're well positioned to benefit from a favorable macro outlook in our key end markets in growing presence in faster growth regions. This positioning in combination with our focused execution will enable Xylem to drive faster than market growth.","Second, we have a clear runway from margin expansion driven by our focus on continuous improvement and business simplification initiatives. And the final element, which I want to touch upon further is our commitment to larger scale balance capital deployment. With our strong cash flow generation and capital structure, we are well positioned to create more value for our shareholders.","During the third quarter, we repurchased more than 2 million shares for $75 million and we have approximately $475 million available under our authorized programs. In addition, we paid $26 million in dividends to shareholders in the quarter or $77 million year-to-date reflecting a 10% increase per share year-over-year.","Finally, I'm pleased to announce that last week, we completed our acquisition of HYPACK. A software firm that specializes in delivering unique solutions and services in the coastal and hydrographic market. Strategically within our $300 million Analytics platform. HYPACK strengthens our position in the surface water, ocean and coastal markets and importantly HYPACK expands our Analytics capabilities in software development.","This transaction is a good example of how we can and will use M&A as a proxy for research and development. As we indicated earlier this year, we have a solid pipeline of targets ranging from small bolt-on businesses to larger targets that can enhance our current portfolio or extend our strategic platforms.","Xylem will continue to be active on the M&A front. And my expectation is that we will close on a number of bolt-on acquisitions over the coming few quarters. Meanwhile, we continue to cultivate targets of larger size. So now let's turn to Slide 5 and I'll cover our full year outlook.","Consistent with our previous guidance, we expect to generate 2015 organic revenue growth of 1% to 2%. We now expect full year operating margin to be approximately 13% up 30 basis points excluding the impact of foreign exchange translation as benefits in productivity actions and volume leverage will likely be partially offset by unfavorable mix.","We are reaffirming our previous earnings per share guidance of $1.82 to $1.87 for the full year, which includes $0.23 of negative foreign currency translation impact. Excluding this headwind, year-over-year EPS growth is still expected to be in the range of 4% to 7%.","Finally, we will continue to execute a balanced approach to capital deployment, which we expect to result in a 100% free cash flow conversion. With that, let me now turn the call over to Shashank Patel to walk you through the results and full year guidance in more detail. Shashank?","Shashank Patel","Thanks, Patrick. Please turn to Slide 6. We generated revenues of $902 million, down $61 million from the prior year. The year-over-year decline reflects the anticipated foreign exchange translation headwind driven by a stronger US Dollar. Excluding this impact organic revenue increased 2% slightly above our expectations.","We saw growth across our key end markets, the strongest being public utility which was up 5% driven by an uptick in municipal spending. Additionally, we generated growth in industrial up 1%, residential up 6% and commercial up 1%. This growth was partially offset by a decline in our smallest end market agriculture which was down 7%.","From a regional perspective, we again saw the strongest performance coming from emerging markets which grew 9%. We continue to experience growth in Western Europe and Australia during the quarter, but we also felt the unfavorable impact from a weak oil and gas market, which drove declines in Canada and the US.","Operating margins was 13.7% flat year-over-year excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange translation. Global procurement, lean initiatives and restructuring savings reduced cost by $29 million in the quarter driving 320 basis points of margin expansion.","Offsetting these reductions were material, labor and overhead cost inflation. Unfavorable mix driven by lower dewatering, rental and sales and lower margin project deliveries and to a lesser extent foreign exchange transaction headwinds. Overall, pricing was neutral for the quarter.","At the bottom line earnings per share declined by $0.04 to $0.49. However, excluding the foreign exchange translation headwind of $0.06, we grew EPS by 4%. Our tax rate was generally in line with our expectations. Our share repurchases during the quarter were executed opportunistically in late August and early September and therefore had a relatively insignificant impact to our share count expectation.","Now, let me cover each our reporting segments. Please turn to Slide 7. Water infrastructure recorded orders of $590 million down 1% organically reflecting a tough comparison with the prior year, when we posted 10% organic growth. The high single-digit growth generated in water and wastewater transport applications was offset by declines in our dewatering business driven primarily by oil and gas market weakness.","Our book-to-bill ratio was $1.07 in the quarter. Slightly better than last quarter but not as strong as last year. Overall, we existed the quarter with backlog of $624 million up 6% on an organic basis. Of this amount, approximately 52% is due to the ship in the fourth quarter with most of the balance expected to ship in 2016.","Well this represents a relatively small portion of our anticipated 2016 revenue, we are encouraged by the 23% organic relative to the comparable figure last year. Revenue of $551 million was up 2% year-over-year on an organic basis. Treatment revenues grew 10% and Test increased 2%. As was the case last quarter, transport was flat overall.","Regionally, we generated most of our growth in the emerging markets. Where we continue to see growth driven by increased regulations and demand for both public utility and industrial water and wastewater infrastructure. We posted 9% organic growth in these faster growing regions including 18% growth in China.","Australia and Western Europe grew 19% and 4% respectively. This growth was partially offset by weakness in the United States and Canada primarily due to declines in the industrial oil and gas markets. Growth accelerated in the Public Utility sector, where we posted better than market performance in the aggregate.","Our performance this quarter reflects the positive longer term outlook, we have for this attractive and stabilizing end market. As I mentioned earlier transport was flat overall for the quarter. We saw a significant growth in our water and wastewater pump business up 9% organically including accelerated growth in the US and Europe. Offsetting this growth was weaker than expected performance in our dewatering business. Which was impacted by year-over-year 45% decline in oil and gas application.","We expect these headwinds to continue until we lapped the first quarter next year. The good news here, is that we continue to benefit from a healthy construction in Public Utility market, where combined we generated approximately 14% growth in the quarter. Our treatment was up significantly with strengthened Western Europe complemented by project deliveries in China and Australia. And to wrap up on the top line, Test grew 2% overall primarily driven by the delivery of our multi-million dollar projects in emerging markets.","Operating margin decreased 90 basis points from 16.3% to 15.4%. Cost reductions, net of inflation drove 60 basis points of operating margin expansion. However, operating margin was negatively impacted primarily by unfavorable mix, which was driven by lower dewatering rental volumes.","We also continue to invest in our strategic growth initiatives in the quarter such as our expansion in the Middle East, which we outlined during Investor Day. While FX translation negatively impacted operating income during the quarter, it had a neutral impact on margin.","Let me now turn to Slide 8 and talk for Applied Water segment. Applied water recorded orders of $349 million up 2% organically. As improving markets conditions and new product introductions in Europe more than offset the anticipated slowdown in China. In the US, our biggest regional exposure we continue to see an improving commercial market driven by the institutional building sector.","We entered the fourth quarter with total backlog of $188 million [ph] up 5% on constant currency basis. Approximately $125 million of this backlog is expected to ship during the fourth quarter representing approximately 34% of our anticipated fourth quarter revenue.","Turning back to the third quarter results. Revenue was $351 million up 3% organically from the prior year. Building service applications were up 3% and industrial water increased 6%. Irrigation declined 7%. Regionally, we generated 7% growth in emerging markets and 21% growth in Canada. The US and Western Europe were also up slightly for the quarter.","Let me provide a few more details on this performance. In Asia, our business increased nearly 10% fueled by growth in India, Thailand, The Philippines and to a lesser extent China where growth decelerated to 3%. Additionally, we delivered mid-teens growth in Eastern Europe and high single-digit growth in Latin America.","In the US, we generated mid single-digit increase in residential and modest growth in commercial and industrial applications, partially offset by weakness in irrigation. Canada grew significantly this quarter, as we delivered on a high spec fire turbine [ph] project and experience some strength in the commercial building sector.","Operating margin declined 40 basis points from 14.4% to 14.0% year-over-year excluding FX translation headwinds. Cost reductions and net of inflation drove 110 basis points of expansion in the segment. However, operating margin was negatively impacted primarily by unfavorable mix driven by lower margin project shipments and the one-time impact of a retroactive Italian compensation tax change.","Now let's turn to Slide 9, where I will cover the company's financial position. Xylem maintains a strong cash position. With a balance of $611 million at the end of Q3. Our net debt to net capital ratio is a healthy 24.5% and our commercial paper and revolving credit facility remain in place and continue to be unutilized.","We remain committed to our balance capital deployment strategy. During the third quarter, we invested $21 million in capital expenditures and we return $26 million to shareholders through dividends. As Patrick discussed, we opportunistically repurchased $75 million in shares under our existing share repurchase plan.","Free cash flow was $116 million during the quarter, which includes a strong conversion on the 132%. With that, please turn to Slide 10 and I'll cover our 2015 guidance.","Beginning with our organic revenue outlook by end market. Industrial, which represents 44% of our total revenue has been flat year-to-date and we anticipate a flat growth the fourth quarter as general industrial growth is likely to be offset primarily by near-term oil and gas headwinds.","Given our fourth quarter outlook for general, industrial growth. We still expect flat full year performance within this market. The Public Utility sector which constitutes 33% of our total revenue is anticipated to grow at a low to mid single-digit rate for the full year. You might recall, that we had a low single-digit growth over the first half of the year. However, we experienced an acceleration in that growth during the third quarter, which we expect to continue through the end of the year.","While we continue to expect above market growth in key regions like the US. Given that we have sizable project scheduled to ship later in the fourth quarter, there is some risk of project deliveries slipping into 2016. For the commercial market, we now anticipate full year organic growth in the mid single-digit range better than our previous expectations and reflecting the positive growth trend in the US institutional building sector.","We are also projecting slightly better full year performance in residential. We now expect this market to grow at a low single-digit range with low-to-mid single-digit growth in the fourth quarter. We expect the fourth quarter to reflect growth in Europe as well as continued growth in emerging markets.","In Europe, we are driving share gains with new products that address customer needs. Driven by increased energy efficiency regulation. As we outlined at Investor Day, this is one example of how our innovation agenda is being developed are on both immediate and emerging customer needs.","Finally, our smallest sector agriculture will likely be down mid-to-high single digits. Strengthen the Western US region driven primarily by continuing drought conditions is expected to be more than offset by the unfavorable impact from floods earlier this year.","Turning to Slide 11 to summarize our revenue outlook as well as cover the rest of our full year guidance. At the segment level, we expect water infrastructure revenue of approximately $2.3 billion. Organically, we now expect growth of flat to up 1%. This is 1% lower than the previously anticipated and it reflects [technical difficulty] dewatering which are related primarily to oil and gas applications.","As Patrick mentioned earlier, we do expect these headwinds to moderate, as we get into the second quarter of 2016. And for Applied Water, we expect revenues of $1.35 billion. Organically, we now expect revenue growth of 2% to 3%, which is slightly better than our previous expectations. This reflects the commercial and residential performance I highlighted earlier.","Segment margins are anticipated to be 14.2% and operating margins are projected to be approximately 13.0% reflecting year-over-year margin expansion up 30 basis points excluding the impact of foreign exchange translation.","At the bottom line, we still anticipate earnings per share of $1.82 to a $1.87 excluding restructuring and realignment cost of $20 million and other special items. We are on track to achieve 100% free cash flow conversion this year. And we continue to invest return on invested capital to remain at approximately 11%. Excluding the anticipated impact of foreign exchange translation, we would expect approximately 50 basis points of improvement in 2015.","While our business is impacted by several currencies. The most significant impact comes from the Euro. Our Euro-Dollar exchange assumptions remains unchanged at a $1.10. Our operating tax rate is expected to be 21%. Approximately 1% higher than 2014 given the expected mix in regional revenue.","And lastly, fully diluted share count is count is now expected to be 182 million reflecting our third quarter repurchase activity. Now I'll turn the call back over to Patrick.","Patrick Decker","Thanks, Shashank. To wrap up, I'd again highlight that we delivered another solid quarter. We continue to see signs of an improving public utility market and post above average organic growth overall, overcoming industrial weakness. We still have a lot of work ahead of us to close out the year, as our teams delivered a very strong fourth quarter last year.","Looking ahead, we know our year-over-year comparison will ease starting in the second quarter of 2016, as we finally lapped the substantial declines in our dewatering rental business driven by the oil and gas sector. In addition, we are committed to maintaining focus on driving productivity and cost discipline, which will enable us to continue to deliver a stronger bottom line performance.","We are also focused on executing our capital deployment strategy. Returning capital via dividends and opportunistic share repurchases and cultivating a solid pipeline of M&A targets. Lastly, I'm encouraged by the progress we've made this year and pleased that we continue to be on track to deliver on our full year commitments. And now operator, we can begin the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Nathan Jones of Stifel.","Nathan Jones","I wonder, if we could just, with trying to get a little bit more color on Slide 6 the volume price mix at minus 50 basis points. I would assume that with plus 2% organic growth, volume was a very slight tailwind and the mix just from dewatering, I would think was probably at least 100 basis points of headwinds.","So I wanted to try and get some idea on how price is behaving overall for the company there.","Shashank Patel","Hi, Nathan. This is Shashank, so I'll take that question. From a price realization standpoint, we're neutral overall. So what we've experienced in the second quarter. We saw third quarter, so there's pockets of price pressure out there. But overall, it was pretty much flat in the third quarter and that's our expectation in the fourth quarter.","The mix dynamic you talked about was primarily coming from the dewatering side, where the oil and gas headwinds were stronger than we had forecasted, so that impacted the mix part of the equation.","Nathan Jones","That's there. I guess price was neutral and I guess, it sounds like it has been for the whole year.","Shashank Patel","Yes, correct.","Nathan Jones","And you did say, in your prepared remarks Patrick, that you're expecting some modest general industrial growth going forward. I think that's probably better than the general industrial economy outlook. Can you talk about what's giving you confidence that you're going to share growth there? Perhaps what the different market exposures are that help you out?","Patrick Decker","Sure I think, first of all it's our geographic exposure that helps in that regard as well. So again, there is some of the emerging markets that factors into that. But it's also, when you look at the nature of our industrial exposure, it much less weighted to the energy sector and much more to broad based general industrial and again, we do - we just continue to see signs of strength that's there.","If you look at where we are in the quarter industrial growth excluding oil and gas was up about 2.5% and that's roughly what we're continued to expect through the balance of the year.","Nathan Jones","Okay, thanks. I'll jump back in the queue.","Operator","Your next question comes from Scott Davis of Barclays.","Scott Davis","Trying to get a sense of your M&A pipeline. Now it's your first deal that we've seen and quite some time and I'm trying to get a sense of this as a first of and many and a flurry, it's relatively small transaction but is there a stuff that's a little bit larger in your pipeline.","Patrick Decker","Sure, thanks Scott. There certainly are acquisitions of larger size in the pipeline. We are actively in discussion with a number of bolt-on targets kind of smaller tuck-ins. Certainly larger than the ones that we announced here, but we also continue to cultivate some larger targets that are out there.","And so, we really highlight this one not so much because of the size, I wouldn't consider this to be typical of the sizes we go after, with really to demonstrate as much that the pause is over. And two, the fact that as I mentioned in Investor Day. I really do see M&A serving sometimes as a proxy for R&D and that really is largely what this acquisition is pointing to.","Scott Davis","Okay, great and then. From a strange question, but trying to get a sense like Break\/Fix infrastructure is old we all know that, but is Break\/Fix the type of thing. I mean, you mentioned it's been weak for a last few years. I mean, I would assume that just based on the installed base you have and infrastructure that you have existing it's pretty old that Break\/Fix would be fairly decent growth through the cycle.","I mean, how do you think about what that should be? I mean, have you drawn out models or how to sense I guess of Break\/Fix specifically should be 5% grower or is it something that could be a little bit better than that because there's pent-up demand.","Patrick Decker","Sure, I'll take that one Scott. So I would say, you're absolutely right. So we've got a very large installed base especially on the Public Utility side and as a result of that. Even throughout the cycle, we would normally see low-to-mid single digits in terms of steady growth.","I think what we're saying here is, we're seeing kind of the upper end of that and would expect that could probably be growing even faster as we go forward here because as you've heard it say before, it really is a trade-off for these infrastructure owners. You can only kick the can down the road so long before it's going to catch up with and you're going to be forced to deal with the Break\/Fix aspect of things.","Now obviously that could moderate and balance towards Greenfield infrastructure investment as well. So it's always the balance in the equation, but we would expect to continue to see probably the upper end of that mid single-digit growth in Break\/Fix.","Scott Davis","That's really helpful. Okay, I'll pass it on, thanks good luck, guys. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets.","Deane Dray","I was hoping you could expand on the data point you gave regarding the bid pipeline being up 17%. Just remind us about the methodology, the parameters, how you're tracking that win rates and how it converts to backlog?","Patrick Decker","Sure. So, our teams have a very, especially in the project side have very good visibility to all of the active projects that are out there within the EPC community as well as the property owners themselves. And certainly as, we've continue to build out the utilization of Salesforce.com. We've got even more visibility to the pipeline and what the conversion rates are and we have seen some improvement in our win rate as well, as an increase just in the level of quoting activity.","And so, pretty rigorous pipeline review that we do on a regular basis. So as I mentioned earlier, Deane in my prepared remarks. We're not really looking at that pipeline so much as a view towards what our treatment business would be per se because as you know the project side is still a relatively small portion of our overall revenue. It's just historically been a leading indicator as to demand that's coming for our broader water infrastructure business overall.","Deane Dray","And just to remind us, that mix between the Break\/Fix and projects. Historically it's been around 70-30 is that still the case?","Patrick Decker","Yes, I'd say that's a case right now. It's probably shifting a bit more towards maybe 75-25.","Deane Dray","Okay and with 75 on the Break\/Fix just, so we're clear.","Patrick Decker","That's correct.","Deane Dray","Okay and then, hoping you can expand on China. Lots of focus in terms of, what their economy is doing, but we're seeing real differences across the multi-industry sector, that's on China growth depending on their vertical exposures and obviously you're on the favorable side of this. So talk about your mix in China pipeline and who you're competing with for these projects. How much of it is domestic Chinese players versus other western players?","Patrick Decker","Sure. So I'll take various aspects of the gains [ph] and if I don't address each of your questions. You're just, remind me again of some elements of it. So we saw again in the third quarter continued robust growth as you pointed out and that really is driven by our over waiting towards public utilities and the municipal side. And that really is being driven by largely the government mandate there around pollution control and water preservation.","So that's the overall macro driver that's there. We obviously have seen a slowdown in the commercial building sector. Although, it was still growth for us in the quarter and we expect that to continue to grow, albeit at a slower pace. In terms of the - who we're competing against there. It is a combination of global players, but also local players.","Obviously part of what we're doing in terms of localizing our product design in China and looking at ways to augment what we call our Tier 1 offering with a Tier 2 offering there as well, is to protect ourselves on the flank in terms of local competition.","We're optimistic about the opportunities that we have there to be able to even grow that kind of Tier 2 segment, while still preserving margins in that business because of the features and benefits that we can decouple and deliver that at a better value for customers more in the Tier 2, Tier 3 cities that can't really afford [indiscernible] any of the larger pumping stations that these large cities do.","Shashank Patel","And just to, this is Shashank just to add to that. So on the - as far as the international players, obviously the [indiscernible] are big one, we compete directly head-on against. And on that side, that is premium value segment of the market and that's a lot of way, we participate today and as Patrick said on the infrastructure side. The investment continues there, so we've continued to see strength there.","As we've all heard, there's been a slowdown on the construction side and that's where we've seen the slowdown in commercial building services, but there again with the localized product. Where we're going to be looking at competing more on the, let's call it the value segment. Which is where you see a lot of the local players.","Deane Dray","Great, that's real helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brian Konigsberg of Vertical Research.","Brian Konigsberg","I just wanted to touch on the fourth quarter guidance. So just looking at the sequential change from Q3 to Q4, you had a pretty big uptick or a decent uptick on sales, which is a bit higher than what you potentially see and then separately just on the margin, you were down you [indiscernible] basis points in Q3 year-over-year, but you're expecting that to take a pretty big step up into Q4, I know there was some mix you said on the Applied Water. But you also noted, the oil headwind being a mix negative, which I assume will continue in the water infrastructure in Q4.","So can you address me the revenue and margin, how you see the progression sequentially?","Shashank Patel","Yes, let me take that one. From a revenue perspective, first point is, we do have an extra day versus the prior year last year, that's what the bottom 1% as far as organic growth. If you recall, last year we had a very tough compare, we were up about 6% in the fourth quarter but when you look at the normalized growth it's more like 3% to 5% in Q4 last year.","Since we equate that and we look at the guidance this year, it's about 1% to 3% organic growth over the fourth quarter last year. Which with the extra day and normalizing last year it's kind of inline and it's supported by the strong order activity we've seen. On the margin question, clearly in the third quarter we had margin headwind not only from the softness in the - from the oil and gas and dewatering, but also the points I noted especially on the AWS side, where we had the Italian tax true up, which was a one-time true up as well as FX transaction and those were primarily driven by the strength in the [technical difficulty].","But when we take a look at that headwind going away, as well as the extra volume leverage we get in the fourth quarter that's how we anticipate the extra margin expansion Q3 to Q4.","Patrick Decker","And Brian, I would just, this is Patrick. I would just add a couple of things. On the margin side, we also as is normally the case, our global procurement savings accelerate over the course of the year. So we'll have some additional procurement savings in Q4 as well. On the revenue side, within that range, obviously we talked about there's always risk of project delays at the end of the quarter shifting from one to the next. The way I would handicap it for you all, it would be within the guidance range that we gave you.","I'd kind of go right down in the middle of fair way in terms of what that revenue guide would be and that would help mitigate any, of that risk that maybe out there. So just to help you guys kind of do your models, I'd say right down the middle of fairway on the revenue guide.","Brian Konigsberg","That's on the water infrastructure side that you noted, possibly.","Patrick Decker","That's overall. Yes, that's actually - it's mainly on the water infrastructure side that you would see some of the bigger project, right.","Brian Konigsberg","Okay great and then just maybe comment a little bit more on the oil and gas. So you're lapping the steep decline starting Q2 of next year. But are you starting to see stability at low rates or are you - is it still falling at a pretty substantial degree even sequentially.","Patrick Decker","Yes, so it's a good question, Brian. Just to maybe help size it up for everyone. So again the oil and gas exposure for us for the whole company, is roughly less than 5% of our 2014 revenue. It's actually going to be down around 3% to 4% of our 2015 revenue given the sharp drop that we've seen. That exposure really has begun to stabilize and we got 44 branches in the US, seven which are the ones that are really tied to fracking and they're the ones that are really been hit the hardest. The team's done a lot of great work in managing the cost side there, mothballing in some locations, moving equipment to other international markets to open up opportunities there.","And so, we really don't see another leg down from a dewatering standpoint and oil and gas. Given that our exposure is really now being contained. That's why we're making the commentary around getting through Q4 and Q1 and then we finally lap that tough compare on that, small piece of our revenue but disproportionately profitable.","Shashank Patel","And just to add to that, the 5% that Patrick talked about as far as the percentage of total revenues. We expect that to be down 50%, so that function change we saw with the oil and gas.","Brian Konigsberg","Okay, that's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ryan Connors of Boenning & Scattergood.","Ryan Connors","I wanted to revisit this topic of mix in Public Utility and think about in a little more strategically, not in the fourth quarter or even 2016, but as the cycle kind of plays out in theory. You've got a pretty good, divergence in the mix there. Your project business is more subject to bid and there, I would assume lower margin, but yes the repair and replaces almost had some aftermarket type elements and higher margins.","So as we move years into this upcycle. Where do you see that mix evolving and where do you see the impact on the margin being?","Patrick Decker","Yes, certainly there would be some shift towards a larger project mix. But it's certainly over the timeframe that we talked about at Investor Day kind of looking at over the next three years to five years. I certainly wouldn't expect that to shift dramatically. There's probably, if you look at it historically that might go up to maybe a third of our overall revenue that would be on the project side versus where we've been tracking over the course of the last few years.","Shashank Patel","The other point - the other point to notice as we discussed during Investor Day. One of the big initiatives on the innovation technology side will be to work around VOD [ph] which is really taking cost out of the material component of our product. So obviously, you talked about long-term, that's the big long-term drive over the next five years and that has an impact directly on the gross margin line and then some of other business simplification work we'll be doing, obviously will improve gross margins as well.","Patrick Decker","I mean to be specific, Ryan on just to give you a feel and maybe to take it back to Investor Day in terms of the targets that we laid out there for you all, that we're marching towards. Historically, our incremental margins have been around that 35% give or take. What we factored into, our long-term outlook was through a combination of some slight uptick in project mix as well as faster growth rates in emerging markets that, that long-term incremental margin that we assumed might be more around that 30%, maybe little slightly better than that, but it's you know probably down about 5 points from historical average and we got that already modeled in, that obviously derived, are thinking also been around simplification, VOD [ph] some of the other things we're doing to offset that to really driver the bottom line expansion, that we committed to.","Ryan Connors","Okay, great and then my second one had to do with sort of the new product pipeline. Obviously, a strategic focus on innovation that was a big theme at the Analyst Day. So can you provide any real-time color on what's hitting the market for you and whether there's anything that will move the needle as a pricing or volume standpoint over the next say 12 months.","Phil De Sousa","Ryan, its Phil. We just have a little bit of a technical difficulty here. You just flipped over to a backup line, can you just repeat the question for us, just one more time from the beginning.","Ryan Connors","Sure, thing. So yes, just asking about the new product pipeline, that's something that you focused on quite a bit innovation at the Analyst Day and wondering, whether you can provide any update on kind of the potential for new product introductions to drive pricing over the next 12 months or so.","Patrick Decker","Sure. Ryan, this is Patrick. So we feel very good. First of all, can you hear me?","Ryan Connors","I can.","Patrick Decker","Okay, great. So I feel very encouraged and very good about what's happening in our innovation funnel and pipeline. The areas that we highlighted at Investor Day focused on elements such as energy efficiency. Obviously as the Internet of Things make its way to the water segment. Our whole monitoring and control platform that we're building here, those were things that we are already bringing the market and we have a number of introductions that are scheduled here through the end of this year and end of 2016 and onwards.","We do feel and see that does give us a pricing opportunity, as we increase the value, we're giving to our customers and as we've seen and parts of our business where we really activated that pipeline. The growth rate, as you would expect in that part of the business, where we're actually introducing new products has grown function over the rest of our base business and has come at more favorable margin. But we'll have more in our coming earnings call. We'll be announcing some of the new products that we've actually launched.","Ryan Connors","Great, well thanks for your time.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brent Thielman of D.A. Davidson.","Brent Thielman","Appreciate the comments on the pipeline and backlog of public utility work. I'm curious, regionally has the mix of that pipeline shifted more toward emerging markets compared to recent years or is it kind of relatively unchanged between developed and emerging?","Patrick Decker","I would say, right now there is not been a big shift between the two obviously. There are some large projects that you've heard us announce that we booked here, I'd say over the course of the last year. so whether that be in parts of Asia, whether that be in Latin America or the Middle East and we certainly had a number of those high profile big project wins. But in terms of what we see in terms of bidding pipelines as well as other bookings.","We are seeing again emerging strength in the US that we discussed again thus far this year. Secondly, we would expect more so in 2016 and 2017 not sure if you're familiar with the UK AMP Cycle, which is a five-year investment cycle, really targeting the water sector by the UK government.","We are now in that first year, there's typically a bell curve that's associated with that five-year timeframe and so it's typically year two and year three, which is next year and the following that you will also hear us talking about ramp up in project and order activity there in the UK, which is not our largest market, but it certainly moved the needle in terms of our overall order activity.","Brent Thielman","Okay, great and then, I think I'm going to step back as you're kind of building momentum in emerging markets, where you know these market shares are kind of still up for grab. How do you assume the competitive environment evolving here lately because you look around many of your global peers are kind of suffering into pressures in oil and gas or other industrial markets. And I'm wondering if that's kind of accelerating some of their interest in pursuing business on the utility side, where clearly things look better.","Patrick Decker","Certainly there is heightened level of interest in these emerging markets especially on the public utility side. I would say that, where we have and I certainly never take that for granted but where I think we really do have a distinct advantage is, if you take an example like China. We've already got a very well established footprint there, we got great customer relationship, we've been there for a number of years. To our customers there, we really feel like a local company.","Obviously, although we're run as a professional global organization. The Xylem name is well-known there. We're well penetrated and I really think that we benefit from the integration of our portfolio. And so, often times it maybe that our Flygt brand is example of the calling card. Based upon the great relationship we have there. But that now is pulling through in many cases, our treatment and our Analytics opportunities there in the country as well.","The same is happening in India, as well as in the Middle East and certainly in South America as well.","Shashank Patel","And I think to just to add to that, is clearly the competition for, all companies. They're focusing towards more of the emerging markets because that's where the growth is and that's how we're addressing that, is with the local presence. So the investment in Middle East, South Africa and Dubai that's one way to address it. But then a greater way is for localizing the product content and getting the lower cost into our material [ph] so we can be more competitive in those markets as well.","Brent Thielman","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Robert Barry of Susquehanna.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi [indiscernible] I'm on the call for Rob. So first question on, if you can comment on the outlook going forward for that Canada business given the impact of lower oil price on the broader Canadian economy. So how would you say the business going forward?","Patrick Decker","Yes, I would say fairly simply. We've seen some level of stabilization, in terms of the exposure that we've got there in Canada. Obviously we've benefited this last quarter from some growth there and some project activity. But again I'd say for us is, it's pretty stable at this point.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay that's helpful and then, if you can maybe breakout the 5% growth in public utility in 3Q. To what extent that was driven by your share gain versus the end market improvement?","Shashank Patel","Yes, I will say out of that 5%, I mean it's tough to say that, because share gain or not but I think we're roughly speaking probably 30% to 40% on that will probably be share gain and the balance is just the overall market is improving.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Nick Prendergast of BB&T.","Nick Prendergast","I just had a question on your corporate and other expense. When I look at your EBIT calculation, you give the two segments and then you give a consolidated number and then obviously the delta is that corporate expenses. Anyway, those significantly lower than we're expecting in the quarter. Is there anything going on there specifically?","Shashank Patel","Well so and you're right, corporate expense was lighter [ph] in the quarter and what we did, is we aggressively managed discretionary cost in order to mitigate some near-term margin headwinds because we saw that in the third quarter especially with the volatility, with China's devaluation and the turmoil out there, a lot of in emerging markets, but there was collateral damage. So we aggressively managed the project type cost that we have in corporate. So and that's why we've got a lower cost in Q3. But the more typical run rate that we see is in the $11 million to $13 million range for each quarter.","Nick Prendergast","Okay that was very helpful and then finally on your share repurchases. In your guidance you said that reflects the repurchase activity that you had in Q3, does that imply that you're not looking to repurchase anymore in Q4?","Patrick Decker","No, I mean not, we're not implying that. I think the - we'll continue to be opportunistic in terms of share repurchase. We clearly have the capacity with the authorization that we already have there as well as our balance sheet. We've got the capacity here to do both share repurchase as well as accelerated M&A activity. So I wouldn't read anything into the comments as it relates to Q4.","Nick Prendergast","Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Rose of Wedbush Securities","David Rose","I have a couple follow-up questions and just to dig a little bit deeper into the order rates. I mean this is sequentially continue to move down or versus upward and I know you talk about the funnel of RFP's being up 17%, but help us in kind of reconcile the direction. I can understand maybe one quarter it's a little bit lumpy, but again this is a third quarter, where you're a little bit soft and then just think about the timing.","If you're going to articulate the timing for us, how we should think about some of those projects going into at the end of 2017 or end of 2016 rather. What do you need to see in terms of RFPs coming through or orders coming through, in order to see growth in 2016?","Patrick Decker","Yes, I would say that I wouldn't read too much into the last couple of quarters or so of the order moving. I really would focus more on what's happening to our backlog. They're shippable in 2016 and beyond. We've had in any given quarter there are a number of projects in any given year and we try to kind of call that out for you guys in terms of what's in there and I realize it maybe choppy overtime.","But as I just kind of look ahead to 2016 and beyond, certainly based on what we're seeing here in terms of our public utility strength again the modest strength that we in industrial and certainly the strength in commercial building. I think you should see kind of continued pattern in terms of organic revenue growth here through the first quarter and as I mentioned earlier, when you get into Q2 when we pass this difficult dewatering compare, then I think you begin to see a further acceleration of our top line.","So not quite so dependent upon the long-term bookings and projects. Really being driven as much by the short cycle nature of our business and what we're seeing in the trend line there.","Shashank Patel","And just another note, when we look at the third quarter last year, this is the tough compared note that we had in the prepared remarks. Last year, Q3 were up 10%, so it was a very tough compare. It was our strongest quarter from an order booking standpoint in 2014.","David Rose","I appreciate the color and then it's helpful. And maybe, we can kind of do the same thing, as we think about the margins and I know Ryan touched upon sort of the mix shift to longer term, but as we think kind of think about, even the mix shift go into 2016, you have a number of puts and takes and as we look at, maybe you talk about total care in terms of your service component adding to margins and maybe even the mix shift in terms of treatment and Analytics, helping the margin story.","Can you provide a maybe a little bit more color about what can help margins in 2016?","Patrick Decker","Sure. I'll hold back from giving any kind of perceived guidance for 2016. We'll certainly cover that in our February call. But in terms of the trend lines that are there. When you think about the impact this year of the unfavorable mix of dewatering, which is a small - the oil and gas piece of our revenue is small, but it was disproportionately profitable.","So when you think about kind of getting through Q4 and Q1, you then should expect to see a return to kind of our normal incremental margins that we'd have in the past that kind of 35% range. In terms of the things that help that obviously we'd lapping the dewatering compare. Secondly, you would get the normalized incremental margins on volume fall through.","Obviously. We're going to continue to be driving lean and procurement and simplification opportunities, as we talked about in Investor Day. There obviously will be some reinvestment for growth as well. But we'll outline at that for you in the February call.","David Rose","Okay and that's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Joe Giordano of Cowen.","Joe Giordano","I just wanted to ask about, the systems integration on the margin side. I know that's a longer term project, but it's a real opportunity for you guys, regardless of kind of the markets you're in, so what are you kind of seeing there in terms of, I guess it could be in the front end and the back end? I know the front end you're looking at the sales side in terms of CRM as well.","Patrick Decker","Sure, yes. We're pleased with the progress that the teams' have made there. Obviously it\u2019s' a lot of work, it's more than just putting systems energy well in there, Joe. It's a cultural change and its training and education and getting people accustomed with the tools, with the adoption rate on the Salesforce.com or CRM is very impressive here in North America, which is where we've largely focused our efforts.","We're now obviously doing in other countries as well. We're doing a lot of work right now on the project quote configurator [ph] software that we got to make that easier for our customers and our sales teams to work with and so we're in the middle of that implementation as well. But I certainly echo your comments that's going to be in my view, a significant competitive advantage for us.","We're early stage in that. It is a multi-year implementation that we're focused on. The other piece that you alluded to was the back end and that was also a big piece of our simplification game plan that we laid out at Investor Day and we already have some level of shared services implementation in North America. We're prioritizing Europe next and we are very advanced in the planning phase and moving into execution on that.","Joe Giordano","Great. Thanks for the color there. I had to hate to ask you questions on oil and gas for you guys because I know how small it is, piece of the overall pie. If we're - I'm hearing people talk about spending in North America being down potentially another incremental 20% next year. I know your business took a major hit this year like kind of an immediate hit as spending drops. So now if that was to happen next year again on the E&P side. How do you think your business would fair relative?","Patrick Decker","Yes and I think, that if you look at the direct exposure that we have in oil and gas which by the end of this year would be somewhere between 3% to 4 of our total revenue and it is really isolated largely to a certain number of branches in dewatering and to some extent our Applied Water business. You know I wouldn't suggest we're completely into it, but I think it's a manageable kind of impact for us.","And so we keep a close eye to it, but a number of these locations. We're about as close to mothball as you can get. And we've redeployed the pumps to other markets and so I think the team's done a great job in sheltering us from another leg down in that area. But we certainly keep a close eye on it.","Joe Giordano","You know that's kind of what I was thinking and just last from me. I just want to touch on the buyback. It's the most active quarter in the company's history. Do you know what you have left on the authorization by wondering from a piece perspective? Should we start thinking this is more representative of a more average rate?","Patrick Decker","I wouldn't read anything into it. I mean again we're going to be opportunistic. Like I said before, we have the capacity to do both that as well as acquisitions and if we think it's smart to do so, we'll continue to do so.","Joe Giordano","Great, appreciate the time. Thanks.","Operator","At this time, there are no further questions. I would now like to turn the call back over to Patrick Decker for any additional or closing remarks.","Patrick Decker","Great. Again, I want to thank you all for your continued interest in Xylem and thank you for joining the call today and we look forward to updating you on the fourth quarter as well as our 2016 guidance in early February. So between now and then, safe travels and happy holidays and we'll see you [indiscernible] soon.","Operator","Thank you.

Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Thanks Matt, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today to discuss our first quarter results. We had a strong start to 2018, and with the solid game plan in hand, our teams were focused in their execution and delivered strong results growing across all end markets and in nearly every geography. The momentum we began to build in the second half of last year strengthened in the first quarter and is continuing as we uncover new opportunities in healthy end markets.","As we look at our first quarter results, nearly every metric met or exceeded expectations. So, let me quickly review a few of the details. In the first quarter, we delivered solid broad-based orders and revenue growth across all of our major markets. Orders increased 10% in the first quarter, the second consecutive quarter of double-digit orders growth. This was driven by a strong performance in our Water Infrastructure businesses where treatment orders were up 27%. Many of those projects have longer lead times. So, these orders will not ship until 2019.","In addition, we had very strong orders grew up in the emerging markets, up more than 20% year-over-year. This reflects solid growth overall as well as a few large project orders that pushed that growth significantly higher. We also secured healthy order growth in our North American Sensus water business. For the quarter, revenue grew 7% organically. From a regional perspective, the U.S. market generated strong growth with a 9% increase year-over-year. This reflects continued strength in utilities where we are capturing share gains as well as improved performance in industrials and the timing of certain projects in the quarter.","Emerging markets continued to deliver solid revenue growth, up 6% overall. Our investments in product localization and capacity are beginning to pay off in a significant way. The standouts once again were China and India. Both markets saw strong double-digit revenue growth and they continue to benefit from increased government spending on infrastructure, as well as growing regulatory requirements.","In India, among the infrastructure projects, we have a very healthy bidding pipeline on larger scale treatment projects as well as growing analytics opportunities. Growth across our key end markets was also broad-based and solid. The utilities end market show continued strength across all regions. The double-digit growth we delivered in the Sensus electric and gas business was driven by some large project deployments in North America.","We were also encouraged by the continued improvement in the industrials end market which grew 6% for the quarter. This reflects ongoing strengthening in both the heavy industrials like oil and gas and mining as well as the light general industrial applications.","Finally, I want to mention the ongoing progress we're making in identifying and realizing revenue synergies across our Sensus, Visenti and legacy Xylem businesses. We are encouraged by the progress of the pilots we have underway as well as the large deals that our teams are working. As I explained at our Investor Day last year, these major deals take longer to close, but given the current progress, we expect those efforts to manifest with orders later this year and revenue in 2019 and beyond.","In addition, our ongoing day to day collaboration across the businesses is increasingly creating new opportunities. While many of those wins are relatively small and therefore not highlighted, we also have visibility to deals and opportunities of more meaningful scale. And I'm confident that we'll be able to announce some of these in the months ahead. This progress increases our enthusiasm for the commercial value created by the combination of these businesses.","During the quarter, our teams also focused on managing cost and driving productivity as we like many others see some signs of growing inflation on the horizon. In addition, we're managing some near-term mix headwinds as treatment project deliveries increase and certain project businesses in emerging market grows. As reminder, that work which is largely for greenfield infrastructure installations generally has modestly lower margins relative to the rest of our portfolio initially, but carries higher margins with the aftermarket and replacement cycle.","One tactic for mitigating these issues is to continue to deliver continuous improvement savings. In the first quarter, we generated $36 million in cost savings, a 9% increase year-over-year which has us on pace to meet our full year targets. In addition, we've already announced some pricing actions to help offset these pressures. We saw very modest impact from those actions in the first quarter due to timing, but expect to see more impact materialize over the coming quarters. And given the health of our end markets and the mission critical nature of many of the businesses we serve, we are confident in the industry's ability and the willingness to absorb price in this environment.","We ended the quarter with adjusted EBITDA of 17.5%, an increase of 130 basis points year-over-year. This reflects volume leverage and the savings I just spoke about. Our operating margin for the quarter was 11.1%, up 60 basis points. Excluding the 40 basis point dilution from purchase accounting amortization, operating margins expanded 100 basis points. We delivered adjusted earnings per share of $0.51 for the quarter, an increase of 31% year-over-year.","We continue to improve our working capital management which Mark will address shortly and are on track for another year of strong cash generation to achieve our full year target of at least 115% conversion.","So, all in, a very strong quarter. And I want to acknowledge the terrific efforts by all of our teams around the world who remain focused on deepening our customer relationships and developing the solutions that will address their challenges. We have a lot of activity in the company right now as we continue to integrate new businesses and expand our portfolio. I've been very pleased with the increased collaboration that's occurring and just plain excitement about working together to create new opportunities and bring a broader set of solutions to our customers. This internally driven momentum is fueling our success in the marketplace and over time will enable us to create even more value for our shareholders.","Before I hand it over to Mark, I want to make a few comments on our most recent acquisitions and the formation of our advanced infrastructure analytics platform which we refer to as our AIA platform. So, let me start by revisiting why we brought these businesses together. I spend a good deal of time out visiting with customers, listening to what their challenges are and better understanding the obstacles they face in trying to address them.","While there are many, three large categories rise to the top: non-revenue water, storm water management and the management of aging or overstressed infrastructure. Now, these are not new problems but the need to address them is becoming acute driven in part by regulatory edicts.","That demand has coincided with a quantum leap in the generation of data, and more importantly, the capability to analyze and draw insights from that data. Add to that the extraordinary advances in technology which we're already leveraging in our legacy businesses, and this enables the development of applications that simply weren't possible a decade ago.","Now, we all hear these huge numbers thrown around about the cost to meet the Water Infrastructure repair and replacement needs. These capital outlays put enormous pressure on cities and communities, but the new technology enabled solutions that we're now bringing to the market can fundamentally change how a utility operator approaches those challenges, utilizing new data insights and tools to inform their decision making in ways that can significantly reduce those costs and simply help make water more affordable.","So, this is the backdrop against which we formed our new AIA platform. We've now brought together a collection of businesses with the capabilities to address these issues. The platform includes Pure Technologies, EmNet, Visenti, Hypack and we added one more in February, Valor Water Analytics. Valor brings another unique software enabled solution to help utilities optimize their revenue potential. Each of these businesses is unique and has its own value proposition. Clearly, the challenges our customers face manifest differently and require a solution that can be adapted to their distinct circumstances.","With a portfolio of capabilities and technologies, we can best address these issues, and we're still building out this platform. We expect to add other capabilities to the platform through acquisitions that further expand our ability to help customers solve their challenges. The platform is being led by Al Cho who many of you have either met or had the opportunity to hear at an industry event somewhere around the world. He brings a unique understanding of how technology can be applied in the water sector in disruptive ways that add value to our customers' operations.","And as I mentioned at our last call, Jack Elliott, the Former CEO of Pure, has agreed to stay on as an advisor to help us scale the new platform effectively. It's early days in this process, but we're very encouraged by the response we've received from customers. Our commercial teams who already have deep relationships with utility customers are opening up new opportunities for this portfolio.","And working together across Xylem, our teams are having a different kind of conversation with the customer. It's no longer just about a project or a new product. Now, it's about how our portfolio, both our legacy businesses and the new platform, can help that customer deal with some of their toughest pain points differently, which ultimately can change the economics of their operations, increase the affordability of water and contribute to the sustainability of our communities.","We are, in effect, creating a new market with our unique set of capabilities and while this will take time to develop, the opportunity is enormous. And our early experience gives us tremendous confidence in its long-term growth prospects. In fact, we expect this relatively small platform to outpace the growth of our other businesses by at least 2x. So, we look forward to sharing our progress in this exciting growth area over the months and years to come.","So now, please turn to slide five and I'll hand it over to Mark to review the quarter results in more detail.","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Thanks, Patrick. I'm very pleased with our strong start to the year. Overall, revenues were up 14% in the quarter, this represents 7% organic growth, 4 points of growth from foreign exchange tailwind and 3 points of growth from acquisitions. From an organic perspective, the strength in revenue was broad-based, across all of our end markets in most geographies. Utilities end market led the way with 8% growth. This was above our expectations and was driven both by the timing of project deliveries and very strong performance in North America and emerging markets.","Most of the growth in emerging markets was from the outstanding performance from our China and India teams, which grew revenue by more than 40% and 30%, respectively, due in part to heightened regulatory focus and growing opportunities across all of our businesses that serve utilities. Industrial revenue was also up nicely this quarter with 6% growth which was at the higher end of our expectations.","Market conditions remain healthy in our Applied Water business as well as dewatering. Here, the strength was primarily in the U.S., Canada and Western Europe. Rounding out the end markets, we continued to see solid performance in our commercial and residential end markets which were up 6% and 4%, respectively.","Moving to operational performance, we increased our adjusted EBITDA by 130 basis points to 17.5% in the quarter. This improvement was primarily driven by increased productivity savings and volume leverage from strong organic growth which was partially offset by cost inflation, unfavorable mix and foreign exchange impacts. Adjusted operating margin increased 60 basis points to 11.1% which includes 40 basis points of noncash amortization related to purchase accounting for the acquisitions in our new AIA platform.","Our teams continue to perform well, executing on our productivity programs where we delivered $36 million in cost savings in the quarter, a 9% increase from the prior year. This 300 basis point improvement offset inflation and enabled us to continue to fund strategic investments for growth.","Partially offsetting these investments was weaker mix from lower margin treatment projects and foreign exchange impacts. Strong revenue performance drove earnings per share of $0.51, an increase of 31% year-over-year and at the high end of our expectations.","Please turn to slide six and I'll provide additional details on our segment performance. I'll start with our Water Infrastructure segment which recorded orders of $554 million in the quarter, up 13% organically year-over-year. This reflects growth in all applications within the segment. Treatment orders led the way, up 27%. This performance builds on the improving trajectory we have in our pipeline and the overall health of the utility market.","As Patrick mentioned, the majority of the treatment orders are for projects which require longer lead times and will not ship until 2019. That said, we exited the quarter with total backlog for this segment of $673 million, up 18% organically year-over-year. Water Infrastructure revenue of $480 million represents a 9% year-over-year increase on an organic basis. Foreign exchange was a $25 million tailwind.","In the U.S., the segment grew 12% reflecting double-digit growth in both the utility and industrial end markets. On the utility side, we're continuing to see strong market performance across all of our businesses. Treatment benefited from the timing of several project deliveries and transport continued to generate strong growth in aftermarket sales and achieve modest share gains. Dewatering also generated mid-single digit growth in this vertical.","The strong growth in our U.S. industrial end market was primarily driven by higher rentals for construction activity as well as double digit growth in the oil and gas and mining markets of our dewatering business. Outside the U.S., performance in this segment was also very good. Emerging markets were up 10% and this included double digit growth in our three focus regions: China, India and the Middle East.","Government mandates and spending in China and India have driven significant activity in both transport and treatment. Additionally, the focus of our commercial teams in driving locally engineered, sourced, and manufactured products from across the Xylem portfolio has continued to gain traction and is delivering impressive results. The Middle East growth came from project deliveries in both transport and treatment.","We saw modestly improving market conditions in Western Europe where our business grew 5% overall, primarily driven by solid growth in Germany, the Netherlands and Italy from treatment project execution and solid aftermarket sales within transport. Operating margin for this segment increased 60 basis points to 11.3% driven by cost savings from productivity programs and higher volumes. This more than offset inflation, foreign exchange, and unfavorable mix from a higher portion of treatment project revenue this year versus last year.","Foreign exchange was a net 80 basis point headwind to margins. This reflects the fact that our transport business primarily manufactures in Europe. So the substantial year-over-year increase in European currencies against the dollar has resulted in higher cost of products exported from Europe for sale into the U.S. We expect this year-over-year impact will moderate in the second half of the year based on our current FX assumptions.","Please turn to slide seven. Our Applied Water segment booked orders of $384 million in the quarter which was up 6% organically. Our book-to-bill ratio was 1.05 in the quarter, which is in line with our historical performance. We exited the quarter with backlog of $217 million which is up 20% organically compared to last year. While this is still predominantly a short cycle business, the growth of our backlog gives us confidence in our ability to deliver mid-single digit organic growth for the second quarter. Revenue for Applied Water was $366 million, up 7% organically versus the prior year quarter. Foreign exchange was a $14 million tailwind.","In Western Europe, revenue increased 10% with growth across all applications. Industrial performance was particularly strong with customers in Germany, France and UK where we continue to benefit from our investments in building up both our sales capabilities and channel partners. Western Europe also drove most of the growth in residential for this segment through promotional activity resulting in some modest share gains.","In the U.S., segment revenue was up 5%. This increase was primarily driven by the segment's industrial vertical which grew 10% as heavy industrial project demand continued to recover. We also benefited from the delivery of several fire pump and turbine projects. Commercial was up mid-single digits from strong distributor restocking of heating and circulator pumps. And residential was down mid-single digits as we lapped the mid-teens growth in the prior year.","Emerging markets revenue grew 6%, reflecting strong growth in Asia, primarily driven by the improvement in the commercial building market in China. Segment operating margin in the quarter increased 100 basis points to 14.5% year-over-year. Continued progress on our productivity programs drove a 340 basis point margin improvement which more than offset 230 basis points of cost inflation and unfavorable mix.","Now let's turn to slide eight to discuss the performance of Measurement & Control Solutions. Our Measurement & Control Solutions segment booked orders of $382 million in the quarter, which was up 12% organically. Revenue for Measurement & Control Solutions was $371 million, up 5% on an organic basis year-over-year. Foreign exchange was a $15 million tailwind and acquisitions added $20 million.","In the U.S., revenue increased 10% with growth primarily attributable to the deployment of large electric and gas projects, specifically the Alliant deal we announced last year and the Nicor Gas deal that we announced earlier this year. Services were up double digits as well due to networking contract upgrades made with existing customers in late 2017.","Water was down low-single digits, primarily due to the timing of shipments. It is worth noting that our orders in North America water were up double-digits versus last year and we expect to deliver mid-single digit growth for the full year.","Our Western Europe and emerging markets businesses were down mid-single digits due to timing of project deployments in the prior year. As a reminder, the rollout of large project deployments in the Sensus business can create some lumpiness in quarterly growth rates. We look at the business over the course of the full year and we continue to expect growth in the high-single digit range.","Organic revenue in our new AIA platform grew 8% year-over-year on a pro forma basis and in line with our expectations. We're very encouraged with the significant momentum we're seeing in orders and pipeline growth. Adjusted EBITDA margins increased 270 basis points to 21.8%. This margin expansion was driven by productivity improvements, volume and price which were partially offset by inflation and the funding of strategic investments.","Adjusted segment operating margin in the quarter increased 90 basis points to 11.6% year-over-year. Our performance here was also impacted by the non-cash impact of incremental purchase accounting amortization from the new AIA platform. Excluding these non-cash items, operating margins expanded by 220 basis points.","Now, let's turn to slide nine to discuss cash flows and the company's financial position. We closed the quarter with a cash balance of approximately $300 million. As you may recall, the first quarter is our seasonally weakest period for cash flow. We continue to expect to deliver our full year target of more than 115% free cash flow conversion. The year-over-year decline in first quarter cash flow reflects the timing of capital spend as operating cash flows increased 20% over the prior year quarter.","We had an unusually high level of investment in the quarter including a strategic investment in purchasing a previously leased manufacturing facility as well as accelerated investment in rental fleet for our dewatering business to meet growing market demand. We also returned $38 million to our shareholders through dividends and repurchased $25 million of shares to offset dilution.","In February, we announced a 17% increase to our dividend pay-out, our sixth consecutive annual increase. We continue to make solid progress on working capital, reducing it by 220 basis points as we continue to improve our processes and discipline. While there's still much to do, I'm very pleased with the focus and rigor the team is bringing to this key metric. We remain committed to maintaining our investment grade credit rating and plan to repay the short-term debt we used to fund the Pure acquisition by the end of this year.","Please turn to slide 10 and Patrick will cover the update to our 2018 outlook.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Thanks, Mark. As we discussed this morning, we had a strong first quarter and we have solid momentum moving forward. We're well-positioned to deliver on our full year commitments while continuing to invest in our longer term growth initiatives. At the top line, we continue to expect to deliver full year revenue of approximately $5.1 billion to $5.2 billion. This continues to represent an organic growth rate of 4% to 6%. And as we previously stated, we expect our new AIA platform to add about 2% to our total revenue. Our continuous improvement efforts continue and our forecast is to generate about $160 million in cost savings for the full year. This result will keep us well on pace to meet our long-term target. These savings are expected to help fuel our operating margin expansion.","Our adjusted operating margin is forecast to expand 60 basis points to 100 basis points to between 13.9% and 14.3%. This expansion excludes about 30 basis points of margin dilution from purchase accounting for acquisitions. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to improve by 70 basis points to 100 basis points which would bring that to a range of 19.5% to 19.8%. At the bottom line, we continue to expect to generate adjusted full year earnings per share in the range of $2.82 to $2.97.","This excludes integration, restructuring and realignment cost of about $35 million. Adjusted EPS growth is projected to be in the range of 18% to 24% for the year. And as Mark discussed, we expect to continue to generate solid cash from operations which will enable us to deliver free cash flow conversion of at least 115% in 2018. Anticipated capital expenditures are $190 million to $200 million.","Now please turn to slide 11 and I'll walk you through our end market assumptions. Overall, our end market view for the full year has not changed materially from the guidance we provided on our last earnings call. While we did have a strong first quarter in certain end markets, we do expect that to moderate somewhat as we get into the second half of the year when we'll lap some tougher year-over-year comparisons.","So let me quickly walk through our projections. Our utility end market is one in which we've seen continued strength, particularly in the U.S. and key emerging markets. For full year 2018, we continue to expect revenue to grow in the mid-single digit range overall and the smart meter market is projected to generate slightly higher growth, likely in the high-single digit range.","We had a good first quarter in the industrial end market. Looking out for the full year, we expect a somewhat mixed environment, particularly in the emerging markets. There we expect markets such as China and India to continue to benefit from governmental spending, but that will likely be somewhat offset by softness in parts of Latin America. We continue to project industrials to be up low-to-mid single digits.","We expect 2018 organic growth in the commercial end market to be in the low- to mid-single digit range. We see low but stable growth in the U.S. and some moderation from recent strength in Europe. Emerging markets should continue to enjoy solid growth due in part to increased government spending.","And finally, in residential, we anticipate full year 2018 revenue growth in the mid-single digit range. We continue to see competitive dynamics in the U.S. market where demand tends to be replacement-driven and we have some tough prior year compares. But we also anticipate solid demand to continue in China and other Asia-Pacific countries, as well as Western Europe.","Now please turn to slide 12 and Mark will walk you through more details on the outlook.","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Consistent with what we disclosed last quarter, we're providing the seasonal profile of our business as well as highlights of our 2018 planning assumptions. For the second quarter, we expect sustained growth in the utility market in the mid- to high-single digit range. We expect industrial markets to moderate sequentially and return to low-single digit growth. We expect the commercial and residential markets to both continue to grow in the low- to mid-single digits.","All in, we anticipate this will result in organic revenue growth in the range of 5% to 6%. We expect the contribution from the AIA platform to be about $30 million. We expect second quarter operating margins to be up 50 basis points to 80 basis points, this includes a 30 basis point negative impact due to purchase accounting for our recent AIA acquisitions.","Our outlook also reflects an uptick in direct material costs from increasing global demand for certain materials in electronic components. Our procurement and operational teams have done a great job securing adequate supply and we expect they will continue to do so, but it is impacting cost. To address the impact of rising material costs, our commercial teams are in the market with price actions. We expect to see some realization in the second quarter and higher price realization in the back half of the year.","Finally, please note the summary of our FX assumptions on this slide, which includes our euro guidance assumption, which remains at $1.21. In the second quarter, we expect year-over-year operating margins to be impacted by FX transaction headwind, similar to the first quarter and predominantly in our Water Infrastructure segment. We expect the year-over-year impact in the second half of the year will be minimal based on current FX rates.","With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Patrick for some closing comments.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Thanks, Mark. Again, we had a strong first quarter and momentum is continuing, both in the end markets we serve and within our teams across the company. But it's only the first of four quarters and we take nothing for granted. We will remain vigilant in our execution and remain focused on best serving our customers. At the same time, we will continue to invest in our strategic initiatives, to fuel our longer-term growth to drive greater value for our shareholders.","With that, operator, we'd be happy to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Nathan Jones with Stifel.","Nathan Hardie Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Good morning, everyone.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Good morning.","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Good morning.","Matthew Latino - Xylem, Inc.","Hi, Nate.","Nathan Hardie Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","So unsurprisingly, I'm going to start on margins here. And I wanted to look at your full year guidance for margins because you actually ex-purchase accounting increased the margin expansion guidance by 10 basis points. You've got headwinds from mix. You've got headwinds from inflation. You've got headwinds from the stronger dollar. Yet you've actually taken the guidance for core margins here up by 10 basis points for the year. Can you talk about how you get to a better number than you did before with certainly some increasing headwinds to margins here?","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah. I'll go first here, Nathan. I think the \u2013 our read through on margins both in the quarter which came in a little bit light because of the mix of treatment, that subsides in the second half of the year, as does the impact of the FX transaction effect coming out of Europe. That subsides in the second half of the year.","And I think the fact that we're getting ahead of the emerging inflationary pressure that we're seeing on some of the components and others, with price early in the year. We went out earlier this year with price increases in addition to what we'd already announced, so we could get ahead of this. And so when you rack all that up together, that's what gives us the confidence around the margin expansion for the full year. So, not concerned at all about margins.","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah. And Nate on the \u2013 yeah, the guidance is essentially the same. The purchase accounting amortization ticked up 10 basis points. That might be what you're thinking about if you exclude that impact, but it's essentially the same.","Nathan Hardie Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah. It's the same including that extra 10 basis points, but without the...","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah.","Nathan Hardie Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","...amortization, it actually went up 10 basis points. So, there must be the anticipation of some pretty meaningful price realization in the back half of the year here, correct?","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah. That's right. We saw a little bit in Q1. We'll expect to see a bit more in Q2, and then we see the full effect of that in Q3 and Q4.","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","And we continue to ramp up productivity and cost savings as well. So, we've got good confidence in our ability to deliver those full-year margin targets, Nathan.","Nathan Hardie Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then, on the first quarter, you're about 30 basis points below what you had forecast for the first quarter. Can you maybe break down the impact of what mix was? I mean, you obviously had a strong treatment shipment quarter, can you break that down maybe between...","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah.","Nathan Hardie Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","The mix impact, the inflation impact.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah. Really, I mean the biggest piece of this, Mark can go through the details, I mean if there was one takeaway from the quarter, if you think about the higher revenue that we delivered above and beyond what we had guided to, that really was predominantly coming from some large treatment in emerging market project deliveries that accelerated into the quarter from Q2. Those came with lower margin because they're greenfield, they have great aftermarket profiles, but in the initial install they're lower margin and that impacted us alone by about 70 bps in Q1. And so, that gives you a feel for the magnitude of what we're talking about. That begins to subside. We have a little bit more of that in Q2, but we've got that reflected in our guide and then it really subsides in second half the year.","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah. Nathan, I guess, yeah, it comes under the heading of no good deed goes unpunished. We've got exactly what we were looking for in terms of growing our position in those end markets and, as Patrick said, the project margins are a little bit lower. We're going to like the aftermarket margins a lot. But the impact that was probably 30 basis points to 40 basis points more because of that mix. In terms of the margin impact, inflation was \u2013 ran a little a bit harder than we thought. But obviously we got some nice benefits from volume leverage which offset a lot of that and also we performed better than \u2013 a little better than we were expecting on our productivity as well.","Nathan Hardie Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","I guess the project work has to stay the aftermarket for the future and that will drag on in the quarter. So, I think that's helpful color. Thanks a lot.","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Sure, thanks.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you. Good morning everyone.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Good morning, Deane.","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Good morning, Deane.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, I'd just like to stay on the topic, the emerging markets and these greenfield projects. Just to follow on, what's your line of sight for additional infrastructure needs across the emerging markets? I mean, you don't see it in developed markets. We're not building new plants but what inning are we for emerging markets in infrastructure build-out on the municipal side over the next couple of years?","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah. So, Deane, I think, it's hard to predict exactly what inning we're in but, I would say, it's the early innings based on what I've seen when I've been traveling there and when we take a look at our bidding pipeline, particularly, I would say, in India. Certainly, I think the only thing that could ever change that trajectory would be if there was a change in political administration and we're not getting any reason to believe that's going to happen. So, that's going to have a long tail to it because it really is being driven by the Smart Cities initiatives, as well as the Ganges River clean-up, as well as the connecting their population to treatment \u2013 treated water across the country. So, we've got a very significant pipeline there.","The same in China. We continue to see, especially in the second- and third-tier cities, tremendous investments in water treatment there. We would be expecting those to be 30%, 40% on a regular basis. I mean, we're guiding there through our long-range plan of certainly low-double digit for those businesses. The Middle East, I think, is still very early in its recovery, coming out of the energy downturn. And so, we've seen that begin to recover quite nicely. That one in my mind is probably a little bit less predictable than China and India would be.","And I just got back from South America. I spent a week there two weeks ago and was very encouraged by what I see especially in Argentina, Chile, Colombia, may be less so Brazil. So, I think we're in the early innings here, Deane, in terms of continued run for emerging markets.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got it. And just one last point on these projects. What's the content, the Xylem content? How broadly are they taking your different products and services in these projects?","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah. It has broadened. I mean, it depends obviously on what the application is. But generally speaking, you're talking about projects that we're able to cross-sell. The team has done a great job there of getting in, for example, maybe on an ozone job and then being able to pull through our flight pumps pulling through analytics on the water quality side. Just to give you kind of one example. But we also \u2013 that's one of the areas where we're seeing some of the best early activity on pilots for some of some of our new Sensus revenue synergies as well.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. And then I'd like to ask a few questions regarding the advanced infrastructure analytics, the new subsector platform. What are the growth expectations here? This really feels like a tech incubation...","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Yes.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","...holding co for you. A lot of these are still in pilot programs in terms of different projects you might even be pre-revenue. But just help us calibrate what the growth expectations over the next couple of years should be from this platform?","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah. I think, it's \u2013 what I would kind of reply would be, the comments I had in my script initially and that was we're really making a new market here, Deane, as you can appreciate. You probably of anybody understands that the most in terms of, we're kind of really addressing new unmet needs and sorting through what is the best way to optimize the revenue generation out of this given the significant disruption possibly. It's going to be having and is already having to large CapEx spend.","But certainly, the businesses as we see them today, we would expect these businesses to be growing double-digit consistently and that's just with the businesses that we have today. I mean, it's a small part of our portfolio, you're right it's an incubator. We're doing probably about $120 million right now of revenue, but we're going to see that grow exponentially and we're going to be adding to it in terms of new acquisitions.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And I'm sorry, I just got one other one. We heard some rumblings that regarding the combined sewer overflow, that the EPA is like backing off on some of the enforcements and maybe this will result in some delays in orders. Are you seeing any of that showing up in like EmNet's business?","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah. It's interesting you asked that question Deane. I haven't been out with a number of these customers whether it be utilities or whether it be the works departments because in many cases, as you know, it's not always the same entity in any given city that manages this issue. But the conversations I had, they were not seeing the EPA alleviating pressure. They may not be getting fined right now in immediate term, but the consent decree still hold. And one of the opportunities that we have here is obviously EmNet can actually serve as one solution to helping significantly reduce what that capital burden would be and working with the EPA to actually allow that technology to be used as an alternative.","Regulatory is also only one driver in this area, as I know you'd fully appreciate. It's also the public nuance that utilities and works departments have to deal with when there is a storm water overflow situation. So, it is one of the biggest headaches that works departments have across the country. So, our customers see this as a long-term issue and I'm very confident that their needs are going to persist beyond one potential administrative change in policy.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Connors with Boenning & Scattergood.","Ryan Michael Connors - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc.","Great. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to talk a little...","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Good morning.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Good morning, Ryan.","Ryan Michael Connors - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc.","Good morning. I want to talk about the project delays on the metering side that you talked about. And certainly you're not alone there, your peers have made similar comments, but at the same time, you're seeing the strength in treatment which, in theory, is also a project-oriented business. So, my question is what is it about metering projects specifically that's different, that's leading to the delays there? And what's different about treatment where we're not seeing delays on those types of projects?","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah. Actually, I would say our issue was less of a project delay as much as it was just timing of projects. I mean, our orders were up 10% and that was coming from project orders coming in. We had a little bit of softness in the quarter, a little bit of that was weather. That certainly had some impact, but then you might say, well doesn't it have an impact on treatment, but it just depends on what utility you're dealing with, what location it is. I wouldn't read too much into that. We still feel very confident about looking at a mid-to-high single digit growth in our water utility business for the full year. I don't know, Mark, if you want to make a comment.","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, it's timing of deployment of existing projects. I don't \u2013 the pipeline is very good. The order rates, we had 12% order growth in our water business in North America for Sensus. So, this is more of a quarterly phenomenon than it is anything that's long term.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah. If you go back to the \u2013 to go back to the fourth quarter of last year, we had double digit growth in that part of the business in terms of orders growth. So, it really is it can be lumpy in terms of the deployment from quarter-to-quarter, but this is not a long-term trend that I'd be concerned about.","Ryan Michael Connors - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc.","Got it. Okay.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Okay.","Ryan Michael Connors - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc.","And then my other question had to do with, Patrick you talk about a willingness on the part of customers in the utility space to accept price increases and yet if you look at their situation, those customers are actually having a harder time getting price themselves. We've really seen tariff inflation recede and it's now kind of they're barely running above CPI. So, can you just talk about \u2013 give us your take on that and why we're confident that we can push price when that the customer base there is maybe not able to pass that through themselves as well as they have historically?","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah. I think, firstly, part of that is just the, again, the critical nature. These are mission critical applications and so obviously we want to be respectful of these, so we're not going to gouge them on price, but it's also more than utility. We're talking about each one of our end markets here. So, you also need to bring in the industrial part of the equation to this as well. When we go back and we look at previous periods of time where we were in an inflationary period, back then you're talking about kind of the 2011, 2012 timeframe. We were realizing quite significant price at that point in time well above what you've heard us talk about here in the last couple of years, and it was because there was an understanding that it is inflationary environment.","Secondly, what we're finding especially in the pockets of business where we've been most successful to get price here most recently, it is where we brought much more innovative solutions to bear. So, when we've embedded more intelligence and whether it be energy efficiency, whether it be cost of use, it's part of a broader value proposition here rather than just an across the board take a list price increase.","Ryan Michael Connors - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc.","Got it. Okay. So, if I could paraphrase that, you think you can kind of take wallet share so to speak?","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","That's correct.","Ryan Michael Connors - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc.","Yeah. Okay.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","And you take a look at the size of our installed base and the replacement nature of that, there's opportunity there that we're seeing on the repair and replacement side of the business to take some price.","Ryan Michael Connors - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc.","Okay. Great. Well, I'll get back in queue. Thanks for your time.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Thanks.","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Walter Liptak with Seaport Global.","Walter Scott Liptak - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Hi. Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Good morning, Walt.","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Good morning.","Walter Scott Liptak - Seaport Global Securities LLC","I wanted to ask about the oil and gas business, and if you could just refresh us now how big percentage of revenue is that? And then the comments about dewatering, what inning are we there? Are you able to get pricing on the dewatering related products?","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah. Sure, Walt. It's about the scale, it's about 2% of our enterprise revenues. Dewatering had a very solid quarter. And just looking at oil and gas, they were up strong double digits. And in fact, I had remarked in earlier comments about accelerating some capital investment to build out our rental fleet to meet market demand. So, it's relatively small in the overall scheme of things, but it is growing nicely and we're investing to make sure we can meet market demand.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah. All in \u2013 to be clear, Walt. All in, our oil and gas and mining exposure both together roughly about 5% with mining in. But that's not the only piece of our dewatering business just to make sure that we don't confuse anyone there. I mean, dewatering is larger than that. It plays into also other industrial markets, muni and certainly what's been driving growth in that business also was during the middle of the downturn that team did a good job of diversifying beyond oil and gas and mining. Now we're getting the benefit of oil and gas and mining coming back. That's putting some pressure on our rental fleet, and there we're making the capital investments to support it.","Walter Scott Liptak - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Okay. Good. And then on the pricing side there, I mean, it's probably a little bit easier getting price in this part of the business.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah. I'd say we had a little bit of a lag recovery. We began to see growth in order rates in oil and gas and mining second half of last year. We did not see the pricing realization early on. But now the market is absorbing that price as, again, obviously I think ours and our competitors' fleets are tightening in terms of utilization.","Walter Scott Liptak - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Okay. All right. Great. And if I can just do one more, you mentioned the flight business and the currency issues. I wondered about anything that you could do to mitigate that. Is there a way of manufacturing in a different location or if there isn't anything, is there demand destruction that happens because of the foreign currency, the higher prices?","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah. There's a couple things that we can do and are doing. One is we do hedge the cash flow impact to that. But as currencies continue to rise, it's not 100% coverage. So that is one thing, and with the rapid rise in euro-based currencies that we saw the impact to that. The other that we can do and are doing is make sure that in the markets where those products are coming into, we again go after price to offset some of that higher cost. And the teams are out there, as we mentioned in our comments, taking price actions to address some of the uptick in cost inflation.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","The good news for us, Walt, is that at least in that part of the business which is really the business that is most exposed to euro-based manufacturing, pretty much all of our competitors are as well. And so it does not create a market share challenge or a competitive dynamic. And so, we tend to take the longer view here in terms of what we want to do strategically. We are and have been shifting some capacity to the U.S. That was just really to support the U.S. market growth anyway; it wasn't really being driven by currency movement.","Walter Scott Liptak - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Okay. Got it. All right. Thank you.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chip Moore with Canaccord.","Chip Moore - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Wondering maybe if you could provide a bit of an update on where we stand in terms of localization in emerging markets, potential for some more investments there, how you think about the benefits.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Sure. Yeah. So, I think we're pretty well progressed on the localization efforts in China, India and the Middle East. I would say we're furthest in China. There today, we do about 90% \u2013 north of 90% of our revenue in the market actually comes from products that are localized. And we're obviously looking to get that as close to 100% as possible. Secondly is India and I would say India is just behind that at roughly about 80% localized and we would expect that to continue to grow. Middle East, we have local factory there. We had a greenfield that we opened up about two years ago. And I'd say there, we're still moving things into that facility and also we're ramping up the actual design locally as opposed to just the manufacturing of it locally.","Then I would say there probably are opportunities as we look forward in a couple areas. One is I do think we're going to have an opportunity to do some further localization on the metering side, leveraging some of our footprint in those locations as we look to grow those businesses. And then secondly would be in Latin America. Based on my visit down there, there clearly are some opportunities that we're going to be exploring in a couple of key markets. Just got to find the right timing and find the right channels to market to support that.","Chip Moore - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","That's great color. Thanks.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jim Giannakouros with Oppenheimer.","Jim Giannakouros - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Good morning, Patrick, Mark, Matt.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Good morning, Jim.","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Hey, Jim.","Matthew Latino - Xylem, Inc.","Morning.","Jim Giannakouros - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Clarification point on that pop in treatment, I mean you cited broad-based sales growth across Europe and North America, but that pop in orders, that 27%, is that a couple large orders driving that or broad-based as well?","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","It's pretty \u2013 I mean, we had a few large projects but it was pretty broad-based. I would say, if it's skewed anywhere, it's skewed heavily towards the emerging markets and that was mainly again in China and India. But there was pretty broad based growth in orders. I mean, we saw good growth in North America as well as in Europe. So, it was not a lumpy one-off. I mean there were some big projects in there but not a meaningful piece of the 27% that we quoted.","Jim Giannakouros - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Got it. Okay. And then seems like you're pacing well, at least on an aggressive plan on it with internal initiatives on the cost side, productivity side. Can you \u2013 maybe this is more of a question for Mark, refresh us on the areas that will accelerate into 2019 and 2020 to kind of get you to that stated margin goal that you have out there, 17% to 18%?","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah, Jim. Sure. Right now, what we have seen and are continuing to see is significant procurement and savings around our continuous improvement Lean Six Sigma programs. What we have launched this year and are ramping up and we'll see some modest benefit at the end of this year, but significant benefits into 2019 and 2020 is our global business services program where we're looking to standardize our platforms and processes and tools across finance, HR, procurement and IT. So, that is all in front of us and those are substantial programs.","Jim Giannakouros - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thank you. And one more if I may. I recall aftermarket sales, I mean just pre Sensus, pre Pure aftermarket was kind of dubbed at that 30%, 35% of Water Infrastructure and Applied Water. Is that still a good number? And can you kind of isolate your aftermarket sales, how much it grew in those two segments and what the obvious influence, I would think, positive on margins was? Thanks.","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah. Listen, I don't think it shifted that much. I mean, as we're looking at it, it's..","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","It's roughly about 40%. It ebbs and flows from quarter to quarter, but it's roughly about 40% all in. And that's if you throw in the impact obviously of the new Measurement & Control Solutions segment.","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah. Services is bumping that up a little bit. And the transport, Jim, the transport aftermarket was up double digits there. So, that was where we saw some good help.","Jim Giannakouros - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thank you all.","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano with Cowen.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Good morning, Joe.","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Good morning.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hey Patrick, can you talk about how \u2013 as you've added these platforms and you're having these discussions with these pilots, how has like the selling pitch changed? Like is it more you now doing a lot of this stuff, going into big customers and doing like a pitch to a CEO whereas maybe a couple years ago it was individual product people talking to people like at lower levels of utility?","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","That's a good question, Jim (sic) [Joe] (58:33). Let me be clear, this is a team sport. So there's a lot of people and a lot of executives that are having these conversations. But what I would say to your point, the nature of the conversation very much has changed. So, a lot of these are me going out with the teams and meeting with the CEOs, the Chief Technology Officer, the CFO, for example, of a utility, but there are many other executives that are off doing these meetings as well.","What's most important is the nature of the conversation has evolved. Before, we would be selling in, this was before the Sensus acquisition and certainly before the new AIA platform, we would go in, and quite frankly, it was more of a courtesy call. We were serving the wastewater side of the market, not very capital intensive other than large treatment plants, and they didn't have any headaches with our product. I'm not saying that overconfidently but it was not their top of mind issue.","They were happy with what they got or they had issues they would share with me. Now, we're having conversations around their large capital plans which is what gets the CEO's attention and the CFO's attention, and we get to talk about what are their biggest pain points? What are the big headaches for them both from an OpEx and CapEx perspective? And it really is those pain points that I talked about in the opening around non-revenue water, the age and decay of their infrastructure, as well as headaches like storm water overflow, outdoor water, smart watersheds, et cetera.","So, we leave them, we try to leave them to a process of discovery to say depending up on what their pain point is. We're pretty confident that we have a technology and a solution in the portfolio to then go do a pilot with them, and that's where we're really seeing the inflow of these pilots that I'm referring to not just on the Sensus side, but really the new AIA platform.","So, it's early days, Joe, I mean I think we are evolving, we are learning a lot as we go. But it's a great \u2013 it's very different and great set of conversations with the customer to really understand what their biggest challenges are.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","And then, and Mark, if we get another leg higher in cost inflation or if there's something that ramps on tariffs or anything, how much flex do you have on the cost side of things to be able to maybe bring forward some of the savings at a faster rate or flex spend somewhere to kind of keep offsetting inflation with productivity like you've done so far this year?","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Well, yeah, I think we're going to continue to drive our productivity programs or actually perform a little bit better than what we had expected and planned in the first quarter and the teams are doing very well there. But as inflation ticks up, we need to do a better job in getting price in the marketplace to cover that. So I think that's really what we need to be pushing on.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Joe, we also have flexibility in some of the planned investments in the back half of this year as well as in the next year that obviously we can throttle those as we need to. Obviously, we're not going to cut ourself short in terms of investing in growth of the business, but we've got some other incremental discretionary investments that we've held back on thus far just until we get a better feel for what the environment is going to be in the second half.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","All right. Thanks, guys.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah. Thank you.","Operator","As a reminder, please limit yourself to one question. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Barry with Susquehanna.","Robert D. Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Hey, good morning, Robert.","Robert D. Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Thanks for taking the question. Just a couple of follow ups...","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Sure.","Robert D. Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","...I guess at this point. On the emerging markets, I think in China and India are about 25% of the total, that implies, I think, the rest is down like mid-single digits. So, just curious what's going on in those other pieces? Are there some particular pockets of weakness and what's the outlook for those?","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah. I'm not exactly sure how you did your math. I would say...","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah. The Middle East...","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Middle East.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Middle East was up low-single digits. And I would say we had a little bit of softness in Latin America...","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","...that would have \u2013 and a little bit in Eastern Europe, but they're quite small, so maybe all those together that gets you down maybe around flattish for the rest of emerging markets but I think our math would still show us with low-single digit growth in the rest.","Robert D. Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Got it. I'll follow up with that, Matt. And then just a quick one on just setting the expectations for growth in MCS, I know it's lumpy but with starting at 5%, I think that implies you need to do 8% to 9% and the remaining quarters and it's toughening comps in the back half. So, just any level setting there on how we should model that?","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah. On that one, I think there's a bunch of components right? The first is when you just think about Sensus which is the biggest piece of that segment. In the first quarter, they grew at 6% but we do expect that to ramp up in the second quarter and over the back half of the year to high-single digits. We've got pretty strong backlogs there. We \u2013 also on the test side we're a little bit light, we are in low-single digits and that ramps up as well. So, the next three quarters are bigger than what we see in the first quarter. So, we're confident that we'll get to that higher revenue.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","So, Robert, we had a 16% increase in shippable backlog for that whole segment and we expect high-single digits in Q2 through the end of the year and that's based on some very specific project deployments, things that we've won previously that we're announcing for, so the Alliant deal, the Nicor deal, those kind of things that are out there. So, we've got quite a high level confidence on hitting those numbers.","Robert D. Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Great. Thank you.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah.","E.

Good morning.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Good morning, Scott.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Would you guys mind just \u2013 I think I'm asking a question that maybe some people are trying to get to. If we look at your page five, your mix\/price\/FX\/other, that was a minus 80 basis points, and in the fourth quarter, it was a plus 30 basis points. So, that shift \u2013 I know that gap gets reduced in the coming quarters by pricing and the mix things that you've already talked about. But I think it would be really helpful to us if you could tell us specifically what pricing was in each of the two legacy segments, is that possible?","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","We'll take that offline. I mean, we've, I think, laid out pretty clearly what that margin delta was year-over-year. The biggest driver was volume, okay? And that was 170 basis points, 180 basis points. And we also saw significant improvement from productivity that was roughly 40 basis points. Then you had mix was roughly 70 basis point hit year-over-year and we've talked a lot about that. And obviously inflation was 220 basis points.","So, those were the big drivers, the other that we mentioned briefly was a little bit of a headwind, relative to transactional FX. And obviously, we continue to invest in our business as well. So, I mean, those are the components. I don't think there's anything that's changed in terms of the model.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Understood. Thank you. And I just \u2013 a follow-up would be residential construction spending has been slowing. I mean, it's been a great market for such a long time, law of large numbers. Do you think that that ultimately backs up into utility spending in 2019?","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","We're not seeing the signs at this point, Scott, I mean, based on all of the indicators we see in our bid pipeline, all the conversations we're having across utility base. You are correct that over the long-term of the cycle, depending upon where that \u2013 it really depends on the pockets around the country that it's happening as to whether or not that resi expansion is impacting the need for greenfield expansion of treatment capabilities. So it really depends on where. We're not seeing it and we're not hearing any indications of that at all certainly in terms of the bid and quotations coming in to us.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Sounds good. Thank you.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Okay.","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Yeah.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Lee - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thanks for taking the question.","E. Mark Rajkowski - Xylem, Inc.","Hi Brian.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Good morning, Brian.","Brian Lee - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Good morning. I'll just squeeze one in here, I know we're nearing the end of the call. But on analytics in India, I think, Patrick, you made some specific comments around that. Can you speak to China and then maybe some other regions where you're seeing some revenue synergy opportunities and also maybe speak to the scale of some of these opportunities given the commentary around them being larger deals and now maybe being more 2019 versus 2018 impact on the P&L? Thank you.","Patrick K. Decker - Xylem, Inc.","Sure. Yeah. So we're seeing \u2013 I would categorize it overall that especially in the emerging markets, I mean, I'll come back in North America in a moment and Europe, but certainly in the emerging markets, that's where we're probably seeing the quickest uptake on some of the pilots that we've been talking about because there, you've heard me say before and I don't mean to be kind of facetious about it, but the emerging markets in many cases don't have the basic infrastructure in place, and therefore, they're going to skip investing in dumb infrastructure. They're going to go right to smart infrastructure and they've got the money to pay for these things. And so, there are a number of sizeable opportunities there that we are very confident about.","That's not to say that North America and Europe are great opportunities as well, especially with the AIA platform. We're seeing a lot of uptake there. That's where Pure already had a strong base as well as these other small start-ups that we brought into the fold, and we're bringing them channels to market that they didn't have before. So, I want to hold sort of talking about specifically size of deals just from a competitive standpoint and, again, we'll have more to share on that as we secure a couple of these and convert from pilot to larger project.","Brian Lee - Goldman Sachs & Co.

Good morning and Happy New Year. Thanks for joining the call. We appreciate your interest in Xylem. We made substantial progress in 2012 putting a foundation in place and defining a clear path to realizing our full potential. We are confident in our course and we are moving forward this year with continued focus on leveraging our full power of our portfolio, our industry knowledge and our customers\u2019 relationship to grow this business.","While we were disappointed from a top line perspective in 2012, we entered the New Year with relatively stable market conditions, a resilient portfolio and plan to earn to drive earnings growth centered on improving our competitive positions, simplifying our business and continue our focus on cost saving initiates to provide flexibility to expand our growth strategy. Later in the presentation we will discuss how we see 2013 from a market perspective and the actions we\u2019ve been taking to deliver earnings growth and impact of these conditions.","Now I\u2019d like to walk you through our fourth quarter results. We received orders of $926 million, up 3% in constant currency and 2% organically. Revenues from the fourth quarter was $969 million, down 3% compared to prior year, when we registered over $1 billion in revenue, an all-time record performance. Revenue in the U.S. and Europe was down 4% organically versus the prior year, while super storm Sandy provided a benefit of approximately $8 million, it did not offset weak Industrial and Public Utility markets.","Within the emerging markets which today represents approximately 20% of our revenue base, fourth quarter revenues were down 2% organically. However when you exclude the timing of large project shipments the fourth quarter of 2011, emerging markets grew 9%. Investments made in key countries like Russia and China resulted in double-digit growth in this quarter. We\u2019re reporting gross margins of 39.4% for the fourth quarter, up 150 basis points over the prior year.","Adjusted operating margins expanded 140 points to 13.4%. These results demonstrate our commitment and ability to drive operating performance from our business even in a challenging growth environment. Our strong operating performance during the quarter resulted in earnings per share of $0.47 up 21% on a normalized basis. Overall, we delivered strong operating performance, delivering additional penny of earnings relative to our guidance, despite lower than anticipated volumes.","Our full-year 2012 financial highlights are as follows. Orders of $3.8 billion were in line with revenue and we are exiting the year with a backlog of $647 million, roughly in line with prior year. Revenues had increased 2.5% on a constant currency basis. Gross margin was 39.6%, up 120 basis points over the prior year. Operating margin was 12.9%, up 100 basis points on a normalized basis.","To put this into perspective, our full-year margin came in right around the midpoint of our original guidance we set last February, a significant achievement given that impact of lower volumes and dilutive transaction and integration cost from the MJK and Heartland acquisitions. It also includes the addition of incremental standalone costs of $28 million. At the bottom line, we\u2019ve recorded EPS of $1.77 exceeding our previous guidance by $0.01. And finally, we delivered free cash flow of $312 million, a conversion ratio of 100%.","Now I\u2019d like to provide you with an update on the business and the progress we\u2019ve made on our strategic initiatives. We continue our focus on acquiring businesses that set our strategic objectives for growth, and we believe we\u2019ll achieve attractive returns on invested capital. During the third quarter of 2012, we acquired MJK, followed by the acquisition of Heartland Pumps in the fourth quarter and earlier this week, we announced the acquisition of PIMS Group.","I\u2019ll spend some time on the next slide walking through the PIMS acquisition. We\u2019ll just say for now is that our integration process is working both MJK and Heartland are already exceeding our expectations. In fact well we expected the impact of Heartland to have been $0.01 dilutive to the fourth quarter, it was neutral to earnings. We are excited to have added these three acquisitions to what is already the world\u2019s broadest portfolio or water focused solutions and we believe our pipeline provides opportunity to deploy our capital in a disciplined fashion in this fragmented market to drive growth and return for our shareholders.","Last year we began several steps to better align ourselves to maximize our presence and efficiency in Europe. The European market is and will continue to be a critical region for us. We\u2019ve operated there successfully for more than 100 years and have built a large install base with trusted customer relationships. By capitalizing on our entire portfolio of products and services and leveraging our scale and expertise more efficiently, we not only preserve but enhance our competitive positions.","We made significant progress on this initiative beginning with the establishment of a new European headquarters in Schaffhausen in Switzerland. We also initiated some restructuring steps in 2012 and this year we will be taking additional restructuring and realignment actions targeting at advancing this new European management structure for growth. By driving our strategic and operating decision making aligns Xylem in Europe we will best \u2013 we will best positioned to take a more focused view of our customers\u2019 needs and optimize our cost savings, differentiating Xylem in the marketplace.","We made good progress in delivering customer value. For the year, we achieved the Vitality Index of 15% which is our internal measurement for our new product as a percent of total revenue. This is up from 12% in 2011 and reflects the successful deployment of innovative new product applications and services for the relevant customer segments. This means we generated over $0.5 billion in revenue from new products \u2013 new innovative product launches including more than one-third from application self designs reducing the energy consumption of our customers processes.","During the quarter, we announced plans to open a new office in Saudi Arabia to continue to build our already strong position in the Middle East and Africa region which today represents approximately 5% of total Xylem revenues. Accelerating our presence in market penetration in the emerging markets will continue to be a key focus area for Xylem. And I am pleased to announce that we recently proposed and achieved Board approval to increase our first quarter dividend by 15%.","Our annual dividend payout will be approximately $86 million assuming the Board approved each of the next three quarter dividends at the same amount as the first quarter. This reflects our confidence in continuing to generate strong free cash flow from the business. Beyond 2013, our dividend policy will be to propose dividend increases in line with earnings growth.","Turning to Slide 4, this week we announced the acquisition of privately held PIMS Group with fiscal year 2012 revenues of $38 million for a purchase price of $57 million. This acquisition is consistent with our strategy to expand our aftermarket service business and accelerate our expansion in the contract services. Located in and servicing more than 10,000 locations in the U.K., PIMS specializes in the installation and maintenance of water and waste water pumping systems, sewers and drains and waste water treatment plants. The business provides municipal, industrial and private customers with 24x7 support services.","We expect to leverage its market leading business processes throughout our global footprint with minimal additional capital investments, while enhancing the services we already provide today. With Xylem\u2019s large install base, PIMS is a perfect match to ensure customers are provided with industry leading products, application solutions and enhanced aftermarket support services.","We expect to generate cost synergies with the acquisition and to generate revenue synergies in the U.K. and as we expand globally. We expect the PIMS to be margin dilutive during 2013 as we get through the normal purchase accounting step up adjustments and integration costs. And we expect that PIMS will be EPS neutral in 2013 and accretive in 2014.","Now let me turn the call over to our CFO, Mike Speetzen to walk you through the 2012 detailed results. Mike?","Mike Speetzen","Thanks Gretchen. Please go to Slide 5. In the fourth quarter Xylem revenues were $969 million, down 3% from our record fourth quarter in 2011. Let me provide some perspective on our fourth quarter and full-year revenue performance by end-market and by region.","First in our largest end-market Industrial, organic revenue was down low single-digits, year-over-year in the fourth quarter. Despite the impact from super storm Sandy, U.S. continued to be negatively impacted by dry weather conditions and the slowdown in water transport supporting natural gas fracking. European industrial market weakness continued in the fourth quarter down mid single-digits. Industrial performance in emerging markets was robust with Latin America and the Middle East and Africa regions posting double-digit gains over the prior year.","On a sequential basis, Industrial grew mid single-digits in the fourth quarter driven by Europe, reflecting normal seasonal patterns. Overall, full-year organic revenues for Industrial were up low single-digits. Fourth quarter revenues from the Public Utility market declined high single-digits year-over-year. This was weaker than our expectation of a low single-digit decline. As we mentioned on our last quarter\u2019s call we saw the acceleration of some deliveries into the third quarter and we knew we were facing a difficult time given the sizable projects we delivered in 2011.","The varying levels of uncertainty among public utilities both in the U.S. and Europe resulted in the delay of smaller projects in discretionary maintenance and drove the additional weakness in this market. Overall, full-year organic revenues for Public Utilities were down approximately 1%. Commercial Building services were up low single-digits. In the U.S. we saw market conditions weaken in the back half of the year.","Super storm Sandy partially offset this weakness providing approximately $1.5 million in revenue for the quarter. Outside of the U.S., we saw strength in Latin America driven by several small project shipments and Europe was flat year-over-year. Overall full-year organic revenues were flat for the Commercial end-market in line with our expectations. Residential was up low single-digits in the fourth quarter. U.S. market was up mid single-digits driven by seasonal promotions and the benefit of approximately $0.5 million contributable to super storm Sandy.","Despite the contribution from our recently launched high-energy efficient Ecocirc Circulator, Europe was down low single-digits given continued weakness in the housing market. Overall, full-year organic revenues were down low single-digits for the Residential end-markets, in line with our previous expectations. And as far Agriculture, we were up mid single-digits for the fourth quarter driven by better than expected results out of Europe. Overall full-year organic revenues were up low single-digits in line with our previous expectations.","Let me spend just a few minutes on our overall geographic performance. The U.S. was down 4% on an organic basis in the fourth quarter and 5% for the year in line with our previous expectations. Europe was down 4% in fourth quarter and was down 1% for the year slightly below our expectation of flat year-over-year performance, driven by weakness in the residential market. Emerging markets organic revenue declined 2% for the fourth quarter primarily due to the timing of several large project shipments which we delivered during the fourth quarter of 2011.","Excluding these projects, emerging market revenue was up approximately 9%. Emerging market organic revenues were in mid single-digits over the full-year in 2012. Adjusted operating income was up 8% despite lower than expected organic revenue, fourth quarter operating margins came in at 13.4% up 140 basis points after absorbing the minimal impact of incremental standalone ramp up costs.","Gross margin was 39.4% for the fourth quarter, up 150 basis points versus the prior year as price and cost improvements more than offset inflation and unfavorable mix. By driving gross margin performance we are able to continue to invest in our business while expanding operating margins. Investments in the fourth quarter impacted operating margins by 30 basis points. For this quarter, our operating margin contribution for price offset material cost inflation. The MJK and Heartland Pump acquisitions were 10 basis point headwind operating margins for the quarter, reflecting the impact of purchase accounting and integration costs. The impact of foreign exchange translation and transaction favorably impacted our operating margins by 20 basis points.","Please turn to Slide 6. This slide shows our EPS walk for the fourth quarter. This has been a transition year for Xylem and as such there were lot of moving parts. So I am going to spend some time this morning as we have on previous calls describing the components of our performance. As the middle section of the chart depicts we\u2019ve adjusted both 2011 and 2012 EPS to a normalized basis to provide a clear picture of how we performed operational efforts last year.","The walk starts with GAAP EPS for 2011 and ends with GAAP EPS for 2012. In between we made two sets of adjustments. For the fourth quarter on the left side of the chart, we increased 2011 GAAP EPS of $0.28 by $0.11 to show 2011 on a comparable basis. For the fourth quarter of 2012, on the right side of the chart, we adjusted GAAP EPS of $0.39 by adding back the net negative impact of 2012 one-time separation costs, restructuring and realignment costs and special tax items. Making these adjustments for the fourth quarters on a comparable normalized basis to allow for better view of operational performance.","This analysis shows that normalized EPS increased 21% or $0.08 and was completely driven by core operations including actions taken to reduce costs and restructuring activities initiated in the third and fourth quarters of 2012. Acquisition impacts, foreign exchange translation and our operating tax rate were neutral to our EPS performance. We previously provided a range of restructuring and realignment costs of $15 million to $20 million with related savings of approximately $10 million.","For the year, restructuring and realignment came in at $24 million and will yield savings of approximately $12 million in 2013. Now let me provide more detail for each of our reporting segments. Please turn to Slide 7. For the fourth quarter, Water Infrastructure reported revenues of $637 million, down 5% over prior year on a constant currency basis and down 7% organically.","The MJK and Heartland Pump acquisitions contributed two points to top line growth and foreign exchange was a one point headwind. Transport declined 5% for the fourth quarter driven by weakness in both Public Utility and Industrial markets were we saw mid single-digit declines. Despite approximately $6 million of revenue due to super storm Sandy, our U.S. dewatering business was down significantly from the prior year due to ongoing drought conditions, lack of public utility funding for projects and lower industrial rentals particularly for natural gas fracking applications which peaked in the fourth quarter of 2011.","Treatment revenues declined 18% for the fourth quarter, by the general decline of project activity and the delay of project shipments in 2013. Additionally in the fourth quarter of 2011, we saw a 21% increase in Treatment driven by the timing of large shipments in the Latin America which did not repeat in 2012. Test revenues were up 1% due to strength in emerging markets partially offset by continued weakness in Europe.","Fourth quarter operating margins came in at 16.5% of a 120 basis points for 2011. Operational excellence and restructuring savings expanded operating margins by 380 basis points, where our customer excellence initiative drove price to 270 basis points and as a result, more than offset the impact of inflation and provide a flexibility to continue to invest in the business.","Our margins were however negatively impacted to the previously mentioned lower rental dewatering volume and acquisition headwind from purchase accounting and operation costs. Let me now turn to Slide 8 and talk to our Applied Water segment. Applied Water\u2019s fourth quarter revenue was up 4% on both the constant currency and organic basis. Foreign exchange was a 1% headwind bringing our total growth in the segment 3%.","Building services was up 2% driven by Commercial and Residential performance I covered earlier. Industrial water was up 6% due to favorable general industrial market conditions across most regions. In the U.S. our results were favorably impacted by the timing of shipments we mentioned during the last quarter call. Excluding these dynamics U.S. Industrial Water applications were slightly weaker than expected. Europe was up low single-digits driven by growth in Russia and we continue to see favorable results in Asia-Pac. And lastly Irrigation was up 4% with Europe up mid single-digits, partially offset by the U.S. which was down low single-digits.","Fourth quarter operating margins came in at 11.6%, up 240 basis points from 2011. Price and productivity actions and benefits from severance actions taken in the fourth quarter of 2011 more than offset the impact of lower volume, unfavorable mix and inflation enabling continued investment in this segment.","Now let me turn to Slide 9 and review our financial position. We generated $312 million of free cash flow for the year, a conversion on adjusted net income of a 100%. Our cash flow is down from 2011 as anticipated, driven primarily by interest payments of $53 million related to the debt put in place as a result of this spin on from ITT. In addition, we had an incremental U.S. Federal and State tax payments in 2012. As a reminder the 2011 figures are a result of the carved out financials provided in the Form-10 and reflected in allocated portion of U.S. tax payments that were deemed as Xylem obligation for the purposes of the Form-10 statement.","Note that adjusting to these tax payments would bring the 2011 conversion in line with our current year performance. As you can see from the slide, working capital as a percent of revenue increased 80 basis points year-over-year. Foreign exchange had an unfavorable impact of 100 basis points and was partially offset by 20 basis points of operational improvements.","Improved collection performance and favorable supplier terms more than offset investment inventory to support shorter lead times expected from customers. As it relates to our capital structure, we ended the year in a strong position. Our available cash on hand was $504 million. We have a solid net debt to net capital ratio of 25% and our credit metrics are in line with expectations at current rates. Our commercial paper and revolving credit facilities remain in place and continue to be unutilized.","Before we turn to the guidance details, let me turn the call back over to Gretchen to provide you with the framework we are working in 2013. Gretchen?","Gretchen McClain","Please turn to Slide 11. I want to say a few minutes providing you with our strategic framework that guides and drives our decisions and actions. We will spend more time in our upcoming Investor Day on March 7 explaining this to you. But simply put these are our key goals and initiatives and from here we develop plans for change and ways to measure the change. It\u2019s our business model to drive excellence throughout the business.","In 2012, we made substantial progress putting a foundation in place as a pure play water technology company, taking it to the next level and positioning Xylem for the long-term requires a few things. First an incredible focus on delivering customer values. We price customer intimacy above all and working to meet customer needs and deliver the unique value as part of our company DNA. We will continue to deliver value across our portfolio, products and services and actively seek new ways to create more value to bring together our application expertise and integrated processes across the business to help solve the complex water challenges our customers confront.","Through our Xylem Total Care program coupled with the benefits of the PIMS acquisition, we\u2019re enhancing our aftermarket capabilities to protect and expand our large install base. Our applications knowledge gives us the ability to provide energy audits, system upgrades and solutions focused on reducing our customers total cost of ownership. Second, drive profitable growth. We are balancing growing our main lines of business with pursuing dynamic new opportunities, both through organic investments and our disciplined acquisition strategies.","We will accomplish this by indexing and innovative offerings in high potential areas like smart products, energy efficiency and reuse, expanding our gross platforms, analytics and dewatering and extending our geographic position in the key markets, both emerging and underserved matured markets. And we will maximize revenue and profitability and carefully manage how we use our capital to invest in our business, balance risk and opportunity and return to our shareholders.","Third, improve business sustainability. We are focused on continuously improving the efficiency and effectiveness in all we do, which translates into greater competitive advantage and builds a sustainable product goal of financial stability and flexibility. We will continue our focus on optimizing our cost structure. We plan to invest $60 million to $70 million in restructuring and realignment in 2013.","As I discussed earlier, in Europe we are repositioning our business as well as talking other targeted actions to better position us in the future. And we are driving robust operating rhythms throughout the organizations. These changes will lead to achieving our goals and enabling innovations, agility and speed which are necessary to address the long-term market drivers of demand in the water industry.","So let me set the stage for our 2013 guidance before I hand it over to Mike to walk through the details. Turn to Slide 12. This slide shows our revenue profile on a trailing four quarter basis since 2011 and highlights some of the key major drivers that have influenced our actual performance and our forecast for 2013. As the chart illustrates, we experienced strong growth in 2011 driven by the delivery of large project orders received in 2010.","Strong performance from dewatering and analytical businesses acquired in 2010 and general strength across all end-markets driven by the recovering global economies. We started to see order rates for a large public utility CapEx project flow in the second half of 2011 impacting Public Utilities revenue growth in 2012. Compared to the strong performance in 2011, the U.S. dewatering business was impacted by drought conditions along with the slowdowns in natural gas related fracking activities.","While European political and economies concerns made headlines in 2012, our European business remained resilient down only 1%. Like most other companies, we saw a general slowdown in the U.S. and European industrial markets in the latter half of 2012. Taken together this led to a flat organic revenue growth with a more difficult second half of the year. Looking forward to 2013, we expect the second cash flow down experienced in 2012 continue to impact the first half of 2013. Compared with relative prior year periods, we expect revenue will be down mid single-digits in the first quarter of 2013, down low single-digits in the first half of 2013 and up low single-digits through the balance of the year.","We expect Europe to remain relatively stable and expect the U.S. to strengthen in the second half along with reacceleration in emerging market growth, this sequential improvement in underlying demand for our business as the year progresses. Please turn to Slide 13 where Mike will walk you through each of the end-markets and our 2013 guidance.","Mike Speetzen","Thanks Gretchen. On a global basis Industrial remains our largest end-market representing 43% of our revenues in 2012. In this market we provide cards which are critical running our customers base operations for energy efficient products and total cost of ownership of value by our customers. In addition the majority of our dewatering revenues are associated with Industrial end-markets.","With some uncertainty around where U.S. industrial demand will go and European industrial production is expected to remain challenged, we anticipate our revenues will be flat to up low single-digits organically in 2013. In addition to slightly improving economic conditions in the U.S. and emerging markets, we see additional expansion of our Treatment solutions into Industrial applications and a return to more normal weather patterns for dewatering business in the U.S.","Revenues from Public Utility is now 35% of our total revenue, and are expected to be flat with 2012 levels. We continue to expect stability and required operations and maintenance activities as this spin is largely non-discretionary and is funded by tariffs end-users. As we\u2019ve discussed during previous quarters, the portion of Public Utility revenue does drive from CapEx project spending continues to be constrained by project orders.","Given the longer lead times for such projects and the absence of insignificant change in CapEx spending levels our forecast for 2013 assumes that this continues to be case for this year. We expect the demand for emerging market public utility infrastructure will drive growth for Xylem in 2013. Our revenues from commercial markets are expected to be flat to up low single-digits. While indicators such as the Commercial Architecture Building Index have improved slightly in recent months, we expect market demand in the U.S. to remain flat for at least the first three quarters.","European commercial construction is expected to remain challenged, offset by growth in emerging markets. Residential markets support flat to low single-digit growth as our product sales are largely driven by replacement sales associated with our large install base. Agriculture remains a small market for us and revenues are likely to be flat given the benefit we received from drought conditions in the U.S. in 2012.","Taken together, the low growth economic environment along with the relative stability of demand from the variable types of products we sell across the variety of end-markets suggest flat to low growth in 2013.","Please turn to Slide 14 and I\u2019ll walk you through the guidance details. We anticipate 2013 revenues of approximately $3.9 billion which reflects total growth 3% to 4% consisting of flat to 1% organic growth, two points of growth from acquisitions of MJK, Heartland and PIMS and a one point benefit from foreign exchange. For Water Infrastructure we expect 2013 revenue of approximately $2.5 billion reflecting total growth of 4% to 5%. Organic growth for Water Infrastructure is expected to be flat to 1%. The previously mentioned acquisitions will contribute three points of growth while foreign exchange has a one point benefit.","Finally for Applied Water, we expect revenues of approximately $1.4 billion. This reflects growth of 1% to 2% driven by organic growth of flat to 1% and one point benefit from foreign exchange. Segment margins are anticipated to be in the range of 13.8% to 14.3% and company operating margins are projected to be in the range of 12.3% to 12.8%. We anticipate earnings per share of $1.80 to $1.90. This range excludes one-time restructuring and realignment costs of approximately $60 million to $70 million pre-tax. That includes approximately $5 million pre-tax of additional one-time separation cost and $5 million pre-tax higher pension costs.","Of the $60 million to $70 million we plan to execute restructuring actions in 2013, which will cost approximately $40 million to $50 million with an expected payback of approximately two years and we expect approximately $13 million to $15 million of net savings to be realized in 2013. This is in addition to the $12 million of savings resulting from the actions executed in 2012.","Free cash flow conversion is forecast to be approximately 95% slightly lower than 2012 after taking into account restructuring payments and capital expenditures related to the European realignment and targeted expansion of dewatering. We also have the remaining actions required to separate from ITT including IT systems to exit service agreements and as well as the required relocation of our corporate headquarters.","Our operating tax rate is expected to be approximately 21% a reduction from 24% in 2012. This rate reflects a sustainable benefit from the establishment of our new European headquarters in Schaffhausen, Switzerland. Please note, because of certain milestones including the rollout of the European structure across our regional businesses, we expect the operating tax rate to average approximately 22% over the first half of 2013 and 20% over the second half.","Our fully diluted share count is expected to be a 186.4 million which takes into account our share repurchase program targeted at offsetting dilution associated with the various Xylem employee stock plans. Finally, let me summarize our capital deployment plans. Our first priority remains organic investments as this is the highest returning investment we can make. To this end we see investing 2.5% to 3% of revenue in CapEx, 3% into R&D and just under 2% into restructuring and realignment to enhance our competitive position [ph].","Inorganic growth remains a top priority. Our acquisition capacity and pipeline support continued investments. As Gretchen mentioned we\u2019re increasing our dividend by 15% and have the intention to grow at future years in line of earnings. Please turn to Slide 15 which illustrates our EPS and operating margin walk in 2012 to the midpoint of 2013 guidance.","For 2013, we are incorporating a remaining required one-time separation costs in the \u2013 for IT systems and corporate headquarter relocation into our guidance. These costs result in a $0.02 reduction in EPS and a decrease of 10 basis points for operating margins in 2013. The impact of foreign exchange and the acquisitions of MJK, Heartland and PIMS are neutral to EPS that reduces our 2013 operating margin by 40 basis points. Operating margins related to the acquisitions are unfavorably impacted by certain purchase accounting adjustments and integration and transaction costs.","Excluding these impacts, operating margins for all the three acquisitions will be accretive to Xylem\u2019s operating margin. Cost savings initiatives and productivity are expected to drive a $0.07 benefit to EPS and 50 basis points to margin improvement, more than offsetting the unfavorable impact of higher pension costs of approximately $0.02, continued investment growth initiatives and the headwind from a low organic growth environment.","Finally, our European realignment led $0.03 to EPS. The lower tax rate discussed on the previous slide will more than offset the higher run rate costs associated with new European organizational structure. At the segment in operating marginalize this is expected to have a 30 basis point negative impact. The combination of all these items result in an adjusted EPS with $1.85 and adjusted operating margin of 12.6%, consistent with our guidance midpoint of 2013.","Please turn to Slide number 16 and I\u2019ll turn it back over to Gretchen to wrap up.","Gretchen McClain","In summary, 2012 was certainly a challenging but rewarding first full year. Looking back we established an organization with the ability to handle adversity, adapt to changing market dynamics and deliver strong performance. We\u2019ve discussed in detail how we\u2019ve advanced our strategic position over the past 12 months. Launched new innovative products and services and were recognized by organizations and customers as best in class.","We delivered strong financial and operational performance despite macro challenges which resulted in softer top line performance than we expected at the beginning of the year. We drove significant growth margins and operating margin expansions in line with our original guidance and we are taking actions to project our progress and continue our efforts we initiated in 2012.","As we move forward to 2013, we will focus and maintain our focus on improving our competitive position, investing for long-term growth and increasing our efficiency and effectiveness. We ended the year well positioned in the marketplace with a strong balance sheet and an organization still to succeed. With that we\u2019re happy to take your question. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","The floor is now open to the questions. (Operator Instructions) Thank you. Our first question is coming from Deane\u00a0Dray with Citi Research.","Deane\u00a0Dray \u2013 Citi Research","Thank you, good morning everyone.","Mike Speetzen","Good morning.","Gretchen McClain","Good morning, Deane.","Deane\u00a0Dray \u2013 Citi Research","I was interested in hearing more about the PIMS acquisition, the move with the services does cope up with the equipment model but if you can comment on how you scale the service business, there is a lot of headcount in terms of returns of that business model, so how much has it been growing and how do you scale it and do you get a flow through of your aftermarket products through service organizations like PIMS?","Gretchen McClain","Yes, Deane let me step back a little bit and we\u2019ve been talking about our aftermarket strategy for quite some time. We\u2019ve been spending enormous amount of time driving what we call our Total Care program is. And so in all of our businesses where we have a large install base, our sales teams have been working aggressively to make sure that we\u2019re capturing the parts and services but also bringing advanced services where we can bring the broad portfolio of products that we have and our ability to going and do energy audits and so forth.","What we get with PIMS is, one, some very nice processes. We also get a very talented group of folks that have a core competency that we can help train geographically our teams that are positioned very well. So we not only do we get a great position in the U.K. which complements where today we play in the public utility and 90% of their customer base is non-public utility. We also get a core competence of talent that we can actually use to help our teams geographically expand.","Deane\u00a0Dray \u2013 Citi Research","Great, and then just a quick follow-up for Mike. Can you comment on the lower tax guidance and you know what\u2019s driving that and sustainability?","Mike Speetzen","Yes, good question, Deane. We do quite a bit of work around the tax planning. As we have mentioned in prior discussions, we actually were fortune to take the tax leader [ph] that was at ITT with us given the global footprint that we have. So we\u2019ve been doing a lot of work around the planning aspects. I think the key elements is this is a sustained tax rate improvement from some of the restructuring that we\u2019re doing in Europe and we look at it as a great position not only the leverage, including other parts of our current portfolio but as we look to bring new acquisitions into the full that will give us a good leverage point in terms of doing some sustainability around further improvements in our tax rate.","Deane\u00a0Dray \u2013 Citi Research","Great, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt\u00a0Summerville with KeyBanc.","Matt\u00a0Summerville \u2013 KeyBanc","Good morning. Can you talk a little bit more, I understand the relocation of the headquarters, but just what you are doing from \u2013 heavy lifting perspective in terms of restructuring, are you taking out facilities, people, can you put other numbers sort of behind that, and then what do you expecting the payback to be on the $60 million to $70 million year investing in \u201813 as we think about at \u201814?","Gretchen McClain","Sure, Matt, let me first talk a little bit about what we\u2019re trying to do in Europe. We\u2019ve been positioned in Europe for quite some time, and as a separate independent company, we have not really been totally utilizing or leveraging our unique and broad capabilities as a total Xylem in the water industry. And so our objective here is to setup the headquarters, one headquarters, today we have three headquarters in Switzerland. We will be aligning our strategies around our end-markets that we go to and so couple of the restructuring actions will lead to consolidating multiple sales companies in one country.","And we\u2019ll be able to leverage our back office more efficiently and effectively. We\u2019ll be able to set up shared services to support the teams across Europe. They have centers of [ph] excellence and ultimately be able to get some opportunity to leverage, manufacturing, our supply chain leverage, commodity-wise across the whole organization. So I feel like we\u2019re going to be able to position ourselves to be able to work more effectively and efficiently in the market, but ultimately be able to bring more value to our customers. Mike, you can walk through the numbers.","Mike Speetzen","Yes, so Matt let me just kind of step back and hit some of the numbers. So in 2012, we executed about $17 million from a cost perspective of restructuring. We got about a $1 million of benefit in 2012. The remaining $12 million will be a benefit in 2013. Out of the $60 million to $70 million of restructuring and realignment, $40 million to $50 million of that is restructuring and we see that giving us a benefit in 2013 of about $13 million to $15 million. So think about the total restructuring benefit from actions done in 2012 as well as 2013 in a range of $25 million to $27 million.","The payback period on these like we\u2019ve articulated before given the fact that we\u2019re focused primarily around Europe is going to be approximately two years.","Matt\u00a0Summerville \u2013 KeyBanc","Okay and so then we should think about that, in other words [ph] you are getting a one to one dollar payback that there is somewhere in the range of $35 million to be \u2013 they will be back in \u201814, is that the right way to think about it, Mike?","Mike Speetzen","Yes, we\u2019re essentially from an execution standpoint for the actions being done in 2013, pardon me, planning in Q1 execution in Q2 and then we\u2019ll be looking for run rate savings to have achieved in Q3 and Q4.","Matt\u00a0Summerville \u2013 KeyBanc","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Connors with Janney Montgomery Scott.","Ryan Connors \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott","Thank you, good morning.","Gretchen McClain","Good morning.","Ryan Connors \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott","I had a question in regards to foreign exchange, last year you all made a downward guidance revision based on the Euro and translation and given now strongly the Euro in particular has rebounded and look at the guidance assumptions, a little bit surprised that Forex has a little tailwind as it is in that 100 basis points, so you can just talk us through Mike, kind of the assumptions you\u2019re making around currency and the Euro in particular? Thanks.","Mike Speetzen","You bet. Euro is clearly the largest driver we have. In the guidance we used a $1.32. Rates have been trading at slightly higher than that, but just from a modeling perspective if you look back the average rate that we had during the 2012 time period is about $1.20. And so as we look at that, it\u2019s about 1% pickup from a top line perspective. Obviously if the rate were to hold at a $1.35 you would see some incremental pickup. If anybody shot in terms of where the Euro is going to go, if you look at what the projections are through the balance of the year, the Euro is supposed to moderate some based on what they are projecting with interest rates but certainly if it were to hold at the levels it is today we would see potential upside from where we\u2019re at today but again it\u2019s all translation, it has a minimal a impact on the bottom line.","Ryan Connors \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott","Great, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chip Moore with Canaccord.","Chip Moore \u2013 Canaccord Genuity","Good morning, thanks. On the repositioning, I was wondering if you could talk a little under term once you get through the actions in Europe, how much more runway that you have streamline in the business in where you\u2019re at?","Gretchen McClain","So we\u2019ve been making actions as we established Xylem, and so if you were to look at our Asian organization today, we have aligned around the Xylem organization across our Asian region. We\u2019ve been making some moves in Europe, a couple of countries have already integrated and so that has been positive. And so we\u2019ll be making actions. Europe is critical. It\u2019s a market that\u2019s challenged right now. It\u2019s an important customer base. And so those are the first major steps.","But I do feel overall we\u2019ve got a nice alignment in the organization and we\u2019re trying to take those big steps now to position ourselves for the long-term. We\u2019ll give a little bit more color in March at our Investor Day but the big step is in Europe.","Chip Moore \u2013 Canaccord Genuity","Great, thanks.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of David Rose with Wedbush Securities.","David Rose \u2013 Wedbush Securities","Good morning, couple of quick questions. On the spin cost, can you elaborate a little bit more of what we\u2019re seeing and why we\u2019re still seeing that cost, (inaudible) and then maybe a little bit more differentiating the orders for the fourth quarters given that they were up so much and your commentary about public utility is being down, I am assuming that the order growth is more industrial than public utility maybe you can get down for us?","Mike Speetzen","Yes, let me David take the one-time spin cost. Obviously at the time of spin we did our best estimate what do we take to effectively separate ourselves from ITT. When you look at the total amount of money that was spend to exit, the remaining $5 million that we\u2019re talking about in guidance is relatively small. It\u2019s not related to anything that we did not know about. We spent the better part of 2012 trying to make sure that we had a good effective strategy for the IT systems exit as well as exiting our current location for our new corporate headquarters.","So it\u2019s nothing that wasn\u2019t anticipated. It was tough to put a number around it. At the end of the day we weren\u2019t going to compromise an effective and efficient exit. I do not see anything beyond this, this effectively ends all the inter-learnings [ph] that we have with ITT this year. So this is the reason we pointed out is to ensure that as you think of the margin going forward it\u2019s not an ongoing cost.","Gretchen McClain","Yes, let me talk a little bit about the fourth quarter dynamics. As we all saw the confidence level in Europe and some of the confidence level around the U.S. fiscal cliff, had people falling back high on their budgets. So we saw that both in Public Utilities and Industrial. In the Public Utilities, part of that was driven by some of the orders that were pulled forward in third quarter but we did see some pulling back. We\u2019ve done a lot of discussion with our customers to understand what\u2019s going online and what to expect going forward. We did see them extending some of their business activities not something we think is a trend or difficult and we also had some very difficult comparison in the fourth quarter.","As I mentioned earlier, it was our all-time record fourth quarter in 2011 at $1 billion and a significant part of that growth was tied to treatment orders in the fourth quarter of 2011 \u2013 sales in 2011 which didn\u2019t of course repeat. The good thing is we held some nice orders in the fourth quarter of 2012 around treatments so we are feeling good about that. Let me just come back in terms of the order rates we\u2019ve seen, we\u2019ve talked about bidding activities still being strong, bidding activity is still good, our pipeline or I should say our funnel is very full but there is not a significant change in terms of the release of those bids into orders. So see something happen in the fourth quarter, not sure that\u2019s the trend. It\u2019s too early to say that at this point in time and so we\u2019ve not take that in. We think we\u2019re going to still see that market very challenged going forward.","David Rose \u2013 Wedbush Securities","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John\u00a0Moore with C.L. King.","John\u00a0Moore \u2013 C.L. King","Thank you, good morning. Can you quantify any benefits that Sandy had on the order rate in the fourth quarter, and do you expect to have any benefit from Sandy related demand in the first quarter or longer term?","Gretchen McClain","Yes, let me comment. On fourth quarter we saw $8 million from Sandy that came from both of our segments. The largest portion of it from dewatering business, the team did a remarkable job in executing and being there helping our customers. In terms of 2013, we all know that the Disaster Spending Bill has been approved, projects are being worked. We\u2019re working very closely with our customers. I think we\u2019re well positioned to be able to benefit when you look at the portfolio that we have, the expertise that we\u2019ve got but again it\u2019s early in the stages of those projects getting laid out that should be something that falls out later. So it\u2019s tough to quantify 2013 impact at this point.","John\u00a0Moore \u2013 C.L. King","Okay, great. The $8 million was the revenue, but was there a similar benefit to orders in the quarter?","Gretchen McClain","Yes.","John\u00a0Moore \u2013 C.L. King","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jim Krapfel with Morningstar.","Jim Krapfel \u2013 Morningstar","Hi, good morning. I think you partially answered this question already, but would you think the driving \u2013 the weakness you\u2019ve seen from your Public Utility customers, do you think it\u2019s more due to weaker electricity usage trends or the necessitated need for doing product plans or do you think it\u2019s more to due to continued low [ph] power prices making utilities more conservative with available cash. So just trying to get a better sense of whether the utility end-market weakness is more secular in nature or is this typical?","Gretchen McClain","I think you have two dynamics. The Public Utilities have been down in the CapEx expenditure for quite some time. They\u2019re at low ends I think 60 years, that\u2019s not changing. We don\u2019t see any indication of that changing. That\u2019s a big piece from the CapEx perspective. From the operational, OpEx side of the house, as I said we felt some dynamics so we pulled some things into the third quarter. We don\u2019t think the aftermarket is a very strong market and given our large install base that we will reposition very well.","I also think public utilities are looking at how they can reduce their total cost of ownership that again positions us extremely well to be able to bring solutions to help them take their costs down.","Jim Krapfel \u2013 Morningstar","Okay. And then how is the acquisition pipeline looking and what evaluations are you encountering especially relative to the past few quarters?","Gretchen McClain","So our acquisition pipeline is quite strong. We continue to cultivate a lot of different businesses as we know the water industry is quite fragmented and feel good that we have a healthy acquisition pipeline. And it\u2019s working I mean we had three acquisitions over the last three quarters and we feel very good about that. I also felt very good about our acquisition strategy \u2013 our pipelines and integration process.","Each one of our acquisitions that we\u2019ve acquired are getting well integrated with the businesses, are performing quite well. In terms of evaluation, in the fragmented market you still have various different acquisitions. We have been looking primarily on bolt-ons, smaller, many those who are private companies and it varies whether you are going after a businesses in the services areas, sources whether you are at more of a high attractive value in the analytics or treatment area.","Jim Krapfel \u2013 Morningstar","Okay. Thank you so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt\u00a0Summerville with KeyBanc.","Matt\u00a0Summerville \u2013 KeyBanc","I just have a couple of follow-ups, can you talk about, you know from putting Sandy aside for a minute, what was the magnitude of drop-off you saw throughout 2011 in your dewatering business, and given that some of the longer term kind of drought related statistics that at least we look at are still indicating a pretty severe situation here in early \u201813, were you driving the confidence so that business gets better?","Gretchen McClain","Yes, so the water is two dynamics, two very significant dynamics. One an all-time drought in the U.S. which brought that down. And then the other area where we felt 2011 flow is the pickup that we saw in 2011 around the national gas fracking activities. The positive things about our dewatering, dewatering is well positioned in the U.S. We have been able to take that business model and expand ourselves in Australia, now into Brazil and we intend to take that business model into other regions around the world.","We think that will ultimately be significant in terms of growth for us and also help cycles with their when you do have some kind of a drought activity. Overall our position in dewatering does serve many multiple different end-markets but we did see a spike in the natural gas which makes it tougher compare [ph]. But we were flat for the year.","Matt\u00a0Summerville \u2013 KeyBanc","Your global dewatering was flat?","Gretchen McClain","Our overall business.","Matt\u00a0Summerville \u2013 KeyBanc","Got it. And then, as we think about the margin dynamics, your core business flat to up 1%, Mike sort of talked to my last question about the anticipated cost savings from the \u201812 actions, what\u2019s going to happen in \u201813 following through for the year. I guess I am having a hard time reconciling to your operating margins being down as much as 50 basis points and I would assume you are looking to take more prices this year?","Mike Speetzen","Yes, so let me comment it from a couple of different angles, Matt. From a pricing point we\u2019ve talked firstly about having a target of 100 to 200 basis points. We\u2019re obviously entering a \u2013 continued to be in a tough economic cycle and pricing is going to be towards the lower end of that range versus this year we ended up at about 150 basis points. So there is going to be a little bit of headwind now although we do still see a positive contribution from price. But I think the slide we put together in the deck hit of the some key points, I mean first of all we\u2019ve got a pretty substantial pickup from foreign exchange and acquisitions and while they are not dilutive from an EPS standpoint, they are not bringing any income for the most part to the bottom line and that ends up diluting the margins by about 40 basis points.","The foreign exchange piece is more of a triangulation effect of the currency change. The acquisitions, it\u2019s more of a short-term impact of the upfront purchase account and some of the transaction cost. The European realignment was a pickup from an EPS standpoint and drives a substantial portion of the tax benefit. We do have to setup infrastructure in Europe to support that. That\u2019s a 30 basis point headwind. Now the good news is over time that\u2019s going to give us a platform to drive future benefit to the business from an operating (inaudible) and then we\u2019ve articulated really two of the \u2013 what I\u2019d say is out of the norm adjustments, one it is the pension discount rate came down about 75 basis points and for us its about $5 million impact.","And then the one-time separation costs which we\u2019re about just really trying to make sure we exit the connections with ITT in the right way. And then if you look at our core operations, we\u2019re doing a lot of the same things that we did in 2012, dealing with a low growth environment, we have very robust lean and sourcing initiatives and sure we\u2019re driving productivity to not only offset inflation that give us a little bit of room to continue to invest in the key parts of our business and I think that\u2019s a critical element is we have not backed off making sure that we\u2019re investing in the future of the company.","And then the restructuring savings obviously to that to help offset what is some headwind from the other cost increases that I had mentioned a little bit earlier.","Matt\u00a0Summerville \u2013 KeyBanc","Pretty detailed walk, thanks Mike.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from the line of Brian\u00a0Konigsberg with Vertical Research.","Brian\u00a0Konigsberg \u2013 Vertical Research","Good morning. I just had a only question really on the Public Utility, you hit on some of it but I am just curious what you\u2019re thinking actually is going to take to get the capital projects part of the business to trend upwards, I mean if you think about what \u2013 historically how can you refine that, it seems like the healthy \u2013 the municipalities is able to issue debt now that we\u2019re seeing some improvements in the residential market, you would think that health of the municipalities are improving. But I am curious is there a kind of a period of absorption that needs to occur or kind of the \u2013 the municipalities go less before they are able to get to a point where they are able to improve the bond issuances at the municipal level to start doing these capital projects on a more significant level. We know there is no shortage of demand for new projects, it\u2019s really a matter to regain that capital into the system I think. Can you just \u2013 if you could address that?","Gretchen McClain","Sure. It\u2019s a great question. Here is how I think about it, I mean the economy is down until the economy gets dressed in some of the key issues that we\u2019re talking about in the U.S. and other areas it\u2019s going to be a challenge area. Now that\u2019s not stopping us ultimately in terms of strategically looking how we position ourselves in working with our customers to get after cutting, to reducing their operating costs so that they can actually invest in those areas.","There are a lot of bills that are out there that are being kicked around and addressed. There are indicators that will say later this year or into 2014 you will see activity taking place, but right now the trends and the orders don\u2019t reflect that. Our teams are aggressively investing in the right technology, so we are well positioned once that opens up.","Brian\u00a0Konigsberg \u2013 Vertical Research","Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Stewart\u00a0Scharf with S&P Capital IQ.","Stewart\u00a0Scharf \u2013 S&P Capital IQ","Can you talk a little bit about the mix in base line, the new products and end-markets, is there \u2013 what areas that you are focusing or where the mix generally is better and the margins or is it just pretty even based on the various new products and end-markets?","Gretchen McClain","I would say one thing when I talked about our Vitality Index, we are getting a large percentage of our revenue coming from our new product launches which is a good indication that we have the right technology going into the market. I feel good about that. When I look at the mix, going into \u201813 we think our mix is going to be net neutral. You\u2019ve got emerging markets that is pulling down and that\u2019s an area that is growing and an area that we continue to expand in. Analytics and dewatering is positive.","Mike Speetzen","Yes Stewart and maybe just from a financial standpoint I mean 2012 we saw a lot of negative mix and we had a lot of the drivers around the dewatering business being the primary impact. As we look into 2013, as Gretchen stated, we see mix being less of a factor for us, where we see positive upticks in areas like dewatering and analytics. We\u2019ll see a little bit of an offset from an emerging markets standpoint but nothing that\u2019s significant at this point.","Stewart\u00a0Scharf \u2013 S&P Capital IQ","Okay and just going to your financial allocation, it is pretty much the same, focused on the strategic acquisitions, just raised your dividend, maybe change in planning for use of cash, share buybacks and so forth?","Mike Speetzen","No, I mean we have a share repurchase program as we\u2019ve stated in the past, it\u2019s primarily in that managing the dilution from the equity programs. At this point we have a very robust acquisition pipeline and an ample supply of internal investments and our strategy is going to be to focus in those two areas and continue to reevaluate as time goes on.","Stewart\u00a0Scharf \u2013 S&P Capital IQ","Okay, thank you very much.","Mike Speetzen","You bet.","Operator","That was our final question and I\u2019d now like to turn the floor back over to Gretchen for any closing remarks.","Gretchen McClain","Yes, I just want to say thank you for joining us. It\u2019s been a great year. We\u2019ve got a great plan laid out. We are watching the economy very closely. We\u2019re sizing our business to ensure that we\u2019ve got the flexibility for growth. We\u2019re driving of course for growth in our strategic activities. So if we did it and the market changes, that\u2019s a positive thing that we will see in the future.

Please note that the company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements publicly to reflect subsequent events or circumstances, and actual events or results could differ materially from those anticipated.","Now please to turn to Slide 3. And I'll turn the call over to our CEO, Patrick Decker.","Patrick K. Decker","Thanks, Phil, and thank you all for joining us this morning. Today, we announced our first quarter 2014 results. In a moment, I'll give you some headline comments and perspective on the quarter. I will then share some perspective on what I've seen and heard thus far, since join the company 6 weeks ago, and then I'll turn it over to Mike to share more details on the quarter and our full-year outlook.","Given the slow start to the year, which was driven in large part by severe winter weather conditions in North America, the team certainly closed the quarter strong and delivered a solid performance. Heading into the last month of the quarter, we understood it would be critical to drive hard to recover from the slow January and February to get back on track. I'm very pleased with the way the team embraced the challenge, particularly during a CEO leadership transition and challenging market conditions.","During the quarter, orders and revenue grew 3% overall and organically, with strong performance coming from emerging markets.","We entered the second quarter with backlog of $793 million and 2014 shippable backlog of $679 million, which is up 6% year-over-year.","We continue to invest for growth. During the first quarter, we spent $27 million in R&D, up 4% from the prior year and we expect those spend levels to continue through the year. And we see prior year's investments in product development paying off. For example, sales of Flight Experior embedded with new smart run technologies grew approximately 50%. This demonstrates the continued adoption of smart technology and flights capability in market-leading product development.","Additionally, our investment in MultiTrode is also a driving growth. For example, we just recently completed the release of our Multismart Controller in 12 additional languages, enabling us to expand sales of this line to approximately 20 new countries.","Just as critical are our ongoing cost-reduction initiatives, such as the $18 million of restructuring and realignment costs in the quarter, targeted at reducing our overall cost base. We'll see the benefit from those actions in the latter half of the year, and we continue to realize significant savings from the actions the team completed last year, which resulted in a 150 basis point improvement in operating margins in the first quarter.","To wrap up the first quarter results, volume growth and improved operating performance drove earnings per share of $0.34, up 26% over the prior year. Free cash flow is negative $3 million, primarily reflecting typical seasonality and working capital dynamics. We are confident in achieving our full year free cash flow target of 100% conversion of net income.","Finally, on the capital deployment front, we increased our first quarter dividend by 10% and opportunistically repurchased $50 million in common stock.","We will cover some of my initial observations since joining the company on the next slide, but I'll highlight one message I've already stressed: The importance to get off to a good start, which in my view is key to delivering on the full year commitments. So we're off to a nice start, headed in the right direction and have laid a strong foundation for the rest of the year. Thanks to the entire Xylem team worldwide for getting us off on the right foot in 2014.","Now turning to Slide 4. I'll turn it over to Mike to cover the first quarter results in more depth in a few minutes, but before that, I'd like to share with you some of what I've seen and learned so far and what my early-stage priorities are for the business. One of the things that attracted me to Xylem in the first place, beyond the opportunity to be part of something that has the potential to make a big difference globally, is to be part of a young company with a tremendously bright future. That makes Xylem unique. We have a lot of experience to leverage within our business and it's important to me to tap into that experience, to listen and learn and to use that knowledge to help shape our future.","Let me give you a sense of where I'm focusing my attention, as I settle into my new role. After joining on March 17, I convened a set of briefings on key strategic topics with Steve Loranger and the team. These meetings were crucial for me to get an even deeper perspective on the business and to make sure I thoroughly understood our financial commitments and the actions necessary to deliver them. And I want to thank Steve Loranger once again publicly for his tremendous leadership and sacrifice during his tenure as the CEO and for the very smooth transition he has worked hard to provide me.","Now I was excited to hit the road and develop an early sense for the strengths and opportunities in our business. Over the course of the first month, I visited more than a dozen locations in 5 countries. The sci-fi visitor represents some portion of all of our business lines and cover more than 20% of our global workforce. I'll be visiting more sites in the next few months with a particular focus on a number of our key emerging markets. While pushing hard to get to know the business and our people, my primary responsibility, of course, is to direct our performance. As we move to the second quarter, it's critical that we stay laser-focused on driving our performance, but we meet the targets we have set.","So let's move on to recap what we have to do in 2014 because there is much more still ahead. We need to maintained and grow the confidence of our investors in Xylem by delivering on our commitments.","So let's start with our financial commitments. In 2014, we must generate top line growth and at the same time, improve our operating efficiency and align our cost structure to be more competitive. For the year, we expect to achieve nearly $4 billion in revenues. As you already know, we are a company that addresses challenges around the entire cycle of water. The world is changing rapidly, and the world's problems related to water productivity, quality and resilience are changing too. It's exciting to think about our potential to take our innovative products and services and our strong relationship with our customers and solve these new and evolving water challenges. To do that, we will need to continue to drive productivity that will enable further investment in innovation and our people in order to capture new growth opportunities.","In terms of operating income, we expect margin to improve to the 13% range. This would result in earnings per share between $1.85 to $2, as we previously guided, and would represent somewhere between 11% and 20% growth. To make or exceed our 2014 operating income goal, we need to execute on our initiatives in Lean Six Sigma and get the maximum leverage more global strategic sourcing capability. I am a big believer in the returns we can see from Lean Six Sigma. I've seen it work. And the benefits go well beyond productivity, and we shouldn't think of lean applications as only for the factory. Every business and every function within Xylem can and will benefit. We want to achieve a high level of incremental efficiencies. The great thing about the progress make in this area is that it sets us up to be more efficient and competitive. Improvements in our cost structure that carry to the bottom line will certainly have a positive effect, not just on 2014, but on 2015 and beyond.","In addition to our financial goals, we have a few other top-level priorities for the company this year. Among them, optimizing our integrated front-end to accelerate our growth and improve our sales force effectiveness. It is one of our most important initiatives. It's a big lever and it will enable us to present a more informed, more focused, single face to our customers and allow us to cross-sell our portfolio of leading products and services. Integrating the front end and implementing the associated sales force effectiveness tools we're putting into place like a customer relation management system, is no small task for a company with our geographic breadth. But it will enable us to significantly raise our game in the market.","Next, under the umbrella of advancing and institutionalizing high-performing organization culture, we're reigniting the Xylem Management System, or XMS. We want to drive this disciplined approach even further into the organization, carving out and standardizing our key business processes, ensuring accountability and alignment. This helps ensure that we move seamlessly from strategy to execution.","Next is rebalancing our portfolio and our product investments to ensure that we've got the right allocation of resources in the areas that we think will create most meaningful value. We could be more disciplined in our allocation of financial and human resources. This is about investing our money and our time where it matters most, focusing on increasing return on vested capital and enhancing long-term shareholder return. And I believe in benefits we can realize by developing stronger, global strategic sourcing and Lean Six Sigma capabilities. There are companies in and out of the industrial water space of similar size and geographic footprint that do this really well. We're not one of them, at least not yet, but we will be.","Moving beyond our financial and operational objectives for this year, there are 3 top focus areas, ways of doing business, if you will, that are very important to me. I shared these in my Day 1 message to all employees and want to speak about them again briefly to you as well, so you understand what's most important to me. These 3 concepts can be applied to any businesses, but I believe they are particularly applicable to our company.","The first is putting customers at our center. To me, this means listening to customers, understanding them and even anticipating their needs. A lot of companies say they do this, but not all of them do it very well. I often times used the expression keeping our center of gravity squarely around the customer. I know many of Xylem's employees share that same view because I've seen that firsthand over the last few weeks. But we must capture the voice of our customer and integrate it not only in how we sell to and service our customers, but how we tie the voice of the customer into how we innovate, and further expand our portfolio of products and solutions.","The second area is investing in our people. We have very talented people around the world, with expertise and devotion to solving our customers' most critical water issues. We are a recognized market leader because of our people. But more than having expert individuals, our power comes when we operate as a global team, leveraging everyone's important role in what we're aiming to accomplish. I believe in empowering our people to do their jobs. This empowerment includes providing the right training development, as well as honest and constructive feedback around performance to goals. But most important, I believe in providing an environment that ensures everyone's safety. In my experience, strong safety performance almost always coincides with good employee engagement, which ultimately translates into strong financial performance.","The third area involves driving for peak performance. This bears repeating, Lean Six Sigma or Continuous Improvement works. It's important that we embed all these tools in what we do every day. Equipping our people around the world of continuous improvement skills will be a key part of our training and development efforts. It's not lost on me or any of my team that we have faced significant challenges, but I am convinced that we are well on our way to overcoming this. I don't expect that road ahead will be entirely smooth nor should you. But I am excited about the direction we're heading, confident in the future and very excited to be leading this team.","So with that, let me turn the call over to our CFO, Mike Speetzen, to walk you through the results and full-year guidance in more detail. Mike?","Michael T. Speetzen","Thanks, Patrick. Please turn to Slide 5. We generated revenues of $906 million, up 3% from the prior quarter. It's worth noting that we're comparing the first quarter of last year, where we experienced 7% organic revenue contraction. The public utility industrial and residential end-market showed strength relative to poor performance last year.","The public utility end market was up 5%, driven by continued infrastructure investment in emerging markets and while we did have some sizable projects deliver in Europe and the U.S., customers remain focused on operational expenditures and small project activities. Growth of 1% in industrial stemmed primarily from emerging market demand, including the delivery of several projects for the power market in Korea and heavy industry in China.","While the commercial market came in flat for the quarter, residential continues to demonstrate growth, up 6% over the prior year, driven by growth in both the U.S. and emerging markets. I'll cover up more specifics by segment, but generally speaking, we saw strong growth from emerging markets, up 18%, modest growth of 1% and the U.S. was down 1%, most significantly impacted by weather.","We delivered strong operational performance. Operating income of $94 million was up $16 million or 21% over last year, and operating margins increased 150 basis points or 10.4%. The first quarter performance was driven by the increase in organic volume and savings from cost reduction initiatives across our businesses. Cost reductions totaled $31 million and included approximately $10 million of restructuring savings and the balance coming from sourcing and Lean initiatives.","Partially offsetting these tailwinds was inflation of nearly 2% and unfavorable mix due to lower dewatering rental revenue, which stemmed from the severe weather conditions experienced early in the quarter.","Incremental margins were 59%, including the benefit from restructuring savings and unfavorable foreign exchange. Excluding these items, incremental margins were still strong at 42%. EPS expanded 26% to $0.34, better than we anticipated, driven by favorable revenue performance and accelerated cost actions given the slow start to the year.","Core operations drove the year-over-year EPS improvement, contributing $0.10 driven by organic volume growth combined with execution on productivity and cost management, including restructuring savings of $0.04.","Now let me provide more detail on each of our reporting segments. Please turn to Slide 6. Water Infrastructure reported revenue of $568 million, up 4% organically. Additionally, we had 1 percentage point of growth from acquisitions and foreign exchange was a 2-point headwind. We experienced organic growth in all of our applications, with transport up 3%, treatment up 9% and test up 5%, year-over-year.","Regionally, we saw the most significant growth come from emerging markets, which were up 24%. Europe was positive, up 2% and slightly better than our expectations, but was more than offset by the U.S., which was down 6%.","I'll summarize our revenue performance as follows: Growth was driven by Water and Wastewater infrastructure investment in emerging markets, for example, China, which was up more than 50% year-over-year. Increased demand for mixers and project deliveries drove mid-teens treatment growth in Europe that was partially offset by the slow recovery of the U.S. CapEx market. Test was up 5% for the quarter, driven by project shipments into the emerging markets, such as a $3 million order to Brazil's national water agency, ANA, our largest analytics delivery under this region to date. In addition, test had 2 large shipments to China's Ministry of Environmental Protection.","And lastly, our dewatering business was down low single digits, as we lapped a tough compare with Superstorm Sandy and saw the negative impact to our rental business due to the severe weather in the U.S. Operating margin increased 80 basis points from 9.4% to 10.2%, due to increased volume and cost reductions. Restructuring savings of $7 million, coupled with sourcing and Lean initiatives, more than offset the negative effect of inflation, unfavorable mix due to weather impacts on our rental business and foreign exchange.","Let me now turn to Slide #7 and talk to our Applied Water segment. Revenue was up 3% overall, with organic growth at 2%. As you can see, building service applications grew 2%, driven by strength in the U.S. market. Irrigation, while relatively small, was up 7% and industrial water was flat year-over-year.","Regionally, we saw growth across the U.S. and emerging markets which were up 3% and 6%, respectively, while soft market conditions continued in Europe, which was down 4% for the quarter.","I'll summarize our revenue performance as follows: Growth was driven by continued strength in U.S. residential and agricultural markets, while industrial projects in residential investments fueled growth in emerging markets, such as Asia Pacific and the Middle East. While we saw a low single-digit growth in our U.S. commercial building services business, we were flat overall with weakness coming from Europe.","Operating margin expanded 100 basis points from 12.2% to 13.2%, year-over-year. Margin improvement was driven by volume leverage coupled with the favorable impact of cost reductions. Although price was positive, we continue to see downward pressure given current market conditions.","Now let's turn to Slide 8 and I'll cover the company's financial position. Xylem maintained a strong cash position with the balance of $466 million at the end of Q1 and approximately 71% held outside of the U.S., consistent with our geographic business mix. The net debt to net capital ratio is a healthy 26%, and our commercial paper and revolving credit facilities remain in place and continue to be unutilized.","We remain committed to our balance capital deployment strategy, which is to maintain and grow the business, while enhancing shareholder returns through dividends and share repurchases.","During the first quarter, we invested $25 million into capital expenditures, and we returned $74 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, which is up substantially from $37 million in 2013. The increased cap -- return of capital to shareholders was driven by the 10% increase in dividends per share we announced earlier this year and an increase in share repurchases of $36 million.","Free cash flow was a negative $3 million and reflects typical seasonality and working capital dynamics. Relative to the prior year, our free cash flow performance improved by $7 million.","With that said, please turn to Slide 9 and I'll cover our 2014 guidance. This slide summarizes our expected 2014 organic revenue performance by end market. Overall, we continue to see low single-digit growth across the majority of our end markets. Beginning with industrial, our largest end market, representing 45% of our total revenues. In the U.S. the industrial market continues to slow recovery and market reports suggest that demand conditions are generally improving.","In Europe, macro indicators suggest that the market may have bottomed out. And lastly, partially offsetting growth in these regions is a continued weak global mining market.","Public utility at 34% of our total revenues is our second largest market. We continue to expect growth in emerging markets. While we're currently expecting a slow recovery in the U.S. and European CapEx markets, we have seen market indicators, suggesting conditions could be improving. We've already seen some of this activity in our bookings, and we still have a robust pipeline of projects we are actively pursuing. We expect to continue to see strength in maintenance and repair activity.","While we expect building service applications in the commercial and residential markets to be up low single-digits in 2014, commercial growth is expected to come from emerging markets and the successful launch of new products. However, we expect to continue to see soft conditions in the U.S. institutional building market and a slow recovery in Europe.","We seen slightly better performance from residential in the U.S., but anticipate this will subside, as the housing recovery moderates. In Europe, we expect conditions to continue to stabilize and it's also important to note that last year, we posted very strong residential growth, creating a tough year-over-year compare.","Lastly, our bookings and backlog position coming out of Q1 supports a low single-digit revenue growth trajectory. Our backlog position, as a percentage of the balance of full year revenue, is 22%. So while encouraging, we still have to see consistently improving book and bill rates throughout the balance of 2014. I'd also like to note that we are encouraged by the strength in backlog deliverable in 2015, which is up 34%.","Please turn to Slide 10. Let me spend a few minutes covering our full year guidance in detail. We anticipate 2014 revenues in the range of $3.9 billion to nearly $4 billion, which reflects organic growth of 1% to 3%.","For Water Infrastructure, we expect revenues of approximately $2.5 billion, reflecting organic growth of 2% to 3%. And for Applied Water, we expect revenues of approximately $1.5 billion, reflecting organic growth of 1% to 2%.","Segment margins are anticipated to be in the range of 14.1% to 14.6%, and operating margins are projected to be in the range of 12.6% to 13.2%. We anticipate earnings per share of $1.85 to $2, excluding 2014 restructuring and realignment costs of approximately $40 million to $50 million. We expect approximately $15 million of the savings from restructuring to be realized in 2014 from these actions. This is in addition to the carryover savings of $25 million from the actions executed in 2013.","Our operating tax rate is expected to be approximately 21%, and fully diluted share count is expected to be approximately $185 million, which takes into account anticipated share repurchases of approximately $130 million in 2014, of which $50 million has been completed.","Please turn to Slide 11. I'd like to spend a minute calibrating everyone on the call around what we expect our first half and second half revenue and operating income profile to be in 2014. While we do not provide quarterly guidance, we recognize that it's helpful to highlight trends and expectations to assist in modeling.","Revenue, we see the first half representing approximately 48% of our full year, which is consistent with our typical seasonal profile. This reflects sequential growth in Q2 of 8% to 10%, with growth balanced between both segments. While our backlog is up 10% year-over-year, Q2 shippable backlog is up only 3% versus last year, supporting a Q2 organic growth rate range of 1% to 3%.","Operating income performance in the second half will be driven by volume leverage and incremental cost improvements in areas such as global sourcing and Lean. We see second quarter margins improving sequentially from the first quarter by 130 to 170 basis points.","We're on track to deliver the $40 million in restructuring savings, which is equally split between first and second half. Although corporate expense was below the full year run rate, we do anticipate spending between $55 million and $60 million for the year.","In summary, backlog trends are supportive of the 1% to 3% organic growth target, and we're pleased with the progress being made, thus far, on cost reductions to ensure we meet our profit expectations.","With that said, please turn to Slide 12 and let me hand the call back over to Patrick for some final comments. Patrick?","Patrick K. Decker","Thanks, Mike. We delivered a solid first quarter, which gets us off to a good start to the year and we're very excited by the direction Xylem is headed. As Mike indicated, we see stable market conditions and are gaining momentum in orders activity. Operational performance is improving. While we are not where we need to be yet, I am pleased with the progress the team has made and the trajectory we are in. And as I mentioned in my opening comments, we are clear about our focus areas and remain committed to delivering on our financial commitments and recognizing the full potential this company is capable of delivering.","Operator, we can now begin the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Deane Dray with Citi Research.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","That was a nice clean quarter. I had a couple of questions. The first will be on the emerging markets. Seeing an 18% organic revenue is very impressive, as well as the 50% up in China. So if you could just give us some additional color, how much of that -- is it a lumpy business? Are these big projects? Is there any MRO associated with them and then how does that play out the balance of the year?","Michael T. Speetzen","Yes. So thanks, Deane. The 18% growth was terrific and as you indicated, there's definitely project activity that comes with that. And it was pretty balanced across various regions. I think the key point I'd make is that we are anticipating that it will decelerate. We anticipate the full year emerging markets would be in the high single-digits. And so although it will continue to be very positive for the business, we do see it moderating a bit. And as you indicated, we are dealing with some of the project deliveries and saw a couple of those accelerate into the first quarter, which created a little bit of a distortion on growth rate.","Patrick K. Decker","And Deane, I would only -- I would just add that the emerging markets, that whole area in my mind from a strategic standpoint is, I think, a big area of opportunity for us. I'm actually going to be traveling over to Asia for the first couple of weeks of June, to get a number of our markets over there and just get a better feel for the pulse of the business, but I'm very pleased with the quarter. But I'm also very much focused on what the long-term potential is for us in those markets.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And I should have also added, it's -- you'd rather be in a position of explaining why the emerging markets are up so much, rather than the other way around. And the second question, for Mike, I know you alluded the fact that corporate expense came in late this quarter. Maybe if you could calibrate for us what's some of the puts and takes were. I know, from our estimates, it came in like by about $0.025 favorable. So was there some discretionary spending that you pullback and what other puts and takes might there be?","Michael T. Speetzen","Yes, I mean, look there's always puts and takes relative to things like compensation accruals and things like that. But I think, given that we saw the year starting off slow and saw the weather having a pretty heavy impact on our very profitable dewatering business, we made some discretionary decisions around deferring certain costs out of corporate. And that was really consistent with what you've seen us do in the past, where we're keeping a very quick pulse on the business and reacting quickly as well. We do anticipate some of that coming back into the business. So as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we see corporate being in the range of $55 million to $60 million for the year. So you ought to anticipate us being around $15 million to $16 million per quarter.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then -- perfect. Just last one for me, is maybe you can address how the cadence of the quarter played out. You said January and February were light, March came in strong. Can you give it to us on organic revenue growth basis by chance?","Michael T. Speetzen","Yes, so I guess, maybe I'll put it in these terms. When we looked at February, as I mentioned in Patrick's introduction call, we were actually flat year-over-year. And when we looked at how much we had delivered through that point, we were at about roughly $500 million worth of revenue. We were anywhere from 2 to 3 percentage points behind where we have historically been. So by default, March came through a couple of points better than we had originally anticipated and I really give a lot of credit to the teams, given the weather conditions improved into and back out of it. Dewatering, for example, we had seen utilization rates in the low 40s, 40% range in January and February and we saw these utilization rates improve back up into the high 40s. We did not recover the January and February missed revenue, particularly in that business, but the teams really took advantage of the weather being back. We didn't run special promotions or anything like that. The teams just went out and made sure that we were executing on the business.","Patrick K. Decker","Now I would just add, Deane, that I -- having come in the middle of the month and knowing and seeing firsthand the level of focus and intensity the team was placing on this, I was very impressed by how they came together and rather than making excuses, we're really going out and just as Mike said, doubling down and the teamwork across the organization was very impressive, those last 3 to 4 weeks of the month.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Connors with Janney Montgomery Scott.","Ryan M. Connors - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","This question is for Patrick. Patrick, you mentioned the top 3 focus areas on Slide 4 and the #1 focus area there is putting customers at the center. And there's been some level of chatter in the marketplace, maybe some of it opportunistic by your competitors that given the last few years, there's been a lot of distraction, the spinout, multiple changes at the top. Is the fact that, that goes at the top of your list any reflection that you think there is merit to that distraction and now this needs to refocus? Or is something else that you saw on your travels that led you to put that at the top?","Patrick K. Decker","Yes. Well, I appreciate the question. I had to say, first of all, throughout my entire career, it's always been very clear to me that keeping customers at the center is got to be at the forefront for any organization and company. I will then add that I think any organization that is going through a number of changes and transition a company like Xylem has done, naturally, they're going to be magnetic forces that pull people away sometimes from focusing on the customer. But I have been very impressed by what I've seen out at the local level in terms of people's passion for the customer. The whole passion for being very entrepreneurial at a local level and all I'm trying to do here is to really elevate that. You've heard Steve talk in previous calls about the importance of us investing in innovation and that also is very much a centerpiece for me. Because I do think we have opportunities here to again leverage our productivity to invest even more in innovation over time.","Ryan M. Connors - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","And then kind of a related follow-up is just in terms of compensation structures and incentives, both for I guess, in the -- both the manufacturing side of the house and maybe more importantly in the customer-facing side of the house. As you look at the way things are structured, are there any changes or tweaks do you think that need to be made in terms of how the teams are incentivized to drive the business?","Patrick K. Decker","Well, I would say, again, good question. It's early days for me. I mean, it's my seventh week in the organization. Obviously, making sure that we've got the right organizational model in place, which I feel good about in terms of the changes been made here, making sure that the incentive structure is aligned with that, are clearly very much on my radar screen. But I think it's premature for me to comment right now on that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Halloran with Robert W. Baird.","Michael Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","So could we just go through the puts and takes, when looking at the front half of the year versus the guidance for the back half of the year? Obviously, a large portion a little over half of that's going to be just sequential volume uptick that you guys are projecting, but what are some of the other puts and takes there sequentially from a mix perspective, as you see restructuring layering in and any other items like that?","Michael T. Speetzen","Yes, so I think a couple of things, Mike. Restructuring is going to be pretty even throughout the year, it's going to be about $20 million in the first half and the second half. What you really sees is a couple of things and you hit it, it's the volume leverage, as we get into the back half of the year. We're going to end up delivering, call it another $150 million worth of revenue and it's going to have a pretty hard mix in our Water Infrastructure segment, which is we've indicated drops at a pretty high rate. In addition to that, as we laid out in our guidance, we talked about the $100 million worth of cost reductions. It's a little more biased towards the back end of the year. If you look at our first quarter, we got about 22% of the total savings including restructuring. So we're going to end up picking up another $15 million to $20 million in the back half, which is really the work we're doing to accelerate a lot of the sourcing savings that we think the business has the potential to recognize, as well as just getting the Lean projects up and going. So you've got the volume leverage, coupled with higher level of the profitability coming through on the productivity savings.","Michael Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Makes sense. And then on the dewatering platform, obviously, mining is a little bit of a headwind, weather was a headwind in the first quarter. Maybe you could just talk a little bit by end market, what you're seeing there as weather and trends start normalizing and which of these areas or strength are improvement, which areas are still soft?","Michael T. Speetzen","Yes, so and I think you're right. The mining is going to continue to be a headwind, especially in the first half because then we'll start to lap some of other things, we saw playing out last year. For us, the first quarter, and whether it was public utilities or construction, given the freezing conditions, the fact we had, I think over 20 Godwin branches that were shut down due to weather and construction sites being down, we saw that part of the dewatering business down kind of call it mid-single digits. As we go through the balance of the year, we're not anticipating the recovery in mining. We definitely see the construction markets improving, and we'll definitely see public utilities getting back to a more stable environment. I think that will really help, from a mix perspective, back to your first question with the rental business, picking up momentum through the course of the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones with Stifel.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Patrick, hearing your prepared comments, you spent a fair bit of time talking about your philosophy in your approach to management in terms of Lean Six Sigma, voice of the customer. It's probably unfair to ask you about where the opportunities are within Xylem at this point, but could you just expand on that a little bit more and how you intend to draw those changes down through the organization?","Patrick K. Decker","Sure. Again, thanks for the question. I would summarize it as this. As I've traveled around, I've clearly seen some pockets of real strength and excellence, as it relates to the application of Lean Six Sigma and also even in the area of sourcing activity. But I do believe that there's an opportunity for us to make that more consistent in its application to also make it deeper in its application. So, for example, what I've not seen as much of is the application of Lean Six Sigma kind of beyond the 4 walls of the factory. So when you start getting into the sales and marketing area, the R&D area, I've seen pockets of it, but I think, there's more opportunity for us in that area, that will also help us enable to drive growth. In terms of how I go about doing it, again, I think messaging across the organization and making sure that people understand that it is a #1 priority for me is where it starts and also making sure that we are investing adequate resources in terms of training, certification, but also how we deploy the resources across the organization. So there's a multitude of things that I'll be driving in that area, as we go forward. As you know, very well, this is a journey. It's a journey that's never ended, and I think that we are well on the path to realizing it, but there's still opportunity in front of us.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And my follow-up is on the test, strong growth there. You did call out some large projects shipments in that business. Is that something that you're expecting to recur or we expecting to see a moderation of the growth rates there?","Patrick K. Decker","Yes. I think there'll be a little bit of a moderation, as I commented overall from around the emerging markets, with us, up 18% in the first quarter. We're going to see that moderating down into what I'll say is the high single-digits as we move forward. And again, it could move around within the quarters, but at this point, I don't anticipate anything significant for that particular business unit anyway.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Davis with Barclays.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Patrick, I know it's early days, so it's kind of hard to answer some of these questions, I'm guessing. But I wanted to touch on a couple of topics. And first is just the cost base. It was always our understanding at least that the high fixed cost base in Europe needed to be chipped down at. I mean, have you dug into that or at least, have any early read on whether that cost out -- take out the past restructuring, that's already done, but whether that cost base can, in fact, be brought down to better levels? Or do you just need volumes to come back to make that business look better? I guess, it's -- I'll just open it up to that.","Patrick K. Decker","Sure. Yes, well, volume always helps certainly, and we shown, certainly this quarter, that leverage in that volume growth is a great way to expand margins. But my assessment right now is that I think the commentary that's been made in the past around there being a couple of hundred basis points or so of SG&A opportunity that's still in front of us, I think, is very fair. I've seen opportunities as I've traveled around that I do believe, we can drive that number down. In terms of margin expansion, again, I still believe that through, again, some of the Lean work that we can do, there'll be opportunities in that area, as well as we go forward. In terms of any other kind of cost takeout actions, I think, again, there's opportunities there in terms of helping us get this business to that mid-teen margin that's been put out there in the past as a long-term goal.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And then as a follow-up, one thing that was missing in your slides, and again, early days, is really the portfolio and M&A. I mean, how do you think of driving the M&A organization? I mean, do you have to take a backseat for a while, until you make the cultural changes you're looking for, or can you proceed on continuing to look at assets and maybe even potentially getting more aggressive?","Patrick K. Decker","Sure. Yes, well, I think that acquisitions are and definitely will be a key element of our growth strategy in terms of getting our growth rate up to where we have stated we wanted to be. We continued and I've seen the teams continue to cultivate opportunities, even while we've been in this slight pause for a while. And so I think now we've made a lot of progress on the operating improvement actions, obviously, we still have work to do there. That gives me increased confidence in execution. Obviously, we no longer have the lingering questions around CEO change. I'm very pleased the team has maintained a pipeline of candidates and continue to have a strong balance sheet that we can obviously leverage when the time is right. So again, little bit more time for me to spend with the team and of course, the market factors always come in play here and when the right opportunity is available. But I can reinforce that acquisitions will be a key element of our growth strategy.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Summerville with KeyBanc.","Joseph K. Radigan - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","This is Joe Radigan on for Matt. My first question is just a follow-up on an earlier answer. Have you seen the pickup in March? Has that carried through into April so far? I mean, what are you seeing more up-to-date trends?","Michael T. Speetzen","Yes, so we're actually right on the forefront of getting results for the month of April. But based on what we've seen and heard and there's a little bit of softness, some of that's the project deliveries that accelerated into March. But otherwise, we really haven't seen any significant deviation from the trends that we saw in the month of March.","Joseph K. Radigan - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then Mike, I think you said in your prepared comments that you've seen some early signs of the CapEx-related business improving. Was that a U.S. comment or a global comment, and what are you seeing there that kind of gives you more confidence that maybe we could be seen recovery at some point of the horizon here?","Michael T. Speetzen","Yes, I mean, I think, it's between both regions and as you know, Europe is a number of different regions. So we tend to see more of the strength in the, call it, Western and Northern part of Europe. But the reason that we have, I guess, increased confidence is when you look at the backlog that shippable for 2015, it's up 34%. And then when you look at it between the 2 segments, it's actually up over 40% in Water Infrastructure. And so that obviously has some projects that are in emerging markets, but it does also contain the work that we see going on and we've seen it. I'll comment more specifically around the treatment market in the U.S., where last year as you know, we continued to see declines in the order rates. That's impacting our revenues as we get into 2014. But we are seeing order rates starting to pick up that will obviously bode well for 2015. So we're not ready to call that we're out of the woods yet, but it certainly feels like things are moving in the right direction. The bid pipeline is still very active, and we feel like, we're competitively positioned to take advantage of that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Konigsberg with Vertical Research.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Mike, maybe can you just touch a little bit more on price cost, so it was a little bit mixed in the quarter. I know you -- I think, you had some decent opportunities in the second half of '13, maybe it decelerated a little bit in Q1. I just wanted to know what your thoughts were for the remainder of the year, particularly through the channel.","Michael T. Speetzen","Yes. So I think, we saw little price, about 20 basis points in Q1 and it was actually more biased towards Applied Water. Water Infrastructure was essentially flat. It was better than we were anticipating slightly. But I do expect that the competitive pressures that we see in the market are going to still weigh on us through the balance of the year. So the discussion that we had around pricing gain, where from 25 to 50 basis point, headwind for the year still holds. But from a cost standpoint, we're actively pushing from a productivity standpoint. So even though pricing isn't pulling its share of the weight that it was in the past, we've made up for that with not only the restructuring, but also pushing forward more on the sourcing and the Lean savings in the business and creating a nice spread that's going to give us the margin uplift that we need for the year.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","All right. And this just going over to the customer relationship management system. Where are you in that installation process? Are those costs embedded in Q1 numbers and if not, I guess, maybe just touch on the cadence of the spending and potentially even the benefits?","Patrick K. Decker","Yes. So the implementation is really right at the beginning, at the early stages right now. And so the team have been studying alternatives for a while, certainly before I joined and I'm very supportive of the decision that we've made to move forward. It's a big enabler to our whole integrated front-end, getting our sales organizations able to talk to each other, get visibility to what our opportunities are with customers across the portfolio and sharing those leads. Again, the money itself, again, is not going to be incremental to what we've got into before. It's all been embedded in our outlook for the year. But again, at the end of the day, we expect that this is going to have a pretty meaningful impact for us over time in terms of driving top line growth and as well, obviously, margin expansion.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","If I could just ask one more, maybe I'm reading this incorrectly, but it looks like the FX headwind, it was $0.03 headwind in the quarter, but now, it was only a $4 million revenue headwind? How do I reconcile those 2 things?","Michael T. Speetzen","So there's -- so Brian, there's 2 components. There's the translation, which is the smaller impact this quarter. And as we anticipated, we saw a heavier transaction impact and what we do hedge, that only ends up smoothing out the eventual impact that you have from a foreign exchange perspective and we're only hedging about 75% to 80% of the total. For us, it's really around the mix of where you derive revenue and where your costs are based. So not to get into a lot of the details, but we've got a lot of euro base revenue, but a cost base based in Sweden. So you end up with some differential there and then we obviously have a bunch of cross-currency issues with Australia and the Canadian dollar, which have both had been heavily impacted this past quarter. But I think, the key message is this is consistent with we what built into the guidance. We don't see any issues as we go through the balance of the year either.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Just curious, I imagine these are hedges that are put in place, but do you have an offset that hits gross margin a couple of quarters down the line as these things are delivered or is that not really play?","Michael T. Speetzen","No. This is more what actually lives through and what is what I'll call a differential in the cost base. So the hedging handles all the transactional pieces, but over time all that does is smooth you out and if you end up with the imbalance between 2 regions, you're ultimately going to have that impact to your P&L and that's essentially what this is.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of David Rose with Wedbush.","David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","This is a follow-up question on the margin side. I mean, the SG&A was, I think, lower than many of us anticipated. Given the gross margins were essentially flat, how should we think about the gross margin pressure going forward? I think the implication is it's pretty hard to get the leverage there, if sales are flat, on the gross margin side, given what you talked about in terms of pricing. Am I missing something there? And that's I guess, the first part and the second part is, if we think about sort of the, I wouldn't call it aggressiveness, but I think there was, Steve had put it before in a prior call, that the team is more aggressive in seeking out orders and I guess, you're going to be a little bit more competitive on pricing. What is it in terms of comfort level and the backlog, how do you get comfort with that backlog and maybe that question is for both of you, Patrick and Mike, that you don't see further margin pressure in and what's in the backlog?","Michael T. Speetzen","Yes. So on the gross margin, I guess, a couple of comments. One, Q1 was heavily impacted by the fact that we came up a bit short on the dewatering rental and we were a bit overweight to the emerging markets, where we tend to see a little bit lower gross margin in terms of what that revenue comes through. As you know, it's project-based, so it tends to be on the lower end of the margin scale. As we progress through the year, though, a couple of things. One, there is improving mix, as we see the Water Infrastructure business ramp up, that starts as we get into the second quarter. But we're also working on number of initiatives that I've talked to in prior call around the Lean, but also sourcing, where we think that there is more capability to drive sourcing savings throughout the business. And so that would tell you that our gross margin will improve on the year-over-year basis at the full year level, probably around 50-plus basis points, despite what we anticipate as some pricing headwind. On your second question around the orders, it's a good question and it's something that we're pretty active in reviewing all the bid activities. So when you think about that improvement in the backlog that's shippable going out beyond the next year. The review process we have is to make sure that we're bidding at the right level of margins. So given that there is project activity, there's going to be some pricing pressure there relative to what we would see coming through some more of the developed regions. But not a surprise and it's something that we build in, as we think about our cost plans and our margin improvement plans as we go forward. So we're adjusting our cost base accordingly, and I think there is plenty of opportunity for us to continue to see the margin expansion.","Patrick K. Decker","I would just reinforce what Mike said here around, again, the opportunities in global sourcing are very real. And that really has been underleveraged in my view. And so again, the commentary Steven made in past quarters, I think is spot on and we're working hard in that area. And then again, the opportunities around Lean deployment, while those tend to be longer-term, I think there are some near-term opportunities there for the team. The team is working as hard as Mike pointed out, we own the pricing environment that we're operating in and we, again, want to do we can do to really use our productivity to drive growth, both investment, as well as being competitive from a margin standpoint.","Operator","And there are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the floor back over to Patrick Decker for any additional or closing remarks.","Patrick K. Decker","Thank you. Well, as I mentioned in my opening comments, we're very clear about our focus areas and remain committed to delivering our financial commitments and recognizing the full potential of the company is capable of delivering. We are pleased with our performance in Q1. We have a lot of work yet to do to deliver 2014, but we're confident the plans and actions are in place to do exactly that. So again, I want to thank you all for joining today and for your support interest and look forward to connecting to you again in the near future.","Operator","Thank you.

Loranger","Thanks, Phil, and thank you all for joining us this morning. I'm now 50 days into my tenure at Xylem and I've managed to cover a lot of territory. Let me start by saying that I am thrilled by the dedicated team that we have here. And likewise, I'm very excited by the significant growth opportunities in front of us and especially, our team's performance in this third quarter. I'm going to offer a little more detail on what I've seen and how we're prioritizing in a moment, but let's first start with the third quarter results.","We achieved revenue of $965 million, up organically for the first time since the third quarter of last year. We booked orders of $955 million, up 6% organically over 2012. Our view is that some market conditions are showing stabilization and we could see some slight improvement in the European public utility and industrial markets as we look ahead. While we are cautiously optimistic on these markets, we are very proud of our sales teams, who continue to drive hard in this environment. Their focused efforts, along with a slightly improved Europe, were significant factors behind the pickup in revenue and orders this quarter.","Equally important is the progress we're making with improved operational performance. Our operating margin was up 330 basis points sequentially from the second quarter, or up 60 basis points year-over-year. This represents record margin performance for the business since spinning out from ITT 2 years ago. We clearly see the benefit derived from our earlier restructuring actions, and we are delivering better volume leverage. We also drove incremental improvement by executing on the second phase of our European realignment. And these activities have significantly lowered our tax rate. And we also think that our short-term focus on business accountability and cost actions have had a positive effect. The bottom line, we realized 11% earnings per share growth over the prior year, up 36% sequentially from the second quarter.","With a lot of market volatility, we have had some forecasting difficulties. And as a result, we've taken a conservative approach, not unlike our peers and other industrial companies who also see the same challenge. But over the last quarter, we've taken significant steps to improve forecasting, particularly in Europe. We have driven substantial integrated activities to add more financial discipline. And our work continues, we are not finished yet. We have improved our business visibility by streamlining processes, delayering parts of the organization and eliminating complexity.","One of the key impressions I got initially was that we needed to make things simple, enable faster decision-making and clarify accountability. Yesterday, we took a logical step to streamline our European operations and further clarify individual roles. We are eliminating a redundant management level which was created by the overlay of our European regional businesses with our Water Solutions group. Because we now have excellent traction with our integrated front end in both EMEA and Asia, along with strong selling organizations in the Americas, we made a substantial move to strengthen the management of our product-focused businesses. As a result, we are eliminating Water Solutions as an umbrella value center and refocusing on 3 global P&L businesses: transport, treatment and dewatering. These 3, along with Ken Napolitano's Applied Water and Chris McIntire's Analytics units, will all access global markets through our regional selling organizations. This did create some management changes. Colin Sabol, who you know is our Chief Strategy and Growth Officer, will be transitioning to lead our global dewatering business; Chris McIntire, who has done an impressive job running Analytics, will also assume the treatment franchise; and Tomas Brannemo, who was running Global Transport within Water Solutions, will continue to run this as a standalone P&L business. Mike Kuchenbrod, who has been running Water Solutions, will leave Xylem. And I want to take this opportunity to thank Mike for his terrific 25 years of service and dedication to the company.","To close out on the quarter, while we were conservative on the second half, we did deliver a strong third quarter, both with revenue and our operating metrics. We are benefiting from our restructuring and realignment actions and with better visibility, we have more confidence going forward. We do see slightly favorable conditions in emerging markets. The U.S. has remained stable for us. And Europe, albeit still slow, has improved relative to the second quarter. We're cautious in this assessment, but we do think it's slightly more positive. We have begun to prioritize our growth initiatives, continuing to invest for growth in a disciplined fashion in applications and geographies most critical to our vision. We're also targeting increased productivity by our global sourcing initiatives and Lean process improvements in the manufacturing facilities.","And so I am very pleased with our team's second half response to the first half challenges. We expect our businesses to be squarely focused on execution and delivering on their commitments for the remainder of the year. And as a result, we are raising our full year guidance.","Finally, in the third quarter, our board approved our $250 million share repurchase program. Since that approval, we have repurchased approximately 1 million shares and we expect to remain active with this share repurchase program.","Let me now turn the call over to our CFO, Mike Speetzen, to walk through the third quarter results and guidance. Mike?","Michael T. Speetzen","Thanks, Steve. Please go to Slide 4. Xylem's revenues were $965 million, up 4% from the prior year, primarily driven by 1% organic growth and an additional 2% from acquisitions.","Let me provide some perspective on our revenue performance by end market and region. First, in our largest end market, Industrial, organic revenue was up 1%. Europe was up low single-digits due to increased demand for dewatering applications, driven by construction activity in Germany and mining strength in the Nordics. The U.S. was down low single-digits, as slow mining and construction markets were only partially offset by an uptick in demand for frac-ing dewatering applications.","Public utilities also increased 1%, year-over-year, as growth in Asia Pac and Europe offset a low single-digit decline in the U.S. Consistent with past quarters, demand related to CapEx projects remained weak in developed markets, while continue to see stability in demand associated with MRO activities. As developing countries are at an earlier stage of building out and upgrading water and wastewater networks, we continue to see growth in CapEx-related projects, which, for example, is driving strong growth for us in China.","Commercial building services revenue was up 8% compared to the same period in 2012, when revenues were down a similar magnitude. Promotional activities in the U.S. contributed to growth in the face of continued weak end market conditions. Increased construction activity drove favorable results in Europe, while we continued to see strong demand in emerging markets. Residential building services revenue was down 7% year-over-year, driven by a decline in the U.S. groundwater market and continued difficult market conditions in Southern Europe. And lastly, agricultural was up 2%, driven by strength in the Western U.S. states.","Let me spend just a few minutes highlighting our overall geographic performance. Europe grew 1% organically, as strength across most of the region was partially offset by continued weakness in the South. Generally, our performance was significantly better than our previous expectations. This was driven by 3 main factors. First, we saw improved sales execution under the newly integrated European sales organization and from internal sales initiatives, such as Find More, Win More, Keep More. Second, market conditions modestly improved outside of Southern Europe. And lastly, we admittedly had a conservative forecast following the significant decline we experienced in the second quarter.","U.S. was down 1%, driven by the mix and market dynamics I highlighted earlier. And while sequestration and the government shutdown did not have a significant impact on our business overall, they did affect our Analytics platform, which does serve various federal agencies in the research market, which were unfavorably impacted. Emerging markets grew 8% organically in the third quarter, including continued double-digit growth in both Russia and China.","Before turning to our operational performance, I'll highlight that similar to prior quarters, we've excluded restructuring and realignment costs. In the third quarter, we've excluded $20 million of one-time special charges, including the costs associated with the CEO transition, including legal, PR and search fees, and the resolution of legal settlement associated with the use of the Xylem mark. More information regarding the settlement will be provided in our quarterly filing later today.","So now turning to our operating income. We delivered strong operational performance. Operating income of $130 million was up $10 million or 8% over last year. And margins reached 13.5%, our highest mark since spinning out from ITT. As expected, we had strong incremental margins of 29% for the quarter, even after absorbing negative foreign exchange and acquisition impacts, as well as continued investments in the business. Incremental volume leverage offset higher G&A costs for the European headquarters, pension expense and unfavorable mix. Price pressure has become a bigger challenge to our growth and in the quarter, it was a 30 basis point headwind against the overall operating margin improvement. Difficult market conditions, particularly in the public utility, industrial and commercial end markets, have driven overcapacity in the market and, as a result, has lead to a more competitive environment. Looking forward, the pricing environment is likely to remain challenged as long as this economic backdrop persists.","Offsetting the price pressure were cost reduction activities, which drove 350 basis points of margin improvement, including $7 million of restructuring savings from actions executed in 2012 and 2013. Inflation had a 210 basis point negative impact on operating margin, while foreign exchange movements subtracted 10 basis points. In addition, acquisitions were dilutive to margins by 40 basis points as they contributed revenue but no income in this stage of integration.","In summary, operating margins increased 60 basis points despite considerable headwinds from price, a dilutive short-term impact of acquisitions and the investments that we continue to make in order to grow the business over the long term.","Turning to Slide 5. This slide shows our EPS performance for the third quarter. We're reporting $0.49 of EPS, up $0.05 or 11% from the prior year, and 36% on a quarterly sequential basis. Core operations drove strong operating margin improvement, contributing $0.04, driven primarily by organic volume growth, combined with good execution on productivity and cost management. Restructuring savings provided a $0.03 benefit. Ongoing European realignment actions and the associated sustainable tax benefit from a lower tax rate provided a $0.01 benefit in the quarter. These benefits more than offset a $0.02 unfavorable impact of mix and price, as well as one-time separation costs and pension headwind of $0.01.","Now let me provide more detail on each of our reporting segments. Please turn to Slide 6. Water Infrastructure reported revenue of $619 million, up 5% over the prior year on a constant currency basis, and up 1% organically. Acquisitions contributed 4 points to the top line growth. Transport grew 2%, primarily driven by mid single-digit growth in Europe, as strength in Northern and Central Europe more than offset weakness in Southern Europe in the quarter. Transport revenue in the U.S. was flat, as strong demand for dewatering applications, including frac-ing related activity, was offset by declines in CapEx spending.","Treatment revenues declined 2%, as strong double-digit growth in Asia Pac, including China, which was up over 30%, did not fully offset the ongoing weak demand environment in the developed markets. Both the U.S. and Europe continued to experience funding constraints and associated project delays. Our European treatment results were also impacted by the decline in the biogas market and the comparison to 2012,which had strong shipments in the U.K. with the regulatory spending cycle.","And lastly, Test revenues were flat as growth in Europe and the Middle East was offset by sequestration-related softness in the U.S.","Operating margins came in at 15.5%, up 50 basis points year-over-year. We delivered very strong incremental margins despite significant price headwind, unfavorable foreign exchange and acquisition impacts. This also included increased investment in growth initiatives and higher pension expense. With 2% growth in Europe, we benefited from the same factors that drove high decremental margins in Q2, mainly volume leverage versus the fixed costs associated with the European direct sales structure in this segment.","Let me now turn to Slide #7 and talk to our Applied Water segment. Revenue was up 2%, both on a constant currency and organic basis. Building services was up 1% as strong commercial performance discussed earlier was offset by a decline in residential-related sales. In particular, U.S. groundwater sales were weak as market share gains could not offset the decline in the U.S. groundwater market. Industrial water was up 2%. Sales in China were particularly strong on the back of demand for our products used in offshore oil and gas fire pump applications. And lastly, irrigation was up 2%, with the U.S. up 7% as weather conditions continued to drive strong demand in the West. Operating margin was 12.2%, a decline of 40 basis points year-over-year.","While cost reduction initiatives more than offset inflation, lower-priced realization and negative mix drove margins down slightly. Mix was impacted by 2 factors. One, revenue was down 1% in Europe, which is where we carry higher fixed selling costs. And two, we saw a 13% increase in emerging markets, where our margins, in general, are slightly lower.","Now, let me turn to Slide 8 to review our financial position. Xylem maintained a strong cash position with a balance of $394 million at the end of the third quarter, and the majority is held outside of the U.S., consistent with our geographic business mix. Our net debt to net capital ratio is a healthy 27%, and our commercial paper and revolving credit facilities remain in place and continue to be unutilized. We remain committed to our balanced capital deployment strategy, which is to maintain and grow the business while enhancing shareholder returns through dividends and share repurchases.","Year-to-date, through the third quarter, we've invested $172 million into acquisitions and CapEx. Additionally, we've returned $107 million to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases, up substantially from $58 million in 2012. The 2 key drivers here were the 15% increase in dividends we announced earlier this year and the ramp-up of share repurchase activity.","Free cash flow was $72 million year-to-date and while down from the prior year, remain strong and at a level consistent with our capital deployment strategy. The decline in free cash flow year-to-date versus the same period of 2012 is driven by lower income, unfavorable working capital and higher restructuring payments. As a percentage of revenue, operating working capital increased 170 basis points, driven by a number of factors this quarter. First, we had a particularly strong September, relative to the rest of the third quarter, which resulted in a higher level of receivables that we expect to collect in the fourth quarter. In addition, we continue to hold higher-than-normal levels of inventory in order to compensate for shorter customer lead times. And finally, customer payment times continue to be elongated, although we have not experienced any significant bad debts associated with these length in payment durations.","Please turn to Slide No. 9, and I'll cover our guidance update in detail. As Steve mentioned earlier, we're revising our full year guidance to reflect our strong third quarter performance and the anticipated improvement driven by internal growth and cost savings initiatives. As you can see from the chart, we are raising our full year revenue expectations by $50 million, which brings our full year revenue projections up to $3.8 billion. As I mentioned earlier, this revision includes our third quarter results, which was approximately $35 million of revenue and $0.10 of EPS better than we expected. The additional $15 million of revenue and $0.08 of EPS is attributable to our improved outlook for the fourth quarter.","With respect to revenue, our guidance implies fourth quarter organic growth of 1% and reflects what we think are stabilizing conditions we have seen in Europe, particularly with the public utility and industrial markets, partially offset by lower revenue from residential applications in both the U.S. and Europe. In addition, we have assumed continued growth in emerging markets and the conditions in the U.S. do not improve from what we've seen in the past quarter. We're increasing our EPS guidance by $0.18 at the midpoint, which is driven by an increased focus on execution and continued disciplined cost management. Let me point out that our guidance reflects the fact that we are on track to deliver the restructuring realignment benefits and incremental cost savings I discussed in our last earnings call.","In summary, we now expect full year revenue of approximately $3.8 billion and EPS in the range of $1.60 to $1.65.","Please turn to Slide 10. Let me highlight just a few items I haven't covered yet. First, we still expect free cash flow conversion to be approximately 90% of net income. We anticipate a normal seasonal increase in free cash flow generation and conversion on our last quarter of the year, coupled with higher receivable collections resulting from the strong sales we experienced in September. Our operating tax rate is expected to be 21% for the year, consistent with our previous guidance. This is indicative of the progress against the realignment initiatives we started earlier this year. We expect our share count to be approximately 186 million for the full year calculation, but down to 185 million for purposes of the fourth quarter. This reflects the impact of approximately $25 million deployed towards repurchases during the third quarter and an assumed similar outlay with our approved program in the fourth quarter. And lastly, we expect restructuring and realignment costs to be in the range of $65 million to $80 million.","With that, operator, we can now begin the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Deane Dray with Citi Research.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Steve, welcome back to the front lines.","Steven R. Loranger","Thank you, Deane. It's great to be back.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","All right, so I wanted to hit you with the first question, and this is kind of like a high-quality problem, to have to answer this question. And it's, how would you characterize the upside this quarter? I mean, we've gotten some of the nitty-gritties in terms of where the upside is -- how it has been reported, but maybe you can characterize it. Is this too much conservativeness in the previous guidance? Is this a catch-up from some of the second quarter? And -- or are we at this meaningful inflection point where we're now seeing some projects being released?","Steven R. Loranger","Deane, the real answer to that question is all of the above. And we had a number of dynamics occurring, which came together nicely. First and foremost, I think that previously, Gretchen and the team have done a really nice job in the summertime of outlining the necessary cost reductions that were needed to make the third and fourth quarter, with a relatively sluggish top line. The teams executed against those cost benefits. So we certainly got every bit of what we're looking for. Second of all, there had been some ongoing restructuring, as you know, in the 2012, 2013, time frame, and that's coming through. We did see some slight favorability in markets, although we're not going to forecast any real trend here, these markets have been moving around. But certainly, the markets were a little bit favorable, but we also had our sales teams out there really working hard. We put a lot of pressure to go get the order and focus, and the teams did a good job. And then finally, there was certainly some conservatism. When the July forecast was announced, the team really wanted to make sure that we had a number that we could make. So it really was all of the above. You take a little conservatism out of it, and what I'm mostly pleased about, is just really the operating performance of the teams, both on the sales line and the operational execution line.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Great. And then just as a follow-up, make sure I understood some of the nuances here within the realignment. And if you could just clarify about Water Analytics. Because, Steve, when you put this business together back in ITT, you talked about the transportation -- or transport, treatment and test, the 3 Ts of water. And so analytics seems to be not one of the cornerstones within the 3 businesses. So just clarify where Water Analytics is.","Steven R. Loranger","Okay, fine. First of all, on transport and treatment and dewatering, the purpose of associating all those underneath the umbrella of what was water, wastewater and later water solutions, was less about the relatedness of operations and the product technology, and more about the ability for Water Solutions to enable access to a global market. So in the presence of our integrated front end, which is we've essentially migrated in most of our regions, we now can go back, with respect to running really, really efficient product businesses in those dimensions. Analytics or Test remain separate underneath Chris McIntire, and as part of this -- as it has been. So there's no change there. But as part of this, Chris has been doing an outstanding job, and there is some more relatedness with some of the treatment technology and some of the tests. And we invited Chris to be the leader over both of those franchises.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","That's terrific, okay. That's still part of this. So we should think of it as part of the Treatment division?","Steven R. Loranger","Well, think about Chris McIntire as leading both the analytics\/test and the treatment businesses now yes.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, that makes all kinds of sense. And just a special shout-out, that's great to see Colin getting an operating role.","Steven R. Loranger","And we're thrilled by the change in leaderships. Operator?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matt Summerville with KeyBanc.","Matt J. Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","I think, Mike, on Slide 10, you talked about the net cost savings in '13 being in the range of $14 million to $15 million. Based upon what you're doing this year and anything left over from '12, if you will, what would be the incremental cost saving benefits that we should expect for '14, based on stuff done as of year end -- as of the end of the year here?","Michael T. Speetzen","So we -- consistent with what we've talked in the past, there's a few components to that. First, the carryover restructuring is going to be in the range of about $15 million. In addition to that, as we guided, there were still some one-time spend costs that we were dealing with this year. The 2 biggest drivers being IT-related costs, as well as moving our corporate headquarters, and that's about $5 million. So those 2 items gave about $20 million. And then as we indicated in our last discussion, there's an additional $15 million related to the cost actions that we're taking here in the second half that will play out into 2014. And what I would say is, Steve talked to it a little bit in the upfront comments, we're continuing to work for more. I think the key component that we want to signal is, even with a flat top line in 2014, we feel confident we can deliver EPS growth in 2014.","Matt J. Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And then just one sort of follow-up on what you're doing, at least in the near term, from a cost standpoint. I mean, have you cannibalized any growth investments? Have you substantially throttled back discretionary spending? Can you talk about maybe some of the more temporary levers you may or may not be pulling right now?","Michael T. Speetzen","Yes, there's a couple of things. I mean, one, we're clearly seeing a lower level of inflation, and that has helped. I mean, we've gone from some just under 3% in the first quarter. We're down near around 2% in the third quarter. So there's a been little bit of help from that. But there's certainly been a mixture. I would say that there were some short-term measures that we took. Nothing, from my perspective, that's damaging the business. I think it was prudent cost management in light of a volatile top line. But we are also working right now to identify what are more permanent cost reductions, as we head into 2014, as Steve highlighted. We've got opportunities around global sourcing, we've got opportunities around the Lean and Six Sigma avenues relative to our business. And the other key point I'd make is we continue to invest in the business. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, it continues to be a slight headwind relative to margin performance through the third quarter. So one thing we've made sure of is we're not going to do anything that damages the long-term potential of the company.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Davis with Barclays.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Can you guys talk a little bit about what you're looking for in a new CEO? I mean, are you looking for a restructuring person? Are you looking for somebody with water experience? And just give us a sense of what type of profile you're looking for.","Steven R. Loranger","Well, first of all, the CEO search is well underway, and I don't have anything definitive to say there. But clearly, Xylem is a company that has just terrific global assets. You guys know about our technology, our market and customer reach around the world and some really, really good supply chains. And we think that clearly, the opportunities in front of the company are every bit as rich as they were when we created the spinout. So the notion about having a very, very strong global product business that can access these markets and become greater than the sum of the parts, is still in the front of our minds. And clearly, a CEO who has the leadership, the vision and the track record of experience in that dimension would be first and foremost.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, fair point. When you think about, Steve, what's happened over the -- since the spinoff, clearly Xylem has been the most disappointing of the 3, and arguably had the most promise, really. What's gone wrong? Are you just behind -- did the restructuring come too late for the slow global macro? Just give us a sense of the playbook to kind of what went wrong, so we can get a better sense of what you're going to change in the near term.","Steven R. Loranger","Well, I think focusing on where we're going in the future is really responsive to that question. We clearly have had some challenges with these markets. And we have such a broad portfolio. I think what we do need to do is to focus and re-prioritize both our investments and growth activities in a way that can create more total value. As an example, we really do like the Flygt product line. That's been a fabulous product line. We're going to be increasing some investments in that to continue to drive competitive advantage in the transport segment. The same thing in the analytics and the emerging markets, as Mike had mentioned. The operative component there is to really prioritize those investments where they make -- where they matter the most to execute our vision around Let's Solve Water. So that's a big piece of, I think, where we need to go in the future. The second big piece really just has to do with the structure and efficiency of the company. I mean, with these markets, we have diluted operating margin, as you well know. And the team collectively have come to the conclusion that we simply need to get back up to the level of operating metrics, that we know that we're capable of, in a hurry. And so that really induces strategies like a global strategic sourcing organization of simplified and streamlined, product-line focused, an integrated front end that, quite frankly, not only is more capable than the independent selling organizations, but it can -- has the potential of being more efficient. And so that's a lot to talk about, but it has to do with de-leveling, organizational simplicity and clarification. And I think all those things are going to go into the operating efficiencies that we know are possible in front of us.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Konigsberg with Vertical Research.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Maybe first, just with Mike, just trying to get a better sense of how the quarter, particularly in infrastructure, Water Infrastructure, progressed sequentially. You had decent or modest top line growth on a quarter-over-quarter basis, and the drop-through to operating profit was just pretty extraordinary. I know you had sequentially, I think, you were suggesting $10 million, $11 million or so of incremental restructuring benefits hitting Q3 versus Q2. But even kind of removing that, you're looking at close to 100% drop-through of the revenue. Maybe can you just talk about were there other factors, what the other contributing factors were there, so we get a sense of how that played out.","Michael T. Speetzen","Actually, this gets back to, I think, one of the questions that was asked earlier in terms of the conservatism in the forecast. I guess a couple of comments I'd make is, when we put our guidance out after second quarter, the one thing we were looking at is we were looking at July results, which were relatively weak and supported a -- obviously, a much lower view of the trajectory we were headed on. So I think the first statement I'd make is the momentum started to build towards the end of July. And then clearly, as we got into August, it got a little bit more difficult to see, just given the dynamics that go on in Europe. But it was clear that we were pulsing at a level that would suggest that we were going to have stronger revenue performance. I think given the dynamics we were facing, one of the things that we did is not only did we have the cost actions identified, we had outlined what we called an EPS assurance plan. So essentially, we had identified additional cost activity to basically go and execute if the revenue didn't materialize. So essentially, we ran a scenario that said, what if we're flat sequentially for the first to second half? What would we need to do to ensure that we got to our EPS range? So when I look at what happened in the third quarter, we got the revenue growth that was targeted, albeit, it came a little bit late in the quarter. And we also executed on the additional cost actions, and so you got the double benefit of those. And then you're obviously correct in the restructuring kicked in substantially in the third quarter, and we've been signaling that throughout the first half relative to all the activities that we undertook in the first and second quarter, relative to primarily what is our European realignment.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Okay. And then just secondly, Q4 revenues at $965 million. So flat sequentially. I think typically, we've seen over the last several years when you roll everything up, you did have anywhere between a 5% and a 15% uptick on a sequential basis, but you're looking for flat now. Is that -- and also I think you've spoken before about the utility and municipal spending being very Q4 loaded. Is that some conservatism there, or was there some pull forward of revenue into Q3 from Q4? If you could touch on it, that would be helpful.","Michael T. Speetzen","Yes. I wouldn't characterize it as a pull forward, but definitely, we saw a very strong third quarter. Quite frankly, it was actually opposite of what we've typically seen, which is third quarter drops from the second quarter. So admittedly, there is a little bit of conservatism in the fourth quarter. If you look at the upper end of our range, it's more indicative of what you would typically see in terms of the seasonality uplift. The one comment I would make is, our backlog position going into the fourth quarter has increased about 13% from what we had going into the third quarter. So that's obviously a very good indicator and gives us confidence. But at the same time, as Steve highlighted, these markets have been volatile. We've been dealing with this for the past 1.5 year, and it's too early to call it a trend. We're optimistic and we'll continue to drive, and if it's there, we're going to get it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Maczka with BB&T Capital Markets.","Kevin R. Maczka - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Can we just go back to visibility, in general, that you have and the forecasting issues, Steve, that you mentioned? I understand having a conservative forecast coming off a bad June and early July, like you did as we went into Q3. But are there actual forecasting issues that you had that have now been fixed? I think you mentioned Europe in the context of your new management change. But can you just address that? What's different or improved that allows you, going forward, to have better visibility and then allows investors to have more confidence in the guidance that you're giving?","Steven R. Loranger","Well, thank you. The forecasting issues that I talked about were principally in the creation of an integrated regional business and the integrated front end, particularly in Europe, to some degree in some of the other regions. Where in order to make that effective and put the accountability out at the point of sale, there was a lot of moving parts internally on the forecast with respect to things like transfer pricing and cost allocations. And so we just finished about 9 months of organizational change in that area, which made it difficult to see as clearly as we wanted to. We've had outstanding actual cost and revenue visibility, but that's always where we're looking. So quite frankly, it was just a lot of financial discipline, some blocking and tackling, refining of formats and processes and understanding of things like cost allocations and transfer pricing levels that, to some degree, have been -- with good financial work with Mike and his team, have just kind of gone through the system. So not that we are finished in that area, but we do feel better. Mike, do you want to add to that?","Michael T. Speetzen","Yes, I guess the only thing I'd add is the organizational change that Steve talked about, I think, puts us closer to the point of impact and being able to see the inner workings of the business. Because the thing I'll go back to is, we are improving visibility and our ability to have good financial discipline, but our business is heavy short-cycle. And so it's important for us to be close to those trends to understand what's going on in the marketplace on a real time. And we go into any given quarter with less than 50% of our shipments sitting in backlog. And so I think that's always an important piece to keep in mind. But I think the discipline, the financial changes that we've made, I think the organizational change that Steve announced, is going to put everything closer to the point of impact, and I think we'll have a lot greater visibility and accountability.","Kevin R. Maczka - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay. And if I can just follow up. In terms of the short-cycle nature, Mike, I think last quarter, we were still talking about de-stocking at your distributors and that's a big chunk of your business, seeing smaller orders and less frequent orders and therefore, you're carrying more inventory. So in the context of your bookings being better now and the momentum starting to build in late July, are you seeing any notable change on that front?","Michael T. Speetzen","I wouldn't say any notable change. I would say, in our dewatering business, we saw the distributors start to restock. We had been dealing with them de-stocking for the past couple of quarters. And I think that's shown up in the positive results we've seen in our dewatering business, which is -- has been on a nice, steady growth trajectory. And I'd say, in our commercial segment, there's clearly been a strong performance there. Resi continues to be -- it was down for us here in the third quarter. The groundwater market, we're primarily servicing the well water market, as well as boiler circulators, and we've seen a little bit of downward movement there. But I wouldn't characterize that we've seen some big shift, and I would not anticipate, in the near term, seeing the distributors go back into a significant restocking mode.","Operator","You next question comes from the line of Chip Moore with Canaccord.","Chip Moore - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","With increased emphasis on redeploying some capital back to shareholders, can you just talk about how that impacts your thoughts around M&A? And then as you look out at longer-term targets, if you do see acquisitions coming in at less than that, call it, 2.4% range or organic growth a little below, do you think you can make that up through better execution and operating performance here?","Steven R. Loranger","Well, most certainly, we think the very best acquisition that we have in front of us right now is Xylem's stock. So you can expect us to continue to deploy there. Also, we have had some operating concerns, as we've been talking about the whole call, and we thought it prudent to take a pause on some of the actual acquisitions. We're continuing to cultivate and we still have a rich pipeline. And to the note of your question, yes, with respect to some of the operating metrics we're forecasting in free cash flow generation, we will be able to continue to redeploy capital in the share repurchase and generate capacity for the acquisitions. And we expect, over the next quarter or so, as things settle down, we'll get back into the market. We're actually committed to meeting our long-term targets that you're all aware of in terms of operating margin, EPS and ROIC. So that's all highly intact.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Rose with Wedbush Securities.","David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","I was hoping I could follow up a little bit on Europe, sort of the upside surprise for the quarter for -- at least for us. Maybe you can walk us through in terms of the -- what you're seeing in Europe. Were a large number of orders just released? Was there a push? And then maybe you could talk about, I think you've implied that there was a push for orders in September. Was that Europe, was it across the board? And what's the implication for margins going forward? Was that at the expense of margins, or is it really kind of what we've been seeing?","Steven R. Loranger","Yes, so let me talk just a little about the -- I'd say, the overarching dynamics around Europe. I mean, we certainly had seen some dynamics, as I talked about in the last call, around public utilities pulling back. And as evidenced by our overall aftermarket performance, which was up low single-digits, we've seen a return to, well, say, a more normal pattern around the break fix, the operating maintenance, from a public utility standpoint. In the industrial side, I think there was a de-cycling there in the first half, and I think with more positive signs in Europe, in general, we've seen things -- I wouldn't say that I'd call it a recovery. I would say things are just starting to move again. And then certainly, the construction market has been favorable, specifically in areas like Germany. And that's helped our commercial business, as well as our dewatering business as we look at those dynamics. From a margin standpoint, I guess I'd say a couple of things. One, with the recovery in Europe, that's actually helped because as I mentioned, we've got impacted pretty heavily in the second quarter, given our fixed cost structure in Europe, which is, on average, 7 to 10 points higher from an SG&A standpoint because of our direct selling channel. Obviously, with the return of volume in Europe, that helps us more than cover those costs, and you saw that come through in the third quarter results. The one dynamic we are facing, which we talked a little bit about in my prepared remarks, is pricing. That is causing some top line pressure to the tune of about 30, 40 basis points in the third quarter. I don't think that it's anything atypical of what the competitors are seeing either. So I don't think there's any distortions in the market, nor do I think we've done anything to gain volume. But I do think that's going to continue to be a headwind for us. I think just given the overcapacity across public utility in the industrial space, that's going to continue to weigh a little bit on margins. But as Steve indicated, we've got ample opportunity to go out and drive improvements in our sourcing, in our Lean, value-based, Six Sigma. So we'll be able to go out and use that as an advantage to offset some of those headwinds.","David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Mike, that's helpful. And I was also trying to see if there was any sort of -- and I think you made some commentary around potential pull forward, but when you -- when Steve mentioned the push for orders in September, did that mean at lower margins, were there some sort of special terms? Was anything unusual or different that took place in September that would have taken place in any other month?","Michael T. Speetzen","We had some marketing initiatives. Like in our standard care and mixer lines, we introduced some new products and went out with some attractive new programs. But for the most part, I'm just going to say it was disciplined blocking and tackling, and getting the sales teams focused on winning more. Colin and Joe Vesey and the team have been driving a program called Find More, Win More and Keep More, which is just a series of classic, good, strong marketing activities. And they've been deploying that, and I think we've got some benefit from it.","David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Did you see the momentum continue in October?","Michael T. Speetzen","Yes, we've seen -- the comment I gave you about October is our performance from a booking standpoint has roughly been in line with the guidance that we've provided. So we've not seen anything substantially shipped in the month of October.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jim Krapfel with Morningstar.","James Krapfel - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","How much industry overcapacity do you think there is in public utilities and industrial? In other words, how much demand do you think would have to improve to bring pricing back to more normalized levels?","Steven R. Loranger","It's hard to say that, but it's got to be several percentage points. If you just -- one way to think about it is, you go back to the 2007, 2008 timeframe and figure that the industry was probably at pretty full capacity at that point in time. And you could sort of subtract from that, what the gross markets have done since then, and probably divide that difference in half to get to the answer to your question. The half being that companies have taken out some capacity on these downsides, but not all of that.","Michael T. Speetzen","And, Jim, the only thing I'd add to that is if you look at just the U.S. water and wastewater spend as a proxy for what Steve was just walking through, it's down to levels that go back to say, 2004. And so, I think that gives you an indication of what we need to start to happen, which is essentially, we'd need to start to see fully embodied projects released. That's meaning, not just treatment projects, but projects that include transport products, pumping primarily.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Stewart Scharf with S&P Capital IQ.","Stewart Scharf - S&P Capital IQ Equity Research","You have obviously leading positions in many markets: transport, industrial, water, tests, building services, and regarding the pricing. And are there any of those areas where demand might be more inelastic, where customers you have a relationship with, where they'll stay and not base their decisions totally on price?","Michael T. Speetzen","Yes, I think -- and Stewart, I think you have to almost take it segment-by-segment. I'd say that our applied water business probably has a little bit tighter curve. When you look at our Flygt business, our direct selling channel, I think gives us some ability to leverage. But again, I'm going to point back to the overcapacity in the industry, I think, has put all the competitors in a position where every bit is being competitively quoted. And so I think that's putting some pressure from a top line standpoint. Clearly, from a project business perspective, given the fact that projects are down some 15% to 20% from the height, pricing is extremely competitive and quite frankly, the fact that things are not converting from bid to actual order is indicative of the fact that folks want to have another 1 or 2 looks at pricing.","Steven R. Loranger","Some of our premier brands, such as Flygt, we probably can get some good price just simply because we represent some very high quality. But with the question earlier about some slight overcapacity in these markets, we've got great competitors out there that we're very respectful of and everyone's working hard. So price is going to continue to be an issue. But that just merely underscores the comments I made earlier about the necessity for us to drive higher levels of operating efficiencies. What I mentioned this global strategic sourcing group we're going to be establishing, that is in part in effect now, but we're going to make a holistic global group out of it. We're going to be able to substantially improve our net productivity in the areas of sourcing. That'll start adjusting our cost base in ways that are going to address some of the front end pressures. So that's why we're working on that side of the equation as well.","Well, with that -- operator, is there anybody else in the queue?","Operator","We do have a follow-up question from the line of David Rose with Wedbush Securities.","David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","I'm sorry, I did have a follow-up question on your inventories, the jump in inventories for the quarter. Can you just give us a little bit more color if that was raw materials, finished goods, was it in Europe, where did it come from? It's kind of a big jump.","Michael T. Speetzen","Yes, I mean, there's a couple of areas, but I'd say, we're -- as I've indicated in the past, I mean we've probably impacted our inventory turns by 0.2, 0.3, in an effort to make sure that we can deal with what has been relatively volatile dynamics around the inventory delivery requirements. So it's pretty equally weighted across the businesses. And from a geography standpoint, David, I don't know that I could isolate it to one particular area. It is an area of focus. I mean, Steve and I, clearly, are not happy with the inventory, and broadly, the working capital levels that we're at today. So it's a key area of focus for us. We're going to continue to monitor it. And hopefully, as the market starts to return to some level of growth, that'll give us a little bit of pressure to be able to take some of that inventory out of the system as lead times start to move back into something that's more reasonable versus the very short nature that they are today.","David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","And just to be clear, if the business was a -- started to get little bit better than you expected, I would have assumed that you would have been running pretty lean on inventory, given your guidance. So was there some sort of makeup at the very end and as you've got inventory out?","Michael T. Speetzen","Well, I mean, like I said, we started to see order rates improving in the month of August. And I'd say that the teams were moving quickly to make sure that they were able to satisfy the promotions that we were putting out into the marketplace, as well as to support to Find, Win, Keep initiative that we had underway. So I think in light of what was a pretty disappointing level of performance in Q2, we were doing everything we could to make sure that if an order came in, we were in a position to satisfy it.","David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay. So the 90% free cash flow conversion seems fairly reasonable then, by year end?","Michael T. Speetzen","Yes, I think so. I mean, we had some dynamics with the way the receivables came in at the end of the quarter. But that's not too out of the normal for what we see at the third quarter point.","Operator","That was our final question. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Steven Loranger for any additional or closing remarks.","Steven R. Loranger","Well, thank you. And let me summarize what I hope everyone has ultimately taken away from this call. We do have a lot of work in progress. We're going to stay focused on doing the basics well. And clearly, we've got a lot of work in front of us. We have faced some real challenges and those challenges are not going to subside anytime in the future, but we do have the foundations, the tools and the global assets. We've got some great technology, premium brands, terrific applications, expertise with comprehensive selling and distribution channels. And I can tell you, we've got some of the greatest, talented employees of any company in our space. So we've got these assets and collectively, we will eventually overcome some of these challenges and help realize our vision. We do have 3 priorities right now. First and foremost, it should come as no surprise, we've got the entire organization working to achieve the 2013 commitments. Second, we are prioritizing our strategic initiatives to drive more top line growth, as I outlined. And finally, we're focusing both our strategy and our operating framework to accelerate and increase shareholder value, not only in 2013 and beyond. So we've taken some decisive actions to improve our performance in the face of these ongoing challenges. And I believe there's a lot that we can still do to perform better and grow faster across the businesses. And our commitment, as you would expect, is we will move as quickly as we can to make all of that happen. So with that, I want to thank you for your participation and we look forward to talking with you next quarter.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's conference call.

With me today are Chief Executive Officer, Patrick Decker; and Interim Chief Financial Officer, Shashank Patel. They will provide their perspective on Xylem\u2019s quarterly results and discuss the full-year outlook for 2015.","Following our prepared remarks, we will address questions related to the information covered on the call.

Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to our CEO, Patrick Decker.","Patrick Decker","Thanks, Phil, and thank you all for joining us today. We have a number of items to cover this morning but before we get started, I\u2019d like to address the news regarding our Chief Financial Officer transition that we announced earlier this month. First, my sincere thanks to Mike Speetzen for his many contributions to the company over the past six years.","As many of you know, he played a key role throughout the separation process from ITT, providing strong leadership for the financial organization as well as broadly across the business. We wish Mike and his family the very best as they transition to a great new opportunity at Polaris.","I would also like to recognize and thank Shashank Patel, who is here with us this morning for quickly stepping into the role of CFO on an interim basis. With nearly two decades of experience at ITT and Xylem, Shashank has deep knowledge of our many businesses and is a highly respected finance and operational leader. He has been able to hit the ground running and help facilitate a smooth transition which is allowing us to proceed with a disciplined, thorough search for a permanent successor.","Now let\u2019s turn to the current market environment. Our second quarter results and finally our outlook for the balance of the year. The combination of our uniquely diversified portfolio along with strong execution, enabled us to deliver solid results in the second quarter. I am pleased with our team\u2019s ability to perform well in a challenging environment, increasing long-term backlog, continuing to gain share, and taking cost actions to mitigate pricing pressures.","In our Applied Water Systems business turned in another record operating margin performance. In addition, we are encouraged by what we\u2019re seeing in key end markets. The commercial market for example generated solid growth over the first half of the year, and we anticipate growth to accelerate in public utility during the second half.","However, market conditions do remain mixed. The industrial market broadly speaking is challenged. As we\u2019ve noted previously, the significant downturn in the oil and gas sector, is shaving an unfavorable direct impact on our dewatering business. As that downturn has persisted, the impact has expanded to other industrial sectors that are currently served by dewatering. That said dewatering is a very attractive business with a compelling historical growth profile, but we currently are working through some near-term market challenges.","Looking ahead, our focus remains centered on executing our long-term strategy and delivering on our commitments. I am confident that we\u2019re well-positioned to weather the near-term headwinds and generate solid results within the range of expectations we previously announced. As you saw on our press release this morning, we have narrowed the range of our full-year outlook to reflect our latest view.","Now let\u2019s review our results. Orders in the quarter were up 1% organically against record bookings last year. We continue to build backlog, exiting the quarter with just over $800 million in projects. Notwithstanding that, we\u2019re still primarily a book and term business. I am encouraged by the strong execution that resulted in an increase in our sequential backlog, shippable beyond this year by nearly 40% in the quarter.","Let me highlight a few project examples. We recently won a $6 million rental contract for Godwin Pumps for the Panama Canal expansion project. As many of you know, the expansion project will double the Canal\u2019s capacity and allow even larger vessels to utilize this waterway. Our dewatering pumps are being used to fill the new lock basins with nearly 2 billion gallons of water as part of a testing phase for this new system. This is a very complex application that needed tremendous technical expertise and the team will very quickly to meet the customers\u2019 tight timeline. On our call last quarter, I discussed one of our innovative water reuse pilot projects in California where interesting water reuse continues to grow.","This past quarter Xylem was commissioned to deliver a unique water reuse solution, Island Water Reclamation Plant in Los Angeles. Our advanced oxidation process from Wedeco will be used to ensure that the plant complies with California\u2019s stringent groundwater recharge regulations for indirect potable reuse.","Finally, an example in the Middle East. Ashghal, the Public Works Authority of Qatar has commissioned the construction of a new wastewater treatment plant in Al Dhakhira, northeast of the capital city of Doha, included in this plant will be a 56,200 cubic meter per day capacity water reuse facility.","In addition to our flight pumps and mixers, our state-of-the-art reuse technology including products from Leopold, Sanitaire and Wedeco were selected for this new plant. We expect to deliver product for this project in both 2016 and early 2017.","Shifting back to the second quarter results. Organic revenue growth in the quarter was 1%. We generated growth of 3% in our Applied Water segment including double-digit increases in China and Latin America as well as continued strength in the U.S. commercial building sector. The Water Infrastructure segment was flat for the quarter primarily due to a decline in our dewatering rental services business, which serves the U.S. and Canadian oil and gas market.","We expect these oil and gas sector headwinds to continue, but we are working to minimize the overall impact in the near-term. For example, we currently are redeploying assets to regions where they can be utilized and at the same time help us to expand our international dewatering presence. Partially offsetting these near term challenges is growth in other key applications, including our water and wastewater pump business.","We are capitalizing on our strong offering, and well-earned reputation to outgrow the underlying market and increase share. During the quarter, our business posted mid-single and double-digit growth in the U.S. and Europe respectively. Again, this is an encouraging indicator [Technical Difficulty] utility end market is stable and likely moving into an upward trend.","Our adjusted operating margin was flat year-over-year, excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. The increase savings generated through continuous improvement actions preserve profitability, offsetting inflation and unfavorable mix resulting from the declines in dewatering rental services.","During the quarter, our new centralized procurement team was able to leverage our global scale in key categories to drive nearly $20 million in cost savings. This team, which commenced late last year, is continuing to expand the universal spend categories that it targets, in order to reduce the consolidated Xylem spend. I\u2019m very pleased with our contributions today.","At the bottom-line, we delivered earnings per share of $0.43, up 2% year-over-year excluding the impact of foreign exchange translation. Considering the muted top-line growth and unfavorable mix, we were pleased with our team\u2019s ability to deliver earnings in line with expectations for the quarter. And finally, we also improved free cash flow generation, up 21% year-over-year for the quarter.","Now let\u2019s turn to slide four. I\u2019ll briefly summarize our outlook for 2015, and on the next slide, I\u2019ll outline the changes relative to our previous guidance. We now anticipate 2015 organic revenue growth of 1% to 2% for the full year. Our adjusted operating margin is expected to grow in the range of 40 basis points to 60 basis points. We are narrowing the range of our adjusted earnings per share guidance to $1.82 to $1.87 for the full year.","We now expect year-over-year EPS growth in the range of 4% to 7% excluding the year-over-year impact of foreign exchange translation. Finally, we\u2019ll continue to execute a discipline approach to capital deployment, which is still expected a result in a 100% free cash flow conversion.","With that, let\u2019s turn to slide five, and I\u2019ll provide some additional color on the outlook. We are reducing the top end of our full year revenue outlook by approximately one point of organic growth or $40 million. This reflects the incremental weakness in our dewatering business. While the dewatering rental declined then the oil and gas market generally remain in line with our previous expectations.","We are seeing incremental unfavorable impacts on our distribution partners. This is a result of a weaker industrial CapEx market, as well as the prolonged oil and gas decline. We\u2019ve also updated our pricing outlook. We now expect pricing to be flat for the year, which is down slightly from our previous expectations.","In summary, organic revenue growth is now expected to be approximately 1% to 2% and as a result of the slightly stronger euro, total revenue in the range of $3.64 billion to $ 3.68 billion.","From an earnings per share perspective, we\u2019ve narrowed our guidance range to a $1.82 from $1.87. This reflects the change in revenue as well as unfavorable mix. We are diligently working to offset as much of these headwinds as possible and are driving for an incremental $0.07 of earnings from productivity actions. These actions, which include global procurement opportunities, further Lean deployment, and strategic cost management are currently underway. However, we expect to realize the majority of the benefits in the fourth quarter.","Finally, we are also updating our second half guidance for foreign exchange translation of $0.02.","As we look ahead to the second half, we are not counting on a significant uptick in the current macro environment. We are confidence in our ability to deliver modest growth as we navigate through challenging conditions in the industrial market. We intend to leverage that growth and execute on cost savings initiatives to deliver on our full year commitments.","With that, let me now turn the call over to Shashank Patel to walk you through the results and full year guidance in more detail. Shashank?","Shashank Patel","Thanks, Patrick. Please turn to slide six. We generated revenues of $920 million, down $85 million from the prior year. The year-over-year decline reflects the anticipated foreign exchange translation headwind driven by a stronger U.S. dollar and the impact of our valves divestiture in the third quarter of 2014.","Excluding those items, organic revenue increased 1%, slightly below our expectations and the outlook we provided during our last call of approximately 2%. From an end market perspective, commercial lead the way up 6% with public utility and agriculture up 2% and 1% respectively. Partially offsetting these gains were declines in the residential market of 2%. The industrial end market was flat year-over-year.","From a regional perspective, we again saw strong growth in emerging markets, up 9% combined with 10% growth in Australia and modest growth in Western Europe, up 1%. This was mostly offset by declines in Canada and the U.S., which were down 16% and 2% respectively, primarily due to industrial oil and gas market headwinds.","Operating margin was flat at 12% excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange translation. Once again despite headwinds in our largest end markets limiting our organic growth, we\u2019re able to demonstrate our ability to execute cost management to maintain our operating margin. Focus on continuous improvement and restructuring savings, reduce cost by $32 million in the quarter and resulted in 350 basis point of margin expansion. Partially offsetting these reductions, where inflation cost, unfavorable sales mix and the impact from the divestiture of our valves business last year.","Earnings per share, declined by $0.05 to $043, however excluding the foreign exchange translation headwind of $0.06, we grew EPS by 2%. Now let me cover each of our reporting segments. Please turn to slide seven.","Water Infrastructure recorded orders of $585 million, slight organically. Here we saw the high-single digit growth in treatment and modest growth in water and wastewater pump applications, offset by weakness in our dewatering business. Book-to-bill was $1.06 in the quarter. We exited the quarter with total backlog of $614 million, up 9% on an organic basis. Of this amount, approximately 70% is due to be shipped this year with a balance of nearly $200 million expected to ship in 2016 and beyond. The revenue of $551 million was also flat year-over-year on an organic basis. From an application perspective, test and transport revenues were flat, while treatment was down 2%.","Regionally, we generated most of our growth in the emerging markets, which are up 8%. Australia and Western Europe, both contributed approximately $3 million of growth or 11% and 1% respectively. However, declines in the U.S. and Canada, mostly offset our growth. To further summarize our revenue performance, I\u2019d highlight international expansion of dewatering and test, drove growth in emerging markets like Latin America, India and China. In Western Europe, we saw broad-based demand for water and wastewater pumps, partially offset by a decline in treatment project deliveries in Spain and France. Australia was up double-digits, probably driven by strength in treatment, where we are benefiting from regulatory growth drivers around controlling sewer outflows and increasing wastewater recycling for reuse.","Test was slight overall probably because of the timing of a multi-million dollar project shipment, which lifted to July. Lastly, we saw significant declines in the U.S. and Canada, derived from lower demand for oil and gas dewatering applications.","Operating margin decreased 30 basis points from 13.1% to 12.8%, excluding a 30 basis point headwind from foreign exchange translation. Operating margins was negatively impacted by inflation and unfavorable mix, coupled with an increase in growth investments and pension costs. This was partially offset by cost reductions resulting from sourcing and lead initiatives, as well as $3 billion of restructuring savings.","Let me now turn to slide eight and walk through our Applied Water. Applied Water recorded orders of $359 million, up 3% organically. The strength was headlined by commercial building services, as we continue to see recovery in the institutional building market in the United States. Additionally, we saw significant growth in the commercial sector and to a lesser extent in industrial within emerging markets. As a result, we entered the third quarter with a total backlog of $198 million, up 6% on a constant currency basis. Approximately 80% of this backlog is expected to ship this year.","Revenue was $369 million, up 3% organically from the prior year. Building service applications were up 3%. Industrial water increased 3%, and irrigation grew 1%. Regionally, we generated growth in emerging markets and the U.S., which grew 13% and 1% respectively. Western Europe was slightly down overall for the quarter.","To summarize further our revenue performance, I\u2019d highlight, we continue to see growth in emerging market regions particularly Asia Pacific and Latin America as commercial and industrial markets continue to expand. Additionally, growth in building services was driven by strength in U.S. commercial up 6%, where we have seen distributors stocking due to the continued recovery in the institutional building sector.","Irrigation increased slightly as strength in the U.S. and Latin America offset weak market conditions in Europe. Residential was down 2% globally from weakness in Europe and roughly flat performance in the U.S.","Operating margin expanded 10 basis points from 14.7% to 14.8% year-over-year excluding FX translation headwinds. Margin improvement was driven by the favorable impact of cost reduction initiatives and volume leverage. These factors were partially offset by negative sales mix, inflation costs and the unfavorable impact of the valves divestiture.","Now let\u2019s turn to slide nine, where I will cover the company\u2019s financial position. Xylem maintains a strong cash position with a balance of $600 million at the end of Q2. Our net debt-to-net capital ratio is a healthy 25%, and our commercial paper and revolving credit faculties remain in place and continue to be unutilized.","We remain committed to our balanced capital deployment strategy, which is to maintain and grow the business while enhancing shareholder returns through dividends and share repurchases.","During the second quarter, we invested $20 million into capital expenditures, and we returned $25 million to shareholders through dividends. We have approximately $60 million of additional potential repurchases under our authorized share repurchase program.","Free cash flow was $64 million during Q2, which marks an improvement of $11 million from the prior year and primarily reflects improved working capital performance.","With that said, please turn to slide 10, and I\u2019ll cover our 2015 guidance. At the segment level, we expect Water Infrastructure revenue in the range of $2.2 billion to $2.3 billion, reflecting organic growth of 1% to 2%. And for Applied Water, we expect revenue of $1.4 billion, with organic revenue growth of 1% to 2%.","Segment margins are anticipated to be in the range of 14.3% to 14.5%, and operating margins are projected to be in the range of 13.0% to 13.2%, reflecting margin expansion of 40 to 60 basis points, excluding the impact of foreign exchange translation. At the bottom-line, we anticipate earnings per share of $1.82 to $1.87, excluding restructuring and realignment costs of $20 million.","As Patrick noted earlier, we have narrowed our full-year outlook to reflect a slightly lower organic growth and unfavorable mix partially offset by an increase in productivity and cost savings.","Additionally, we have also updated the projected impact from foreign exchange translation. As noted on the slide, we expect EPS growth of 4% to 7%, excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange translation.","As mentioned earlier, we are driving to 100% free cash flow conversion of net income, and this takes into consideration expected CapEx in the range of $120 million to $130 million.","We expect return on invested capital to remain at approximately 11%. Excluding the anticipated impact of foreign exchange translation, we would expect approximately 50 basis points of improvements in 2015. Our operating tax rate is still expected to be 21%, approximately 1% higher than 2014 given the expected mix in regional revenue. Lastly, fully diluted share count is expected to be 183 million.","Turning to slide 11, we have provided for you a summary of our first half performance by end market along with our current full-year outlook which, as you can see, has been adjusted to reflect current end market conditions and anticipated trends. In summary, Industrial, which represents 44% of our total revenue, is expected to be flat year-over-year versus our previous expectation of low single digit growth. Our current full year outlook reflects our first half performance and lower general industrial growth assumption over the second half of the year.","The public utility sector, which constitutes 33% of our total revenue is anticipated to grow at low single-digit to mid-single-digit rate. Here we have increased our outlook, to reflect our first half performance, solid backlog in our water waste water transport pump division, and encouraging signs of improving market conditions in the U.S.","For the Commercial market, our full year outlook remains unchanged. With growth expected to be in the low single-digit to mid-single-digit range. Again, the U.S. market appears to be improving, and we continue to anticipate strength in the emerging markets. We do expect growth to moderate over the balance of the year, given the restocking activity we saw over the last nine months. Conditions in Europe remains soft, but we continue to expect that new products will drive growth over the second half.","We now project the residential end market to be flat, reflecting our first half performance and expected stable U.S. market conditions. Previously, we had anticipated a low single-digit decline.","Finally, our smallest sector, Agriculture, will likely be down low single-digits for the year. Strength in the western U.S. region driven primarily by continuing drought conditions is expected to be more than offset by unfavorable flooding impacts in Texas and other parts of Central U.S. It is also important to note that we face very difficult year-over-year comparisons in this market segment as well as weak European market conditions.","Turning to slide 12. Given the continued focus on foreign exchange and expected incremental headwinds, we thought it would be appropriate to revisit the information we covered last quarter. So first, let\u2019s begin by discussing Xylem\u2019s foreign exchange transaction exposure. This is true economic exposure and as such we have a place \u2013 we had in place a comprehensive hedging program that substantially mitigates our overall transaction exposure. Our strategy is to proactively hedge and mitigate up to 75% of net cash flows for our seventh largest currency pair exposures. We do this on a rolling 12-month basis.","Furthermore, we hedged the monthly mark-to-market exposure on our balance sheet, and all of our hedging activity utilizes forward instruments. Finally, as it relates to foreign currency transaction exposure, I would highlight that any residual impact not offset by our hedging program is reflected in our underlying operational performance.","Now let me address foreign currency translation exposure, which is the impact resulting from translating financial statements of foreign entities back into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. Given the nature of this exposure and the anticipated impact on our financial results in 2015, we will continue to isolate the impact, so you will be able to better judge the operational performance of our company and progress against strategic initiatives.","The table illustrates the top-five currency exposure for Xylem. It provides you with the average exchange rate for each currency last year and the rate assumed in our previous guidance as well as the average rate during the first-half.","Perhaps most importantly, because FX rates have continued to significantly fluctuate. We have also included the rates we assumed in our guidance update.","Similar to last quarter, the table includes the full year expected impacts on revenue and operating income. To summarize, based on the rate assumptions used for our guidance update, full year revenue will be negatively impacted by approximately $300 million, and operating income by approximately $54 million, which will result in $0.23 of EPS headwind. As you can from this the slide, we already saw revenue negatively impacted by $162 million and operating income by $25 million over the first half. And we expect second half results to be negatively impacted by $138 million on the top line and $29 million for operating income.","As Patrick highlighted earlier, we are reflecting the recent strengthening of the euro in our forecast. This benefit is reflected in both our second quarter performance and the outlook for the balance of the year. We will continue to provide quarterly updates with full transparency.","Turning to slide 13, I\u2019ll provide some color with regards to our expectations for the second half. I\u2019d like to spend a minute calibrating everyone on the call around what we expect our revenue and operating income profile to be over the balance of 2015. I\u2019ll begin with some comments around our shippable backlog. Of the total $812 million in backlog, $573 million of shippable in the second half of the year, and the remaining $229 million as expected to ship in 2016 or thereafter.","Third quarter shippable backlog is approximately $405 million and that represents approximately 45% of our expected third quarter revenue, and its consistent with what we had last year. So we still have a lot of book and term business to secure and deliver in the quarter. As per revenue growth, we expect second half organic revenue to be approximately 1% to 2%. We see the second half profile similar to years past, down sequentially in the third quarter with a ramp up in the fourth quarter. More specifically, we expect revenue to decline in Q3 approximately 3% sequentially from the second quarter reflecting the impact of European seasonality in July and August.","On a year-over-year basis, we expect third quarter organic growth of approximately 1% to be more than offset by foreign exchange impact of approximately $80 million. We expect sequential operating income performance in the second half to be driven by volume and incremental cost improvements in areas such as global souring, lien, and strategic cost management. Second half sequential incremental margin is expected to be approximately 56%, lower than last year\u2019s sequential performance primarily reflecting unfavorable mix. As for the third quarter, we anticipate margin declines of approximately 20 basis points year-over-year including FX translation.","By segment, we expect the sequential margin improvement to be more pronounced in Water Infrastructure than in Applied Water. Finally, we expect full year corporate expense of approximately $50 million. With that said, please turn to slide 14, and let me hand the call back over to Patrick for some closing comments. Patrick?","Patrick Decker","Thanks, Shashank. As we move past the midpoint of the year, I\u2019m pleased with the progress the team has made, particularly in terms of their continued focused execution. While we are weathering some near term market challenges, several areas of the business have delivered solid growth. Importantly, we continue to advance our strategic agenda. And I look forward to updating you in more detail on that agenda at our upcoming Investor Day.","As a reminder, it will take place on Thursday, September 24, in New York City. At that time, we plan to outline our long-term growth strategy, which will include organic and inorganic growth plans, our continuous improvement agenda, as well as our capital deployment framework to drive shareholder value. It will also be an opportunity for you to engage directly with my leadership team. We will share more details on the agenda in last August. And, now operator, we can begin the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question is coming from Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets.","Deane Dray","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Patrick Decker","Good morning, Deane.","Shashank Patel","Good morning.","Deane Dray","I was hoping, we could start on the comments on muni, and it\u2019s been a while since there has been some positive comments about growth and rebounds and so, take us through first geographically, the European municipal buyers versus the U.S. and address where the pickup is coming? Is it from break in fix MRO or are there any projects getting released?","Patrick Decker","Thanks, Deane, yeah. So, let me give some overall commentary here. I would say, it\u2019s a combination of both in terms of break in fix as well as some project activity there, that we see rebounding. When you take a look at what we\u2019ve seen thus far, we\u2019ve looked at about 2% growth in muni in the second quarter, about 2% to the first half of the year. We are seeing an acceleration in that area.","We expect the second half of the year to be up mid-single-digits. And so we are seeing some acceleration there. It\u2019s being driven primarily by both treatment and transport predominantly in the U.S., but I would say also as well as Europe, but Europe to a lesser extent than the U.S.","Deane Dray","Are you actually seeing projects getting released?","Patrick Decker","It\u2019s a combination, but yes, we are seeing \u2013 we are seeing projects are getting released, again, it\u2019s still a bit slow, but we also have seen an increase in the quoting activity as well as in our win rate on that quotes.","Shashank Patel","And Deane, this is Shashank, and just add to the on the pump side from our transport division in the second quarter, we\u2019re up 6%, for the half, we\u2019re up 4% and that\u2019s where we see strength in the second-half of the year as well.","Deane Dray","Understood. And this is the second question to, maybe you can expand on the expectations regarding pricing, it doesn\u2019t sound like it\u2019s a big headwind, but directionally it looks like it\u2019s gotten a little bit tougher for you. And maybe if you can parse out what the pricing environment is like on OVE versus your aftermarket business?","Patrick Decker","Sure. Good question, Deane. So, I would say first of all, you know through the first-half of the year and continuing through the second quarter and we expect this continue through the rest of the year. Pricing has is pretty been neutral. We had previously expected it be up about 30 basis points, 40 basis points, and right now, we\u2019re seeing that being neutral across the businesses, but an aggregated number. When you take a look at the individual pieces of the portfolio. I would say we are beginning to see the supply demand mix work in our favor over time on the muni side of the equation.","We haven\u2019t seen that fully come to realization yet, but we expect that to be the case more in 2016 and beyond. As we see increase in demand, where we\u2019ve seen the most pressure from a pricing standpoint has been predominantly in Applied Water and that\u2019s in the well pump business, there where again it\u2019s a soft market, tough competition. And so, we are taking a very disciplined strategic approach in that area. Obviously, we\u2019re also working to put that pressure back on our suppliers by being more aggressive on the sourcing side. So we can mitigate any of that that pricing pressure that we\u2019re seeing.","Deane Dray","Thanks. And just, hopefully he\u2019s listening, I wanted to wish Mike Speetzen the best and we\u2019ll really miss him.","Patrick Decker","Absolutely. I\u2019m sure he is listening.","Mike Speetzen","Thanks, Deane.","Patrick Decker","Thanks, Deane.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones of Stifel.","Nathan Jones","Good morning, everyone.","Patrick Decker","Good morning.","Nathan Jones","If we could just start on the commercial side there. You had first half plus 8%, you\u2019re looking at low-to-mid singles for the full year, which would kind of imply pretty wide range of down low-singles to up mid-singles in the second half. I know you\u2019ve talked a little bit about distributor stocking in the first half and destocking in the second half. If you could just give us a little bit more color around the slowdown in the commercial in the second half, and how much of that is destocking versus end market slowdown?","Patrick Decker","Yeah. This is gigantic that one. We actually saw a growth in the first half of 7% and there was \u2013 just give you destocking in the first half, primarily in the U.S. as well as we have strength in China. China was up in the high-teens. And what we expect in the second half, specifically in the U.S. a little bit of destocking going on as well as slower growth in China in the second half, driving to our \u2013 we\u2019re calling it low-single digit growth in the second half versus the plus 7% we saw in the first half.","I will say that we are quite encouraged by what we see happening in the commercial building sector. As you know, we\u2019re heavily weighted towards the institutional side of that market. And we are seeing a continued recovery in that space.","Nathan Jones","Okay. Then on the overall margin guidance for the company, it\u2019s gone from 13.2% midpoint to a 13.1% midpoint. You said you had expected 30 basis points to 40 basis points in price that\u2019s now neutral. Is a couple of million dollars lower expectation of restructuring savings? Can you talk about where the offset on the positive side is coming from to those two negative things?","Shashank Patel","Sure, yeah. So, couple of areas. First of all, we have really been driving the global source and global procurement and productivity effort here quite aggressively, and we\u2019ve seen \u2013 we\u2019ve seen an uptick in that progress, so that\u2019s certainly helping us out here. Obviously, we also saw some uptick as we talked about in the area of commercial and public utilities, and those tend to be good margin businesses for us and so that\u2019s help mitigate.","The biggest single driver, of our margin outlook for the balance of the year, really is driven by industrial being weaker than expected, and that\u2019s just given the very high margin nature of our dewatering rental business. And so, that\u2019s really what\u2019s driving predominately that downtick. But we\u2019re trying to more than offset that as much as possible through other productivity efforts.","And just another note on that is. Realizing that we were in competitive markets as well as tough markets industrially as well as dewatering mix impact. We have taken a more \u2013 we always take good approach in cost management but we\u2019ve also focused more on the cost management side, to help with all the other productivity that we work on.","Nathan Jones","All, right. Thanks very much guys.","Shashank Patel","Thank you.","Patrick Decker","Thanks, Nathan.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Connors with Boenning & Scattergood.","Ryan Connors","Great, thank you. Yeah, I wanted to talk a little bit, hello. Wanted to talk a little bit about the Europe side. You noted stronger growth in I guess, industrial applications in the slide deck in Europe. I assume that some of the new products on the HVAC side that might be driving that, but if you could just expand on the drivers behind that strength in European industrial?","Patrick Decker","Yeah, actually on the HVAC side, we did have significant product launches last year, as well as this year. So, we\u2019ve seen some of the benefit of that for in the first-half of the year, and we expect to see the some additional products that will be launched in the Q3 time period of this year. So we expect to see continued strength from them \u2013 primarily driven by product launches.","Phil De Sousa","And Ryan, this is Phil. Just we also saw an uptick in the quarter, particularly from our wastewater pump division, and Patrick\u2019s comments earlier I think with regard to the public utility market, and we did actually see strength there as well. But the industrial wastewater pump market also was up quite significantly in the second quarter.","Q \u2013 RyanConnors","Okay. And then that, I mean, that, will that pipeline of new products continue to be refilled as we move into the balance of 2015 and into 2016, or will we kind of start to anniversary some of those and hit some tougher compares?","Patrick Decker","Yeah, so good question, Ryan. First of all, we definitely will continue to see an uptick in the amount of new product launches. Obviously, we need to manage that in terms of, we don\u2019t want to overload our sales teams with too many new products, but there is quite a bit in the hopper right now that we\u2019re quite excited about. And we\u2019ll be walking you guys through at Investor Day. Some of those exciting launches, and some of the key focus areas that we\u2019re targeting, but the short answer is, yes, we will continue to see new products be a very integral part and critical part to our growth strategy.","And when you look at our vitality index, it\u2019s up to 18%. So this is something we\u2019ve been working on for the last two years or three years, and it \u2013 continues to tick upwards. So that continues to be in focus, and our goal is to continue growing that, so the pipeline will continue.","Ryan Connors","Okay. And then, this is kind of a tough one to answer, I realize, and I know we\u2019re e going to hear more about this at the Analyst Day. But if you could just kind of qualitatively discuss for us, Patrick, your initial thoughts on kind of 2016 top-line, I mean, there is so many moving parts we have, I guess, the 4x headwind will annualize and kind of go away on a translation basis and we\u2019ve got the different end markets. And what\u2019s your kind of your thought process about how 2016 will shape up relative to the company\u2019s longer term top line growth goals?","Patrick Decker","Sure. So, yeah, as you said \u2013 obviously we\u2019ll give more color at Investor Day and it\u2019s a little early for us to predict given somewhat of the short cycle nature of the business here, but let me speak at a top level. I\u2019m very encouraged by what we\u2019re seeing particularly on the public utilities and the commercial side of the equation. And the fact that you\u2019re looking at a sizeable increase in our backlog and shippable in 2016 and beyond.","Again, we\u2019ve seen more than a 50% growth in that in a total company wide basis. So that\u2019s quite encouraging. I would say, so looking at from that perspective that all net-net is positive and probably positive up versus what I\u2019d have been thinking previously.","Having said that, the one big unknown that we\u2019ve got obviously is how long this oil and gas weakness is going to continue and given the impact that has on our dewatering business, which is such a high margin business for us. So that\u2019s really in my view the biggest wildcard right now, but everything else in net-net, I\u2019m feeling more encouraged.","Ryan Connors","Okay. So I guess if we look at the long-term growth goals of the companies, turnout there in the past, would it be safe to say 2016 has given us some puts and takes, but it\u2019s more or less kind of a normal year, right. It means, you\u2019ve got some nice drivers and a few offsets.","Patrick Decker","That\u2019s correct.","Ryan Connors","Okay. Well, great thanks for your time this morning.","Patrick Decker","Thank you.","Phil De Sousa","Thanks, Brian.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Rose with Wedbush Securities.","David Rose","Good morning. Thank you for taking the call.","Patrick Decker","Sure, good morning.","Phil De Sousa","Good morning.","David Rose","Just a couple of quick ones. One, following up on the procurement initiatives, I mean can you quantify how much of the spend as a percentage of total spend is left to target and what you\u2019re expectations are in terms of the dollar amount of savings left and maybe the big buckets if you could?","Patrick Decker","Yeah, I\u2019ll start surely giving specific numbers here today and we certainly will be in a position to kind of layout what that overall target opportunity is and certainly at investor day, this is a multi-year journey that we\u2019re on and we have obviously being going after the biggest spin categories and the most obvious spin categories things like castings for example and so I would say most of our progress thus far has been in those direct spin categories. There is still plenty of room for us to move there and certainly as we see growth in volume as we look into the out years just that increased level of volume and spend will continue to refresh and give us an opportunity to drive become savings there.","Obviously indirect spend in some of the other categories of spending are areas that are still very rich and fertile for us to go after. But again, we\u2019ll talk more about that in detail at investor day.","David Rose","Can you just maybe bracket a ballpark about how much spend was left to go after?","Patrick Decker","I would say that on the direct spend which we\u2019ve been working on for many years we\u2019ve captured most of that. On the indirect spend category where we had a big effort starting about 12 months to 18 months ago, there I think is where the biggest opportunity is, as far as the percentage, I\u2019m not exactly sure but I think we have probably targeted at least 50%, 75% of the indirect spend categories. So there\u2019s still, as Patrick said, there\u2019s still more opportunity for that.","Yeah, this is a multi-year journey and effort. So the buckets evolved, the level of spinning evolves and so, I\u2019ll stop short of talking about a specific number or a percentage right now, but again we can get into that more depth on Investor Day.","David Rose","Okay. I appreciate and I certainly understand. And maybe if I could one more, kind of on a big picture item is the cash flow is great for the quarter. You seem a little timid on the share buyback and maybe you can articulate for us what you\u2019re thinking about that?","Patrick Decker","Sure. Yeah. So, share repo, it continues to be one of the elements of our capital deployment framework. It will continue to be an important element of our capital deployment framework. Obviously, beyond offsetting dilutive impacts from equity grants, we do view repurchases as an opportunistic lever to return capital back to shareholders. Again, we\u2019re going to update you in terms of what our outlook and what our plans are for that Analyst Day as well, but you can rest assure it will continue to be an important element of our framework.","David Rose","Okay, great. Thank you and I look forward to hearing more from you.","Patrick Decker","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Joseph Giordano of Cowen & Company.","Tristan Margot","Hey, guys. This is Tristan Margot for Joe today.","Patrick Decker","Good morning.","Tristan Margot","Good morning. Just a couple of quick ones here, most of my questions have been answered, but could you give us a breakdown of the organic order growth that you have by region and by end markets?","Phil De Sousa","Hi, Tristan. This is Phil. That information we don\u2019t typically provide, but if we get a sense, just as a reminder, the Applied Water division is very much so a book and ship business and so you can pretty much approximate the same to a geographic profile \u2013 application profile as the revenue organic profile \u2013 organic growth that we highlighted earlier today. As far as the organic order growth for Water Infrastructure, perhaps I\u2019ll just leave you with a thought process so that we are seeing an uptick in orders on the treatment side, both the U.S., Europe, and we continue to see \u2013 if you had continued healthy growth on the emerging market side.","David Rose","All right, great, thank you. And then, just a quick one on oil and gas, I know, you\u2019ve highlighted, I think 40% decline in the second half.","Phil De Sousa","Yeah.","David Rose","What are you seeing currently in oil and gas? Is it how we flatten out here or, or what are your expectation or what do you see right now?","Patrick Decker","Sure. Yeah, so, the 40% decline that we talked about previously is in still line with our latest outlook and expectations as we talked about in our prepared comments. What you\u2019re saying here in terms of us talking about further weakness there is really more of a broader industrial knock-on effect and the impact that has on some of our distribution partners.","So our outlook remains unchanged, again 40% down year-over-year. In terms of whether that\u2019s the bottom, I mean, it\u2019s certainly we hope it\u2019s still bottom, it feels like it\u2019s the bottom. But I [indiscernible] anyone to make that projection just yet. So that\u2019s why we\u2019re taking a cautious approach here.","David Rose","Okay. Great. Thank you for taking the questions guys.","Patrick Decker","Sure, thank you.","Phil De Sousa","Thanks, Rose.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Davis from Barclays.","Scott Davis","Hi, good morning guys.","Patrick Decker","Good morning","Phil De Sousa","Good morning.","Scott Davis","I wanted to get some clarity on where you\u2019re spending capital, where you think there is, where do you think there is growth in and what kind of projects and things you\u2019re spending money on, whether it be adding capacity versus productivity and things like that?","Patrick Decker","Sure. Yeah, so from an overall capital perspective, I would say \u2013 and I\u2019ll talk about this both in terms of true CapEx versus where we\u2019re directing maybe our ongoing expense focuses well. Certainly we see the opportunity we\u2019re executing on that in terms of investing more in a few of our critical emerging markets. And so again building some extra capacity in China to support the growth in demand there as well as certainly in the Middle East. We\u2019ve approved an expansion there that I\u2019d talked about it a little bit briefly in the last earnings call and that will be localizing our assembly in test capabilities and adding some additional feet on the street.","We\u2019ve been investing as a priority more in R&D to again drive our new product development pipeline, and again we\u2019re quite encouraged by some of the opportunities there. And then I would say third, probably not big news if you are on the phone, simplifying our IT environment and reducing the number of systems that we\u2019ve got and investing more in the IT implementations to support the frontend of the business is the third area, I would say a priority from a capital perspective.","Scott Davis","It sounds good. Fair answer. And then I don\u2019t know how you can comment on this, but I\u2019m curious to hear your thoughts at least on pain there and trying on it at least the concept of consolidating the industry. I mean how easy to approach from these angles, since you could probably tell me [indiscernible] your comment, but \u2013 I mean how easy is it to consolidate this industry? And how \u2013 how much consolidation do we need to see? I mean when I think about flow in general, it is one of the most fragmented of the sectors that we. Industrial analysts are covering, there\u2019s probably 25 players out there. I mean we\u2019ve got number of verticals that are consolidated down to a four or five major global players. I mean what do you \u2013 how do you think about this industry and how it stacks up in the next several years, and what kind of consolidation we might see and how easy this to consolidators, and just...?","Patrick Decker","Sure.","Scott Davis","It does look easy from the outside, but when you really dig in, it\u2019s \u2013 their channel conflicts and all of kinds of other issues that have to navigate that makes a less interesting?","Patrick Decker","Sure. Well, I may be pleased to hear this, because I won\u2019t say, no comment. But obviously, as a general practice, we don\u2019t comment on speculation or on others kind of move. But obviously being a flow control veteran and bound to space for a number of years, I think it is easier [indiscernible] . Having said that, it\u2019s till fragmented and there are opportunities to consolidate in the space.","There is more complexity behind that that meets the eye for many of the reasons that you pointed out. And so in terms of predicting what will happen, what could happen, I wouldn\u2019t go further than that to speculate. Again, we remained focused on our strategy, and executing what we\u2019re going to do. Obviously, deployment of capital towards M&A is going to be a very meaningful part of that. We\u2019ll be sharing a bit more about that in terms of areas that are particularly interesting to us at Investor Day, and that will be a richer dialog at that point, Scott.","Scott Davis","Okay. And then just last question. I mean when times are tough like this, we normally see market share shifts go back to the best players or the strongest players. Most of all, capitalized has been most cost supplier, producers in the scale, and [indiscernible]. It\u2019s difficult for us to get external validation, but do you feel like you\u2019re gaining share, there\u2019s a feel like you are outperforming your pump industries?","Patrick Decker","I am always cognizant Scott not to get too far ahead of my [indiscernible] , in terms of talking about share, but the bottom-line is, I\u2019m very pleased by what I\u2019ve seen through the first half of the year. When you take a look at our growth rates in our key end markets relative to what the underlying end market growth is, I think you see that most prominently, and again our pump business, you also see that I think to a meaningful extent in a number of our business, including treatment. But it\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s too early to kind of declare that. It\u2019s still a tough market. We\u2019re \u2013 we\u2019re using all the levers that we have at our disposal. But it does feel quite encouraging on behalf of the team right now. But again, we still got a lot of work to do to make this sustainable.","Scott Davis","Okay. Fair enough. Good luck, guys. Thank you.","Patrick Decker","Okay, thank you.","Phil De Sousa","Thank you, Scott.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chip Moore with Canaccord Genuity.","Chip Moore","Patrick Decker","Good morning. Thanks.","Phil De Sousa","Good morning, Chip.","Chip Moore","Just wanted to follow-up on the rental biz a bit. Do you think headwinds bottom out here in the second half as some of those idle assets get redeployed or where do you think we stand in that process, maybe if you have some historical context?","Patrick Decker","Sure. Yeah, so we\u2019ve \u2013 the team \u2013 I\u2019ve been very pleased with what the team has done in proactively addressing this and we do expect to see benefits of the redeployment of a large number of our pumps to put them out for rent in some of the international markets. And so I think we are looking at this as a silver lining on the situation, because it does help us accelerate building out that international business. That takes time to get the pumps there to get them in place and ready to rent, and then obviously you\u2019ve got to create demand. But we\u2019re quite encouraged and optimistic about the opportunities there. That certainly will help us as we go into 2016 as well. Certainly, in terms of \u2013 do we think it\u2019s the bottom, do we think it gets better from here. As I mentioned earlier, that\u2019s hard to predict. I mean it feels like it. I think the team is optimistic that it is the bottom at this point in time. What I feel good though about is the again -the approach the team\u2019s taken. And I do think that will help buffer relative to some of the other players in the marketplace.","Phil De Sousa","And this is Phil. I just add. It\u2019s not that we want to exclude obviously portions of the business from our results because it\u2019s now already behind the diversified portfolio. But if you did take aside the oil and gas related say, deep water and rental branches out of the equation. We\u2019re seeing very solid growth, in all the other branches, and I think that plays into the diversified application expertise of our Godwin business here in the U.S. and more broadly speaking across the globe.","Chip Moore","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks, folks.","Patrick Decker","Thank you.","Operator","So our next question comes from Brian Konigsberg of Vertical Research.","Brian Konigsberg","Good morning.","Patrick Decker","Good morning, Brian.","Phil De Sousa","Good morning, Brian.","Brian Konigsberg","Hey, guys. Hey, couple of quick questions. On the \u2013 just the adjusted guide for the year, the productivity number of $0.07 just seems like, it\u2019s decently large. I know you guys put in place, spending curtailments late in 2013 as well, which seem to yield pretty good benefit. Has the belted loosened over the course of 2014, and now you\u2019re bringing that back down, are you finding more opportunities? And maybe a little bit more color on that bucket would be great?","Patrick Decker","Sure. Yeah, I would say, the bell is absolutely not loosen. I think, the \u2013 it is an issue of just continuing to apply good disciplined cost management and in constrain, as well as identifying further opportunities for cost reduction efforts. As well as we talked about, just the acceleration in our global procurement capabilities as well.","As you\u2019ve heard us probably say before I do think that the large majority of the opportunities that had been done thus far have been happening within the individual business units themselves. And to some extent, the function, the opportunity going forward here as we talk about the opportunity to simplify the company further, is really looking at things horizontally, from a company perspective, and as opposed to just within the unit themselves.","Those are harder to get out, but that\u2019s say a big part of the, what I\u2019d call the self-help story in terms of margin expansion.","The other point I note is from a productivity standpoint. Historically, the second half is stronger than the first half. And that\u2019s just leveraging the incremental volume, we have that helps productivity as well as the whole fixed overhead cost issue. So if you look at even 2014 second half to first half, we had an improvement of almost $0.06 in productivity. So $0.07 is kind of in line with that with the additional actions, we\u2019ve taken and the global procurement effort, we are accelerating this year.","Brian Konigsberg","Okay. But just to be clear that $0.07 when you build up from previous guidance to the new guidance that $0.07 incremental versus what you\u2019ve planned as of say to the first quarter, is that correct? And is that mostly coming from procurement or is it mostly coming from discretionary spend that you\u2019re able to cut back on?","Patrick Decker","It\u2019s primarily coming from procurement.","Brian Konigsberg","Okay.","Patrick Decker","And Brian, one element just to highlight, we\u2019ve got some of that benefit already here in Q2. And so as you kind of think as we are trying to offset some of these unfavorable mix and we\u2019re certainly ramping up the GSS activities, given the deflationary environment. We want to go back and certainly first half, with some of our suppliers, expecting of course that they will take some time to get a little bit of acceleration. So you should see more of that benefit come in to the fourth quarter.","Brian Konigsberg","Okay. Got it. Yeah. And maybe you just touched on inflation and deflation. I mean, do you anticipate you\u2019re going to start to see some deflationary benefits in the second half of the year just from commodity prices coming down? I know you\u2019re pushing down [indiscernible] itself, but just kind of raw materials, you\u2019re purchasing. Does that become additive to you versus the previous guidance? And is it baked into the numbers?","Patrick Decker","It\u2019s baked into the numbers. And you\u2019re right that will help in the second half.","Brian Konigsberg","That will be in the second half. Okay.","Patrick Decker","Yes.","Brian Konigsberg","If I could just sneak one more in. Just on the oil and gas part, so there\u2019s been a lot of discussion about U.S. drillers kind of approaching, I guess the market with refracing, rather than just natural fracing. Does \u2013 is that present the same type of opportunity for your transport dewatering business, as it would for I guess a normal state of drilling?","Patrick Decker","It would be \u2013 we would largely be indifferent to that. So it would still be the same level of activity to be managed.","Brian Konigsberg","Okay, all right. Thank you.","Patrick Decker","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thielman of Davidson.","Brent Thielman","Thanks. Just one more question. On the dewatering business, you have some headwinds in areas like mining and oil and gas. Can you remind me, how much these sort of commodity sectors represent as a portion of business?","Patrick Decker","Yeah, so oil and gas is about, again oil and gas mining, that whole commodity play is about 15% of our dewatering revenue.","Brent Thielman","Okay.","Phil De Sousa","And Brent, this is Phil. I just want, it\u2019s 15%, [ph] how much worth, its 15% each.","Brent Thielman","Between mining and oil and gas?","Phil De Sousa","Correct. So the total combined make-up approximately call it 30% to 35% of the dewatering profile.","Brent Thielman","Great. Thank you.","Phil De Sousa","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Barry of Susquehanna.","Robert Barry","Hey guys. Good margining. Thanks for taking my question.","Phil De Sousa","Good morning.","Patrick Decker","Good morning.","Robert Barry","I was wondering if you could unpack the industrial outlook a little bit, I guess especially on the Applied side. It sounds like it\u2019s more than just oil and gas and mining getting worse. And I know you have very broad exposure within what you call industrial in Applied?","Patrick Decker","Yeah, I would say that, you\u2019re right. Its primary oil and gas and mining, but then there is a whole bunch of other segments that get impacted by industrial, it\u2019s the all other industrial category. And there, obviously, we just like the rest of the business in Applied Water, we were soft in the first half. In the second half, we actually have some projects that are shipping in the second half. So when you look at the second half versus the first half, first half was negative 1. Second half is projecting low single-digits. It\u2019s held by the backlog that\u2019s in there rather than improving market conditions in industrial.","Robert Barry","So whenever you see \u2013 the outlook is lower because industrial is weaker, and it sounds like you kept the oil and gas decline the same, and all the nine oil and gas and mining stuff actually looks better in the back half. So, is this incremental weakness kind of absorbed already or are things actually worse out?","Patrick Decker","No, sorry. It\u2019s absorbed. I mean it\u2019s absorbed in the revised guidance now that we\u2019re giving you. And the way that you\u2019ve read it is absolutely right. What we saw deteriorating further was in the oil and gas mining piece, again predominantly in dewatering. We did see some weakness through the first half in Applied Water on that broader industrial piece, but to Shashank\u2019s comment, when you take a look at the second half of the year based on very specific projects and backlog and demand mainly in the Applied Water business, we expect a more positive outlook for the second half. When you bring all that together, it still ends up being flattish.","Robert Barry","Got you, got you. And then maybe just a quickly, I wanted to clarify on the restructuring, and if you said this already, just tell me and I\u2019ll read the transcript, but it looks like the carryover savings are lower now from 2014, I think 2015 versus it was $18 million. Did you talk about why that\u2019s lower?","Patrick Decker","Robert, that\u2019s right. So I think the key point to bear in mind here, and perhaps, we could probably made this a little bit clear in our prepared remarks or in original Q&A. But the expected carryover savings this year is a bit lower, but you should expect the balance that $2 million, to $3 million that has essentially been reduced here. We\u2019ll see that early part of next year, it\u2019s more of a timing shift if you would in terms of when we\u2019ll actually realize some of those year-over-year savings.","We have one specific project that\u2019s included in and it\u2019s been delayed but it\u2019s still on the docket, and will be executed by early 2016.","Robert Barry","I see. Okay, thank you.","Patrick Decker","Thanks, Robert.","Phil De Sousa","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, there are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the floor back over to Patrick Decker for any additional or closing comments.","Patrick Decker","Sure. Well, thank you.

McClain","Thank you, Phil. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. Most of you have seen the news release with our disappointing second quarter results. Today, we'd like to walk you through the numbers and of course, respond to your questions and feedback at the conclusion of the call. As outlined in our earnings release, we experienced a 3% organic decline in revenue in the second quarter. This lower-than-expected revenue, along with investments of growth and productivity, resulted in lower operating profit and led to adjusted earnings per share that were below our expectations. During today's call, we'll summarize the dynamics impacting our top line, show how they affected our financial performance and give you our outlook for the remainder of the year. Also, I'll tell you about some of the things we accomplished in the second quarter and outline the strategic and tactical actions we are taking to enhance our performance for both the short and the long term.","So let's start the quarterly summary with the key driver, our revenue performance. Before jumping into the details, let's take a look at what we assumed going into the quarter. You may recall at the beginning of 2013, we were bearish on the macroeconomic conditions across Europe, and we planned accordingly. Even with this precaution, conditions have proven to be more challenging than we had anticipated. A significant portion of our business is short cycle in nature with 50% of our sales going through distribution. These dynamics coupled with customers requiring shorter lead time and distributors minimizing inventories, have led to more frequent and smaller transactions, thus limiting our short-term visibility and resulting in increased variability from month-to-month. Let me also remind you of our seasonality of our business with the fourth quarter being the largest, followed by the second quarter, and June being an especially important month for us as Europe prepares for its summer holiday. We entered the second quarter with a solid backlog, early order tracking to our expectations, and we are taking aggressive actions to close orders. While June is the strongest month of the quarter, it did not play out as we had expected. Our revenue shortfall was driven primarily by transport and treatment in our industrial and public utility market. While the revenue declines were fairly broad-based and not restricted to any one country, from a regional perspective, the most significant headwinds were in Europe. Unfortunately, our product pipeline continues to push out to the right due to the uncertainty around funding and budget constraints. We are not experiencing meaningful order cancellations, though timing of revenue, conversion is certainly -- is increasingly uncertain. And in this competitive market, we were unable to achieve our targeted price realization and face strong foreign exchange headwind.","Before discussing our adjusted operating profit, I would briefly -- I'd like to briefly highlight some of the bright spots, namely: commercial, residential and agriculture. These 3 growing markets represent approximately 22% of Xylem's revenue. We continue to see strong performance in the U.S. residential market, which posted a third consecutive quarter of organic growth. Second quarter results in the U.S. were in the high teens. U.S. commercial posted 9% organic growth, providing some confidence that this market could be seeing some fundamental improvement. Agriculture was up 10% in the second quarter driven by strength in the U.S. Another bright spot in the second quarter was orders . We received more than $1 billion in orders, that's up 4% in constant currency and 1% organically, and our highest level of orders since becoming a standalone company. Sequentially, organic orders were up 5%. For the second quarter, our book-to-bill ratio was in line with seasonal trends at 1.05. We ended the quarter with a record backlog of $759 million, up $36 million or 5% from the previous quarter. Our shippable backlog is up 7% year-over-year, and we expect to deliver approximately $400 million in the third quarter, and approximately $200 million in the fourth quarter.","Now to income. We're reporting gross margin of 38.6% for the second quarter, and operating margin of 10.2%. Relative to the prior year, these results primarily reflect lower volume and a negative impact of foreign exchange rates. We are partially offsetting margin dilution with contributions from new products, from the savings realized through restructuring actions taken in 2012 and further cost reductions resulting from our Lean and global sourcing initiatives. As a result of these items and the tax benefit realized from our realignment actions, our adjusted net income was $66 million, or $0.36 per share for the second quarter. Our free cash flow performance was driven primarily by a lower income for the quarter, typical seasonality and timing of tax payment.","Let's turn to Slide 4. For the remainder of the year, we have re-forecasted both the top and bottom line assumptions to reflect current market conditions, our first half result and foreign exchange headwind. We now expect revenues to decline 3% to 4% organically, that's down 4 percentage points from our previous guidance. And we expect to deliver EPS in the range of $1.40 to $1.50. Our top line revision is centered on Europe, Latin America and the Middle East growth rate being weaker than we had expected, along with a slower-than-anticipated U.S. industrial market recovery. And we expect public utility project activity to remain challenged into 2014 driven by the weak CapEx spending especially in wastewater.","So what are we doing about this? Across the company, we are taking out additional cost to drive efficiency and a lower cost base in the company while staying focused on growth. We've initiated the majority of our previously announced restructuring and realignment actions. And as a result, I am confident we can deliver the full year cost savings we previously indicated, which will be in the range of $25 million to $27 million for the year. Accelerated cost-saving initiatives will drive an additional savings of approximately $0.06 per share over the balance of the year and are reflected in our revised guidance. These include aggressive cost management to drive further reductions in manufacturing costs by accelerating our Lean initiatives and tighter sourcing controls and significant cuts in discretionary spending across the company. We've already made some immediate adjustments to our cost base while protecting our best profits for growth. We are pacing investments in light of this current market environment. In addition, we are dialing back capital expenditures and resizing our acquisitions spend while still advancing our strategy.","On the other side of this balanced equation are the efforts to drive top line growth. We are launching a series of compelling new products over the balance of the year and staying focused on growth in emerging markets. As always, we are evaluating all opportunities and are taking steps to position this company to be more agile and more competitive. We are leading from the front, actively meeting with our teams around the world, closely tracking progress in our critical initiatives and sending a strong message to everyone across Xylem that our performance must improve.","I would like to quickly highlight some of the areas of progress against our strategic priorities for the year. Turn to Slide 5. We are sharply focused on delivering customer value and driving profitable growth through the launch of technologies that address higher order solutions. Some of these are evidenced by the following key wins. One is a large project in the UAE, to deliver a Leopold brand of filtration system, to pretreat seawater as a critical component to the desal process. In Spain, we won a $2 million project to install our newest UV disinfection system, WEDECO Duron. And we have a $1 million project with our partner, Visenti in Singapore, to help monitor the country's water infrastructure through leak detection technology. These projects are great examples of how we are leveraging our innovation, applications expertise and offering new services to get after some of the world's most challenging water issues. And we're excited by new product launches that are winning in the marketplace, and being recognized with technology innovation awards. We continue to execute our inorganic growth strategy, having completed the acquisition of Pollmann Pumpen during the second quarter. While this acquisition is small compared to those that we completed in the past, it's strategically important and squarely in line with our geographic expansion strategy in dewatering. Pollman complements our existing capacity in Germany and enables us to help better serve our customers across Europe. We have an active acquisition pipeline, and we are advancing our bolt-on strategy. Having spent $80 million on acquisitions year-to-date, we now expect to deploy up to $200 million in total this year.","Lastly, we continue to focus on our business sustainability. As I've already discussed our cost saving initiatives, let me provide you an update on our regional transformation in Europe. You may recall that we opened our European headquarters office in Schaffhausen, Switzerland, and completed the transition of our European Water Solutions business to the newly formed European management structure in the first quarter. During the second quarter, we moved forward with our second phase. And our Applied Water business is now operating under the new structure. And our sales companies across each country across Europe have been integrated into one Xylem team, which will result in greater efficiency and growth as we move forward.","I'll wrap up later and take your questions, but for now, let me turn our call over to our CFO, Mike Speetzen, to walk you through the second quarter 2013 results in detail. Mike?","Michael T. Speetzen","Thanks, Gretchen. Please go to Slide 6. Given our second quarter results, we feel it's important to walk you through our performance relative to our expectations. Organic revenue was unfavorable by 2 percentage points. Strong performance across all end markets in the U.S. was more than offset by weaker conditions in Europe, in the emerging markets, lower price realization and unfavorable foreign exchange impacts.","Let me cover the market dynamics in more detail. First, we saw better-than-expected market conditions in our U.S. residential and commercial building service business, and our Ag business continued to benefit from drought conditions in the Southwest. Europe was generally weaker than expected, but most significantly down in the public utility and industrial markets. We also encountered greater-than-anticipated pricing pressure, as continued market demands challenged our ability to gain more significant price increases. Foreign exchange was a significant headwind, as we saw the U.S. dollar and Swedish krona appreciate against other currencies. The most significant impact was from the noneconomic translation of financial statements into U.S. dollars. The impact to Xylem's revenue was $14 million and the impact to earnings was $3 million. Acquisitions in our restructuring and realignment activities tracked expectations. During the quarter, we realized restructuring savings of $4 million, reflecting our 2012 actions in the initial savings from actions initiated in 2013. Lastly, our adjusted tax rate of 22% was in line with our previous guidance and expectations. As you can see from the bottom of the chart, our EPS shortfall was primarily driven by the volume miss of $0.05. In addition, price and foreign exchange were each $0.01 unfavorable during the quarter.","Please turn to Slide 7. Xylem revenues were $960 million, down 1% from the prior year driven by a 3% organic decline and partially offset by acquisitions. Let me provide some perspective on our revenue performance by end market and by region. First, in our largest end market, industrial. Organic revenue was down 5%, with Europe and the U.S. down mid-single digits. Public utilities declined 6% year-over-year, primarily driven by slowing activity in Europe and emerging markets. CapEx spending was weak in both regions but had a greater relative impact in emerging markets where we have a modest installed base and reliant projects to drive our revenue. Globally, residential and commercial building services were up 6% and 1%, respectively, primarily driven by improved market conditions. And lastly, Ag was up 10% driven by favorable weather conditions.","Let me spend a few minutes on our overall geographic performance. The U.S. was up 2% on an organic basis and as I mentioned, better than our expectations. Europe and emerging markets were both down year-over-year in the range of 4% to 5%. In Russia and China, we continue to generate double-digit growth. The decline in other emerging markets was driven by timing of project shipments and a decline in market demand. Our profitability was significantly impacted by the volume decline. Cost-reduction actions drove 330 basis points of margin improvement. This includes restructuring savings of $4 million from the actions executed in 2012 and 2013. As previously mentioned, price pressure has unfavorably impacted our performance. As a result, price only drove 30 basis points of operating margin improvement, short of our previous expectations and indicative of the environment we expect to see over the balance of the year. These benefits more than offset 250 basis points of inflation and partially mitigated the foreign exchange and acquisition impacts. Foreign exchange movements negatively impacted year-over-year operating margins by 90 basis points. Acquisitions were neutral to income but dilutive to margins in the amount of 30 basis points. Gross margin was 38.6% and operating margin was 10.2% for the quarter. Gross margins were down 100 basis points, primarily driven by the volume decline and foreign exchange impacts. Operating margins were down 380 basis points as a result of loss volume leverage in our continued investments in strategic initiatives.","Please turn to Slide 8. This slide shows our EPS walk for the second quarter. We're reporting $0.36 of EPS, down $0.13 from the prior year. Core operations were down $0.11, driven primarily by volume decline [indiscernible] offset by a $0.02 benefit from restructuring savings. Ongoing European realignment actions provided a $0.01 benefit to EPS and foreign exchange was unfavorable by $0.03.","Now let me provide more details on each of our reporting segments. Please turn to Slide 9. Water Infrastructure reported revenue of $596 million, down 2% over prior year on a constant currency basis, and down 6% organically. Acquisitions contributed 4 points to top line growth. Transport declined 6%, primarily driven by weakness in Europe and decreased mining and public utility CapEx spend in Latin America and Asia Pacific. Treatment revenues declined 12% with the majority of the decline occurring within Europe and the Middle East. As was the case in the first quarter, developed markets continue to see market softness particularly in wastewater capital spending driven by municipal funding constraints. We anticipate that these regions will continue to lag in performance at least until confidence is restored and project orders are released. And lastly, test revenues were down 2% as growth in Europe was offset by sequestration-related softness in our YSI business, which sells to government agencies and the academic market. Operating margin came in at 10.6%. This segment is our highest gross margin segment. The significant volume decline impacted operating margins by 480 basis points, given our direct selling overhead cost structure. Cost-reduction activities yielded 350 basis points of margin improvement, largely offsetting inflation and investments. Foreign exchange volatility and its impact to margins were significant this quarter, totaling 160 basis points, while acquisitions reduced margins by 40 basis points.","Let me now turn to Slide 10 and talk through our Applied Water segment. Revenue was up 1%, both on a constant currency and organic basis. Building services was up 3%, driven by the commercial and residential performance I covered earlier. Industrial water was down 2%. Soft market conditions in the U.S. and Europe resulted in organic declines of 6% and 4%, respectively in the short cycle business. And lastly, irrigation was up 10%, with the U.S. up over 20% as weather conditions continue to drive strong demand. Operating margin was 13.4%, as price increases and cost reduction initiatives more than offset inflation. Year-over-year margin was impacted by the favorable reduction of a contract loss accrual in 2012.","Let me now turn to Slide 11 and review our financial position. Free cash flow was slightly positive in the second quarter. Our performance is below our expectations but reflective of the profitability in the quarter. As you will recall from last quarter, we had $11 million of Sandy relief deferred tax payments. In addition, working capital was unfavorable for the quarter. As a percentage of revenue, working capital increased 120 basis points, driven by longer collection periods and higher inventory as we continue to deal with customers expectations for short lead times and an increasingly competitive environment. Our available cash on hand was $360 million. Our net debt to net capital ratio remains at a healthy 29%. Our commercial paper and revolving credit facilities remain in place and continue to be unutilized.","Please turn to Slide 12 and I'll cover our guidance provision in detail. As you can see on the upper left of the chart, for the full year 2013, we expect to generate revenues of approximately $3.7 billion, down $135 million before the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange translation. To help illustrate this revision, we have summarized our end market expectations which we highlighted when we set guidance earlier this year, our performance over the first half of the year and our current outlook. As you can see, we've revised our outlook downward for both our 2 largest end markets: industrial and public utility. Industrial is now expected to be down mid-single digits for 2013. Through the first half of the year, industrial was down high single digits. While we saw sequential improvement during the first half, the performance was below expectations. In the U.S. and Europe, we believe the lack of corporate confidence to move forward with projects will significantly impact our performance in the second half of the year. And while we still expect some modest sequential improvement, we're reflecting a slower recovery than originally anticipated. With approximately 13% of our industrial end market exposure tied to global mining, we expect to face significant headwinds in the second half of 2013. For public utilities, we now expect full year revenue to be down mid-single digits. In the U.S., we've seen slightly better than expected results through the first 6 months and expect the positive trends to continue through the back half, resulting in a slightly positive organic growth for the full year. However, more than offsetting this favorable trend is the challenging market we face in Europe. Based on first half activity, including significant challenges in the treatment market and weakening customer confidence, we expect that Europe will be down high single digits. We have also lowered our expectations for the public utility end market in the Middle East region, reflecting project timing delays and uncertainty around when large projects will be released. While we saw the commercial market down low single digits during the first half of 2013, we see the potential for improvement in the U.S. over the balance of the year. This expectation is based on market data, customer feedback and our improved performance during the second quarter. We've seen favorable performance in our residential and agricultural markets, primarily driven by conditions in the U.S. which I covered earlier on the call. We have slightly increased our expectations in these markets, reflecting our first half performance and expect continued favorable conditions over the balance of the year. Finally, foreign exchange translation is expected to be a headwind of $70 million to revenue and $0.09 to EPS relative to our previous guidance and is based on currency rates at the end of the second quarter. With that said, you can see how the market dynamics I just described are driving what amounts to be a $0.30 reduction to our full-year EPS projection. In summary, we now expect full year revenue of approximately $3.7 billion, and EPS in the range of $1.40 to $1.50.","Please turn to Slide 13 and I'll provide some color specific to our second half planning assumptions. We are anticipating second half revenue of approximately $1.9 billion, driven by sequential improvements in the U.S. and emerging markets. We're monitoring Europe and have assumed the conditions will remain relatively consistent with what we've seen during the first half of the year, which represents a weaker outlook than originally anticipated. We're forecasting third quarter revenue to be down sequentially in the mid-single digits consistent with our typical seasonality given the European vacation season. This reflects a low single digit year-over-year decline. We expect an increase in second half operating profit of over 25% driven by the sequential uplift in volume, the incremental savings attributable to the 2013 restructuring actions under way and the impact of recovery actions being taken to reduce costs. Based on rates at the end of June, we anticipate that foreign exchange will be a sequential headwind. Despite volume decline, we expect a modest sequential operating margin rate improvement in the third quarter, driven by the incremental restructuring and accelerated cost savings totaling $10 million.","Please turn to Slide 14. Let me highlight a few of the items I've not yet covered. First, we expect free cash flow conversion to be approximately 90% of net income. This is a 5 percentage point decline from our previous guidance and reflects the impact of higher working capital. Our operating tax rate is expected to be 21% for the year, consistent with what we have previously guided and is indicative of the progress against the realignment initiatives we initiated this year. We expect our share count to be approximately 186.4 million, and we now expect restructuring and realignment cost to be in the range of $60 million to $80 million, reflecting a $10 million increase in realignment costs. Consistent with our prior guidance, we expect 2013 restructuring costs in the range of $40 million to $50 million, which will generate 2013 net savings of $13 million to $15 million.","With that, let me turn the call back over to Gretchen.","Gretchen W. McClain","This is not easy news to deliver and we're not pleased to deliver it. We know we must take tough decisions and accelerate our actions given the market conditions we face. But remember, we're seeing a number of positive signs across the business: our order rates are improving, we have a good backlog, we are launching compelling new products and the commercial efforts we are making are all starting to yield positive results. Building the Xylem business is a journey. We're taking the necessary steps to position this great company to achieve higher performance in both the short and the long term.","Operator, we're ready for questions now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Matt Summerville with KeyBanc.","Matt J. Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions. You mentioned heading into the second half of the year, you had about $960 million in backlog, $400 million ships in 3Q, $200 million in 4Q. In a more normal year, what would that dispersion look like? And what I'm trying to get a sense of is how much more you still have to go out and get in a tough year like this relative to a normal year? Does that make sense?","Gretchen W. McClain","Sure, sure. I mean our backlog, when you look at it from a year-over-year prospective, we're up 7% year-over-year. So we're going in with a good backlog, solid backlog. We still have work to do because we do have a short cycle business. But I would say, we feel good about the rates in terms of what we need to achieve as well as the market conditions that we've looked at and adjusted based upon the first half of the year.","Michael T. Speetzen","Matt, the other thing I'd add to that is when we look at that backlog shippable in the second half, we look at it as a percent of the revenue. If you look back at 2012 as an example, it represented about 30%. When you look at the backlog, we're entering our second half, it's up at about 30 [indiscernible] a little bit higher. That's not surprising given the fact that we've seen a decline in the project business. So that's a dynamic that we adjust for as we look at that. And I'd say the dispersion between the 2 quarters is pretty typical of what we've seen barring the projects.","Matt J. Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And then based on what you're stepping up and doing from a cost standpoint now and what you've previously disclosed, how much in incremental savings should we be thinking about for 2014, assuming you complete everything you've discussed?","Gretchen W. McClain","So, Matt, we're working on that today. I mean, we're laying out those actions to date. Most of the things that we're talking about are, it's $0.06 to the EPS, it's $15 million that's baked into our revised guidance. It's discretionary pullback, taking some costs that we need to out of the business. As we get a better projection of the '14, we'll obviously -- we'll share that with you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with Citi Research.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","The first question is for Mike. Take us through the free cash flow because if I've done my math right, you've done a 2% free cash flow conversion so far year-to-date. So how do you get to a 90% conversion in the second half if you're looking at longer collection periods, higher inventory and obviously higher working capital?","Michael T. Speetzen","Yes. It's a good question, Deane. We've taken a hard look at this and I think from a cash standpoint, the one we have to keep in perspective is the cash cost structure is a little bit different than the P&L structure. For example, we pay out bonuses at the beginning of the year and then you're earning yourself back as you go through the year. So adjusting for those types of items, that's why we've revised our working capital projection down, which has had about a 5-point impact on our free cash flow conversion. When we look at the profitable -- profitability and the contribution to cash, we get pretty comfortable as we look into the back half of the guidance levels we have. We've factored in the longer collection cycles as well as the inventory levels that we've got on hand. And then, the thing you have to keep in mind is sort of at least that first half period, we're dealing with a little bit higher cash tax rate given some of the deferrals we had from last year. And then obviously, to Gretchen's point, we're looking at investments in the second half which in terms of the free cash flow conversion, the one area that will be impacted is our capital expenditures. We see that as being dialed way back from the guidance that we have originally given where we talked about it being at about 3.5x -- or 3.5% of revenue. I'd look at that number as being closer to 3% or lower in the back half.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, and then, maybe you can talk about how the quarter progressed because you did say that June came in weaker and that was expected to be seasonally strongest. And the spirit of the question is, when you see the margin shortfall as severe as it did this quarter, I'd like to get a better sense of how proactively did you take out cost this quarter. I know you're trying to manage to a decremental margin because it sounds you're making some cost take outs here adding only about $10 million to the restructuring. I thought that maybe I would see more and maybe see more cost take out within the quarter. So maybe just take us through how the quarter progressed and what cost actions you were taking during the quarter?","Gretchen W. McClain","Yes. So, Deane, let me address so. As we went through the quarter, as I mentioned, June is a big month for us and it's solid. So we didn't see that fall out. We were working our restructuring actions to $60 million to $70 million that we had in our plan. If you remember, we had set our plan assuming we're going to be a flat growth rate and we would size our cost base accordingly. And so we are focused on those areas. Still advancing some of our investments around productivity, which was tied to repositioning ourselves in Europe, and also some new product launches. So that didn't come through. This was our high growth margin business and we saw a big drop to the bottom. Now going forward, we are going to be resizing the business and taking steps. I've talked about what's embedded in the revised guidance. There's more work we need to do and we are looking at all opportunities to see how we can bring our cost base down. Our end markets are challenged right now. The underlying fundamentals of our market are going to be -- have an overshadow of the economy and we've got to make sure we've got cushion in our business to be able to still allow us to invest into growth initiatives that we need because this is a strong market in the long term. And right now, we need to get be able to get our cost base further down. And so there will be more actions. As I mentioned, we put in the $15 million in the revised guidance, actions we will be taking for the rest the year. And while we are 7 months into the year, we've got 5 months yet. Most of those will be savings that will probably play out into 2014 and beyond.","Michael T. Speetzen","And, Deane, I think on the decremental question, roughly we're managing to about a 50% decremental and there's a couple dynamics that play in. While we are taking the cost actions which helped us in the second half, one, we're dealing with a revenue decline in our highest margin business where we have a higher cost structure that we're contending with. So you've got very little erosion in gross margin, but you can see the impact at the up line and that's really around that cost structure. The second dynamic we're contending with is much lower price realization. And as you know, that drops at 100%. We're obviously not just accepting that. We're pushing the teams. But in light of the current environment, that certainly places additional pressure on that decremental margin. So at this point, it wants to be close to 60% and we're fighting to get it down closer to about 50%.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then, just one last question for me. If I heard it correctly, it sounded, Gretchen, like you still had some M&A lined up for the second half. And are you locked into these acquisitions? Are they the right ones to be doing at this time? And I know there's a sense that you want to be playing offense here for the long run, and just how you're weighing that against some of the shorter-term challenges of getting the P&L in order?","Gretchen W. McClain","Deane, it's a great question. And clearly, as I mentioned, we're dialing back a little from what we have originally said. There are some key bolt-on strategies that we'd like to continue to progress. But our #1 priority is to make sure that we get the business in order. We get our performance higher. And making sure that we address, taking the cost out that we need to deposition this company and bring it forward. But there are some acquisitions that strategically are nicely positioned to help us ultimately grow. So again, that balanced equation is essential. Take the cost out, position us for a cushion, but then be able to invest in those strategic initiatives.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Konigsberg with Vertical Research.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","I just want to touch on the incrementals again but more sequentially, meaning, the second half of the year versus the first half of the year. So you're looking at a $42 million increase at the midpoint on revenue between H1 and H2 and a $46 million increase in the operating profit. It sounds like maybe $25 million, $26 million or so that it's from incremental restructuring, but it still suggests a fairly significant incremental from the core business. I think there are some other items, but I was hoping if you could help bridge that gap for us.","Michael T. Speetzen","Sure. Yes, there's a little bit of noise in there. So let me give you a few of the pieces that I think will help provide that. If you look at our core volume, organically, we're up about $67 million versus the first half. Foreign exchange is about a $34 million headwind in the second half and then we've got an additional $10 million of acquisitions. You have to remember the acquisitions are not contributing at a high drop rate at this point in time and foreign exchange are obviously has its set of impacts. So when you look at the core volume increase, less the savings from restructuring, we're looking at about a 50% incremental drop rate, which given where we're at in the business specifically around Water Infrastructure where we see that sequential improvement, we expect to see that drop rate. The drop rate then gets enhanced by the incremental $12 million worth of restructuring benefit that we pick up in the back half. So in my prepared comment, I talked about our restructuring in the second quarter, was it $4 million? $3 million of that came from the actions we initiated in '12. One of that came from the actions we started earlier this year. We pick up incrementally in the back half another $12 million of restructuring benefit.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Okay, but the core business dropping at 50%, I mean, have you ever had that type of experience before? Why is that changed now?","Michael T. Speetzen","Well, there's a couple of things. I think when you look at the Water Infrastructure business, one, we're going to be levering off that cost base. Two, when you look at the mix that we're anticipating in the second half, specifically on the industrial market as it relates to dewatering, even though we're down on a year-over-year basis, the trends we've seen in terms of some of the frac-ing that's driving increased volume to support the rig count increase, that activity comes at a very high drop rate and it's helping us from a mix perspective.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Okay. And then just moving on to the comments about the municipal trends, I think, Gretchen, you said you anticipate the spending to remain weak into 2014. The orders from the quarter actually maybe showed a little bit of an improvement. Maybe can you just elaborate on that comment, I mean, is this just a small aberration in orders that you see in the quarter and it had to drop off again? Maybe you can give us some color on that market, it would be helpful.","Gretchen W. McClain","Yes. So if I step back and I just look at some of the market dynamics that are going on, first of all, in the U.S., you have wastewater spending which is down substantially. And that doesn't look like it's changing anytime soon. Now, we all understand the need of water and the demand that is pending up. And we're seeing that in terms of the bid activity. There's a lot of work in terms of bidding. But the confidence level to actually make that bidding into an order is just not happening. It's not converting. And we anticipate going forward in 2014, right now, nothing that indicates a significant change there. Now if there's public-private partnership that may move that more aggressively, but when I look at the general dynamics in the market, not only in the U.S. but even globally, the confidence level in the funding streams haven't changed. And when you think about 2014, you need to start getting those orders now versus next year because they typically are 12- to 18-month type of orders.","Michael T. Speetzen","And Brian, I guess, what I'd add to that is when you look at the 1% order increase that we had in the quarter, a significant portion of that was driven by Applied Water. The Water Infrastructure business was up about 0.6%. And when you look at that business on a year-to-date basis, because it was down close to 10% in the first quarter, orders were down about 5%. So back to Gretchen's point, the order funnel really hasn't filled at the level that would support significant growth in 2014.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chip Moore with Canaccord.","Chip Moore - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Can you talk a little bit about the signs of bottoming you're seeing to support the outlook in the back half. It sounds like you're not factoring further deterioration in Europe, mining's obviously been quite challenged. Can you just sort of walk us through what you're seeing in some of those markets?","Gretchen W. McClain","Yes. So mining as you mentioned is challenged globally. We're clearly seeing the mining industry being challenged and that hit us, as we talked about in terms of the emerging markets. But let me talk about a little bit from the regional perspective. In the U.S., we're seeing positive signs but the industrial market still has not had the confidence level to give us the confidence that's going to pick up in the second half of the year. In Europe, we're still seeing Europe down. We saw substantially a decline in southern Europe more than we anticipated. While we thought it was down substantially, we didn't think it could go down much further and we've seen that continue. In the Nordics, positive -- still positive growth there but not enough to offset what we're seeing in Europe. And where we're seeing Europe as well as in the public utilities and industrial markets, we anticipate will be weaker as we go into the second half of the year. Emerging markets, China and Russia, we're doing extremely well. We're double-digit growth in both of those regions. But with the global economy pulling back and confidence level still being questioned around the growth in China, that has had impact in the mining industry and our emerging markets globally, specifically, the Middle East and Australia when I look at the Asia Pacific region.","Chip Moore - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Okay. And I guess as you look out if you couple sort of visibility staying challenged in '14, it sounds like with dialing back the M&A a little bit, maybe you can talk about some of those longer-term assumptions, how we should think about those?","Gretchen W. McClain","Yes. I think I would say a couple things. What we think is the markets is pulling back some. We're still feeling confident about the product launches that we are launching this year and into next year. I feel good about some signs of the market picking up. We're seeing residential, commercial picking up. So what we want to do in terms of given the overhang that we've got in some of our markets, being industrial and public utility, still stay strong with our customers, work with them as they're challenged in terms of their funding with services and aftermarket. But we're going to have to adjust ourselves to pull our cost base down. We're still committed in terms of our long term in our business. We're taking the right short-term actions to position the cost base, but still being able to position ourselves with the growth initiatives to hold on to our long-term objectives.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Rose with Wedbush Securities.","David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Would you please quantify the impact that you think the decline in the dewatering business had on margins and revenues as well?","Gretchen W. McClain","Yes. Dewatering globally had been significantly impacted in the industrial market and very specifically, in the U.S. we've seen some decline there, about $4 million in the U.S., in Europe, $7 million, and in Latin America, about another $1 million. So it's down over $10 million in terms of dewatering. Now let me just talk a little bit about our dewatering strategy. That is not just our Godwin business but it is our Flygt business that support some of the mining industry. So it's a combination of the 2.","David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay. And I'm sorry, I wasn't clear. That's the -- what's the operating impact on the business?","Michael T. Speetzen","Well, David, it's a high drop rate business. I mean the majority of where we've seen the pullback is around the rental market. As you know, that's a high margin business. And that's played into, frankly, where we're dialing back from a capital expenditure standpoint as we size that fleet accordingly. We don't typically get into the specific breakouts, but there is obviously within the water infrastructure business, dewatering being a relatively large component of that and impact from the pullback in the rental revenue.","David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then lastly, I think when we last spoke, your sense was that your assumptions basically been would hold, this is back in June, provided that you didn't see deterioration in Europe. Most indications is Europe is not deteriorating. Is there some element in your business that you see different than your competitors where you're more vulnerable than your competitors?","Gretchen W. McClain","Yes. So, David, it's a great question. It's obviously something we sit back and we look at the data and analyze it. But I still feel very confident about the issue that we're facing is the market dynamics. And it's the underlying market overhang that we're seeing specifically in the public utilities, very specifically around CapEx, and then also the pullback very specifically in the mining and the industrial market, just the confidence of not being able to go spend. When I look at our win-loss data, we look at data in the industry trade. Our share, we think we're holding our share. We feel very good about where we're going. Now of course, what's important to that is to make sure we continue to launch new products and we stay close to our customers. But I do not believe this is a share issue, it's a market dynamic.","Michael T. Speetzen","And David, I guess, I'd just -- I'd point out a couple of things. If you look at our peers specifically around the wastewater side of our pumping business, where we're down about 6% in the public utilities, I think you'll see pretty similar characteristics in those results. And then in the commercial and resi side where we're up 9% and 18%, respectively, that's very strong relative to the peer group, although it's a small part of our business. Those 2 components make up just under 20% of our revenue.","David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, lastly, general commentary was MRO is up, is that the same for you or not?","Michael T. Speetzen","Our repair and overhaul or our service revenue was up in the quarter when you exclude the effect of our PIMS acquisition. We were up just over 1%. So that's pretty consistent with what we've seen coming out of the operational side of the public utilities and even the industrial market where folks are still continuing to spend on repairing and maintaining the existing equipment.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Connors of Janney Montgomery.","Ryan M. Connors - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","I had a question on -- I wanted to continue on this topic of competitive dynamics. And specifically, Mike, you mentioned price and the fact that they initiated pushing the teams to try that, maintain that, and so forth. Can you just give us a little more color around that side of things? How the market weakness that you're seeing is impacting your strategic pricing initiatives and then just probably price across the market. And then relatedly after my follow on here and relatedly, do you believe industry capacity overall is where it needs to be? Or are we at risk here of having an overcapacity situation and impact on price there that impact the end market weakness per se?","Gretchen W. McClain","Yes. So, Ryan, let me talk about pricing. If the pricing dynamics that we're really seeing is in the industrial and public utility market, that's the market that we've seen down. And also across-the-board, it is a competitive market. The market is slow and so everyone is going after competitively to win the bids that out there. Now we have a good process in place and we've been driving price and have seen up and through last year, a positive price value gap. We want to continue to drive that, but we also do not want to lose share in our core positions. And that's what we've done is we pull back to make sure that we can get the position that we need. I'd say beyond just a price perspective though, our commercial excellence initiatives that we've been driving, drive more than just price. It's about talking to our customers about our value proposition, around really thinking about our key accounts and making sure that we're driving our growth with those accounts. So I feel good about our strategy. And we are continuing to drive for profitable growth. That is key to us. But we will make sure that we don't lose share in the marketplace.","Michael T. Speetzen","Ryan, I made a comment in my prepared remarks in terms of we saw about 30 basis points of favorable margin impact in the second quarter, which was down pretty significantly from what we had in the first. We think that's indicative of where we'll be for the balance of the year. So we were anticipating when we originally gave guidance that we'd be around 1% pricing. We now see the effect of revenue is about 40 basis points positive pricing and that flows through the margin with about 30 basis points. So pretty similar in what you saw in the second quarter, holding for the balance of the year.","Ryan M. Connors - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay. And on the issue of capacity, I mean, do you believe that from industry perspective, the situation is significant enough in terms of end market weakness, but it needs to be a curtailment of capacity industry-wide. And if so, is that happening or is that not the right way to frame it?","Gretchen W. McClain","Well, I'd say from this perspective, the capacity issue, when you look at where our equipment, our technology is positioned in the marketplace, as long as the factories are up and running and so forth, our equipment is being utilized. I would say in the mines, they're not opening the mines. That industry has pulled back, but still we got a good position in the marketplace. As I mentioned earlier, though, some of the dynamics in the marketplace in terms of inventory in the markets, it's not there, pullback. So there's a growth cycle, that maybe an opportunity for us in terms of quick turnaround. But right now I don't think capacity is a big driver for us.","Michael T. Speetzen","Ryan, I think we look at it in short and long-term views. I think in the short term, we all know that distribution channel has pretty well destocked to a level that when growth is restored, we think that will obviously serve as an opportunity. And I think as we look over the longer term, we don't see that as a capacity issue.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thielman with D. A. Davidson.","Brent Thielman - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","You talked about pressure from the sequestration on the test category, which I know provide some nice margins for you guys. But what percentage of that business is impacted by these sort of issues?","Gretchen W. McClain","Yes. If you take our Analytics business, it's really the YSI business here in the U.S. They typically do work with the USGS and of course, with some universities and that typically get their funding coming from the government. It's probably 40% of that business, roughly. Now the one thing I would say is, while sequestration is having an impact, there's not been significant reductions in terms of budgets, but the pullback of funding and the confidence to go ahead with certain projects is clearly stalled in the market. And so we're watching that closely. We feel pretty confident about our position and our relationships with those end customers. And our hope is that will get released over time.","Michael T. Speetzen","And I think it's also important to point out as we did in our remarks that Europe was up about 5%, which is a strong performance in light of the current environment.","Gretchen W. McClain","And I even say even in the U.S. in our wastewater Analytics business, we feel positive signs as well.","Brent Thielman - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Sure. And then on the commercial side of things, it looks like you saw some gains there. I know it's smaller. But any sense how much of that is market growth this quarter versus sort of market share gains or any repositioning you've done with that business?","Gretchen W. McClain","I would say it's a little bit of both. I mean we had spent some time investing in new product launches and the team has done a great job in getting out and being able to show the value proposition announced. As a lot of company -- or businesses are upgrading their commercial buildings, our new products are nicely positioned to do retrofits and so forth. So I think it's a combination of growing with the market as well as taking some share.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Gaugler with Brean Capital.","Michael E. Gaugler - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division","You had mentioned in earlier prepared remarks, Europe municipals and industrials as weak end markets. As you look to future acquisitions, are you looking to exclude these areas in the end markets?","Gretchen W. McClain","So let me address it, in general, that's a tough question to answer. I mean, I'd prefer an acquisition that's going to give us a nice position to the emerging markets, which are the growing markets. But depending upon the technology and how that complements our position and being able to serve our customers more effectively, you've got to look at the technology and potentially the channel to the market as we go forward. So it's more of a strategic direction.","Michael E. Gaugler - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then my apologies if you covered this previously. In your infrastructure segment, how's your after sales service business performing? And what percentage of the sales mix is it now?","Michael T. Speetzen","Yes. So right now, in the second quarter, our aftermarket for Water Infrastructure was up about 8%, but that includes the effects of the PIMS acquisition. We're up about 2% organically. And that constitutes just under about 20% of our revenue coming out of that segment.","Operator","There appear to be no further questions at this time. I'd now like to turn the floor back over to Gretchen McClain for any closing remarks.","Gretchen W. McClain","Well, let me just summarize with -- as we reported today, we are not happy with our performance. We know we have work to do. Our markets are challenged. However, we do have some very positive signs that are taking place on the business. And we're going to continue to push forward with our new products. We're going to make sure that we're staying close with our customers and make sure that we're driving the top line. At the same time, we're going to make sure that we're positioning this company with cushion for some challenging markets that we know are still there. And we are focused on our long-term objectives and making sure that we're putting the actions in place that we can assure the long-term still plays out. This is a strong market. The macro conditions are still there. And we have the right technologies and the right talent to be able to lead the market. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's conference call.
