[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded for replay purposes. I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Lorin Crenshaw, Director of Investor Relations and Communications. Please proceed, sir.","Lorin Crenshaw","Thank you, Sandra and welcome everyone to Albemarle's Second Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. Our earnings were released after the close of the market yesterday and you'll find our press release, earnings presentation and non-GAAP reconciliations posted on our website under the Investors section at albemarle.com.","Joining me on the call today are Luke Kissam, Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Tozier, Chief Financial Officer.","As a reminder, some of the statements made during this conference call about the future performance of the company may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws. Please note the cautionary language about our forward-looking statements contained in our press release. That same language applies to this call.","Please note that our comments today regarding our financial results exclude all nonoperating or special items and reconciliations related to any non-GAAP financial measures discussed. And those reconciliations may be found in our press release or earnings presentation, which are posted on our website. With that, I'll turn the call over to Luke.","Luther C. Kissam","Thanks, Lorin, and good morning, everyone. Scott and I appreciate the opportunity to share Albemarle's second quarter results and our current views on the rest of 2013 with you today. As usual, at the end of our prepared remarks, we'll open it up for your questions.","On our last call, we expressed the view that 2013 profitability would be back-end loaded and that the second quarter results would be very similar to the first. That is exactly what we saw in the second quarter. We ended the quarter with net income of $82 million or $0.97 per share, net sales of $634 million and EBITDA of $137 million, all consistent with first quarter results and in line with our expectations.","From a segment standpoint in the quarter, Polymer closed stronger than we expected, Fine Chemistry performed roughly as expected and Catalysts was a little weaker.","Scott will go into more detail shortly about each segment. But at a high level, Refinery Catalysts results continue to be impacted by lower metal pass-throughs, customer turnarounds and less favorable mix.","In Performance Catalyst Solutions, there were 3 major factors impacting performance. The full cost of our capital expansions hit the PL during the startup and customer qualification phase without the associated revenue. European polymer catalysts customers seem to be trading down to less performance-based catalysts due to the economy. Finally, we sacrificed some share and price at some key accounts to ensure longer-term commitments.","In Fine Chemistry, Clear Brine volumes in the second quarter, while strong, did not match the first quarter pace, but increased sales and custom services offset that slight drop off.","In polymers, volumes were better than expected, but pricing continued to be under pressure in certain countries [ph]. Demand in electronics, enclosures, commercial construction and infrastructure, particularly in Europe, remained weak.","Overall, the performance of our businesses during the quarter was generally consistent with the direction of global economic environment. 60% of our sales are outside the U.S. and the sluggishness in emerging economies, particularly China, impacted demand for products. Demand in Europe remained well below historic norms.","Inventory levels and portions of the electronic segment caused customers to remain cautious. Despite this challenging environment, on a year-to-date basis, we have delivered solid EBITDA margins of 22%. Year-to-date cash from operations has totaled $179 million, in line with last year and on track for another year of excellent performance on that basis.","The second quarter also saw us being more aggressive on our share buyback program. During the quarter, we executed an accelerated share repurchase program with JPMorgan, under which we will purchase $450 million in stock, which should bring our aggregate 2013 repurchases to roughly 10% of our shares outstanding. We funded this program with a combination of cash on hand and borrowing, and put in place a commercial paper program, under which borrowing costs have recently been on the order of 30 to 40 basis points. Notably, as is normal with accelerated stock repurchase programs, aggregate short interest in our stock rose sharply during the quarter. In turn, short interest has drifted down steadily since our initial announcement, and we would expect it to return to more normal levels by year end at the end of the accelerated share repurchase contract. These actions, combined with the previously announced 20% increase in our dividend, reinforced our commitment to returning capital to our shareholders.","As we've previously discussed, from a capital structure standpoint, we expect to maintain leverage of around 1.0x net debt to EBITDA in the future and to continue looking for opportunity to increase our annual dividend and return capital to shareholders while still funding organic and strategic growth.","Now I'd like to share a few highlights related to our major capital projects, which met several key milestones during the quarter. With respect to bromine, after successfully commissioning the first phase of its expansion project in the first quarter, which doubled elemental bromine capacity, Jordan Bromine Company commissioned the expansion of its HBr and cleared completion fluids capacity in the second quarter. We didn't see any commercial sales from that expanding capacity in the second quarter, and wouldn't expect much in the third, as we worked through some raw material and startup issues, which are typical for a project such as this.","This quarter, we also announced the startup of our TEA facility in Saudi Arabia in conjunction with our joint venture partner, SABIC, with full commercial productions scheduled to begin in the second half of 2013 once customer qualifications are completed. Construction at our Yeosu, South Korea site is complete for our single-site catalyst production facility. And our team recently celebrated the topping off ceremony for the unit under construction, which will produce our PureGrowth line of products for the LED and electronics industry. That unit is expected to be online by the end of the year for qualification runs consistent with our previous reports.","The poly plant at Yeosu remains fully booked, as it engages with customers in the region to help them solve their catalyst needs. And we expect the first commercial batch to ship out of our CMU at Yeosu in the third quarter.","At our 2011 Investor Day, we outlined our long-term growth expectations in Vision 2015. 3 years into the strategy, the foundation of our business is stronger today than it was at the end of 2010. We've expanded our bromine and catalyst manufacturing footprint in areas of the world close to our customers to focus on markets, which are forecasted for growth. We've continued to manage cost to preserve relatively strong profitability despite tough economic environments, taking decisive actions to address underperforming assets and leverage our strong balance sheet to return substantial capital to shareholders.","However, our worldview and global demand expectations have certainly changed. Given slower global growth and less progress than we originally anticipated in expanding into adjacent businesses, it's become clear that we will not attain the Vision 2015 financial targets in that timeframe.","The impact of slower global growth on our ability to achieve our goals have been twofold. On the one hand, it has resulted in lower underlying demand than originally anticipated in our key markets. In addition, this lower market demand is resulting in a longer payback period on our major capital investments. The absence of a post-2010 global recovery has been well documented. Growth expectations for advanced and developing economies have fallen considerably since we laid out Vision 2015. This new economic reality and the resulting demand weakness in our key markets has led to increased competitive intensity and has caused us to selectively reduce prices, and in some instances, share in some segments in order to maintain longer-term relationships with key customers.","Our major capital projects -- once our major capital projects are fully operational and at 90%-or-so operating rates, we would still expect the associated incremental revenue to be in the range of $250 million to $400 million.","However, due to market conditions, the timeframe from startup to 90% operating rates has extended by a couple of years. In short, we invested 12 to 24 months too early. We knew there was a market risk when we made the decision to invest, but decided to go forth as we did, so that we will be prepared to meet the demands of the market and our customers rather than delay investment and risk missing that opportunity.","As we have stated previously, we are patient and are prepared to bring capacity on, as needed, in increments to meet market demand.","We still believe that we invested in the right markets. Within organometallics, we're now the only market participant with a dual global manufacturing footprint positioning us to capture growth not only in Asia and the Middle East, where petrochemical companies have invested disproportionately over the past 10 to 15 [ph] years, this demand is projected to remain strong. But also in the U.S., where projects where significant new ethylene derivatives production capacity is projected to come online over the next 5 to 6 years.","Our bromine expansion further strengthens our position as the world's low-cost bromine producer, balances our bromine production capabilities from a geographic perspective and positions us as 1 of only 2 producers with current capacity to meet any growth to the demand for bromine and bromine derivative. We've also increased our R&D focus on discovering new applications for bromine and bromine derivative products.","Our balance sheet remains strong and we continue to generate strong cash flows. As a result, we have the financial wherewithal, if we choose to exercise it, to still achieve the lower end of the Vision 2015 EPS targets through additional stock repurchases.","However, growing operating earnings remains at the heart of our strategy and is our primary focus. Overall, we remain determined to position Albemarle as an innovative high-performing company in all economic circumstances. We've invested early in the right markets, enjoyed strong financial flexibility to grow organically or through acquisition, and remain confident in the long-term fundamental driving growth in the markets we serve and in the underlying earnings and cash generation power of our businesses. With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott.","Scott A. Tozier","Thanks, Luke. I'm going to start with a review of our business segments and then turn to the details on our P&L and cash flow.","Catalysts reported second quarter net sales of $234 million, up 2% year-over-year, and segment income of $51 million, down 25% year-over-year on segment margins of 22%.","A number of unique headwinds continue to impact results that make it challenging to interpret the underlying health of the business without adjusting for them. Excluding the impact of lower metal surcharges and refinery catalysts, startup costs in Performance Catalyst Solutions and above-normal turnarounds in our Heavy Oil Upgrading segment, sales would've been up approximately 12% year-over-year and segment income would've been up 6% year-over-year.","Finally, joint venture income came in less than expected due to lower metal surcharges, softness in demand and unfavorable exchange rate impacts, particularly the yen.","Within Refinery Catalysts solutions, Heavy Oil Upgrading volumes, which is mostly fluid cracking catalysts, were up double digits year-over-year. And excluding the impact of metal surcharges, segment income was down slightly due to negative customer mix from several large customer turnarounds and lower joint venture income, particularly in Brazil.","Barring another large change to metals pricing, this should be the last quarter where metal surcharges cloud the numbers. Clean fuel technologies volumes, which are mostly hydroprocessing catalysts, also rose double digits year-over-year, driving similarly the strong levels of sales and segment income growth. The mix of clean fuel shipments was similar to last year.","Performance Catalyst Solutions revenue declined 9% year-over-year, and segment income was down approximately 17%, excluding the impact of higher startup costs. Lower revenue was driven by slower demand for polyolefins in Europe and customer destocking, resulting in lower production rates and therefore polymer catalyst demand. We continue to experience the unfavorable impact of factory startup in the quarter and still expect such cost to amount to a full year drag of -- on the order of $20 million to $25 million.","Fine Chemistry reported second quarter net sales of $176 million, down 16% year-over-year, and segment income of $34 million, down 25% on segment margins of 20%. The year-over-year profit decline was mainly driven by a lull in custom deliveries and the expiration of several high-margin contracts that positively impacted the year-ago period.","Lower pricing within HBr, elemental bromine and amines are also contributed to lower year-over-year profitability, partially offset by year-over-year growth in clear brine fluid volumes, although clear brine volumes were not as strong as Q1.","Also, sequentially, bromine and HBr pricing are holding firm.","Polymer Solutions reported second quarter net sales of $224 million, down 9% year-over-year. Segment income of $44 million was down 34% year-over-year on segment margins of 20%.","Excluding the impact of exiting our phosphorus flame retardants business, revenue was down 4% year-over-year. Our flame retardants division was responsible for most of the year-over-year decline in segment revenue and profit, mainly attributable to lower pricing in the HBCD, 8010 and minerals product lines.","Specifically, within brominated flame retardants, a year ago, we announced 2 consecutive price increases for HBCD amid a unique global supply disruption due to an explosion at a facility that produced CDDT, a key precursor. Since that time, HBCD pricing has come full circle, declining back to levels prior to our announced price increases. The impact of this decline in price on the quarter and year-over-year was in the range of around $15 million. The 8010-related price weakness is more modest, but reflects a continuation of competitive dynamics we expect to continue amid the current extended downturn in TV and PC enclosures-related demand.","Within mineral flame retardants, we have not seen any improvement from Q1, as weak European construction and automotive market trends continue to restrain our performance.","Finally, Stabilizers and Curatives revenue in segment income were essentially flat year-over-year, as weak curatives results offset growth in antioxidants, which continues to benefit from better volumes related to new customer wins, growing sales outside of China and an improved cost position in a key raw material.","Finally, second quarter corporate results were negatively impacted by a reserve taken in the amount of $3.6 million pretax or $0.03 per share, in recognition of a misappropriation of Albemarle funds by a freight bill processing and payment services vendor that recently filed bankruptcy, amid allegations of fraud committed against their customers. The vendor was responsible for auditing Albemarle freight invoices to determine whether the invoices were accurate and in compliance with negotiated freight carrier agreements then paying the freight invoices on behalf of Albemarle using funds provided by us for that purpose. We have filed a lawsuit against the relevant principals and are also pursuing claims against the bank group entity.","Now to highlight a few other P&L items for the year. U.S. GAAP reported SG&A expenses were $63 million during the quarter, up 2% year-over-year as a percentage of sales or slightly higher year-over-year at 10%, primarily related to favorable nonoperating pension costs last year. Excluding those nonoperating items, SG&A is actually down 10%, mainly due to lower incentive compensation and other personnel costs.","R&D expenses were $22 million for the quarter, up 3% year-over-year, and up 35 basis points as a percentage of revenue to 3.4%.","Second quarter free cash flow, defined as cash flow from operations, adding back pension and post-retirement contributions and subtracting capital expenditures was $35 million, up $43 million year-over-year despite lower earnings levels driven by lower working capital and CapEx levels. Our year-to-date free cash flow was up 27%, driven by lower CapEx spending.","CapEx was $48 million in the 2013 second quarter and year-to-date has been $103 million, down versus the first half of last year. For the full year, we still expect to spend approximately $175 million, a decline over 2012 spending.","Net debt rose sequentially by over $500 million this quarter to $749 million, reflecting the impact of funding the accelerated share repurchase program. As a result, net debt to adjusted EBITDA ended the period at 1.2x, up from 0.4x last quarter and just above the leverage target of 1x adjusted EBITDA and excludes restructuring charges and nonoperating-related pension adjustments.","Net working capital is $622 million end of the quarter, 8% higher than year end and at 24% as a percentage of sales is currently above our 20% target for the full year, mainly due to an increase in receivables and inventory levels that we expect to come down in the second half.","Excluding nonoperating items, we expect our effective tax rate for the full year to be 22.6%. This is a 200 basis-point reduction from our expected full year rate at the end of the first quarter, driven primarily by the geographic diversity of our income and profitability.","Our rate for this quarter was 20.6%, reflecting the need to catch up to the new full year rate.","Finally, last quarter, we provided guidance relating to the impact of the significant depreciation of the Japanese yen, which averaged approximately JPY 98 to the dollar in Q2, down 22% year-over-year. This movement impacted the P&L during the second quarter from a translations standpoint by about -- by approximately $5 million or $0.05 per share and by $9 million or $0.08 per share year-to-date.","Assuming yen exchange rates remain near current levels for the rest of the year, we can continue to project a full year negative pretax impact of around $22 million or $0.20 per share relative to our expectation heading into the year and estimate that a 1% change in the yen dollar exchange rate would impact earnings by approximately $0.01 per share.","With that, I will turn the call back over to Luke to elaborate further on our outlook.","Luther C. Kissam","Thanks, Scott. At this time, I want to take a minute to update you on the prospects for each business segment for the balance of the year.","In Fine Chemistry, we're forecasting demand for clear brine fluids to remain strong for the balance of the year. We're encouraged that drilling in the Gulf of Mexico increased sequentially during the second quarter from 46 to 57 average rigs in use, and that the average international offshore rig count is up 6% year-to-date to 321 versus the full year average for 2012.","In addition, we expect Fine Chemistry Services to show an increase in profitability in the second half, driven by a combination of new product launches and an increase in the demand forecasted by a number of our key customers. However, the overall step up in the second half profitability in Fine Chemistry Services is now lower than we expected at the time our last call.","So while we expect sequential improvement in segment income for Fine Chemistry in each of the next 2 quarters, the increase in demand is not as strong as we previously expected.","In Polymer Solutions, there have been no developments in terms of our order book or the leading indicators we monitor that would lead us to a more optimistic view than we shared on our last call. The most positive trend across our order book remains the continued improvement in our brominated polystyrene family of products, which corresponds with the Bishop's Report Connector Confidence Index. That index reached a 2-year high of 69.3 in June, and is up from its 2-year low of 35.1 reached last October, which tracks our increases in volumes in this segment.","The most recent IPC book-to-bill ratio showed further improvement of 1.12 in May, the fifth straight month of sequential gains for that rigid printed wiring board indicator.","However, absolute shipments remain at just 80% of 2010 volumes and are down year-over-year. The shipment index trend is more in sync with the underlying demand for tetrabrom, that we're observing than the direction of the book-to-bill ratio itself.","The most recent forecast from GfK caused for lower full year shipments of TV sets in both developed and developing markets, with all of the growth coming from developing markets where flame retardant usage is typically low.","On a positive note, the number of weeks of TV panel inventory declined sequentially during the quarter, but remains 3 to 4 weeks higher than historical averages, a level of excess last seen in early 2008.","The ongoing decline in global demand for PCs continued in the quarter, declining 11% year-over-year, according to Gartner. This trend would appear to reflect some combination of an expansion in the duration of the PC replacement cycle and displacement of PCs by tablets.","Finally, we've not seen improvement in the European commercial construction or wire and cable market, as both public and private investment for a new project remains at low levels with ongoing debt problems at many countries continuing to constrain spending, limiting the near-term growth prospects for HBCD and mineral flame retardants.","Overall, our interpretation of the order book patterns and leading indicators suggest that Polymer Solutions segment income in the second half is likely to be similar to the first half levels, with the third quarter being somewhat higher than the fourth.","Within Catalysts, the second half outlook for Refinery Catalysts solutions calls for fewer turnarounds of our FCC customers, driving better Heavy Oil Upgrading results. We have gotten word of new unit project startup delays that will push back certain large FCC orders from the fourth quarter to 2014.","The second half also calls for a large number of Clean Fuels Technology customer wins. However, some CFT shipments scheduled for the second quarter slipped to third quarter, and even more third quarter orders are slipping to the fourth. It isn't a question of whether we get these orders. We've got them. But there is a question of when the customer will instruct us to ship the order. We are forecasting that CFT will be considerably more profitable in the fourth than the third quarter due to current expectations on the timing of these shipments.","In short, in Refinery Catalysts Solution, it all comes down to the timing of shipments. It's the nature of this business. And I must caution you, that in both product groups, there is potential for further slippage. The timing of the shipments, while meaningful in the context of quarterly earnings, certainly doesn't impact the overall strength of our Refinery Catalyst franchise.","Our second half expectations for Performance Catalyst Solutions have also declined, driven by weaker European polymer catalyst demand and competitive actions. We've responded accordingly to maintain our market leadership, but it yielded some on price and share at some key accounts in exchange for long-term commitments. Those actions are appropriate long term, but could have a negative short-term impact.","Catalysts results for the rest of 2013 really depend on the timing of the CFT shipments for the rest of the year. Based on current information, Catalysts segment's income should be down year-over-year, with the fourth quarter expected to be substantially more profitable than the third. We currently expect total company results in the third quarter to be slightly higher than the second quarter, with the fourth quarter expected to be sequentially stronger.","For the full year, we are now projecting EPS to decline in the range of 10% to 15% from 2012, including the impact of our share repurchase program. The critical factor comes down to the timing of catalyst shipments currently scheduled for December.","In closing, we certainly have a number of headwinds to continue to manage in the near term, but we remain confident in the long-term fundamental trends driving our businesses and the underlying earnings and cash generation power of our company going forward.","With that, I'll turn the call back over to Lorin for questions and answers.","Lorin Crenshaw","Operator, we're ready to open the lines for Q&A. [Operator Instructions]","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Robert Koort from Goldman Sachs.","Robert A. Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Luke, could you explain a little bit more and talk maybe if there's any precedent on this downgrading of your Chemical Catalysts customers? I would suspect, if times are lean, they would need to get the best deal and efficiency possible. So can you just give us a historical basis for these guys going to cheaper materials or cheaper catalysts?","Luther C. Kissam","Yes. And that was specifically in Europe. So I think what the issue has been, as it seems to us, is that there hasn't been the demand for our customers' products in the markets which they're selling. So they're seeing a slowdown. So they don't need that efficiency, Bob, to get higher throughput and efficiencies in their production process. So they seem to be going to a -- at least in the second quarter, seem to be going to a lower performance catalyst. But we've already seen in July some of those orders picking up, so I think it will return to norm in due course.","Robert A. Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then I appreciate the update you gave us and the specificity around the guidance as well as your Vision 2015. Thinking about just the back of the envelope, though it would suggest to get to that low end that you said was still possible to share repurchase that you'd see 50% growth between '13 and '15. So I just want to make sure I did the math right, but it seems awfully sensational. So...","Luther C. Kissam","Yes, Bob, I hope that's the case. But I don't think you did the math right. What, if you'll look at what I'm trying -- the point I'm trying to make is, we've previously stated that we're going to try to maintain a level of roughly one-time net debt to EBITDA. Now if we were that -- that would assume you can buy back shares, $350 million, $400 million a year. My CFO's kind of shaking his head. But something kind of in that range, that doesn't prohibit us from the possibility of leveraging up further if we decide that's the right point. So I think that's what you got to look to. It's more the amount of leverage we would be willing to put on, on the business in order to acquire those shares. We'll still have fundamental underlying growth, but it's not going to be anywhere near the kind of number that you just drew out.","Robert A. Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And just to clarify, if I could, Luke. But you said if you were to lever up, maybe you could get to that, 6 75 low end?","Luther C. Kissam","Yes, that's right.","Operator","We have another question for you, and this one is from P.J. Juvekar from Citi.","P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","When you lowered expectations relating to your Vision 2015, which segment do you see the biggest shortfall? And you mentioned that your capacity was maybe 12 to 24 months earlier, are you referring to the catalyst plans or the bromine expansion or both?","Luther C. Kissam","Yes. P.J., I think if I look from where we estimate it, if you go back and look, remember we talked about polymer margins being in the 30% range by that time. And where we are today, given the dynamics and what's going on with PCs and televisions, I have a hard time seeing us get to that kinds of margins given where we are today by 2015. So I think the one where we've got the biggest gap is on polymers, and particularly in that one area. When I talk about the being 12 to 24 months early, the bromine expansion, if you look at capacity today, we clearly didn't need that capacity for another 24 to 30 months. I mean, we could have gotten along with the capacity we had. So bromine was clearly early. And on Catalysts, it's a lull today. I don't know whether it's actually 12 months early or -- it's hard to tell, because you don't know what the economy is going to do. But it's clear that we don't need it today. So on both of those, we don't need them today, but in both of those instances, because of our market leadership position, we took the position that it was better to be early and be able to meet the demands of the market as opposed to being late and running the danger that someone else steps in and fills our shoes as the market leader. So that's the decision that we took.","P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And secondly, you talked about catalyst orders slipping. Is that mainly because of customer destocking? And I think you mentioned it's on polyolefins, but are you seeing that similarly in refinery customers as well?","Luther C. Kissam","Yes -- no. When I was talking about the order slipping, I was really referring to Refinery Catalysts. So it's not a destocking at all, it's just a matter of when they're going to turn around the unit and when do they want to make the purchase. Do they want to make it in this calendar year? Or do they want to make it in the next calendar year based on when they're going to do their turnaround, how they do their annual budgets and that. But it has nothing to do with destocking in that space.","Operator","Next question comes from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just a quick question, Luke. Your guidance for the back half on earnings basis per account was very helpful. Could you just give a little bit more color as to the margin cadence Q3 to Q4 and then for the full year?","Luther C. Kissam","Yes. What I'm going to do is I'll give that to Scott, and he can look at that on the specific margins. What I would say is, I think we're going to -- that the margins this year, you got to remember those additional costs that we've got coming through for the year. We have -- we've lost the \u2013 where [ph] are pass-throughs, that the impact of the metals pass-through as well as the startup costs that we've got, it'll be impacting margins year-over-year when you look at that. So I'd be mindful of those 2 specific incidents that we've got, it will impact those margins. At the end of the day, those margins remain strong, and I think that those are ultimately mid-20%, 30%, high 20%, 30% margins in that catalyst base going forward as we discussed in our Vision 2015. So, Scott?","Scott A. Tozier","Yes. So as you look at the second half, Catalysts, we'd expect the margins in the third quarter that are similar to what we had in the second, and we expect to have improving margins going into the fourth. So really tied into that volume that Luke talked about in terms of the sequencing in the second half, so.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","That's very helpful. And then just another follow-up on Polymer Solutions, you brought up a good point in that we might be seeing the secular shift away from PCs towards tablets. Have you guys thought a little bit more about raising the content on other electronics platforms going forward? Do you see that particularly there?","Luther C. Kissam","Absolutely. What we've done is we've got a bromine task force. And that bromine task force is, the job, their sole job is to find, first of all, new applications for bromine in general. And if you look at the GBU, they've got -- the polymers GBU has a corresponding task force looking for ways that we can spread our applications in flame retardants into other areas, not only in electronics, but other areas where we don't participate today. So looking for that is bromine, as well as our Gemini product and phosphorus and mineral products as well. So a lot of work going over there, and we believe these markets are still strong. And we've got to find ways to get into other areas of markets where we don't play today, to expand our footprint.","Operator","Your next question comes from Kevin McCarthy from Bank of America.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","In the Catalysts business, I think you outlined a whole host of different issues, some of which appear to be transitory in the first half around metal surcharges, customer turnaround activities, some startup costs that you have, PCS in Europe, et cetera, creating a lot of noise here. And so I'm wondering if you could just go back up to a high level and maybe opine on how you would view the structural growth prospects in your key catalyst businesses, let\u2019s say, over the next 3 years at the industry level or at the Albemarle level. How fast do you think these businesses are growing, which might be growing faster than others? If you can just kind of reset the bar, because I think it's difficult to disentangle a lot of these moving parts here.","Luther C. Kissam","Yes. Thanks, Kevin, I appreciate that question. I think -- I love the Catalysts business, first of all. I think it's a good solid performance-driven business that delivers high margins for us. If I look at the growth and I look over the next 2 to 3 years, we've been public about the wins that we've seen in our high oil upgradings, our fluid cracking catalysts. We believe that our technology is strong for what we're going to see in a lot of areas of the world, where they're going to have to maximize that propylene yield, and that had to resid. There's the shale gas. Everybody's talking about light sweet oil in the U.S. and that is certainly there, but in emerging regions of the world. They're not going to be able to crack naptha, so they're going to look to be maximizing that propylene yield to the maximum that they can in areas of the world, and we believe our technology there. So I feel really strongly about the growth of our FCC business 2014 and on into the future. We got that business, we got to keep it, and we plan on keeping it. But our technology should be the winning technology in the bulk of these new units coming online. If you look at our win rate on hydroprocessing catalysts, it's going quite well. We've not lost any share, we hadn't -- I wouldn't say we gained any share, but we're winning the winning units that we would expect to use based on our technology and our relationship with UOP there for the new units. As you know, we've done quite well with those new unit wins, so that's been a strong partnership. And I continue to see growth in those areas of the world, particularly as you see the sulfur specifications in the areas around the world getting tighter and tighter, and that doesn't even talk about bunker fuels and things like that with regard to ship carries and things. So I continue to see a tightness in those sulfur specifications driving the use of our Clean Fuels Technologies. And Brazil's going to bring those units online. It's just a matter of timing. And when they do, we'll be there with our partners, Petrobras, to have -- capture more than enough of their share of that growing market. So that business should continue to grow. On Performance Catalyst Solutions and organometallics, we are the market leader with the world's low-cost position. And we make good margins about those products. We've got customers that are -- we've got other competitors trying to come in and become the market leader. But we're there, and we're going to maintain our market leadership. And we're going to capture more than our fair share of growth in these markets. We've worked too hard to let it go away, and we're not. So I continue to see strong growth in our organometallics and are excited about the possibilities in LED. If you listen to companies such as Philips, who has the bulk of the fluorescent market today, they're talking about the amount of volume they're going to see in LEDs and moving to LED lights. So I feel like that LED market from lights and backlighting, it keeps moving a little bit, seems to be delaying a little bit, but it's going to come. There are too many people in the industry, too many companies in that lighting industry, who are making it their commitment to move to that line of lighting. So we're going to be set there with the largest, best cost position from the key intermediates that are going to allow us to go downstream in this LED market. So I feel good about the long-term prospective for growth in LED and our organometallics. So all in all, I love Catalysts, it's got great growth, got great legs in the long term.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Second question, if I may just on clear brine, Luke, I would've thought those volumes might have increased in 2Q with the new bromine salt capacity in Jordan. Why was that not the case? And perhaps you could comment on pricing trends for clear brine.","Luther C. Kissam","Yes. If you look at pricing, what I would say is clear brines have held in there pretty fine. They haven't seen a whole lot of degradation in pricing in clear brines. It is what it is. On clear brines, it's not a matter generally of price, it's a matter of do you have the product in the area of the world where it needs to be, when they finished -- when they complete that well. So we hadn't seen a whole lot of price degradation there at all, it's been pretty solid around the globe. With regard to the volumes, they had a tough comp in the first quarter. It was the second-highest volume we'd ever had. And remember, Kevin, while we brought the JBC online and commissioned it in the second quarter, we didn't see any commercial production held from that in the second quarter at all. So I would think, to conclude the rest of the year, we're going to see similar volumes that we've seen to the first half, which would be a record year for clear brine fluids. So I feel like that business is in good hands.","Operator","Your next question comes from James Sheehan from SunTrust.","James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Just wondering if the macro situation doesn't pick up any in 2014, what actions do you think you can do to generate greater top line growth? Or is there any specific -- company-specific leverage you can pull to increase the outlook for 2014?","Luther C. Kissam","Yes. I think if you're looking at that, I would not -- you should not expect that you're going to see another plan C like we went through in 2009. We are going to be committed to bromine task force. We're going to be committed to innovation and in intimacy with our customers to grow new products. That's going to be our focus. There are levers that we can certainly pull. There are opportunities for us from a cost standpoint, from a collaboration standpoint, from a partnering standpoint that would give us more leverage across our spend and across our revenue. I'm not quite sure that we could increase the revenue because of that, but we certainly would work to maximize our bottom line.","James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And a longer-term question on your mercury sorbents business, could you just update us on your expectations for the timing of EPA Mercury removal rules? And how much of a market share of that business do you expect to pick up?","Luther C. Kissam","Yes. On the mercury removal, I haven't seen any change from the EPA. I know there are some lawsuits, but our current expectation is that it's still a 2015 type of area in the U.S. for that registration. So I would expect that we would -- you would see some increased bromine use for that. I\u2019d keep in mind that the Mercury removal, if you go to the EPA regulations, and you really need the 95%, that's really an activated carbon play. There's not as much bromine. I mean, the bromine put on that is insignificant compared to that as any carbon. So to have the material share of that, we're going to have to have a more reliable domestic source of activated carbon, and we've got -- we're working on that today. But absent being able to get a meaningful and reliable domestic source of activated carbon, our share in that market will be minimal.","Operator","We have another question for you, and this one's from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Could you -- if we think about Catalysts, and we think about last year, there was some order deferral into '13. And now it seems like there's going to be some order deferral into '14, which you speak with confidence about the orders, and it's just a question of timing of shipments. Is there a way you can sort of frame that in terms of talking about your backlog of orders? And help us understand how much of the deferral out of '13 was realized in the -- I'm sorry, deferral out of '12 was realized in the first half of '13? And is there sort of a run rate of sort of a deferral time period? And where is your total backlog today versus maybe the second quarter, again, the second quarter a year ago?","Luther C. Kissam","Yes, that's -- it mainly, all that mainly is in clear fields technologies, okay? So when you've got -- our specific situation in the FCC that I talked about is there's a new unit coming online, and that construction is being delayed, I mean, their startup is being delayed. So sometimes you have those where you have construction being delayed. They tell you a date, you got to be ready to have the -- you got to be ready to have it there, the FCC catalyst there, so it can operate when it cranks up. If you really look at HPC catalysts, if you look at last year -- let's use last year as an example. In 2012, we moved roughly 22,000 metric tons of HPC catalysts. First quarter was about 6,500. Second quarter was, if my numbers are right, about 3,700. Third quarter, about 4,600. And the fourth quarter it was about 7,300. So it's a lumpy business. And what we've seemed to see over the course of the last few years is you've seen a heavier first and a heavier fourth quarter and then a weaker middle, and that's consistent whether you're going to see the turnaround. So you see turnarounds mostly in the first quarter because they want to be up and ready for the driving season that starts in the middle of the year. What I can't tell you is I don't know how much of that high first quarter is being pushed from the fourth quarter and how much of the fourth quarter is in anticipation of that first quarter. I just don't have data to do that. And we're not -- it's not backordered like you'd think about as if I was an engineer or in a construction company. So what we have to do is, when they tell us that they need their order, when we first go to produce that product, we got to have it ready at the earliest time when they say they may need it. Because if we don't have it ready when they say they need it, they're going to go somewhere else and get it. And you can do that once, but you can't do it twice. So we can't risk that, so we got to have the catalyst ready. And then we're kind of up to their desires about when they actually want to take it, and that's based on their budgets and a lot of other items. So I didn't really -- I don't know if -- that's about as good an answer as I can give you, Vincent. I wish I could do better, but that's where we are.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","That's very helpful. And Scott, if I could just ask you to elaborate a little bit on the working capital, and you said it was largely related to receivable. And you said there were some actions you're going to take in the second half that were going to help bring that down. So is there anything -- any more detail there? And just is there anything on your operating rate going into the second half that we should know about?","Scott A. Tozier","I don't think so. On the inventory side of things, we had built some inventory in anticipation of these HPC orders that we've been talking about. And so as those get shipped, those -- that inventory will come down. So that's a big driver. The fourth quarter is where a lot of that comes out. The operating rates within Polymer Solutions, the inventory rates of Polymer Solutions are very healthy in terms of inventory. The operating rates are holding steady with what they've been in the last couple of quarters, and so we feel pretty good about that. And then I think on the receivables side, it's really just a natural effect of collections coming through as we continue to drive to collect that cash that's built up in the first half.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And so you\u2019ll expect working capital to be largely flat year-over-year? By the end of the year? Or are like...","Lorin Crenshaw","That's my expectation. That's what we're pushing for. We'll see how well we do to get there.","Operator","We have another question for you, and it's from Laurence Alexander and he's from Jefferies.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","So couple of questions. First, can you sort of give a little bit of extra clarity around what you see being pushed from this year into next year that you are reasonably sure will be an incremental tailwind for next year? I mean, just in terms of gives and takes. And also, can you address the longer-term expectations around Fine Chemicals and Catalysts in terms of margins?","Luther C. Kissam","Sure. On the orders and what pushed and might be tailwind for next year, I'm not -- we're not trying to push anything into next year. I don't -- that's not how we're going to run our business. When the customer wants it, that's when we're going to get it to them. So I don't -- right now, we're expecting everything that they told us they're going to want in the fourth quarter is going to go in the fourth quarter. And if it doesn't, if it slides in the first, then it'll slide to first. But we're not going to try to push anything to get a tailwind. So, Laurence, there isn't really anything. I can't give you -- if one order moves, it might be $1 million. If another order moves, it might be $8 million. So I can't -- without knowing exactly what's going to move and what might not, I can't give you a good answer on that, okay? With regard to margins, I still believe that Fine Chemistry is a 20%, low 20% to mid-20% margin product if we get the right custom services contracts in there. And we've done that in the past, and I think that's where the sweet spot's going to land for Fine Chemistry. On Catalysts, there's not a reason in the world once we get some of these onetime year-over-year matters behind us, there's not a reason in the world I can't be a mid-20% to 30% margin business. We've done it in the past and we certainly expect that kind of profitability going forward.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And I guess, just as a follow-up. In terms of what would you expect to see -- or what would you need to see in your external markets to bring the CapEx down closer to D&A?","Luther C. Kissam","What would I see? I'd be able to see a -- where, I don't see where I have a demand for new products. We've got 1 or 2 projects out there right now that we've actually have held up on, seeing what's going to happen with demand. Now, what's going to happen? And if we continue to see the kind of market demand in our key segments that we're seeing today, I think next year you'll see us closer to that level.","Operator","We have another question for you, and this one's from Mike Ritzenthaler and he's from Piper Jaffray.","Michael J. Ritzenthaler - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Just a quick nuance on Catalysts in the back half as you see things now, and we appreciate the timing risk on things like that. But as it sits, refining asset utilization looks a bit better year-over-year. So in 3Q, what's the relative contribution of improved volumes based on those increasing asset utilizations versus that mix that you highlighted?","Luther C. Kissam","You're talking about from our increased utilizations?","Scott A. Tozier","No, no, from refinery.","Michael J. Ritzenthaler - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Yes, the industry asset utilization improving.","Luther C. Kissam","Mike, I can't give you a good answer on that one. I'll have to get the data and get back with you. I only know what we are scheduling to ship from our customers. And what we're seeing is stronger FCC sales building during the fourth. We'll see a volume increase in FCC over the second half. And the way it's set up now in HPC, if the orders go as expected, the second quarter will be strong and the fourth quarter could be a new record.","Michael J. Ritzenthaler - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Yes. Okay, that makes sense, I guess. And then on the Vision 2015, and following up on a couple of previous questions, the bromine task force -- is the thought that perhaps the adjacencies won't be able to fill in the TV and PC gap, is that a fair way to look at it? I mean, we're looking at the food safety, the bromobutyl rubbers and the different things that you've talked about before plus all the things that were kind of being worked on in the skunkworks?","Luther C. Kissam","Yes. If you look at all that, it's going to be a tough order to fill. We\u2019re not -- what we're trying to do is this, if you really look at where we are today, we're a catalyst and bromine company. And we've got to have a focus on growing the pie, not the share, but growing the pie in bromine, okay? And new -- if you look at who's got capacity around the world, new uses of bromine benefit us more than anybody else in the industry. So we've got to have a dedicated focus to driving new applications for bromine, and that's what -- we've initiated that. And it's too early right now to give you any indication about what areas we may be looking at, what the opportunity costs or all that there. But we've got metrics, we've got milestones and we've got a list of credible opportunities for us to go after in that regard.","Operator","We have another question for you. This one's from Mike Sison from Keybank.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Luke, when I think about your portfolio of businesses, I agree that the economy's sluggish this year. But when you think about the earnings decline, you're going to show us, particularly, if you exclude the stock buyback, it sort of mirrors the decline that you saw in '09, yet you would think that -- I don't think the economy is as bad as in '09. So are you a little surprised in terms of the -- your outlook for earnings this year? And maybe just walk us through how much of the decline is, let's say, economic-related, some of the pushouts and maybe self-inflicted in the sense that you've got these costs coming in. Because I would've thought this portfolio of businesses could have performed a little bit better.","Luther C. Kissam","Yes. Well, you got to look at the comparisons, first of all. So if you look at Catalysts, we got 2 things. We got about $40 million or $50 million hitting it year-over-year between the startup costs, the volume absorption loss and the rare earth pass through. So that\u2019s $50 million a pop right there. And how much of that is self-inflicted, how much of that is market? I can't tell you. We've been operating in polymers. If you look at electronics, we've really been in a trough since 2011. So in 2009, what happened is the world ended. Nobody took any volume. It didn't matter what price you offered, because nobody was taking it. We've been now in a trough for probably 18 months, 18 to 24 months, if you really look at it, because there was some false demand in 2011 in the first half.","Scott A. Tozier","And '12.","Luther C. Kissam","Yes, and the beginning of '12. So if you look at that, we've really been in a trough. So people get antsy in a trough and try to start biting off a little bit here, and we were having to protect it. So we lost some price, Mike, on that one. So is that economic or is that competitive? I don't know. So I think that even in this downturn, you got to remember, we've got 22% EBITDA margins, okay? Now we want to do better. But in the economy that we're working in with those kind of headwinds, and you're right, some of them were self-inflicted because we invested early, intentionally did it. 22% EBITDA margins under those conditions still shows you a strong business. It's going to throw off great cash flow.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then given the balance sheet, what are your thoughts on maybe growing via acquisition? It's tough to grow organically, clearly, in this environment. Are there opportunities either to continue to build upon your businesses, or would you even consider something new, maybe a fourth leg or something to that degree?","Luther C. Kissam","Yes. I don't feel the need to do an acquisition for the sake of doing an acquisition. I think that our strategy is sound, and I think that we've got the opportunities in all these businesses to continue to grow. But we're certainly in the market looking at acquisitions. I mean, there's one, particularly in the Catalysts area. Dow's got a UNIPOL business that's up for sale. Well, certainly, I'd be looking at that business. And because it's right in our sweet spot from a catalysis standpoint, as I'm sure will a lot of other catalyst companies. So we're looking, we got a strong balance sheet. We've demonstrated in the past the ability to lever up both for acquisitions, as well as to return capital to shareholders. And we'll continue to balance that act and do both.","Operator","I'd now like to turn the call over to Lorin for closing remarks.","Lorin Crenshaw","Well, we appreciate everyone's time and interest in the company and would encourage you to call with any further questions.

Our earnings were released after the close of the market yesterday and you'll find our press release, earnings presentation and non-GAAP reconciliations posted on our website under the Investors section at albemarle.com.","Joining me on the call today are Luke Kissam, Chief Executive Officer; Scott Tozier, Chief Financial Officer; Matt Juneau, President, Performance Chemicals; and Michael Wilson, President, Catalyst Solutions.","As a reminder, some of the statements made during this conference call about the future performance of the company may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws.

Kissam","Thanks, Lorin, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin the call by culminating on the company's results and accomplishments for the year. Scott will review select highlights related to business segment performance and financial results, and I'll end by providing some perspective on our current outlook. At the end of our prepared remarks, Matt and Michael will join Scott and me to address your questions.","In 2013, Albemarle generated excellent cash flow, maintained top quartile profitability levels and returned over $660 million to our shareholders via stock repurchases and increased dividends, the highest such annual cash outlay for a single year in our history. Even with that record cash outlay, we ended the year with a strong balance sheet and a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of approximately 1x.","We finished 2013 by delivering fourth quarter net income of $88 million, or $1.08 per share, that resulted in full year earnings of $342 million or $4.06 per share. Net sales for the quarter totaled $692 million and were $2.6 billion for the full year, while EBITDA was $147 million and $576 million for the quarter and year, respectively. Profitability, as measured by EBITDA margin, was 21% for the fourth quarter and 22% for the full year.","Scott will discuss our financial results in detail in a moment. However, at a high level, Refinery Catalyst delivered double-digit volume growth over 2013. Lower metals pass-through drove over 70% of the 10% year-over-year catalyst price decline highlighted in the earnings deck accompanying our financial results with the balance being driven by product mix and lower pricing within Performance Catalyst Solutions.","Delivering superior end use performance continues to be the only sustainable way to create value in the refinery catalyst industry, and 2013 was no different. Our technologies continue to provide significant performance and financial benefits to refiners challenged to meet tighter, ultra-low sulfur diesel regulations around the world; those managing new contaminants present in North American tight oil and those in the Middle East and Asia, seeking to use heavier feedstock while pushing for higher propylene yields.","Within Polymer Solutions, we continue to manage through an uncertain environment, characterized by reduced demand, cautious inventory management by our customers and some price degradation. Nevertheless, the business maintained high margins in the -- excuse me, nevertheless, the business maintained margins in the high teens for the year.","Fine Chemistry results were down year-over-year, primarily reflecting lower utilization rates and some price degradation in the bromine and HBr.","Clear completion fluids had a fantastic year, setting revenue and volume records and was able to offset some, but not all, of the weakness in these other areas.","In 2013, we executed several initiatives that strengthened our competitive position and laid the foundation for greater innovation and organic growth going forward. We successfully started up 3 new facilities: a polyolefin catalyst center in South Korea, a world-class aluminum alkyl facility in Saudi Arabia in partnership with SABIC and a significant expansion of our bromine and clear completion fluid capacity in Jordan. These new units, while unlikely to reach utilization rates -- high utilization rates for 2 or 3 years given current market conditions, are all state-of-the-art units, designed using the best technology and benefiting from our many years of hands-on operating experience. Each site strengthens our competitive positions in key markets and will certainly pay dividends long into the future.","We also realigned our organizational structure into 2 globally integrated business units: Catalyst Solutions and Performance Chemicals. Going forward, our strategy will be to grow and strengthen our catalyst franchise; maximize the life cycles and profitability of our current bromine products; identify, develop and commercialize new applications for bromine; and improve operational excellence through One Albemarle. The reorganization allowed us to simplify our structure, reduce management layers and free up resources to redeploy to areas such as R&D, sales and business development in our core businesses to accelerate growth.","We believe the successful execution of these strategic initiatives will drive top quartile returns for our shareholders in the coming years.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Scott.","Scott A. Tozier","Thanks, Luke. Before I get into the details, please note that within the presentation we issued with our press release, we added a slide showing the year-over-year change in volumes on a metric ton basis by major product groups on both the quarterly and trailing 12-month basis. I hope that will provide some clarity around demand trends and visibility to longer-term trends rather than quarter-to-quarter variations.","Catalysts reported fourth quarter net sales of $306 million, up 4% year-over-year, and segment income of $80 million, up 2%, with segment margins of 26%.","Heavy Oil Upgrading, which is primarily comprised of FCC catalysts, experienced double-digit revenue and profit growth year-over-year, driven by new customers and strong order growth for resid upgrading applications.","Clean Fuels Technologies, which is mainly comprised of HPC catalysts, delivered year-over-year earnings growth and doubled revenue sequentially, driven largely by strong volumes.","There was a concern heading into the quarter and in our December press release about some Refinery Catalyst orders sliding into 2014. But thanks to great execution by the team, we delivered on essentially every order in the quarter.","For the full year, Catalysts reported net sales of $1 billion, down 6% year-over-year, and segment income of $246 million, down 16%, resulting in segment margins of 25%.","From a revenue perspective, lower metals pass-through offset solid volume growth. FCC enjoyed double-digit volume growth in 2013 despite heavy customer turnarounds during the first half of the year. HPC volumes also were up in the mid-single digits in 2013.","Excluding the timing impact of the metal surcharges in Refinery Catalyst, segment income for the segment was down 12% year-over-year. The lower profitability was driven by lower profitability within Performance Catalyst Solutions, driven by increased fixed costs related to new capacity additions, lower sales prices and softer market conditions.","Profitability within the Refinery Catalyst division was essentially flat year-over-year, excluding the impact of metal surcharges, with strong volume growth offset by an unfavorable mix in CFT.","Polymer Solutions reported fourth quarter net sales of $201 million, up marginally year-over-year, and segment income of $27 million, down 24% with segment margins of 14%. The revenue increase reflected favorable mineral flame retardants and stabilizers trends, offset by lower brominated flame retardant volumes and pricings, particularly within products for the enclosures and construction foam insulation end markets.","The double-digit profit decline, despite flat revenue, was driven by a combination of lower pricing and utilization rates, as well as significant volume growth in lower-margin mineral flame retardants and volume decline in the higher-margin brominated flame retardants.","For the full year, Polymer Solutions reported net sales of $864 million, down 3% year-over-year and segment income of $158 million, down 22%, resulting in segment margins of 18%. Both top and bottom line results were principally driven by lower flame retardant pricing and higher costs in flame retardants and mix issues offsetting mid-single-digit volume growth for both mineral and brominated flame retardants.","Notably 2 to 2.5 points of the total 3% decline in Polymer Solutions sales were a function of the reversal of substantial HBCD price increases taken in 2012 in the wake of a major industry supply chain disruption.","Fine Chemistry reported fourth quarter net sales of $185 million, down 4% year-over-year, and segment income of $29 million, down 20%, delivering segment margins of 15%. Segment results for the quarter were primarily driven by clear completion fluid volumes coming in lower than originally expected, due to tight inventory management at year end by certain Middle Eastern and North American customers and a number of delayed well completions in the Gulf of Mexico. These factors offset year-over-year growth in custom services, which finished the year with a strong second half, driven by agriculture and electronic materials-related contracts.","Annual net sales were $750 million, down 4% year-over-year, and segment income was $132 million, down 21% year-over-year on segment margins of 18%.","Within Performance Chemicals, revenues rose 2% but profits were down 10% as record complete -- clear completion volumes in revenue were offset by lower HBr and elemental bromine pricing and higher fixed costs related to new capacity.","Additionally, 2013 was the first year of the change from a 70-30 to a 60-40 profit-sharing arrangement at Jordan Bromine Company, which impacted our bottom line by approximately $6 million in 2013.","Overall, for the quarter, we reported all-in diluted earnings per share of $1.91 or $1.08 per share, excluding special items. The largest special item related to a $139 million pretax pension mark-to-market actuarial gain, which amounted to $1.08 gain per share after taxes. This gain was caused by a combination of positive asset returns in the pension portfolio and an increase in our discount rate from 4% to 5%, roughly tracking the movement of 10-year treasuries.","Offsetting that gain were pretax charges of $33 million or $0.27 per share after-tax for termination benefits related to a workforce reduction initiated in connection with realigning our operating segments. Most of these reductions will be completed in the first quarter of 2014.","I would caution you that this exercise was to enable us to redeploy resources to drive growth and we do not expect to take these savings to the bottom line in 2014.","Our quarterly and full year effective tax rates were 19.7% and 21.9%, respectively. The full year rate is down 260 basis points compared to the 2012 rate of 24.5%, driven by the geographical mix of our profits.","R&D expense ended the year at $82 million, up 4%, as we continue to invest in a number of organic growth opportunities. For the full year, R&D expenses as a percent of revenue were 3%, up roughly 30 basis points year-over-year.","SG&A expenses, adjusted for nonoperating pension and OPEB items, ended the year at $263 million, down 3% versus 2012, driven by lower performance-based incentive and compensation levels. And we're essentially flat as a percentage of net sales at 10%.","Free cash flow, defined as cash flow from operations adding back pension and postretirement contributions and subtracting capital expenditures, was $291 million for 2013, up 27% from 2012, due mainly to lower capital expenditures.","During the year, we repurchased $582 million of our stock or approximately 9.2 million shares at an average price of $63, ending the year with a diluted share count of 80.1 million shares. There are approximately 6 million shares remaining in our current board authorization.","Overall, our balance sheet remains strong with net debt of $588 million, excluding nonguaranteed JV debt, up $383 million year-over-year, and a net debt-to-EBITDA of 1.0x, right on target with our expectations.","Net working capital as a percentage of sales ended the year at 23% versus 21% in 2012 as net working capital rose to $612 million. The increase was primarily driven by higher accounts receivables. Although the successful shipment of several large HPC orders toward year end did skew receivable levels somewhat higher, overall, we were simply not successful at reducing net working capital, an opportunity that will receive greater focus in 2014.","As we stated on our last earnings call, our initial target is to permanently reduce working capital by at least $100 million by 2015 and we have initiatives underway right now to ensure we make meaningful progress toward this objective in 2014.","Looking forward to 2014, we expect CapEx to decline to somewhere between $120 million and $140 million, a level that is still expansionary, but down 20% year-over-year.","We expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 25%, excluding special items, driven by our expected geographic mix and the current lapse of U.S. tax credits, including the R&D tax credit.","Foreign exchange-wise, we hedge our balance sheet exposures. However, our most significant exposure from an earnings standpoint relates to the euro and Japanese yen. For every 1% change in the euro-dollar exchange rate, we would expect a pretax earnings impact of approximately $750 million. And for every 1% change in the yen-dollar exchange rate, we would expect a pretax earnings impact of approximately $1 million.","There don't appear to be any major increases in raw material costs in 2014, but we continue to monitor it very closely. We are currently forecasting an increase in energy costs, however, of approximately $10 million to $12 million. Given the current weather conditions in the U.S., we are forecasting a headwind in the first quarter as well. If U.S. natural gas prices stay where they are for the full year, we would have an additional $6 million to $8 million of headwind on the year, totaling $16 million to $20 million.","Additionally, we would expect corporate expenses to increase $25 million to $30 million over 2013, driven by performance-based incentive compensation.","As previously announced, effective January 1 of this year, we realigned our organizational structure into 2 Global Business Units: Performance Chemicals will include Fire Safety Solutions, Specialty Chemicals and Fine Chemistry Services, consolidating the company's bromine, mineral and custom manufacturing assets. The Catalyst Solutions GBU will include Refinery Catalyst Solutions, Performance Catalyst Solutions and Antioxidants, consolidating our assets focused on the refining and petrochemical industry.","We will report in this manner for the first time when we release our first quarter earnings in April. However, in March, we plan to release an 8-K providing 4 years of restated historical financial data. Upon that 8-K being filed, as usual, we will be readily available to answer any question that you might have as you adjust your financial models.","With that, I will turn the call back over to Luke to talk further about our outlook.","Luther C. Kissam","Thanks, Scott. Looking at 2014, we expect double-digit segment income growth from Catalyst with Refinery Catalyst expected to be the largest contributor to our company's overall earnings growth for the year.","Within Heavy Oil Upgrading, we expect to benefit from continued strong demand globally for FCC catalysts, designed to handle heavy resid-based feedstocks, maximize propylene production and address the metal contaminants found in North America shale oil. We have ample capacity to meet our growth objectives in light of a capital efficient de-bottlenecking project at our Bayport facility that will be completed in the second half of this year, which will increase our FCC capacity there by approximately 15%. FCC is poised for a great 2014.","Improved earnings in Clean Fuels Technologies will be driven by solid volumes, better product mix and increased catalyst intensity driven by more stringent fuel specs.","Sulfur specs in fuels continue to decline around the world. In 2014, China is planning to decrease the maximum sulfur content in gasoline from 150 parts per million to 50, and in diesel from 350 parts per million to 50. Brazil is also expected to mandate ultra-low sulfur diesel by commercial vehicles within cities this year. Saudi Arabia appears committed to reducing sulfur in gasoline and diesel to 10 parts per million by 2016, down from 500 parts per million for diesel as recently as 2012. Gasoline sulfur levels in the U.S. could decline by more than 60% to 10 parts per million by 2017 if the EPA's most recent proposal is approved. All of these bode well for continued growth in our CFT business.","In Performance Catalyst Solutions, we expect top line growth to be offset by a combination of the full year impact of fixed costs associated with the units brought online last year, the full year impact of TEA volumes previously produced in our U.S. facility shifting to the new joint venture plant in Saudi Arabia and a continued highly competitive environment within aluminum alkyls.","Within Polymer Solutions, our view of third-party market indicators and order book trends has led us to assume that bromine pricing trends stabilize, but earnings remain flat overall in 2014. The IPC book-to-bill ratio, which has historically correlated reasonably well with our tetrabrom volumes, has now declined for 3 straight months to 0.91.","PC shipments declined by between 6% and 7% in the fourth quarter, according to IDC and Gartner, and by roughly 10% for the full year. Both data providers project a smaller rate of decline in 2014 relative to what occurred in 2013, but both expect further declines.","From a TV standpoint, third-party projections call for a 1% decline in global sales in 2014 with units in the developed world, where fire safety standards are most stringent, declining 4%, offset by growth in the developing world.","The one sector of electronics where indicators are more favorable is connectors. The connectors market is exceptionally diverse, encompassing areas such as automobiles, household appliances and mobile networks and devices, in addition to PCs and TVs. In December, the Bishop Report Connector Confidence survey was at 74.1, up from November and almost 27 points higher year-over-year with North America and Asia driving much of the improvement.","Throughout 2013, our order patterns for brominated polystyrenes were consistent with the upward trend of this survey, although they have not shown further acceleration in the early weeks of 2014.","Mineral flame retardants demand in Western Europe stabilized in 2013, but pricing was a struggle. We are forecasting modest year-over-year growth within wire and cable applications in automotive, construction and infrastructure, the primary application impacting this business. Our efforts to grow this business in the Asia Pacific region are continuing to meet our expectations, resulting in sales to that region becoming a meaningful percentage of this business.","Our Curatives and Stabilizers business is expected to follow a strong 2013 performance with another year of growth, driven by new lubricant antioxidant customers, polymer antioxidant growth in China and an improved global infrastructure environment benefiting curatives.","We expect modest segment income growth from Fine Chemistry in 2014, nearly entirely driven by Performance Chemicals as the profit outlook for Fine Chemistry Services is flat.","Within Performance Chemicals, growth is primarily expected to come from clear completion fluids, elemental bromine and specialty bromides. Specifically, after an exceptional 2-year run, clear completion fluids are expected to grow at a healthy rate but more slowly than in recent years.","Based on the current delivery schedule of new rigs, the offshore Gulf of Mexico rig count is forecasted to rise from 43 today to near 50, up 16% by year end with growth in developing countries, particularly the Middle East and Asia, continuing to drive growth in fuel consumption, offsetting flat to declining demand in developed markets.","Factors that could cause downside to our view would include a continuation of the recent destocking and well completion delay episodes that we observed in the fourth quarter and a meaningful decline in oil prices or increase in regulatory pressure on offshore drilling, which can lead to delays in deepwater and ultra deepwater spending","Fine Chemistry Services has a solid pipeline and good growth in contracts linked to electronic materials and agricultural applications. However, in 2014, profits will likely be flat.","2014 will be a year of transition in that we will lose almost half of our 2013 profits from Fine Chemistry Services due to the expiration of certain contracts. Our new projects will offset that loss and set us up nicely for future growth. The long-term prospects for this business are better than ever.","As we roll up the various factors by business, our plan anticipates revenue growth of the order of 7% to 8% to around $2.8 billion for 2014.","From a segment income standpoint, we expect growth in the range of 2% to 7% to between $485 million and $510 million with Catalysts driving the bulk of that growth, Polymer Solutions should be essentially flat and Fine Chemistry up slightly. This would result in cash flow from operations growing in the range of 10% to 15% to between $475 million and $500 million with some meaningful upside if we are successful at reducing our days of working capital through our One Albemarle initiatives.","We will deploy that cash to drive shareholder value and would expect to end the year, absent a meaningful transaction, with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of approximately 1x.","To that end, from a capital allocation standpoint, you can expect us to allocate our cash flow roughly as follows: 25% for CapEx, 10% for restructuring-related payments, 10% for potential investments and the balance or roughly 50% for dividends and share repurchases.","Consistent with that approach, we anticipate entering into an accelerated share repurchase program in the coming weeks for the repurchase of approximately $50 million of stock by the end of April. And absent an acquisition, we would expect to continue to enter into accelerated share repurchase agreement of a shorter duration throughout the year.","In closing, in 2014, we celebrate 20 years as a public company. During that time, our revenue has grown at a 5% CAGR, segment income has grown 9% per year and our market capitalization has risen at a 53% CAGR.","Our challenge going forward is to extend our legacy of being among the highest performing, most innovative companies in the global specialty chemicals pace.","I am confident that we are taking appropriate strategic steps towards extending our impressive historical track record and that we have the employees, management team, assets, strategic position and financial strength to meet that challenge.","With that, I'll turn the call back over to Lorin for questions and answers.","Lorin Crenshaw","Thanks, Luke. Operator, we're ready to open the lines for Q&A at this time. [Operator Instructions] Please proceed, operator.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Robert Koort with Goldman Sachs.","Neal Sangani - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","This is actually Neal Sangani on for Bob. I was hoping you could discuss maybe a little bit about the cadence of margins in Fine Chemistry. You brought on some new capacity and are absorbing the fixed costs. Is the fourth quarter absorption or the margin decline kind of where you're expecting things to reset absent utilization improvement?","Luther C. Kissam","Yes, I'll turn it over to Matt. But I think if you really look, we were at the high teens in 2013 overall, and that I think we could maintain that. I think it's difficult to look at any one quarter because you have moving parts back and forth, but I think the cadence of it for the full year is going to be in that range. Go ahead, Matt.","Matthew K. Juneau","No, I would say that is right. If you look overall, fourth quarter did have some impact because of slightly lower clear brine volumes. We're seeing this come back in the first quarter. So I think if you look at 2013 on average, it gives a better predictor of 2014 then just the fourth quarter.","Neal Sangani - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then in Catalysts, I know you get the question a lot, but maybe you could update us on the latest on your thoughts on FCC market share, given the positive outlook?","Luther C. Kissam","Yes, I'll let Michael talk about that. From a share standpoint, though, if you looked in the fourth quarter, there wasn't a whole lot of movement for the year on market share in FCC. We won a few, we lost a few, but overall, is roughly the same. Michael?","D. Michael Wilson","Yes. I mean, I think for the year, overall, our share percentage is up 1% to 2%. So not a big movement there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citi.","John Hirt","This is actually John Hirt sitting in for P.J. Can you talk about where your inventory levels are for brominated flame retardants and non-BFR derivatives and just sort of put that in the context of how that might compare to the previous year?","Luther C. Kissam","Yes. I'll let Matt talk the details. But I think that really in the bromine chain, we've done a fairly good job of pushing down our inventory levels there. And Matt can talk more about details.","Matthew K. Juneau","If you look at brominated flame retardants, actually we brought inventory down on a days basis throughout the year. And we ended the year in what I would characterize as about the appropriate level of inventory for the brominated FR business, so we don't have an inventory overhang. If you look at the non-FR bromine derivatives, similar story, except in the fourth quarter we did get caught just a little bit by the slowdown in clear brines and we'll be adjusting that as the year goes on.","John Hirt","Okay. And then as a follow-on to that, where are your utilization rates today for your bromine assets and then also for the BFRs? And where do you see those going in the first or second quarter?","Luther C. Kissam","We're not -- we had to be careful there because, remember, we added some capacity in bromine and in clear brine. So if you look, overall, and Matt, I think this is generally where we are, if you look at bromine rates at -- for 2013, we ended the year roughly at about 68% for bromine and we're going to run a little -- maybe a little bit slower in the first quarter because of what Matt said in clear brine, a little bit stronger in the second quarter, but for the year maybe up 1 point or so but about there for bromine. If you look at all BFRs, for the year, we ran about a little over 50% capacity utilization for -- on all brominated flame retardants and we'll again start off the year a little slower because maintaining that inventory and Matt will talk later, I'm sure, about Chinese New Year. But we'll end the year roughly -- to hit the forecast roughly the same level as we did '13.","Matthew K. Juneau","That's exactly right. Nothing to add, that's exactly right.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.","Jermaine R. Brown - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","This is actually Jermaine Brown sitting in for Dave. Two questions. Within brominated flame retardants, where do you see pricing trends -- where do you foresee pricing trends going forward? And what was the success rate of the price increases late last year? And then what do you expect volume growth to be for BFR in 2014?","Matthew K. Juneau","Okay. I'll take that one if you look overall at pricing trends, clearly, we've had some price degradation, but that has mostly stabilized at this point. And we are really seeing 2014 as roughly flat with the way we ended 2013 right now. And if you look specifically at what we did in the fourth quarter when we announced the price increase on tetrabrom, we did see some support for that from the major producers of tetrabrom. We didn't see the type of support we'd like to see if you look specifically at the Chinese-type suppliers.","Jermaine R. Brown - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Understood. And for the 2 polyolefin catalyst plants that came on in Korea and Saudi Arabia, what do you expect the impact from the start-up costs to be in 2014?","Luther C. Kissam","I think the start-up costs -- we keep calling start-up costs. There are some that are actually start-up costs, but what you're seeing in '13 -- what you saw in '13 and what we're seeing in '14 is the full year impact of the cost that it takes to operate those sites and they're still in qualification runs, so you're not getting the revenue to offset that start-up, if you will. So I just want to be sure -- those start-up costs aren't going away. The costs are going to be there. We need revenue to fill it up, post qualification, to be able to drive that. Why don't I turn it over to Scott or Michael for more detail there.","D. Michael Wilson","Yes, I think to quantify the cost that Luke's talking about is probably in the midteens in millions that we'd expect is really in 2 components: it's the additional operating costs that we brought on, plus the fact that we'll be shifting some volumes from production in Pasadena to our joint venture in Saudi Arabia. So that's part of that midteens millions headwinds I'm talking about, in addition to the costs that we've had.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.","Ian Bennett - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","This is Ian in for Vincent. In Polymer Solutions, I think some comments were made last year about $160 million or so of costs being taken out of the business since 2009. And I had kind of thought of trough earnings in that business around the $35 million level. So if you'd just talk what's changed since 2009 and I guess since the expectations were kind of laid out in the end of 2012 and the beginning of 2013?","Luther C. Kissam","Yes, I'll take that. I mean, largely what's happened is you've seen costs continued to rise that we've had there. Some of it is raw material costs, some of it is depreciation, some of it is costs relative to people because you've got kind of 3% going up every year. You've also got price from 2009 till the day you've seen it go up and then you've seen it come back down. So Matt can add to it, but just a combination of increased prices, but the bigger driver is some price degradation.","Matthew K. Juneau","That's an accurate statement. We've had some cost creep that we're working on right now. And we have had some price erosion, as we've talked earlier. Again, that price erosion is basically, at this point, stabilized as we enter 2014.","Ian Bennett - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Understood. And for that price erosion, are you guys seeing in the market other competitors that are shutting down, that are not profitable at these levels? Or what is your expectation? Or is it just tied to the volumes that we're seeing in PCs and TVs?","Luther C. Kissam","We're not seeing anybody shutting down anything. I mean, I think at the end of the day when you look at bromine, it all comes down to what happens with the Chinese bromine because those guys will run for cash and at the levels -- even today at the levels that everybody is glowing [ph] about, about the profitability. We're still making a very good return on bromine and there's a -- from a cash operating standpoint, there's a lot of cash to be made at these levels. It's an excellent business. We get wonderful leverage on it. And I think people forget sometimes that the value that it creates and the cash it generates at the levels that they are here, we're still talking. If you look at polymers, I guess, the way I would say this, if you look at polymers, we had high teens margins. But not every product across the portfolio has average margins. And if you look at that, your brominated flame retardants are going to be at much higher than that average that you see in polymers and any antioxidants and mineral flame retardants is going to be much lower. So at the end of the day, you're looking at a blended average of that margin. It's still -- there are very good margins to be made in these brominated flame retardants at the prices that we saw in 2013.","Ian Bennett - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Got it. And just one last quick one. On the working capital reduction, how much of the $100 million is attainable in 2014? And what kind of incentives are being put in place to reach that goal?","Luther C. Kissam","It's roughly half. And there are incentives tied to management's AIP and long-term incentive to ensure that we're properly incented to drive that working capital out and keep it out.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies.","George D'Angelo - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","This is actually George D'Angelo on for Laurence today. What is your initial expectation for the HPC mix outlook in 2014?","Luther C. Kissam","Michael?","D. Michael Wilson","Yes, we're actually anticipating a favorable mix in HPC relative to what we saw in 2013. So that's going to be a contributor to earnings growth in that division.","George D'Angelo - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","And on Polymer Solutions, can you guys give any pricing outlook?","D. Michael Wilson","We have budgeted pricing roughly flat with the way pricing ended the year. Obviously, we'll be looking for opportunities if demand trends would help us. But right now, we're assuming flat pricing.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Sheehan with SunTrust.","James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Just on the acquisition front, you alluded to some potential for doing acquisitions this year. I'm just wondering if you could provide your insights on to how you're looking at the acquisition market right now. Do you see bolt-on acquisitions focused on technologies or maybe focusing on achieving cost positions? What are your priorities there?","Luther C. Kissam","Yes, from a priority standpoint, acquisitions need to be consistent with the strategy that we laid out. So that strategy is strengthen and grow our Catalysts franchise and really seek new applications for bromine. So if you look at it, I can see either an -- any acquisition or any type of bolt-on or collaboration will be something that would either be in the bromine area to drive -- strengthen our current products or drive additional use or to strengthen and grow our Catalysts business. So I think you can look for us to work on projects in those areas.","James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then on Catalysts, what's your outlook for FCC pricing in 2014?","D. Michael Wilson","This is Michael. We're actually expecting higher pricing in 2014. We announced a price increase, I think, midyear 2013. We're in the process of implementing that just given contract cycles and customer cycles. It will -- that's going to happen over a couple of year time period. So I would say prices will be modestly higher in FCC 2014.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Ritzenthaler with Piper Jaffray.","Michael J. Ritzenthaler - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","On the pricing weakness called out in PCS, I'm assuming it's mostly concentrated in polymer catalysts. I guess is that a fair assumption? And can you give more detail about why pricing was weak there?","D. Michael Wilson","Yes, you're exactly right. The pricing weakness is in the polymer side of the business and it's really related to global overcapacity for organometallics that we sell into that segment. We're in part responsible for that with capacity that we brought on, but others have brought capacity in as well. So that's a very competitive market at the moment.","Michael J. Ritzenthaler - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Luke, does the strategic decision to pursue the Saudi JV to secure those volumes look more favorable now than it did, say, 12 months ago?","Luther C. Kissam","I would say that as we get it up and running -- one thing I'd say is that is the best aluminum alkyl facility in the world. It is the most efficient and it should be the low cost once we get it up and running and we expect to do that. So we're going to be strategically able to supply that growing region better. Do I wish that all of -- a lot of that volume wasn't coming out of our Pasadena site? Certainly. But that's the nature of the beast. And I think what you've got to watch is what happens in Europe over the long term, and also when these other ethylene and polyethylene plants come online in the U.S. over the next 5 years, we're going to be in the single best competitive position of all the producers. So we may be a little early, but I still love it from a competitive standpoint.","Michael J. Ritzenthaler - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","And just a follow-up, if I could. Trying to reconcile pretty differing world views on the bromine outlook for 2014 that we've heard recently. So I guess, the question is what industry factors could lead to results that are more positive rather than just flat year-over-year? Is it all shouldered by how much price can be captured? Or are there other factors that we should be watching?","Luther C. Kissam","I'll let -- as a general rule, and I'm going to turn it over to Matt for a second, if you don't mind. I think as a general, anytime you're looking at anything, it's demand. So what is the demand out there for the products? Are consumers going out? Are they buying in the developed world -- where you have flame retardant standards, are they buying the electronics? What kind of electronics are they buying? Are they building houses? Is the construction market moving? Is automotive moving? So there's that whole host of consumer-driven confidence on what's going on with markets to drive more demand that you've got to look to. And then we've got to be competitive from a resin system or the products that we're in, in those ultimate end markets. So it's not -- I don't think it's one thing that I can -- that you could point to. But I think overall, we need demand to pick up. And once demand picks up, we have unbelievable leverage for every additional pound of bromine that is produced and where it goes and what it does. And that -- I'm only focusing on the electronics. But Matt, you want to talk a little broader about mercury and other...","Matthew K. Juneau","Yes. Maybe worth adding a little bit on the non-FR side. So obviously, we had a very good year on volume in clear brines in 2013, as Luke alluded to. The trends out there for 2014 are for continued growth in that business. And we feel we are very well positioned when you look at where our assets are, having the assets in the Middle East and the assets here in the U.S. or the Gulf of Mexico, which are still the 2 key regions for clear brine demand. So our outlook for that business is for growth. Luke alluded to mercury as well. Mercury -- total demand for mercury control is growing and it will continue to grow as we get into 2015 when the EPA mandates come into play. So that's going to also drive, I think, additional consumption of bromine. Anything that drives additional tightening of the overall bromine supply demand chain is ultimately good for the industry from a supply\/demand point of view, obviously.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Aleksey V. Yefremov - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","This is Aleksey Yefremov for Kevin. In one of your slides, you talked about a net debt-to-EBITDA floor of 1.0. I guess the question, should we really consider this a floor such that if you go below that level, you'd be looking to -- for maybe incremental share buybacks? And a related question, are you planning to use additional debt for buybacks in 2014?","Luther C. Kissam","Yes. I'll let Scott answer that.","Scott A. Tozier","Yes, so we set a target for net debt-to-EBITDA of 1x. So as we get close to that with cash generation, we're evaluating whether or not we need to do additional buybacks or not. Our expectation, as Luke mentioned in the call, was that starting in the first quarter, we're going to do about a $50 million share buyback. That will take about 3 months to do and be completed around the end of April. So started driving toward that, holding that target. So call it a floor or a target, that's really the goal, is to maintain around that 1x net-debt-to-EBITDA. Will we increase debt? Probably not. I think we'd have to reevaluate that target long term for us to be able to drive toward that increase in debt for that situation.","Luther C. Kissam","But if we look -- if you fast-forward into the future and you see that we're not going to be able to close a meaningful transaction consistent with our strategy at a price that we think delivers, we can deliver long-term value to our stakeholders and -- because we're generating sufficient cash that we can fund our maintenance capital, the growth capital fairly easily, then you could see a situation where you could go above that 1.0. That's not a magic line. That's not the Mendoza Line in baseball or anything like that. It's just the line that we've done that we think that gives us a lot of flexibility. We can always lever up if we need to, but that gives us the room as we look at acquisitions to go -- to fund our strategy to give us a comfort level that we can have that capability while at the same time delivering real returns to our shareholders.","Aleksey V. Yefremov - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great. And just a follow-up on polymers, on BFRs pricing, really. I think Luke, you mentioned that returns and margins in that business are fairly good still. And given that fact, what gives you confidence that there is no further downside to pricing in that business? Are your competitors also enjoying good returns or maybe they're close to cash costs at this point?","Luther C. Kissam","Yes, well, first of all, I don't know what my competitors' returns are other than what I read in their public documentation. And a lot of producers in China have no idea what their costs are. I mean, I have a view but I don't know whether it's accurate, just I believe. So I don't know what kind of money they're making. I know from what the figures we have that there's still some room in there. But you also got to look at, at some point, what's happening in the marketplace. And as that volume grows with this mercury emission, whether it's bromine use somewhere else, whether so on, that gets allocated and becomes less and less volume available to fund some of these products that are at low pricing right now. So there's going to be opportunities, I think, for pricing there. I mean, if you look at the pricing, there's still a little ways it could go. I mean, sure, you could -- I lived through 2009, so I could always find a scenario where it could go lower. But that's certainly not our expectations today. And as I think Matt said, we've seen stabilization in the second half of 2013 and don't see any reason -- don't see anything right now on the horizon that would lead us to believe there is precipitous potential for a default further.","Matthew K. Juneau","And we'll get another view of the market clearly after Chinese New Year. So we're in that stage right now that you're in every year with this business, where you're waiting to see how things are going to play after Chinese New Year. But there's nothing out there now to say that demand is going to hit south on us. We don't predict that of all.","Aleksey V. Yefremov - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then final question, if I may. You mentioned that operating rates in BFRs are at around 50% and will perhaps remain there for a while. Is there an opportunity to cut fixed costs given this view?","Luther C. Kissam","Well, it will be tough to cut too many fixed costs out. We're always looking at a way to do so. There is some leverage that we pulled back in 2009 that we haven't pulled yet because, quite frankly, we haven't had to do so. There's still cost levers that we can pull. We're all working on continuous cost improvements. And I think there's opportunities there should the situation warrant it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Sison with KeyBanc.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Welcome back to these calls, Michael, so I figured I'd start with you. In terms of your new segment here, maybe give us a perspective of how you're going to manage the Catalysts business maybe differently from the past, and any thoughts on how you can accelerate filling up that capacity expansions that were made over the last year there?","D. Michael Wilson","Sure, Mike. And first of all, I'm glad you didn't ask me about [indiscernible] pricing. These are really performance businesses. And we sell based upon that performance in solving customer problems. And the comment that I made to our leadership team in the last week was we may ship products that we really create value by solving customer problems. So we're going to manage this as a specialty business. Our objective is to accelerate growth in Catalysts and I think we've got the platform and the technology to do that. Technology leadership is going to be very critical to us going forward. It's key to our long-term success. On the Performance Chemicals side, the PCS side, where we've got some overcapacity situation, we're working very hard to build the volumes to fill out that capacity. I think you've got a market segment overall and polyolefins is probably growing today at 5% per year. As Luke pointed out, that could get accelerated as some new projects come on in the U.S. because of the advent of the shale gas. But In addition, participation in the electronics segment of that, specifically LED segment, we're looking at double-digit growth rates. So yes, we do have excess capacity today, but I think we'll fill that out over time and the returns and the economics of that business will improve sequentially as we do that.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then one's for you, Luke. You guys do have a cost savings, meaningful cost savings program, being implemented here. Can you update us on what the total potential cost savings are? I know you want to redeploy a good amount of that to organic growth. But if you need some help to generate some earnings growth this year, could you use some of that to get to where you want to this year?","Luther C. Kissam","Yes. I mean, Scott, on a full year basis, it's roughly $30 million, right? It's roughly $30 million that we're freeing up to redeploy, but there's a lot of timing issues on that, Mike, about when people leave and when new people come in. So I really -- I caution you, guys. I'm going to redeploy that money. I'm going to redeploy it in the R&D, into business development and growth so that we can kick -- we've got to maintain our competitive advantage in the Catalysts business. I could listen to the competitors calls. You know that their technology that they're working on is aimed right at our sweet spot. We've got to find new uses for bromine and accelerate it. We will continuously in this demand questions that we're getting on all these calls and rightly so about what the demand is. So we've got to deploy those resources, and I'm not taking it to the bottom line.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Got it. So your outlook for this year for the segments do not include the cost -- any cost savings?","Luther C. Kissam","They do not. And Mike, your model should not include it either or you will be hot.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Steve Schwartz with First Analysis.","Steven Schwartz - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","You mentioned that you had fulfilled all your catalyst orders in the fourth quarter. So I'm wondering what does the run rate through 2014 look like for FCC and HPC?","Luther C. Kissam","When you say run rate, you mean sales volume or do you mean production?","Steven Schwartz - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","The shipment trend because it can be volatile, right, from quarter-to-quarter? So I'm wondering, if at this point, you're seeing any significantly up or significantly down quarters?","Luther C. Kissam","Go ahead, Michael.","D. Michael Wilson","Yes, this is Michael Wilson. I think as you look at sort of the calendarization of our outlook, it's going to strengthen from the first quarter as we go into the second and third quarters. So the first quarter sequentially will be down a bit from the fourth quarter. We had a very strong fourth quarter, but still good in the first quarter and then we'll see it strengthen then as we go into the second and third quarters. So I think typically people would tell you that, at least on the FCC side, the first and fourth quarters typically are weaker quarters. That hasn't necessarily been the case over the last couple of years, but it is a general trend.","Steven Schwartz - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","Okay. And so -- and that trend does apply consistently between HPC and FCC?","Luther C. Kissam","I think as you look at the breakdown between those and you think about the first quarter, FCC will be stronger in the first quarter than CFT just because of the quarter that we had in the fourth quarter in CFT. But if you look at Refinery Catalyst overall, we're just going to see a strengthening as we go forward.","Steven Schwartz - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","Okay, sounds good. And then, if I could, as my follow-up. I think in your prepared remarks, Luke, you said 2 to 3 years for high utilization on these new facilities. At what point do you think you get to a utilization rate where they are no longer a headwind?","Luther C. Kissam","Well, I hope that end of this year, on a run rate basis, we'll be there. Steve, one other thing is I just want, in terms of priority, people ask -- what Michael's talking about the earnings and where it would shape for the year, that's really -- that's about Catalysts, not about the whole company. I just want to caution everybody about that. I think if you look at our 2014, the first quarter probably similar to the first quarter of 2013. And then we're going to make probably 55% to 60% of our earnings for the year in the second and third quarter and then see the fourth quarter be kind of similar to the first. So you're going to see kind of a hill for the year, if that makes sense, not a huge hill, but a little bit of a slug. It's going to be, first, similar to the first of last year; second, strong; our third, the strongest; and then fourth kind of back a little bit like the first quarter whenever you look at our full year from an earnings standpoint.","Steven Schwartz - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","So from a contribution standpoint, 20%, 30%, 30%, 20%?","Luther C. Kissam","Not quite. I wouldn't put -- the third will be stronger than the second. So it's going to be -- the third will be stronger.","Steven Schwartz - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","20%, 25%, 35%, got you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Lorin Crenshaw for any closing remarks.","Lorin Crenshaw","Well, thanks, everyone, for your attention and for joining us.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we\u2019ll conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this call is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference Mr. Dave Ryan, Vice President of Corporate Strategy and Investor Relations. You may begin.","David Ryan","Thank you, and welcome to Albemarle\u2019s second quarter 2019 earnings conference call. Our earnings were released after the close of the market yesterday and you will find our press release, earnings presentation and non-GAAP reconciliations posted on our website under the Investors section at www.albemarle.com.","Joining me on the call today are Luke Kissam, Chief Executive Officer; Scott Tozier, Chief Financial Officer; Raphael Crawford, President, Catalysts; Netha Johnson, President, Bromine Specialties; and Eric Norris, President, Lithium.","As a reminder, some of the statements made during this conference call about our outlook, expected company performance, planned joint ventures as well as lithium production capacity end demand may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Federal Securities Laws. Please note the cautionary language about forward-looking statements contained in our press release. That same language applies to this call.","Please also note that our comments today regarding our financial results exclude non-operating, non-recurring and other unusual items. GAAP financial measures and reconciliations from those to the adjusted numbers discussed today may be found in our press release and the appendix of our earnings presentation, both of which are posted on our website.","Now, I will turn the call over to Luke.","Luke Kissam","Hey. Thanks, Dave. Good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining us on the call today. In the second quarter, excluding currency impacts, excuse me, Albemarle grew revenue and adjusted EBITDA by 6% and adjusted diluted EPS by 20%, compared to the second quarter of 2018. Volume and pricing contributed to the year-over-year growth in lithium and bromine, while pricing was up year-over-year in catalysts. Scott will go into more detail on our quarterly performance and outlook for the rest of the year in a minute.","I want to focus my comments on why we are adjusting our lithium capital expansion plans to significantly reduce capital expenditures in the medium-term. The potential impact of EV subsidy changes in China, possible shifts in cathode chemistry, excess inventory held in spots along the supply chain and the current oversupply of lithium carbonate in the market has caused some caution in the energy storage value chain.","All of this has put downward pressure on price, and we expect to see this pressure on carbonate pricing continue in the near-term, but we also expect supply demand dynamics to tighten in 2020. We have always stated that we would add production capacity to meet demand.","As you can see on Page 8 of our earnings presentation, Albemarle has decided to delay all work related to planning, engineering and construction of approximately 125,000 metric tons of previously announced additional conversion capacity. We anticipate that these changes will reduce our capital expenditures by approximately $1.5 billion over the next five years and allow Albemarle to become free cash flow positive in 2021.","As part of this strategic pivot, we recently announced amendments to the transaction with MRL. The joint venture will now be owned 60% by Albemarle and 40% by MRL. Albemarle will pay $820 million in cash and contribute a 40% interest in the 50,000 ton lithium hydroxide facility currently under construction by Albemarle in Kemerton, Western Australia. This facility is still on track to be commissioned in stages, commencing in the first-half of 2021.","We had previously announced that the first phase at Kemerton would be a 75,000 metric ton hydroxide facility, but we are scaling the total capacity back to 50,000 metric tons at this time. The Wodgina mine will still have the ability to support at least 100,000 met tons of lithium hydroxide.","However, any additional conversion capacity expansions in this joint venture will be based on market dynamics, and we would expect a lower capital intensity from metric ton of capacity. This transaction still unites the mining expertise of MRL with the lithium expertise of Albemarle and the modification accelerates the joint venture\u2019s ability to bring lithium hydroxide to the market. Albemarle will continue to have responsibility for marketing all of the product produced by this joint venture.","In China, our 20,000 met tons Xinyu II lithium hydroxide facility continues to ramp production in its own pace to reach the full capacity run rate by year-end. With several large customer qualifications complete, we continue to anticipate meaningful sales growth supported by this facility during the second-half of 2019.","In Chile, our two existing operating units in La Negra remain on track to produce close to 40,000 metric tons of lithium carbonate this year. The 40,000 tons of La Negra III and IV remains on schedule for completion in the first quarter of 2021. Based on what we\u2019re seeing in the carbonate market and to better manage our cash flow, we have decided to delay all work on the Salar yield improvement project at this time.","This will likely limit our ability to operate La Negra III and IV at nameplate capacity initially and will delay our ability to build a safety stock of concentrated brine for a rain event or similar issue. However, we are confident we will still be able to meet our commitments to our carbonate contract customers.","While we are pulling back on previously announced conversion capacity expansions, I want to point out that Albemarle has access to the best lithium resources in the world: the Salar de Atacama; Greenbushes in Australia; and upon closing the MRL transaction, Wodgina. No other lithium company can match the quality, size or diversity of those resources.","Albemarle will be cash flow positive in 2021, and our balance sheet will get stronger and stronger as we grow EBITDA and operational cash flow over the next few years. This will give us the flexibility when market conditions dictate to build or buy additional conversion capacity that will use feedstock from the world\u2019s best lithium resources.","In closing, as we promised we would do, we are adjusting our capital expansion plans to respond to market conditions. We will still be able to meet all of our commitments to our contracted customers, but reduce capital expenditures significantly in the medium-term, allowing Albemarle to be free cash flow positive in 2021.","We have access to large, high-quality, low-cost lithium resources and the financial flexibility to build or buy conversion capacity in the future, if doing so creates value for our stakeholders. In short, we\u2019re well-positioned for and excited about the future.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Scott.","Scott Tozier","Thanks, Luke, and good morning, everyone. For the second quarter, we reported unadjusted U.S. GAAP net income of $154 million, or $1.45 diluted earnings per share. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.55, an increase of about $0.19, or 14% compared to second quarter 2018, or 20% excluding currency effects.","Growth and bromine, lithium and fine chemistry services resulted in an increase of about $0.19. Earnings per share also benefited $0.06 from our 2018 share repurchase programs and $0.10 from a more favorable effective tax rate than was the case in 2018. These gains were partially offset by unfavorable currency exchange of about $0.08 and unfavorable results in the Catalysts business compared to second quarter 2018, which was a particularly strong quarter for Catalysts.","Now I\u2019ll cover a few financial details. Based on current geographic sales and production mix year-to-date and our expectations for the rest of 2019, we currently expect our full-year effective tax rate to range between 20% and 22%, excluding special items, non-operating pension and OPEB items.","Corporate costs in the second quarter were $39 million, an increase over the same period in 2018, primarily driven by an increase in unfavorable currency losses of approximately $8 million. Full-year 2019 corporate costs are now expected to range from $130 million to $140 million.","For the first-half of the year, net cash from operations was $199 million, down $25 million from last year, impacted by higher cash taxes and increased working capital to support increased sales in lithium in the second-half of 2019.","Capital expenditures during the first-half were $416 million, and we now expect full-year CapEx for 2019 to range between $900 million and $1 billion. Expenditures for the Kemerton project remain on track. However, some expenditures that were planned for 2020 are now expected to occur in 2019. This is largely driven by increased activity in Australia and a requirement by vendors for higher upfront payments.","At the end of the quarter, our net-debt-to-adjusted EBITDA was 1.5 times. After the MRL deal closes, we expect our gross-debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio to be around 2.7 times and net-debt-to-EBITDA to be around 2.2 times, and expected to improve going forward. We will secure a new debt to finance the joint venture and for general corporate purposes. Initially, a delayed drawdown \u2013 draw term loan will be put in place. This may ultimately be converted to long-term debt.","Turning to the details of our business performance now. In the second quarter, lithium delivered sales of $325 million. Excluding unfavorable impact of currency, lithium sales were up 5% compared to the second quarter of 2018, driven by increased volume of 3% and increased price and mix of 2%.","Pricing was up 1%, primarily in specialty products such as butyllithium and battery grade materials. Adjusted EBITDA of $142 million was flat compared to the second quarter of 2018 and adjusted EBITDA margin was 44%.","In bromine, second quarter net sales and adjusted EBITDA grew year-over-year by 17% and 20%, respectively, excluding the impact of currency. Adjusted EBITDA margins were strong at 32%. Although we have seen some weakness in our connectors business that serves the automotive and construction markets, we\u2019ve been successful to date in shifting our bromine to other end markets, where demand remains more robust. Volume growth in the second quarter was aided by our JBC expansion that is running well and was brought online in the third quarter of 2018.","Catalysts reported second quarter net sales of $266 million and adjusted EBITDA of $67 million. The decline in results was caused by a volume shortfall in fluid catalytic cracking, or FCC catalysts, due to delays in the startup of new units and changes in customer mix. This was partially offset by favorable pricing in FCC and higher sales volume and a favorable product mix in clean fuel technology, or HPC. Insurance payments related to weather received during 2018 were also an unfavorable factor in the adjusted EBITDA comparison.","Let me turn to the rest of the year now. In lithium, we continue to expect year-over-year volume growth of 15,000 to 20,000 metric tons and then adjusted EBITDA growth rate in the mid to high-teens. With multiple customer qualifications complete, hydroxide volume from Xinyu is expected to drive a stronger second-half.","We are seeing pricing pressure on some technical grade products and expect second-half pricing to be flat to slightly down compared to 2018. However, we still expect full-year pricing to be flat to slightly up versus 2018 and to see sequential adjusted EBITDA growth in the third and fourth quarters.","In Catalysts, the FCC customers startup delays are expected to impact full-year volumes. We are working to mitigate the short-term impact by placing volume at other accounts, where the pricing meets our profitability targets, but it is unlikely we will fully replace the delayed volume.","To be clear, we have secured this FCC business, so it is a matter of when, not if, we ship FCC catalysts to these refineries. For HPC, the full-year remains on track, although timing of orders has shifted around a bit. Putting all this together, we now expect full-year adjusted EBITDA of the Catalysts segment to be down mid-single digits on a percentage basis, excluding divested businesses. Second-half results are expected to be spread fairly evenly across the third and fourth quarter and flat to first-half.","The downside in catalyst is offset by an improved outlook in bromine and fine chemistry services. Our 2019 order backlog in bromine remains healthy, and we now expect full-year adjusted EBITDA growth in the range of 10%. Global economic weakness is always a risk for this business, although signs are pointing toward a potential 2020 impact on bromine rather than 2019.","For the total company, excluding divested businesses, we are reaffirming the full-year guidance of net sales growth in the range of 9% to 15% and adjusted EBITDA growth in the range of 7% to 14%. We\u2019re increasing guidance for adjusted diluted earnings per share to $6.25 to $6.65, a pro forma growth rate of 15% to 22% over 2018.","Now I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Dave.","David Ryan","Thanks, Scott. Before we get to Q&A, I want to call your attention to our press release of August 6, announcing that we will host an Investor Day in New York City on the morning of December 12, 2019. Additional details will be forthcoming, but we look forward to the opportunity to provide a detailed update on Albemarle and the strategy and priorities for the company and each of our global business units.","Operator, we are now ready to open the lines for Q&A. But before doing so, I\u2019d like to remind everyone to please limit questions to two per person to ensure that all participants have a chance to ask questions, then feel free to get back into the queue for follow-ups if time allows. Please proceed.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Josh Spector with UBS. Your line is now open.","Josh Spector","Hey, guys, can you hear me?","Luke Kissam","Yes, we can hear you.","Josh Spector","Okay, great. Yes, sorry, it\u2019s a patchy connection. Just a question on CapEx kind of over the next five years. So I understand you took down the number, and I \u2013 so I wonder, if demand does materialize kind of over the next two or three years, either at or ahead of your expectations, do you see some of that CapEx coming back into your planning? So I guess, I\u2019m thinking, if you\u2019re adding new capacity in the mid-2020 timeframe, you probably need to start building or spending on that in early 2020, and kind of how do you balance that versus what you said on the release earlier?","Luke Kissam","Yes, great question. If you look \u2013 what you see is, we are building out Kemerton, which would add another 50,000 met tons of lithium hydroxide. And then in the chart, we show that we are assuming we will build out another 50,000 metric tons with our partner, MRL, once that deal closes. So that will reduce the capital that we will have to expand for that next 50,000 metric ton of capacity. We\u2019re essentially sharing that capacity with our partner.","So we believe that when we look at the demand that it would be out further past that 2021 timeframe, where we would have to commit any more capital. So we\u2019re very comfortable with the free cash flow number that we say and being free cash flow positive in 2021. And then as our EBITDA grows, we will selectively buy or build additional capacity if the market demands it at a lower capital intensity than what we we\u2019re seeing today.","Josh Spector","Okay, great. Thanks. And just on \u2013 so first, Mineral Resources and the spodumene availability, how does the change in the JV impact any of the plans there to the extent you can provide any color on what\u2019s going to happen with the capacity, which you aren\u2019t going to be allocating to Kemerton at the start?","Luke Kissam","Yes. Upon the closing of that transaction, we\u2019ll work with MRL to determine the best approach on that spodumene. But it certainly appears to us today that the market is adequately supplied with spodumene today.","Josh Spector","Okay, great. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","David Begleiter","Thank you, Luke. Just following up on that situation, the additional Talison spodumene, will that be processed or how that be allocated going forward?","Scott Tozier","Under the Talison agreements, we have the rights to 50% of the off-take and our partner, Tianqi, has the rights to 50% of that off-take. So that won\u2019t change in anyway going forward. David, I\u2019m not quite sure I understand the question.","David Begleiter","With the reduced capacity in Kemerton, will you be processing any of the Talison spodumene in the 50,000 tons of initial Kemerton capacity?","Scott Tozier","No, that\u2019ll be used with Wodgina rock, we would expect to do that. But we certainly have flexibility to allow us in the future to \u2013 with these resources to do whatever it makes the most sense from a financial perspective.","David Begleiter","Very good. And just on a second-half lithium EBITDA guidance, Luke, it is a big ramp up, you do have Xinyu coming in. But any other drivers for the big second-half versus first-half in terms of lithium EBITDA guidance range?","Eric Norris","David, this is Eric. So it is, as you depicted, it\u2019s two things. It\u2019s the Xinyu II ramp up now that we are \u2013 have six months of experience under our belt and are ramping towards full rates, have four major customers qualified, that can really drive that plant, there\u2019s another six plus that will probably qualify or in the process of qualifying, but we have sufficient now to fill that plant in the second-half of this year.","And then the other factor is the ramp up of \u2013 similarly of La Negra II in Chile and the volumes we expect there. And, of course, the underlying factor is strong demand growth in the EV markets, which we \u2013 our demand outlook continues to be as it was three months ago for strong growth going forward.","David Begleiter","Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Arun Viswanathan","Great, thanks. Good morning. Just trying to, I guess, understand your comments, put them in context in the prepared remarks. So, obviously, there \u2013 we\u2019re going through a little bit of a period of oversupply in carbonate and spodumene, and you\u2019ve halted CapEx, partly as a result. So are we supposed to, I guess, interpret that some of your decisions to not bring as much tonnage to market would help kind of stabilize the market? And do you think, we would see some similar responses from your peers in the industry? Thanks.","Scott Tozier","Yes. I have no way of knowing what our peers in the industry will do. First of all, what we\u2019re looking at is, we have always told our stakeholders that we were going to invest capital to meet our contracted customers\u2019 demand, where we could get an attractive return on invested capital. And our stakeholders have been clear. When I talk to shareholders, the number one thing I hear is, when are you going to be free cash flow positive.","It\u2019s critical that we adjust our capital to allow us to meet our stakeholders\u2019 demand, while at the same time driving towards a positive free cash flow. And we put a stake in the ground that we\u2019re going to be free cash flow positive in 2021. We believe that will create more value for our stakeholders and we will have the financial flexibility if the market conditions call for it to build or buy additional conversion capacity to meet any increased needs in the market.","Arun Viswanathan","Okay, thanks for that. And as a follow-up, just curious on your customers\u2019 acceptance of the long-term contracts. Are you still seeing increased contracting? You mentioned 10 years previous \u2013 on previous calls? Are you still able to extend those agreements? And if so, what\u2019s kind of the magnitude or the level of acceptance that you\u2019re seeing out there? Thanks.","Eric Norris","Arun, hello, this is Eric Norris. We ended 2018 with largely all of those major contracts extended out in \u2013 somewhere in the three to five-year range, some five-plus, and that is what is we\u2019re operating against today. And with those contracts are holding, they are all largely outside of China, those types of contracts and we continue to move forward against them.","Arun Viswanathan","Thanks. I\u2019ll turn it over.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jerry Zekauskas [sic] [Jeffrey Zekauskas] with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Jeffrey Zekauskas","Thanks very much. You said that over a five-year period, you would drop your CapEx by $1.5 billion. So what was your five-year CapEx expectation, and what is it now?","Luke Kissam","Scott, you have that number off the top of your head?","Scott Tozier","I don\u2019t have it off the top of my head.","Luke Kissam","We\u2019ll get back to you with that number. I don\u2019t have it off the top of my head. What we did was we went in and looked exactly what we were taking it down. I can tell you by \u2013 we look at 2019 being right around $1 billion, 2020 been right around $1 billion, and then 2021 drop into around $500 million or so or something like that. Am I right, Scott?","Scott Tozier","Yes, the new is around $500 million, but it was up around $800 million or so or something like that.","Luke Kissam","Yes. So it\u2019s about $300 million to $400 million drop, so in that one year alone. So we\u2019ll get that number for you. I\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t have it off the top of my head, Jeff.","Jeffrey Zekauskas","Okay. Okay. And then just to my follow-up. Originally, once your Wave 2 capacity was done, I think, it would have had something like 350,000 or 340,000 tons of LCE. And what you\u2019re now going to do is you\u2019re not going to build 125,000 tons of LCE. So basically, what you\u2019ve done is, you\u2019ve curtailed your longer-term capacity to the mid-decade by about 35%, 35% or 36%. So that must correspond to with diminished expectation for either lithium growth rates overall, or lithium profitability overall. Can you give us a sense\u2026","Luke Kissam","Yes.","Jeffrey Zekauskas","\u2026of why your curtailments are so large and how you got there?","Luke Kissam","Yes, Jeff, certainly can. First of all, we will still have the capability out in the years to either buy or build additional capacity, if that\u2019s met. I don\u2019t \u2013 you should not view this anyway as seen that we don\u2019t believe demand is still going to be where it is. We\u2019re still bullish on demand. We\u2019re at, I think, 1 million metric tons in that range by 2025 and we still see that based on all the data that we have coming in. So it\u2019s not demand.","From an actual dollar perspective, I think, it\u2019s too soon to say whether there\u2019s going to be a reduction in EBITDA or not, when the supply and demand is got to have an impact, you \u2013 one would think over time on price. What this will do at a 1 million metric tons is, it will reduce our market share, unless we build more over time.","So while it is not ondemand, understand how you do the math on the EBITDA in earnings. But I\u2019m not ready to concede that point yet. If you\u2019ll \u2013 we\u2019re just going to need to let see how this plays out.","But I want to be clear, we\u2019re going to meet the commitments that we have to our customers. We\u2019re going to be free cash flow positive in 2021. As we go out through the years and our EBITDA and our volumes do grow, you\u2019ll continue to see us generate significant free cash flow and will have the balance sheet and the flexibility to invest either in buying or building additional conversion capacity if it means it makes sense to our stakeholders. And that\u2019s probably once we say go, if we\u2019re building it, is probably 24 to 36 months.","Jeffrey Zekauskas","Okay, great. Thanks so much, Luke.","Luke Kissam","Thanks for the questions.","Operator","Our next question comes from PJ Juvekar with Citi. Your line is now open.","Prashant Juvekar","Yes. Hi, good morning. Luke, now that you\u2019ve delayed a big chunk of your hydroxide capacity. You are going to be more exposed to spodumene concentrate from both Wodgina and from Talison for longer period of time. Why is that a better economic decision when you know that there\u2019s going to be excess rock capacity in the market?","Luke Kissam","Well, you assume I\u2019m selling it and I\u2019m not saying today, we\u2019re going to sell it. So we\u2019re not going to be more exposed to spodumene rock. We\u2019re not going to sell it, if there\u2019s not a market for.","Prashant Juvekar","Okay. So you\u2019re saying you won\u2019t operate the mines if there is no demand for it.","Luke Kissam","I\u2019m saying at we will discuss \u2013 after the deal closes, we will discuss with MRL what the best approach is to take on the spodumene rock from that mine.","Prashant Juvekar","Okay. And then most of your cancelled capacity is in Australia. Is Australia not competitive, either because of higher labor, or building cost or whatever, or is it because demand is lower and you\u2019re just matching it to demand, it has nothing to do with Australia?","Luke Kissam","It doesn\u2019t have anything to do with Australia. Although I will say and it\u2019s clear, if you\u2019re going to build an asset in China versus you\u2019re going to build an asset in Australia, you\u2019ve got a much higher capital intensity in Australia, be the same thing if you build something in the U.S., you\u2019ve got a higher capital intensity than you do in China. But what we\u2019re delaying is simply what we had on the drawing board, and we\u2019re taking that capacity out and you ought not read anything more than that into it.","Prashant Juvekar","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Koort with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Robert Koort","Thank you. Good morning. Maybe a question for Eric. I\u2019m trying to reconcile Albemarle\u2019s unique supply capability. I think you guys have talked in the past about customers maybe narrowing or tightening their specifications and your ability to supply there given legacy supply arrangements, qualifications and whatnot.","And, Luke, you\u2019re suggesting maybe you could seed some share. So are the Tier 2 and Tier 3 converters beginning to be able to meet those specifications, or are they narrowing the distance to and performance capabilities that you have?","And then secondly, are we seeing those goalposts narrowing by the customer base? Are there specs getting tighter or tougher requiring more out of their suppliers that are lithium suppliers?","Eric Norris","Hi, it\u2019s Eric. So I would say that this is all about EV growth, right, for our strategy. First of all, that may be obvious, but an important point, because where we see that going is largely a high nickel base, increasingly, and where we see that needing therefore is hydroxide \u2013 lithium hydroxide.","When you talk about the types of quality specifications they are tightening, and you talk about the ability \u2013 the supply pace to meet them, it\u2019s a handful or less of companies that can do that. So I wouldn\u2019t \u2013 I would say that that is \u2013 today, that is not the non-integrated producers. It is the integrated major producers in the marketplace. And so our strategy is one simply around creating flexibility that you\u2019re hearing on this conference call for growth, while continuing to meet needs, not any statement around what we see competitively in this high-growth market, or their continued need for more specialized or high-quality products.","Luke Kissam","Yes, Bob, this is Luke. As a leader in the lithium business, we feel like we need to put a stake in the ground. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing. We\u2019re pivoting our strategy to address the major concern we hear from our shareholders, which is, when are you going to be free cash flow positive.","We\u2019re going to be free cash flow positive in 2021, and we\u2019re still going to be able to meet the commitments we have to our customers. And we will also have the flexibility in the future using the world\u2019s best resources to build or buy additional conversion capacity.","So don\u2019t hear me \u2013 please don\u2019t hear me say that I\u2019m willing to cede share or I\u2019m happy with a lower EBITDA, or I\u2019m not looking for earnings growth. I don\u2019t hear any of that. What you ought to hear is, we\u2019re going to be very responsible in how we are managing our cash to drive shareholder value and meet our customers\u2019 demand.","Robert Koort","If I could follow-up, Luke, that seems to be an ongoing anxiety in the market about spot prices and relevance to your portfolio. I think, you guys have obviously demonstrated consistently your pricing is not in anyway correlated to that spot market. But I\u2019m curious as you think about renewing contracts, I assume some roll in, some roll off, and you\u2019re writing a new contract today. Does that still have a price uplift from where it may have been written the expiring contracts, or how do you sort of characterize the contract pricing dynamic as you look forward from here?","Luke Kissam","Yes. I\u2019m going to let Eric talk about that. But I think, you\u2019ve got to separate it between what you\u2019re seeing today in carbonate and what you\u2019re seeing today in a dry side from a battery grade standpoint, okay? So Eric?","Eric Norris","Yes. So it is \u2013 is it different by the two? Yes. I mean, first of all, in our mix of business, as I said in the previous question, we are not seeing a lot of or we don\u2019t have a lot of contracts expiring within the next \u2013 this year or next year. We have a large number, a large volume committed on the hydroxide side of that, that is where we see the growth, certainly for EVs. But it\u2019s also where we see considerable tightness from a supply standpoint, both today and into the future.","And so while there might be excess in carbonate, carbonate is also a product that is not the preferred product line going forward for EVs. And as a result, you will see pricing pressure there. And any contract that renews, you\u2019ll see more there on carbonate than you would on hydroxide. And so that \u2013 that\u2019s really the dynamic we\u2019re facing right now.","Eric Norris","I mean, Bob, that\u2019s \u2013 the question is, as these contracts enter, we\u2019ve got to look to see if steady price, a set price on that minimum volume, the way it makes sense, or do we go to a band of pricing? How are we going to do this in this evolving market? And that\u2019s something that there is a significant amount of focus on, not only internally with Albemarle, but our discussion with our major customers, the major battery suppliers, and some automotive OEMs, because you\u2019re \u2013 what we\u2019re seeing today is that buying decision is moving further to the right of that supply chain.","And we are engaged in those discussions at the right levels and we\u2019re going to hopefully reach an arrangement that makes sense for us and for our stakeholders and allows our customers to also meet their demands that they have to the OEM. That\u2019s our goal.","Robert Koort","Great. Thanks for the help.","Operator","Our next question comes from Aleksey Yefremov with Numora. Your line is now open.","Matthew Skowronski","Good morning. This is Matt Skowronski on for Aleksey. Given the price volatility that you\u2019ve seen so far this year, are your lithium contracts being executed as expected, or were there any change in terms of mid-year?","Eric Norris","So \u2013 hi, Matt, Eric Norris, again. So we see a mix of things, right? The vast majority of our businesses is battery grade. The vast majority of that is located outside of China. And that\u2019s where our contracts sweet spot has been for years and where it continues to be where we renewed a lot of our contracts last year for the duration of a number of years going forward.","So those \u2013 all those contracts are performing as expected. We have some technical grade products that are sold under more shorter-term non-traditional or not traditional for these battery grade contracts. They are seeing pressure and Scott referenced that we will see some of that in the second-half of this year.","The volume that we have in China that, which is strategic to maintain a position within that supply chain, is also not a traditional sort of contract. It\u2019s been shorter-term, some expired this year. And in some cases we\u2019re able to reach a price agreement with some, and others we weren\u2019t willing to go, where they felt they wanted them to go. And so we walked away from some contracts that we\u2019ve kept a foothold in China.","So it really would be China, which is less than 10% of our volume and tech grade, which is another depending on how you count it 10% to 20% of our volume. That\u2019s where there might be some pressure, but in the vast majority of our business, and certainly, our battery grade portion of the market is growing. Those contracts are performing.","Matthew Skowronski","Thank you. That\u2019s helpful. And then what are your early kind of views on demand for lithium in China in July and August so far? Has there been any change or deterioration from June levels?","Eric Norris","Again, it\u2019s Eric here. It\u2019s a question that I ask my team and I think it\u2019s really way too early to know. You asked in the spirit of, I think, the fact that the new subsidies went into effect as of July 1. Very often there\u2019s a run up before any subsidy change of buying behavior. And so we don\u2019t know what it\u2019s going to mean going into July or August, where I could speculate one way or the other.","The market for EVs remains robust, but subsidies do distort behavior. And so it\u2019s possible that the July or August could be weak \u2013 weaker than they otherwise would be without the subsidy. On balance, though, we see a strong year for China going forward from a demand standpoint.","Matthew Skowronski","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steven Byrne with Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Luke Washer","Hi, good morning. This is actually Luke Washer on for Steve. So given your decision to reduce hydroxide capacity, could you provide some more detail on what you\u2019re seeing on the demand side that\u2019s changing your tone? Are you seeing a slowdown in optimism perhaps for the timing and shift to 811 and the NCA technology?","Eric Norris","Hi, Luke, Eric, again. So as Luke said, first of all, there\u2019s nothing that\u2019s changing in the next two to three years, right? The capacity that we have opted to not pursue is in that three to five-year timeframe. And that same three to five-year timeframe will have certainly the resources and the cash, should the market warranted to go after that, that opportunity. So it\u2019s putting the stake in the ground, as Luke referred to.","In terms of now your question of demand. Demand is unchanged from what we thought three months ago from what we thought six months ago. It remains strong and it \u2013 and probably stronger than \u2013 for hydroxide than we would have expected maybe six months ago. So there continues to be that edging towards hydroxide that is supported by NCA chemistries and 811 chemistries.","But I\u2019ll reiterate what I said three months ago, we never expected 811 to be a big player in EVs in the next couple of years. There are technology and processing challenges yet for that technology to be safely used in a large-scale format in a battery for an EV. It is being used experimentally in some \u2013 in China in some consumer goods products. It is being blended with a six to two to sort of, if you will, supplement the energy within that battery at a small level. But it is not \u2013 there are today, really no \u2013 we don\u2019t see any 811 full EV batteries for some time yet.","NCA continues to grow, is driven by a few automotive producers, in particular. And so that continues on. But again, going back to the original point, nothing has really changed in our demand view in the next couple of years or for that matter five years out.","Luke Washer","Thanks. That\u2019s helpful. And then on the La Negra III and IV, you expected to add 40,000 metric tons of carbonate to the market and now you\u2019re delaying that project a bit. What do you believe the effective capacity of those increases will be now?","Luke Kissam","Yes. I think we always intended to bring that capacity on. As 2021 is when we would have mechanical completion in the first quarter, we have to have four to six months worth of qualification. So I wouldn\u2019t expect much in in 2021. We always talk about bringing these units on third, third, third. So we\u2019re confident we can still bring that on and we could probably have this Salar yield online and have the brine ready for \u2013 by 2023 when we need that last third of that project there. So I would look at it as 15,000, 15,000, 10,000 something like that something in that range.","Luke Washer","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joel Jackson with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Joel Jackson","Hi, good morning.","Luke Kissam","Hey.","Joel Jackson","Hey. You clearly said that being free cash flow positive in 2021 is a key thing for you when considering the changes in the JV with Min Res. And I understand the optionality, I guess, spodumene for you here. So maybe you could talk a little bit about the rationale about deciding just give over $1 billion of consideration for spodumene resource, where maybe in the future, you could go and get that resource later when you need it?","Luke Kissam","Yes. That\u2019s a great question. They will run in an auction and it was going to get sold. If you go back to the very beginning of it, MRL was running a process. We were engaged in a process. It was a top tier asset. If you take Talison out of the equation, you take out Greenbushes, that is the best rock resource in the world.","The \u2013 when you look at Wodgina, the size of that resource, the purity of that resource, and the skill that MRL brings to the table from a mining standpoint, and I believe from a capital execution standpoint, that can help us, it just made for a perfect fit. Ultimately, you\u2019re going to need that volume. And we thought it was best that we had it, we saw it as a good asset. And now when we\u2019ve restructured it, we have 60% of that joint venture. So that gives us some rise that we didn\u2019t have in the past.","So all in all, quality asset, we\u2019re going to use that rock for Kemerton. We will also partner with MRL on our next installment of capital, which will further reduce our capital outlay and still allow us to meet our customer demand. So quality resource, quality people, ability to reduce our capital outlay and still have 100,000 met tons worth of lithium hydroxide coming on board, it all made sense to us from a return standpoint.","Joel Jackson","Thank you for that. A little more on the yield improvement program deferral. Is that just matching some of the conversations you\u2019ve talked about earlier today? Is there anything else going on with the government on getting proper quota increase or maybe\u2026","Luke Kissam","No, not \u2013 this is [Multiple Speakers]","Joel Jackson","\u2026technology?","Luke Kissam","Yes. No, this is nothing involved with the government. Our quota system is fine. There have been no changes in any of the regulatory issues, no changes with any of our contracts. This is purely a decision where we saw an opportunity to delay the implementation of capital to allow us to get free cash flow positive more quickly than we were.","So we decided that we were going to take the step to do that. Because when we calculate it, we believe we can still meet all the commitments we made to the carbonate customers that we have under contract. So it\u2019s all about free cash flow has nothing to do with anyway. Our relations with the government in Chile are fine.","Joel Jackson","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Colin Rusch with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.","Colin Rusch","Thanks so much. Can you tell us what you\u2019re looking for from your customers or from the demand environment to think about reanimating these products? And then can you just update us in terms of your targeted return on capital? Are you looking at evolving that, or are looking for higher returns, as you see this market evolve and see the strategic moves play out a little bit more in advance?","Luke Kissam","We \u2013 for a return on invested capital, we still see for two times our weighted average cost of capital for return. That\u2019s what that\u2019s \u2013 and that\u2019s always been the case and we continue to see that as our case. As what we\u2019re looking for, for our customers at, if people are going to sell carbonate at the cash costs of that marginal producer, it doesn\u2019t make sense for us to add new capacity and we won\u2019t.","We can because of our position in Chile, because of our cost position in Chile, we can still make very good margins at that level. But we don\u2019t see the need to put new capacity in the ground. So it all comes down to what\u2019s the pricing going to be, how\u2019s that pricing going to be, how the contracts coming with the customers, what or how are those going to evolve over time, and those are all decisions that need to be made in the context of a company that needs to make a commitment to our stakeholders on free cash flow, which we\u2019re doing.","Colin Rusch","Okay, great. And then just with the kind of changing trajectory here and the operating expenses, are you \u2013 is the organization right-size at this point, do you need to make any adjustments there?","Luke Kissam","Yes. I think as we look at \u2013 as we look out into 2020 and you start looking across our portfolio, we\u2019ve been operating \u2013 bromine has grown almost double digits for three or four years in a row, that\u2019s not happened before. And we can see some weakness in automotive, we can see some weakness in construction, as we talked about, we\u2019ve been able to reallocate that bromine molecule to date at very successfully. So those continue to grow, but I don\u2019t know how much longer that it\u2019s practical to expect that business to grow at that.","So we are undertaking in the second-half of the year of view of our overall cost in a way to try to reduce our overall cost and gain efficiencies going forward. And we\u2019ll share more of that with you at our December Investor Day presentation.","Colin Rusch","Thanks so much, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Harrison with Seaport Global Securities. Your line is now open.","Michael Harrison","Hi, good morning.","Luke Kissam","Hey.","Michael Harrison","Luke, as you commented several times about this build versus buy decision that you could have looking out a few years when it comes to conversion capacity. Does this reflect the view that you think there\u2019s going to be excess conversion capacity available when you might need it?","Luke Kissam","Yes. I think there\u2019s excess conversion capacity available to date and there\u2019s more coming online. So I think that it\u2019s going to provide perhaps an opportunity for people that are interested in conversion assets. So as an integrated player with the best resources in the world, we believe that that could be an opportunity for us. And we are always mindful of making sure we\u2019re getting the best return on the dollars we invest in that regard.","Michael Harrison","And then, wanted to actually ask you a question about Catalysts. Can you just maybe give a little bit of color on the changes in customer mix that you mentioned and the startup delays, maybe what\u2019s causing them and how those play out in the second-half?","Raphael Crawford","Hey, Mike, this is Raphael. So in the second quarter, the mix in the second quarter was different, namely, we had a very strong second quarter in hydroprocessing catalyst in 2018, that is a refill, rebid \u2013 rebed business. So sometimes, those projects or those refills shift from one quarter to the next. And it just so happened that last year, we were very strong in hydroprocessing.","With regard to FCC, as Scott had mentioned in his commentary, there are some delays in some projects that we have won, it is not a matter of if, but when. So we have \u2013 in 2019 \u2013 coming into 2019, we shed some low-priced, low-margin business to make room for those orders. Some of those have now been delayed.","So that gives us a little bit of a gap in 2019. But we fully expect that we will have that business in 2020 and beyond. So fundamentally, FCC catalyst and catalyst overall in the refining space is very strong for Albemarle.","Michael Harrison","All right. Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chrish Kapsch with Loop Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Christopher Kapsch","Yes, good morning. Thanks. Question probably for Eric, maybe, Luke. In your formal comments, you\u2019d pointed to expectation that you\u2019d see tighter supply demand in the industry in 2020. Just wondering if that\u2019s just based on sort of top down math, are you seeing anything specifically from a bottoms up standpoint, either customer order patterns, inventory levels, anything that, any acceleration in demand that is pointing to that? If you could just characterize that, that would be appreciated?","Eric Norris","Hey, Chris, sure. It\u2019s Eric here. So a couple of factors. One, demand is, as we said on prior questions, is continues to be strong, and we see it based on electric vehicle launches, commitments from EV producers to battery producers, we see that demand will continue to step up again in 2020 to a greater degree. We\u2019ll give more specific guidance, but it\u2019s consistent with our demand model that we articulated of 50,000 to 60,000 tons of this year and 1 million by 2025. So it\u2019s a natural step up there. So that\u2019s on the demand side.","On the supply side, we are seeing a couple of projects on the resource side be delayed, take longer to come to market and\/or under current economics, we believe may \u2013 maybe challenge to operate. And then finally, inventory, which has been a big factor in the marketplace this year, we believe, hard to quantify, a lot of it is in China.","Within China, that\u2019s largely been depleted, we think, from the supply chain, on the carbonate hydroxide side and what\u2019s being in hands, it\u2019s not outside of China. There continues to be some excess rock in inventory outside of China and Australia \u2013 in Australia and it continues to be some excess salt in some of the battery producers\u2019 hands outside of China. So maybe the balance of this year that would be drawn down. And when you put that formula together, we see a pretty tight 2020.","Christopher Kapsch","Thanks for that color. And then my follow-up is really to the expansion curtailments. And really, the question is that strategic pivot, juxtaposed against a couple of your slides you\u2019ve used in prior investor presentations regarding your lithium hydroxide and lithium carbonate that you have under contract over the 2021 and 2025 period?","The question is, like it looks like this decision doesn\u2019t influence those metrics on 2020 intended production, but this is really all about not having visibility on longer-term commitments from customers out to 2025. So could you just \u2013 is that one way to think about \u2013 maybe characterize the decision against those slides? Thank you.","Luke Kissam","Yes. So we made commitments to people out through 2025 in some instances. And in all these scenarios, we\u2019re able to meet those commitments with capacity that we\u2019ve announced and that we have under construction today. And we know what the price is on those and we\u2019re able to calculate the return based on what that capital is going to be. But we\u2019ll be able to meet everything that is under contract today.","What we\u2019re doing now, again, is driving to a free cash flow positive in 2021, with the ability to flex up, if necessary, to build or buy additional capacity, if the market demands it and if we have customers that are prepared to enter into contracts with us for those volumes that we will be producing.","But we I don\u2019t think it makes a whole lot of sense for us to build a lot of capacity, if we\u2019re not going to have contracts that we can place against those, or and it doesn\u2019t have to be the exact same contracts we have today. We just need to know within the range what that returns going to be and we can make a intelligent economic decision about what that\u2019ll be.","So if you see our long-term agreements change a little bit, all these agreements are a little bit different. What we\u2019re looking for is \u2013 not a guarantee, but a surety of a return based upon the capital we put in the ground. But we\u2019re going to meet our commitments to our customers, we have enough. But this is a pivot to make sure that we\u2019re also focusing on free cash flow for our stakeholders, not just a potential for customers to come.","Christopher Kapsch","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dimitri Silverstein with Buckingham Research. Your line is now open.","Luke Kissam","[Multiple Speakers] How are you doing? Please go ahead.","Dimitri Silverstein","Hello, can you hear now? All right.","Luke Kissam","Yes, we can hear you now, buddy.","Dimitri Silverstein","Okay, great. Thanks. Thanks for taking my call. Quickly on the \u2013 you mentioned higher upfront payments that your vendors are requiring for the expanded capacity that you are undertaking. And that was one of the reasons that your CapEx is staying where it is. I\u2019m just trying to understand sort of why? I mean, are they less \u2013 I mean, are they concerned about the rapid lithium expansion across the world by many players? I just want to make sure that you guys sort of serious about the \u2013 these longer-term orders?","Luke Kissam","No, Dimitri, this is Luke. It\u2019s just a matter of the Australian market is heating up for construction. So you\u2019re seeing a lot of activity in mine. You\u2019re seeing a lot of activity in Australia, and they got a book of business that they \u2013 there is now, they\u2019re kind of \u2013 they got a good market. I mean, they got a good seller\u2019s market. And what they\u2019re doing is, if you want to get in line for the time that we want to get in line in the shops, we had to pay more upfront to get that preferred space in line, so we could get it to the market when we said we would in that timeframe.","So that\u2019s all it is. And the cost didn\u2019t \u2013 the overall cost didn\u2019t change, it\u2019s a matter of we have to pay a little bit more upfront sooner than we originally thought we would. That\u2019s all it is. It\u2019s just a market heat-up. It\u2019s got nothing to do with Albemarle. It\u2019s not \u2013 got nothing to do with lithium. In particular, it\u2019s the construction market in Australia.","Dimitri Silverstein","Gotcha. Okay, that\u2019s helpful, Luke. And then just as my follow up question on volume growth that you saw in the second quarter in lithium. I think, you talked about 3% volume growth. I mean, it doesn\u2019t sort of jive well with the market that\u2019s growing 60% or whatever the EV megawatt market \u2013 battery market is growing at.","Was this constrained in your capacity that prevented you from delivering a better volume number, or is there something else going on, and that\u2019s going to go away in the second-half and you\u2019re going to get to the growth that is more reflective of what the EV market is growing at?","Eric Norris","Hey, Dimitri, this is Eric. So we\u2019re selling everything we can make, right? We are ramping up Xinyu II that has natural limitations just on the ramp experience curve, and it has limitations on customer qualification. But I can tell you that both for that plant and for Chile, which was impacted in the first quarter by a rain event, everything we can make we can sell.","Where we were limited in the first-half of the year on sales growth was opportunistic sales, that would be enabled by tolling of the spodumene capacity we have. That \u2013 those opportunistic sales are off contract by nature, given that they\u2019re opportunistic. A lot of them given us half of the market in China is in China, all of them are in carbonate. And with the excess carbonate market with prices where they are in that $8 to $9 marginal cash cost range, we just \u2013 it doesn\u2019t make sense economically for you to do that.","So we pull back on that, we maximize the growth we can get from our internal assets. And what happens in the second-half of the year is, we get the full benefit of qualification at Xinyu II running to full ramp rates on Xinyu II, which is nameplate on that facility 20,000 tons. And the same on La Negra, both \u2013 the benefit of both units running at full tilt, as well as seasonally better brine. We have now opportunity to really recover from the headwinds we had from rains in the first quarter. And those are the factors that drive the comparison first to second-half.","Dimitri Silverstein","Gotcha. So there was a little bit of capacity constraint that that\u2019s going to resolve itself in the second-half of the year. That\u2019s what I wanted to make sure. Okay, thank you.","Operator","At this time, I\u2019m showing no further questions. I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Mr. Dave Ryan for any closing remarks.","David Ryan","We just wanted to thank, everyone, for your questions and participation in today\u2019s conference. As always, we appreciate your interest. And this concludes Albemarle\u2019s second quarter earnings call.

Please proceed, sir.","Lorin Crenshaw","Thank you, and welcome, everyone, to Albermarle's Fourth Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. Our earnings were released after the close of the market yesterday and you'll find our press release, earnings presentation and non-GAAP reconciliations posted on our website under the Investors section at albermarle.com. Joining me on the call today are Luke Kissam, Chief Executive Officer; Scott Tozier, Chief Financial Officer; Matt Juneau, President, Performance Chemicals; and Michael Wilson, President, Catalyst Solutions.","As a reminder, some of the statements made during this conference call about the future performance of the company may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws. Please note the cautionary language about our forward-looking statements contained in our press release. That same language applies to this call.","Please note that our comments today regarding our financial results exclude all nonoperating or special items, and reconciliations related to any non-GAAP financial measures discussed may be found in our press release or earnings presentation, which are posted on our website. With that, I'll turn the call over to Luke.","Luther C. Kissam","Thanks, Lorin, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin the call by commenting on the company results and accomplishments for the year. Scott will review select highlights related to the business segment performance and financial results, and I'll end by providing some perspective on our outlook. At the end of our prepared remarks, Matt and Michael will join Scott and me to address your questions.","In 2014, Albermarle delivered full year earnings per share of $4.20, up 5% year-over-year and in line with our guidance. Net sales totaled $2.5 billion, and adjusted EBITDA was $562 million for the full year, resulting in adjusted EBITDA margins right at 23%. We also generated free cash flow of $361 million, up 24% year-over-year. We divested our antioxidant and ibuprofen businesses in order to enhance our margins and strategic focus. And finally, in January of 2015, we closed the acquisition of Rockwood Holdings, which will certainly transform the company. While attaining our financial and strategic goals is critically important, it is essential that we do so in a way that is safe and sustainable.","With this in mind, I am very proud of the fact that we incurred 42% fewer injuries in 2014 than in 2013 and dramatically lowered the severity of those injuries that did occur. Our 2014 OSHA recordable rate was 0.327, which we expect will place us in the top quartile of companies in the American Chemistry Council. In a year that marked our 20th anniversary as a public company, we ended 2014 better positioned to grow, innovate and deliver value to our stakeholders than ever before.","In terms of our full year financial performance, Catalyst delivered double-digit earnings growth on higher volume and pricing. Our technologies continue to provide significant performance and financial benefits to refiners, which, in uncertain economic times, becomes even more critical to our customers.","Within Performance Chemicals, full year sales and earnings were down from 2013, primarily driven by weaker performance within our bromine franchise caused by sluggish demand, cautious customer inventory management, pricing pressure and a slowdown in demand for drilling completion fluids in the fourth quarter. Nevertheless, Performance Chemicals achieved adjusted EBITDA margins in the mid-20s for the year, and the bromine franchise EBITDA margins was north of 35% for the year.","During the fourth quarter, we achieved several critical milestones related to the acquisition of Rockwood, which paved the way for us to successfully close a few weeks ago. In November, shareholders of both companies voted in favor of the deal. In late November, we successfully raised $1 billion in U.S. dollar debt, followed by a EUR 700 million issuance in December. We were pleased to execute these offerings, which were rated investment grade at a weighted average cost of approximately 3.20%. Then on January 12, we closed the Rockwood acquisition by purchasing the outstanding shares for $5.7 billion.","Our immediate focus is seamless integration, and our team is off to a good start. We have already taken actions that resulted in our achieving over $30 million of annual cost synergies and have actions in place that should result in us achieving our target of $50 million in annualized run rate synergies by the end of 2015.","Last week, we announced the realignment of our global business units effective by the end of the first quarter of 2015. This organizational structure of 3 global business units is the most efficient and effective way for us to run these businesses and will help us achieve our goals of capturing synergies, EBITDA growth and cash generation. The 3 global business units will be Chemetall Surface Treatment, Refining Solutions and Performance Chemicals.","Chemetall Surface Treatment will continue supplying specialty chemicals and services for the surface treatment of metals across a variety of end markets. Refining Solutions will consist of the Heavy Oil Upgrading and Clean Fuel Technology businesses, delivering a robust portfolio of Catalyst Solutions to the refining industry. Performance Chemicals will combine the lithium, bromine, curatives, aluminum alkyls, derivative catalysts, minerals and Fine Chemistry Services businesses. In our financial reporting, we will continue to give visibility to the financial performance of lithium and bromine.","The new company will be structured to leverage the complementary fit between lithium and bromine, 2 of the world's leading mineral extraction and processing businesses, allowing us to capitalize on our long-term lithium strategy while providing immediate ability to leverage its similarities with bromine. Both the lithium and bromine businesses have access to the lowest cost, most geographically diverse sourcing locations in the world. Given their extraction and production process similarities, we expect to realize cost benefits from technology sharing. Additionally, both businesses go to market similarly with several common end markets, including consumer electronics, automotive, polymers and agriculture. This produces opportunities for cross-selling to existing customers as well as the opportunity to attract new customers.","The new structure not only brings together bromine and lithium, it also combines Albermarle's aluminum alkyls franchise with Rockwood's lithium alkyls business.","These product lines have similar manufacturing technology, packaging and distribution channels as well as a number of common customers, particularly in the elastomers market. As a result, we expect the combination of these 2 product lines to unlock significant synergies as well.","Overall, I am confident that we are now well-positioned to achieve the $100 million in cost synergies that we have targeted over 2 years.","Let me try to bucket the sources of synergies for you. We will achieve $35 million in elimination of duplicate corporate functions. $20 million or so will come from asset consolidation and manufacturing best practices across all divisions. $35 million will come from leveraging our increased scale to lower sourcing costs. And finally, around $10 million will come from organizational structure efficiencies. We expect the cost to achieve these synergies to still be in the range of $150 million.","As we move forward, our resources will be directed toward maximizing the potential of our 4 core businesses: lithium, catalysts, surface treatment and bromine, where we enjoy #1 or #2 global market positions, excellent margins and attractive growth prospects. Consistent with this direction, we will pursue strategic alternatives for 3 other businesses: minerals, which includes flame retardants and specialties; Fine Chemistry Services; and metal sulfides. In aggregate, in 2014, these businesses generated revenue in the range of $550 million and adjusted EBITDA in the range of $100 million. 2015 revenue and adjusted EBITDA would be very similar for these businesses.","Given our priority on our 4 core businesses, we believe that selling the minerals, Fine Chemistry Services and metal sulfide businesses represents the optimal choice for maximizing value to our shareholders and giving the management and employees of these 3 businesses the best opportunity for future growth and market success. We will use the proceeds from these sales to pay down debt.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott.","Scott A. Tozier","Thanks, Luke, and good morning, everyone. Before I get into the details, you'll notice a change in how we will be reporting and discussing GBU results going forward. We will be using adjusted EBITDA as opposed to segment income, which should provide additional clarity on the businesses' performance. The non-GAAP reconciliation give you the details on how to bridge to reported GAAP numbers.","Today, the financial discussion will be primarily around Albermarle's Q4 and 2014 results prior to the acquisition of Rockwood. While I will share some high-level comments around Rockwood's full year results, as the Rockwood transaction closed only a few weeks ago, the results discussed and shown in the earnings deck are indicative, preliminary results.","The acquisition and reorganization will make comparisons challenging, but we will strive to provide you information to restate our segments and align reporting definitions anticipating a complete view by our first quarter 2015 earnings call.","Financially, we ended 2014 by delivering fourth quarter net income of $77 million or $0.99 per share excluding special items. Our U.S. GAAP basis earnings were a loss of $19 million or $0.24 per share including special items.","Two special items in particular impacted our results, the largest related to an approximately $0.90 pension-related mark-to-market loss. This noncash loss reflects the actuarial impact of a lower discount rate and longer projected life expectancies partially offset by better-than-expected asset performance. This has no immediate cash impact as we expect our current funding to be adequate for the next 6 years.","We also reported $0.30 per share acquisition and financing costs associated with the Rockwood transaction, and other items amounted to a $0.02 per share loss. These items net to a loss of approximately $1.22 per share, which when added back to our reported EPS of a $0.24 loss, gets you to our adjusted EPS of $0.99 for the quarter.","Net sales totaled $599 million, and adjusted EBITDA was $137 million for the quarter, while profitability, as measured by adjusted EBITDA margin, was 23%, slightly up from Q4 2013.","Revenue was down 6.4% in Q4 and was impacted by the strengthening dollar by about $10 million, or 1.6%, mostly from the euro and yen.","Earnings per share were impacted negatively by foreign exchange by almost $0.02. Fourth quarter earnings were hurt by about $0.05 per share on a higher-than-expected tax rate due to geographic mix of our revenues in the quarter, primarily due to the lower drilling fluid shipments out of Jordan.","Finally, lower share count due to share repurchases in the first half of the year contributed $0.04 per share.","At this time, for the combined company, we expect our effective tax rate, excluding special items, nonoperating pension and OPEB items for 2015, to be 25% or so, again, driven by the level and geographical mix of our profits including those generated as a result of the recently completed Rockwood acquisition.","Our diluted shares outstanding after the acquisition are about 113 million.","Free cash flow defined as cash flow from operations, adding back pension and post retirement contributions and subtracting CapEx, was $361 million for 2014, up 24% from 2013 and the strongest in our company's history. The growth was driven by improved working capital and more normalized CapEx spend that was at $111 million or 4.5% of revenue.","For the newly combined company, we expect CapEx to be between 4% and 6% of revenue. And in 2015, we will be managing to the higher end of the range as synergy projects are executed to deliver cost savings.","At the beginning of 2014, we established a goal to reduce working capital by $100 million by the end of 2015. We ended 2014 with networking capital down to 23% of revenue, down nearly 5 percentage points representing a savings of approximately $120 million.","Our team has accomplished a great deal and will face new opportunities with Rockwood, which has an even longer cash conversion cycle than Albermarle's.","In 2015, our focus will be on pushing that rate below 23% and ensuring those gains are sustainable as we look at setting our next milestone.","The strength of our balance sheet is a source of pride at Albermarle and allowed us to execute the Rockwood acquisition and remain investment grade. We are committed to aggressively deleveraging and have a goal of achieving leverage as measured by net debt to adjusted EBITDA in the range of 2 to 2.5x by the end of 2017.","Executing the divestitures that Luke discussed will certainly aid us in this objective. During the quarter, we raised $1.9 billion in debt in preparation to fund the Rockwood acquisition. However, net debt to adjusted EBITDA remained low at 0.78x as of year end as the cash proceeds from the offerings remained on our books.","We expect that ratio to increase to around 4x when we report our first quarter results, in line with our expectations, and expect to end 2015 at 3.7x before the impact of any divestitures.","Although the transaction has only been closed for 2 weeks, the repatriation of our cash has already begun with over $1 billion in cash having been repatriated from overseas as of today. We have already taken out 75% of the bridge loans and expect to remainder to be taken out by mid-February.","On another positive cash flow note, we previously estimated that as much as $400 million of our 2015 free cash flow would likely go to onetime tax payments to repatriate that foreign cash. However, we now estimate a onetime cash tax outlay in 2015 of much less at $150 million to return over $3 billion in cash to the U.S. Roughly half of the cash will be repatriated in 2015 with the rest returning as we earn it over time.","While the impact of foreign exchange on total company sales and earnings in 2014 was very modest, as we enter 2015, the steep depreciation of both the euro and the Japanese yen represent a major financial headwind. Our earnings are exposed to the movement of these 2 currencies versus the dollar. Specifically, on the combined company, we estimate that every $0.01 change in the euro-dollar exchange rate will have an impact of approximately $1.5 million to $2 million EBITDA. And every JPY 1 change in the yen-dollar exchange rate will have an EBITDA impact of approximately $0.5 million to $1 million. To put that in perspective, ranging the euro between $1.12 and $1.18, and the yen to between JPY 117 and JPY 121, we would expect to see a $40 million to $50 million headwind to EBITDA in 2015, or about $0.20 per share.","And now I will turn to each GBU's 2014 financial performance. For the full year, Catalyst reported net sales of $1.1 billion, up 9% year-over-year; and adjusted EBITDA of $300 million, up 12% year-over-year; and adjusted EBITDA margins of 27%.","The strong revenue growth in 2014 was driven by volume and price increases and favorable mix within Heavy Oil Upgrading and Clean Fuel Technologies. Of particular note were new customer wins in Heavy Oil Upgrading and a large first-ever sale of AlkyClean, a solid asset alkylation catalyst designed to increase a refinery's octane yield in clean fuels. This growth was partially offset by continued pricing pressure in Performance Catalyst, predominantly in aluminum alkyls in catalyst precursors.","In the fourth quarter, with a drop in oil price, we saw evidence of higher operating rate at some of our customers that we think benefited our HOU business. However, we also saw what may be the beginning of a shift by refiners into cost management mode.","Catalyst Solutions' 12% growth in adjusted EBITDA was the biggest source of earnings growth for the entire company. Refinery Catalyst was the main driver with double-digit growth and margin expansion driven by volume and pricing gains. And Performance Catalyst Solutions' full year revenue and volumes rose year-over-year, reflecting solid underlying polyolefins market demand, offset by soft pricing and lower utilization rates at our facilities, which we believe is consistent with utilization rates across the organometallics industry.","For the full year, Performance Chemicals reported net sales of $1.4 billion, down 3% year-over-year and adjusted EBITDA of $337 million, down 6% year-over-year on adjusted EBITDA margins of 25%.","The year-over-year weakness was primarily driven by lower Fire Safety Solutions results and the loss of a large custom services contract. Within Fire Safety Solutions, revenue and profits were down, despite higher volumes on lower pricing within certain pockets of brominated flame retardants, or particularly in insulation foam, where product transition is occurring, and continued soft pricing in China. We believe that the higher volumes were predominantly reflective of an ongoing mix shift towards server and automotive electronics markets, offsetting continued sluggish demand in the TV and PC markets.","Fine Chemistry Services finished the full year with a modest profit increase, despite unexpectedly losing a major contract during the year on strong results within the pharmaceutical and electronic materials applications and aided by a onetime event related to supply of a pharmaceutical active ingredient in the third quarter.","Specialty Chemicals finished the year with modest profit growth on flat volumes. Year-over-year results were driven by strong methyl bromide sales volumes, which we do not expect to continue in 2015, and curatives which delivered record profits.","Drilling completion fluids were solid as this business benefited from another year during which the backdrop for offshore deepwater completions remain quite favorable. However, during the fourth quarter, amid the steep decline in crude prices and announcements of CapEx reductions by drillers, we began to experience significantly weaker order patterns for completion fluids.","In total, overall bromine-based product volumes were flat year-over-year with a drop in oilfield being a year-end surprise. Brominated flame retardant volumes were up about 5% for the year, but mix shifts to lower-end products and continued weak pricing meant that earnings were down. EBITDA margins for bromine were flat versus 2013, north of 35%.","Now let me provide some perspective on a legacy Rockwood business performance. As a reminder, these numbers for lithium and surface treatment are based on Rockwood's historical reporting practices. For the full year, lithium had an estimated net sales of $474 million, down 1% year-over-year and adjusted EBITDA of $199 million, up 9% year-over-year, resulting in margins of 42%.","The primary performance drivers were battery grade applications rising over 20% year-over-year on growing demand within the consumer electronics market in particular; the acquisition of Talison, which contributed nearly $30 million to full year adjustment EBITDA; and GDP-type growth in most technical grade applications offset by weaker butyllithium and potash results. Excluding potash, lithium's adjusted EBITDA would have been up 15% year-over-year.","Surface treatment had estimated net sales of $940 million, up 6% year-over-year and adjusted EBITDA of $220 million, up 11% year-over-year, resulting in margins of 23%.","The business had a great year on all measures benefiting from broad-based volume growth and pricing gains in most end markets, particularly driven by higher automotive OEM and automotive components, general industry, coil and cold forming applications and aerospace applications. Results also reflect continued market share gains and the impact of the acquisition of the remaining 50% interest in its previously unconsolidated joint venture in India.","With that, I'll turn the call back over to Luke to talk further about our outlook.","Luther C. Kissam","Thanks, Scott. As we consider the outlook, we expect our lithium, catalyst and surface treatment businesses will experience nice growth in 2015, but the actual results will be muted somewhat by foreign exchange translations.","Ask Scott said, going into 2015, the currency headwind is $40 million to $50 million of EBITDA. The last time we saw crude oil at this price level was in the 2008, 2009 cycle. And applying a similar impact that we saw at that time related to our oilfield related businesses results in an estimated headwind of $30 million to $50 million of EBITDA in 2015.","Although certain near-term implications for our businesses are clear today, other impacts, favorable or unfavorable, are not possible to forecast with a high degree of certainty. Against this backdrop, our focus will be on controlling what we can control. That will include focusing on cost and spending levels and ensuring that we are designing the most efficient organizational structure as we integrate these businesses into one company.","We will focus on deleveraging by identifying further opportunities to reduce working capital, rigorous scrutiny of capital spending and executing on the announced divestitures. Now let me provide color on each business so that you can understand the fundamental drivers of this outlook.","Let me start with Performance Chemicals. We expect meaningful year-over-year growth in lithium, primarily driven by the combination of a full year earnings from Talison and continued strong demand for battery grade lithium salts. The continued proliferation of lithium ion batteries within consumer devices remains the primary driver as demand for electric vehicles is expected to remain a relatively small percentage of the battery market in 2015. As a result, we will allocate an increasing percentage of volume to high-value battery applications at the expense of technical grade accounts.","Lithium salt pricing will be up year-over-year across both technical and battery grade products. Within technical grade applications, we expect GDP type growth and within potash, pricing and volumes are expected to be relatively flat.","Turning to bromine. A number of factors will make it challenging for this business to grow in 2015. However, the most significant headwind is reality that the sharp decline in crude prices in recent months will place considerable pressure on its profitability as we expect drilling completion fluid volumes to experience a steep decline following a multiyear run of exceptionally strong results for this product. I would note that our current forecast still includes a certain amount of volume for offshore deepwater fracking projects that our customers are still forecasting. Any delay or cancellation of this business is a risk built into our range that I will discuss in a minute.","The downturn in drilling completion fluids will be partially offset by favorable outlook from mercury control, where we project an increase in bromine volumes as many coal-fired utilities proceed to implement the EPA's mercury and air toxic standards.","Within Fire Safety Solutions, we expect continued pricing pressure coupled with modest volume growth as servers and automotive electronics compensate for flat to declining PC and TV trends, and we get some growth in construction and other nonelectronic applications.","Specifically, third-party estimates call for global PC unit growth of around 1%, but with a continued trend toward smaller units; 6% growth in server shipments and flat global TV units, but a 2% decline in developed markets where most fire safety standards exist.","Within organometallics, our results should benefit from solid growth in polyolefin demand globally, customers continuing to exploit differentiated specialty polymer opportunities, and the operational benefits of shutting down our higher cost polyolefin catalyst capacity last year.","Partially offsetting these factors will be lower polyolefin catalyst component pricing, reflecting continued competitive intensity. We also expect another year of lower pricing and demand for butyllithium, reflecting weak synthetic rubber market fundamentals and an inability to replace the volume that was lost when a key customer switched to a different synthesis route in 2014 that eliminated butyllithium.","Finally, profits within Fine Chemistry Services are projected to decline as pricing and volume gains in certain segments, such as selected pharmaceutical applications, are not sufficient to offset a number of contract expirations.","Turning to refining solutions. We expect mid-single-digit EBITDA growth from this business year-over-year. As we have discussed in the past, the global demand for refinery catalysts is driven primarily by 2 factors: the demand for fuels and the severity of upgrading required to produce those fuels.","The current outlook for global fuel demand, particularly transportation fuels, is expected to continue to grow in 2015. So we don't see this factor as a major risk. The severity of upgrading in turn is determined largely by 3 factors: the crude slate, the end product slate and the refinery capacity utilization rates. It is here where we see some uncertainty as we enter 2015.","As the relative availability in cost of crudes, the cost of heavy crudes, light crudes and tight oil shift, refineries will likely adapt their operations to maximize their profitability. In some scenarios, reduced upgrading severity as more stringent cost controls are employed could result in a move by refiners to lower performing, lower-cost catalysts or extend the time period between change-outs and fixed-bed unit operation.","Consequently, in high oil upgrading, we see the primary risk being the product mix, not volume, which would be manifested in a lower realized prices. In Clean Fuels Technology, which tends to be a lumpier business anyway, we could see the timing of orders shift between quarters. With these risks in mind, we still anticipate another year of strong volume and solid earnings growth in Heavy Oil Upgrading while we cautiously expect Clean Fuels' performance to be flat to down based on timing and product mix risk and unfavorable FX impacts. Whichever direction our refinery customers choose to turn, we stand ready with a robust suite of catalyst solutions to meet their ever-changing needs.","Our current view of the pace of revenue in refining solutions is second-half loaded because our CFT customer change-out calendar calls for a relatively heavier number of turnarounds in the second half of the year.","","The other factor creating the second half bias to Refinery Solutions results reflects the fact that a number of competitive trials at some of our HOU customers are projected to occur in the first half of the year versus the second. As these trials are completed, we expect a corresponding uptick in the second half operating trends for this business as we produce at more normalized levels.","Turning to surface treatment. We expect this business to deliver mid-single digit adjusted EBITDA growth despite a significant drag from currency. Absent currency growth -- absent currency, growth will be double digits, driven by solid underlying market growth in most market segments, product mix improvement, positive price and reasonable expansion in developing economies. We also anticipate a continuation of the factors that have, in recent years, presented opportunities to gain market share, including the coupling of innovative technology with superior technical and customer service and our close proximity to our customers. Bolt-on acquisitions continue to support these gains, including the latest buyout of our Shanghai joint venture, which is expected to close in the first quarter.","Adding all of that together for the total company, excluding the impact of any divestitures, we expect to deliver revenue in the range of $3.7 billion to $4 billion, adjusted EBITDA in the range of $875 million to $965 million. Free cash flow in the range of $100 to $200 million and EPS in the range of $3.15 to $3.70 per share.","Depending on how currency plays out, the potential for both upside or downside exist to these numbers. We have assumed the euro is within the range of $1.12 to $1.20, and that the Japanese yen is in the range of JPY 115 to JPY 120 in 2015, resulting in a drag on revenue of about $200 million and a drag on adjusted EBITDA of between $40 million and $50 million year-over-year.","As far as the expected quarterly progression of adjusted EBITDA and EPS for the total company, we expect it to be split roughly 40% in the first half of the year and 60% in the second half, with each quarter of the year getting successively stronger. This second half bias is mainly driven by refining solutions for reasons that I explained earlier, while the earnings progression of Performance Chemicals and Surface Treatment is pretty evenly split between the first and second halves of the year.","In closing, we currently see much uncertainty in 2015, more than typical. Our focus will be on the fundamentals of our business strategies, integration of the acquisition and deleveraging. In short, we will control what is within our power to control.","Our core businesses are strong and the underlying fundamentals over the long run remain solid. Our focus going forward will be 3 things: one, seamless, effective and efficient integration of the businesses that achieves our stated synergy targets; two, actions to accelerate growth in our core businesses; and three, generation of strong cash flow that allows us to rapidly deleverage, invest in organic growth opportunities in our core businesses, return capital to shareholders via dividends and share buybacks and where appropriate, opportunistic, small bolt-on acquisitions to accelerate EBITDA growth in our core businesses.","We are better positioned today than we were a year ago to deliver long-term value for our shareholders and have the people and resources in place to execute that strategy.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Lorin for your questions.","Lorin Crenshaw","Operator, we're ready to open the lines for Q&A. [Operator Instructions] You can proceed.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs.","Ryan Berney - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","This is Ryan Berney on for Bob Koort. I was hoping you could provide a little bit of background on the surface treatment business just for us here. If I recall correctly, a lot of their sales are to Europe, especially into Germany. Could you give us a little bit of a break out there geographically on where else that business sells into?","Luther C. Kissam","Yes. I think, it's predominantly European business. And then you would see other sales in the United States would be the second most, with Asia Pacific and Latin America coming in at a distant third. So there's opportunity for growth there, and that's one of the reasons where you'll see in the first quarter the acquisition of that joint venture partner in Asia.","Ryan Berney - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And then as a follow-up, we've been following some bromine pricing recently. And it looks like China maybe is getting slightly better. Could you comment there versus kind of what you're seeing, and if your comments on the lower China bromine pricing are more kind of year-over-year versus sequential?","Luther C. Kissam","Yes, go ahead, Matt.","Matthew K. Juneau","Yes, I'll take that. Ryan, we have not yet seen a significant change in China. But remember, in our businesses at beginning in the year, you've always got the impact of Chinese New Year, so they tend to start pretty slow for us in China in the first quarter. And Chinese New Year is mid-February this year, so it's about where we expect it in January, but I would not say we see a pickup.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.","Ramanan Sivalingam - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","This is actually Ram Sivalingam, sitting in for Dave. Luke, just a quick question. Could you perhaps give us bromine utilization rates by region? Just to give us a sense for how loose or tight that is? [ph]","Luther C. Kissam","Yes. It will be tough for me to do it by region. But I can tell you that in 2014 overall, we were in the high 60s for bromine utilization rates when you're looking at absolute bromine. So -- and it was about the same for JVC as it was for Magnolia. It's roughly the same, within a couple of percentage points, one way or the other. We can move production around based on where the derivative demand is. But roughly, if you look at that blended rate, it's in the high 60s.","Ramanan Sivalingam - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Got it, that's very helpful. And then in the past, given some demand erosion in legacy TV panels, you've talked about reapplications for bromine. Any progress there, just in terms of demand for products? [ph]","Luther C. Kissam","Yes, yes. We've made some progress in that. We've developed some particularly as it relates into the oil field where there's the most promising for the shorter term and seeing good results there. Some of the longer-term projects have not panned out from a last scale standpoint, so we've reallocated those resources. So we're making progress. There's nothing -- but everybody needs to understand, this is a long term view. We need to do this, but I don't -- well, there's nothing built into our 2015 numbers relative to these new products. It is a development product at this time.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.","Matthew Andrejkovics - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Yes, actually, it's Matt Andrejkovics on for Vincent. Could you just help just clarify some of the competitive dynamics that you're seeing in the Performance Catalyst business? Like, what's driving the soft pricing while you're seeing increase in demand? And then additionally, can you help us understand the decision to move that segment into the Performance Chemicals GBU?","Luther C. Kissam","Yes, let me take the second one first, if you don't mind, to move that into Performance Chemicals, and then I'll let Michael talk a little bit about competition. Essentially for competition, he'll go into more detail, but it's overcapacity in the market. We tried to address that somewhat by taking out our highest cost production in Europe last year, but that's essentially what it is. The second question you had is why move it into that? Because when you look at putting the lithium business together with the lithium alkyls business, they have butyllithium and such, along with our aluminum alkyls, that's where we thought we could get synergies not only from a customer overlap, but from a production overlap, from an asset overlap, from the way those markets go to business. So we thought it was the most efficient way to do it. You don't get those efficiencies in the refining catalyst business. So that decision was made to do that. Mike, do you want to talk a little bit about the competitive dynamics?","D. Michael Wilson","Yes, Matt. I think Luke largely answered the question. We've talked about this for most of the past year, and it's just supply and demand. There's overcapacity on the alkyl side of the business. Part of that, we've acknowledged, we've added capacity over the last couple of years, and there were a couple of new competitive entrants. So the good news is, is that demand is continuing to grow. So as that capacity utilization tightens up, we should get back to a point of having some pricing leverage. And of course, as Luke pointed out, we took a significant step last year by taking capacity off-line in Europe.","Matthew Andrejkovics - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Great. And just as a follow-up. Have you guys earmarked the net proceeds that you think you would gather from some of these divestitures that you're contemplating?","Luther C. Kissam","Well, I certainly have a number in my head that I think we should have, but I think the market will say what that is, and we'll make a decision on whether we divest or do it. I don't think it makes a whole lot of sense for me to throw a number out there because it sets a floor or a ceiling, and I want to maximize what we can get out of these assets because they're great assets. And in the right hands, they'll be able to grow and be market leaders in each of their respective markets, and we're looking forward to getting through that process.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Luke, can you give us a sense for your rationale in choosing to divest the 3 businesses that you called out as well as a feel for how the $100 million in aggregate EBITDA might be disaggregated among those 3 businesses?","Luther C. Kissam","Yes, I can do that kind of generally. I think Scott can get into the numbers. But the way I looked at them is this: We've got 4 core businesses, and we need to focus on those 4 core businesses and to continue to drive them because we've got great opportunities in that, and we need to deploy resources both from a capital standpoint as well as from a people standpoint to drive the growth opportunities we have there. It was going to be taking away from that for us to continue to try to develop these businesses. They're solid businesses. They generate nice EBITDA, but they're not going to be a strategic focus for Albermarle in the long run and they're not big enough to move the needle. So we decide -- we made that point that we thought it was in the best interest of our shareholders to divest these businesses at this time, to take the proceeds to allow us to deleverage more rapidly and move forward with our strategy. So that was the thought process behind it, and Scott can give you a little more details on the numbers.","Scott A. Tozier","Yes. So on the 3 businesses, Kevin, minerals is the largest, at roughly $250 million and roughly 10% EBITDA margins. The Fine Chemistry Services is the next the largest, around $200 million, and they've got margins that are up in the -- EBITDA margins in the upper 20s. And the metal sulfide business is roughly $100 million with kind of a high-teen level type EBITDA margin. So that kind of breaks it down a little bit as to where they are.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great, that's very helpful. Second question, Luke, on lithium. Chile's National Lithium Commission seems to be reevaluating policy as it relates to long term development of the resource there. What is your view of that? Can you maybe elaborate on any discussions or view on how policy might change in Chile, and what, if anything, that would mean for Albermarle?","Luther C. Kissam","Right. That's a great question. The lithium commission issued their findings yesterday, and so we've had a chance to review them. I'd also say that the week of the 19th, I was actually in Chile and met with a number of officials in the mining industry and other government officials about the business there to understand their thinking. I think, number one, lithium is a non-concessible mineral so that remains unchanged, which is a good progress. Number two, the existing contracts don't change, so the existing contracts to the SQM and that Rockwood have are remained unchanged, and I was assured time after time that those contracts will be honored. Going forward, I think they are going to establish a state entity to manage the development of future lithium projects, and they are looking for participants that are interested in doing that with a track record in the industry, which is very positive, we believe, from an Albermarle and Rockwood standpoint. So we applaud the government for taking these steps. We look forward to the collaboration, not only for the exploitation of the Salar for the development of lithium, but they also talked about the collaboration from an R&D perspective to drive new uses for lithium, similar is what Albermarle's trying to do for bromine. So we stand ready and able and think we're in the best position to collaborate with them with new uses as well as in the long run, allow us to be their preferred partner. And if you'll allow me, I just -- the agreement that we have, Kevin, we have the right for 2000 metric tons of lithium. We started operating there in 1984, it was the first carbonate production, and we've used essentially 80,000 metric tons of lithium through the end of 2014, which leaves us over 120,000 metric tons of lithium, which at our current extraction rates, allows us to operate under the existing agreement that we have into the 2030 kind of timeframe. So it's not an issue short term. Long term, we ought to be the preferred partner of that commission, and we're going to work very hard to ensure that we are active participants in the lithium markets in Chile forever.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies and Company.","George D'Angelo - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","This is actually George D'Angelo in for Laurence. First question, given the 35% EBITDA margin in bromine, can you just give some puts and takes on what happened in the rest of Performance Chemicals segment and where the weakness was?","Luther C. Kissam","Yes, I think Scott can do that. But essentially -- or Matt, both of them are here. But essentially, what it is, is if you just look at it, those have always historically been lower margin business, so there wasn't a whole lot of year-over-year change from a dramatic standpoint. But Matt, do you want to comment just a little more?","Matthew K. Juneau","That's correct. On a year-over-year basis, if you look at the FCS, it was flat to slightly up, that would be Fine Chemistry Services piece. If you look at the minerals business, it was roughly flat as well with a little bit of upside versus 2013. So what you're seeing, really, reflects the impact in the bromine franchise year-over-year. So the EBITDA margins would've been somewhat higher, if you will, in 2013 compared to 2014.","George D'Angelo - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. And can you guys just provide a little bit of a timeline for selling the 3 businesses?","Luther C. Kissam","Yes. We're -- our goal is to divest the businesses by year-end. But obviously, that depends a lot upon the third party. So we'll launch the process in the month of February, but -- and we've got a plan laid out to be able to close them by the end of the year, but it depends on who the specific purchasers will be, what their hurdles may be and what the -- you got to deal with the third party. So it could take longer, but that's our goal.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","A couple of questions, if I may. First of all, in terms of sort of the strategic thinking in -- I'm sorry to be revisiting ancient history here, but Albermarle spent some capital to build its flame retardant business beyond bromine with phosphorus and minerals. You've sold phosphorus a couple of years ago when that business profitably deteriorated. Now you're selling minerals. So it seems to be kind of a complete about-face from the strategy of, let's say, 10 years ago. Kind of what -- as you kind of look back on your execution over the market developments, what didn't go right for you in sort of building yourself into a flame retardant powerhouse? And how do you -- what do you see yourselves as going forward if it's not a bromine...","Luther C. Kissam","Yes, that's a great question. So I think one thing I'd say is we're a different company today, because of the acquisition, than we were before. So number one, I think in phosphorus, the acquisition that they made was a small phosphorus business, and you could not compete with the Chinese because you just didn't have the volume. You didn't have a big enough position in phosphorus to get your cost to a level where you could be competitive. So that's ultimately the death of that phosphorus business from an Albermarle perspective. If you look at minerals, minerals has been an excellent, excellent acquisition for Albermarle. It has -- it had an outstanding return overall. I think we paid $20 million and assumed some debt for that. And you can see the EBITDA that is -- the kind of EBITDA that's throwing off on an annual basis. So it has been a great -- if I just look forward, it's not going to get the kind -- I don't see the kind of growth for that business that I do in lithium, surface treatment and catalyst and I don't see the profitability. So I don't know that I'd call -- I'd say it was more of a change in circumstances than it was a failed strategy on the minerals business.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Okay, that's helpful. And then to stay in the flame retardant topic. I thought you -- I heard you say on your prepared remarks that you expect some headwinds on mix or pricing from the European adoption of the new non-styrenic installation. Can you get a little bit more granular on that, why that's going to be a problem for you? And then also, how will the ICL joint venture in the non-styrenic installation flame retardants work for you when it's active later in 2015?","Matthew K. Juneau","Okay. So Dmitry, this is Matt, I'll take that. So the bulk of that headwind actually occurred really this year for us because if you remember, we've been unable to enter the market for the new polymeric flame retardant that is replacing HBCD until late in 2014. So what we have seen is faster conversion from HBCD toward the polymeric replacement, and that impacted our 2014 numbers fairly significantly, and that's what we referred to in the script. As we look to 2015, with the announced joint venture with ICL, we are already selling GreenCrest with our tradename for that polymeric in the market. We're entering the market already, and we really don't have the same kind of headwind year-on-year in 2015 that we had in 2014 versus 2013.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Okay, I got it. So the headwind was really in 2014, and you actually expect it to be a good guide for you in 2015?","Matthew K. Juneau","We expect it to start contributing in 2015.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Mike Sison with KeyBanc.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Luke, when you think about the Rockwood transaction back in July, I think the expectation that you'd hoped to do in '15 was EBITDA over $1 billion and free cash flow closer to $500 million. And at the midpoint, you're about the $100 million off in EBITDA and free cash flow is certainly up quite a bit. Can you help bridge the gap of -- and I know there's foreign currency, yield services, but just kind of help us bridge the gap of where the delta is? And then I have a follow-up.","Luther C. Kissam","Yes. So I'll let Scott talk through the bridge. I think on the cash bridge though, the one thing that's important to remember is, remember that the $500 million was on a full year run rate basis, which did not include the tax payments, okay, that we talked about to repatriate the cash. The $100 million to $200 million that we talked about today includes that tax payment, so it's not that big of a gap, as Scott can go through. Scott, can you walk through the bridge, please?","Scott A. Tozier","Yes. So Mike, you've got the numbers, right? So overall, versus what we were expecting, currency plays a big role as you might expect. Roughly $40 million -- as we said, $40 million to $50 million, the same as what it is on a year-over-year basis. The second key one is a change in reporting that we've made with how Rockwood traditionally reported a JV EBITDA. So traditionally, Albermarle has used a net income from our joint ventures and included that in our EBITDA. Rockwood has used a JV EBITDA rather than the net income. And so we've converted them to that same methodology. That drives roughly $25 million. And then you get down to business results and business outlooks, and that's roughly the $100 million that you referred to. The predominant side of that is really in Performance Chemicals and the lack of growth and the challenge that we've had with the drilling fluids and dropping off on the bottom of us. A little bit of lithium but not much. So those are the big drivers. Cash flow, as Luke said, if you would have looked at our free cash flow with that tax payment, it would have been around $100 million in the model, so $500 million less that $400 million tax payment. We're still forecasting $100 million to $200 million of free cash flow next year on a better tax payment primarily and a little bit better in joint venture dividends.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then Luke, when you think about what the -- your earnings potential should be longer term, maybe take us out '17, '18, it might be early, but where do you think the EBITDA potential combined with all the synergy growth potential could be longer term?","Luther C. Kissam","Well, I think we still -- we've got about $50 million of synergies built into this, so there's another $50 million of synergies on top of that. And we've talked about the growth that we would expect. I think that surface treatment, I see no reason they can't continue with double-digit -- high single, double-digit EBITDA growth as long as they can continue to drive their services. So I see that. Catalyst, a high oil upgrade, we've always said we've been in a period of time, depending upon the crude slate, but I expect our catalyst business, refining catalyst continue to grow. And lithium will grow the way we've described it, in the high single digits as well as double-digits once -- mid-double-digits once we see the, really, adoption and proliferation of electronic vehicles. So there's not a reason in this world when we look out '17 and '18, we can't be at $1 billion. We've got just some issues that are impacting us this year from a macroeconomic trend on that price of oil that I can't tell you where that's going to go, and currency just punched us in the gut. So those are the 2 main factors.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ben Kallo with Robert W. Baird.","Benjamin J. Kallo - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Real quickly, housekeeping on the EPS, did that include businesses that you're going to divest? And if so, how much EPS, roundabout, does that include?","Scott A. Tozier","Yes. So that does include the businesses that are being divested. So we're not assuming that there's any divestitures at this point in time. It's roughly $100 million of EBITDA, so a roundabout [ph] EPS impact for you.","Benjamin J. Kallo - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, got it. And then on some of the commentary on FCC, I know you've addressed this. But what are you seeing on the FCC catalyst business right now as far as your refiners? Are they in kind of a shock mode in purchasing, where they're still waiting on commodity price changes? So is that what some of the uncertainty is that you're seeing there?","Luther C. Kissam","I think what we're seeing in FCC catalyst is more, right now, we've got some change outs in the first half -- I mean, not change outs, some competitive trials in the first half of the year that will reduce our volume. We're seeing more in the high oil -- in the clean fuels or the hydro treating catalysts where they seem to be pushing out some trials, pushing out some change outs in running at a little more cost focus. But, Michael, do you want to address that in a little more detail?","D. Michael Wilson","No, I mean, I would say on the FCC side for the full year, I mean, we're still expecting a significant volume growth year-over-year. Now the timing of that from a quarter calendarization standpoint, as Luke has pointed out, is going to be stronger in the second half of the year for the reasons that he has given. But overall, still strong demand growth. And I think that is attributed both to business that we've already won, that's coming on stream and also just the suite of products that we have to offer refiners to solve their problems regardless of what changes they may see in crude dye [ph] or end products. So I don't really see that much of an issue on HOU. It's going to contribute, I think, strongly both to volume and earnings growth in 2015.","Benjamin J. Kallo - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And then my last question. We understand the foreign currency translation impact, but how is it -- can you run through the business units from a competitive standpoint where you have foreign competitors? And how that changes the competitive landscape because of the currency impact?","Luther C. Kissam","Yes. I think if you look at surface treatment, surface treatment is really very localized and regional. So I don't -- it doesn't have much of an impact on the surface treatment business from a competitive landscape. It has a big transitional impact for us, but from a competitive landscape, because it so -- such a regional business, it doesn't have as big of an impact. If you look at the bromine businesses from a standpoint that's not a European producer really, so the impact there is -- Chemtura of U.S., they've got kind of the same U.S. production that we do, probably sell in the same currencies that we do. They probably got the same yen issue that we do. And ICL is about the same, it's a bucket of currencies. So it may give, overall, an edge a little bit to the Chinese, some of those producers. And Tosoh is a Japanese producer, but doesn't really participate outside of that region. So I don't see that as much of an issue. If you look in our catalyst business, we -- in refining catalysts we sell in the U.S. We got a plant in the U.S. We got a plant in Amsterdam. We've got joint ventures all over the world. W.R. Grace pretty much has the same thing. BASF, their production facilities are the same. So from a competition standpoint, some of that depends upon where you're building your catalyst and where you have to ship it to. So I don't see a tremendous impact there across the portfolio. And with regard to lithium, not really a huge competitive market. So while we have about $40 million or $50 million of translational issues that will impact the what -- our earnings, I don't see it creating a huge competitive impact in any region of the country vis-\u00e0-vis our major competitors, with maybe the single exception of bromine out of Asia.","Operator","And your final question comes from the line of Alex Yefremov with Nomura.","Aleksey V. Yefremov - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","First question on lithium. What kind of volume growth do you expect there this year and next? And also, what are your plans in regards to lithium carbonate expansion in Chile? What is the status of that expansion?","Luther C. Kissam","Alex, I think what you're kind of -- we can barely hear you. I think what you said was, what are we looking at for lithium volumes in 2015? And then there was a question about lithium carbonate that I just didn't catch.","Operator","Mr. Yefremov removed himself from queue, sir.","Luther C. Kissam","Okay, go ahead, Michael, I guess from a volume and a lithium standpoint.","D. Michael Wilson","Yes, I mean, I think from a volume standpoint we expect to see continued growth in lithium salts. Again, battery applications are going to drive the market growth predominantly, the non-battery applications or more industrial uses that are going to grow more like GDP. I think what you're going to see us do in terms of the capacity that we have available will increasingly shift that to higher value battery applications away from technical grades. I do think there is going to be some tightness in the market overall in terms of lithium availability, so -- hence, the guidance that we gave that we expected to see higher pricing in lithium. If you think about the downstream of lithium and the organolithiums, I think the one issue is on butyllithium, where we talked about the major business that was lost last year by Rockwood as a key synthesis account switched to a different route that eliminated butyllithium from synthesis. We'll see the full year impact of that this year. Last year was not a full year impact. So I think overall, butyllithium will grow, but we won't completely be able to overcome the loss of that major piece of business that really affected the industry, not just our lithium business.","Luther C. Kissam","And Alex, we couldn't hear what the last question was on lithium carbonate.","D. Michael Wilson","I think the last question you asked was about the plant in Chile. And from a startup standpoint, we see bringing on that capacity in the second quarter to midyear sort of time frame. So -- and then what I think you need to recognize is that, that capacity, the lithium carbonate that we've added there, is predominantly targeted for providing for battery grade accounts. So there will be a qualification period associated with that. So the impact of that from a volume standpoint will come on gradually over time, probably from midyear this year through midyear 2016.","Operator","I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Lorin Crenshaw for closing remarks.","Lorin Crenshaw","Well, thanks to those listening, and I invite you to call us with any further questions, and -- so you have a good day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference.

GAAP financial measures and reconciliations from those to the adjusted numbers discussed today may be found in our press release and the appendix of our earnings presentation, both of which are posted on our website.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Luke.","Luke Kissam","Hey. Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everybody. I'm very pleased with our second quarter results as we continued strong year-on-year growth, while meeting important milestone toward our long-term growth strategy. Excluding divested businesses and negative currency exchange impacts, revenue grew by $85 million or 13%, adjusted EBITDA grew by $29 million or 15% and adjusted earnings per share grew by $0.20 or 21% compared to the second quarter of 2016.","Overall company adjusted EBITDA margins were 30%, a year-on-year increase of 77 basis points, and our three reported segments delivered improved adjusted EBITDA margins of 35%. Results were driven by strong volume and pricing growth in lithium while Refining Solutions, Bromine Specialties and TCF performed about as anticipated.","The long-term secular growth trend in lithium continues to strengthen as evidenced by increasing targets across the automotive industry and the global effort for governments to support this transition to electric vehicles. The recent announcement by Volvo that they plan to make only fully electric and hybrid cars from 2019 onwards and the introduction of regulations in France and the UK to ban the sale of gasoline and diesel cars by 2040 are just a few recent examples.","To support the contracted demand of our customers, we are committed to execute several expansion projects that are expected to increase Albemarle's global lithium derivative capacity to 165,000 metric tons on an LTE basis by the end of 2021, which we refer to as our wave 1 expansion.","Talison is expanding its mine in Greenbushes and Albemarle is expanding the Salar brine operations in the Salar de Atacama, and maintaining current capacity in Silver Peak to produce the ore and brine concentrate volume to feed this wave 1 expansion. Additional exploration efforts are ongoing in Chile, Argentina, the U.S. and in other regions of the world, with the goal to develop new lithium hard rock and brine reserves to be used for capacity expansion past 2021. We expect to announce more about those results on those efforts during 2018.","Along with our mining expansions, we have several large-scale lithium battery-grade derivative projects in various stages of completion. La Negra 2 is meeting battery grade specifications today and is in the process of ramping up to its 20,000 metric ton nameplate capacity based upon our planned brine ramp up in the Salar de Atacama. La Negra 3, which will expand the total lithium carbonate derivative capacity in Chile to over 80,000 metric tons is fully underway, and we can report the following progress. The Chilean authorities have approved the permits related to the project, contracts have been awarded for the major engineer units and equipment; construction leadership has mobilized with approximately 1,000 workers expected to be on the sites before the end of 2017.","The combination of our La Negra and Silver Peak sites will yield at least 85,000 metric tons of lithium carbonate capacity by the end of 2021. In China, the Xinyu expansion will convert Greenbushes spodumene to 20,000 metric tons of LCE of lithium hydroxide, giving us a total of 35,000 metric tons of conversion capacity in China. This expansion is expected to start up in 2018, and we can report the following progress: The construction of the first of the front half of the plan is completed. All environmental permits have been granted and all long lead time equipment has been ordered.","Finally, at the last step of our Wave 1 expansions, we expect to complete the addition of another 40,000 metric tons of LCE spodumene conversion capacity by the end of 2021. I am very confident that we are on pace these to meet our targeted completion dates on these projects in a way that allows us to meet the contracted demand of these products for our customers.","Now I'll turn the call over to Scott.","Scott Tozier","Thanks Luke, and good morning, everyone. For the second quarter, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.13, an increase of $0.20 per share compared to the second quarter of 2016, or 21% growth, excluding the year-over-year impact of divested businesses. Growth in our businesses resulted in an increase of about $0.29. Business results were offset by a net cost increase in other areas of about $0.09 per share, primarily due to increased corporate expenses and a higher effective tax rate compared to second quarter of 2016. Business mix by country and continued strength in our Jordan Bromine Company joint venture drove a favorable effective tax rate in the quarter compared to our previous assumptions. As such, we now expect our full year 2017 effective tax rate, excluding special items, non-operating pension and OPEB items, to be just under 21%, down from prior guidance of 22%.","Corporate costs were $28.2 million during the second quarter, driven by professional fees and compensation costs. Given our updated view of the rest of the year, 2017 corporate costs are now likely to reach the upper end of our expected range of $95 million to $105 million. Operating working capital ended the second quarter at 27% of revenue, in line with our 2017 guidance, and we expect to remain at a similar level for the rest of the year.","In June, we completed the accelerated share repurchase program initiated in March. In total, we received and retired just over 2.3 million shares and expect our average share counts for all of 2017 to now be about 112.3 million shares. Our share counts for the second half will be 112 million even. We will continue to evaluate capital allocation opportunities between projects and transactions that accelerate our growth strategy and additional share repurchase programs.","Capital spending year-to-date through June was $98 million. As Luke noted, our Wave 1 projects are ramping very quickly, and substantial project commitments have been made. This activity should drive increased spending in the second half of 2017. Based on payment terms and timing of equipment delivery, we expect total 2017 CapEx spending to be $325 million the $375 million, slightly lower than our previous guidance.","In the first half of the year, our adjusted free cash flow was $170 million. This number represents cash flow from operations, adding back pensions and postretirement contributions, and subtracting capital expenditures, but excluding onetime acquisition and tax related costs. Unadjusted free cash flow, including those onetime costs, was impacted by a one-time tax payment of approximately $255 million, related to the sale of the Chemetall business. For the full year, we anticipate adjusted free cash flow of $225 million to $325 million.","Now let me turn to our business units. Lithium and Advanced Materials had a very strong quarter, with net sales of $318 million and adjusted EBITDA of $133 million. This resulted in adjusted EBITDA margins of 42%. Compared to the second quarter of 2016, net sales were up 36% and adjusted EBITDA was up 60%. Let me break down these results a little more. The lithium portfolio again delivered outstanding results. Second quarter net sales were up 55% and adjusted EBITDA up 80% compared to the second quarter of 2016. Adjusted EBITDA margins were 47%, and overall volume grew in the quarter by 25%, with pricing improving by approximately 31%. The results were primarily driven by hydroxide volume growth, produced by our assets in China and by product and customer mix with higher average sales prices. For the full year, we now expect average pricing to be up about 20%.","During the first half of 2017, overall global lithium operations have exceeded our expectations. We expect this to allow us to meet our full year target volume growth, while taking prudent steps to optimize brine inventory as we systematically ramp up Chile. Even with higher-than-average rainfall in the Atacama in 2017, our production team has put in place adequate contingency plans that should allow us to meet our stated goal of adding 10,000 metric tons of new LCE production this year. The split of carbonate and hydroxide production may change somewhat from our Q1 forecast, but we will continue to match production needs with the needs of our contracted customers.","Full year expectations for adjusted EBITDA and volume both for the Lithium business remain unchanged. We still expect to deliver an adjusted EBITDA increase greater than 35% compared to 2016 and about 10,000 metric tons of growth on LCE basis. Due to product and customer mix and our increasing efforts in lithium resource exploration for Wave 2 growth, our adjusted EBITDA in the third and fourth quarter is expected to be similar to the first quarter of 2017.","PCS performed in line with expectations. Net sales were down 2% and adjusted EBITDA was down 6% compared to the second quarter of 2016. Our full year expectation remains unchanged.","Second quarter net sales for Bromine Specialties were $204 million, down 1% year-on-year. Adjusted EBITDA was $62 million, down 7%, and was impacted by unfavorable pricing of the byproduct potassium hydroxide, higher freight costs and lower clear brine volumes. Clear brine volumes were particularly strong in second quarter of 2016, providing a difficult comparison.","Flame retardant demand across electronics applications continues to be healthy. The business delivered strong adjusted EBITDA margins in the quarter of 30%.","Refining Solutions reported second quarter net sales of $184 million, and adjusted EBITDA of $50 million. Compared to the second quarter of 2016, sales were up 3% and adjusted EBITDA was down 19%. Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was down as anticipated, driven by sales mix and higher input costs. Sales volumes were supported by solid demand in clean fuel technologies, or HPC catalysts, especially in the heavier feed resid segment. This segment is traditionally lower margin. Fluid catalytic cracking, or FCC catalyst volumes, were down due to customer turnarounds and competitive trials, just as in the first quarter, but were partially offset by strength in FCC volumes in North America where lower margin VGO products are more prominent.","Now I'll turn the call back over to Luke to update our view for the year.","Luke Kissam","Thanks, Scott. Up first half in position: 2017 is another outstanding year for Albemarle. The Lithium business performed very well in the first half of 2017. We remain on track with our aggressive capital and exploration projects in lithium, and are meeting the demand needs of our customers today. Bromine Specialties, PCS and Refining Solutions performed as anticipated. In addition, we returned $320 million to our shareholders through buybacks and dividends in the first half of 2017, and net debt-to-EBITDA ratio remains a very healthy 0.9. As we look to the second half of 2017, in Bromine Specialties, favorable market trends in flame retardants appear to be continuing and our plants continue to run very well. We expect full year adjusted EBITDA growth in the mid- to high-single digits on a percentage basis.","In Refining Solutions, we expect on improved second half, with the fourth quarter forecasted to be much stronger than the third due to the timing of some larger CFT orders. As always with CFT, there is some risk related to orders slipping from one quarter to the next. In FCC, we continue to see strong demand in North America, driven by Tier 3 gasoline standards and the success of our action technology in that application. Finally, lithium continues on the path for full-year adjusted EBITDA growth of more than 35% versus 2016, with the third and fourth quarters expected to be similar to the first quarter of 2017. For the second half, we expect EPS in the third quarter to look similar to that in the first, and EPS the fourth quarter to be higher, driven largely by the timing of the orders in Refining Solutions.","Based on the strong first-half results and our expectations for continued business strength in the rest of 2017, we are reaffirming our 2017 full year guidance for net sales of $2.9 billion to $3.05 billion, adjusted EBITDA of $835 million to $875 million and adjusted diluted EPS of $4.20 to $4.40 per share. In closing, I am pleased with our overall execution in the first half of this year and with the progress the teams have made in our capital and exploration projects in our lithium business. We remain very focused on meeting the needs of our customers and execution of our strategy, which we expect to deliver significant value to our shareholders over time.","Matt Juneau","Operator, we're ready to open the lines for Q&A. But before you do so, I'd like to remind everyone to please limit your questions to 2 at one time so that everyone has a chance to ask questions [Operator Instructions] Please proceed.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan, of RBC Capital Markets.","Arun Viswanathan","I wanted to ask a question just on the footnote 1 on the release, it talks about the inventory valuation method. Can you just explain a little bit more on how that impacted your results and what the implications are for the rest of the year?","Luke Kissam","Sure. I mean, from an adjusted perspective, we're taking inventory revaluation out of context, out of the number. So it really does not affect our adjusted EBITDA at all. If you look at our U.S. GAAP basis, the valuation related to our Chinese acquisition at the end of 2016, when you do an acquisition, you have to mark up the inventory that's being purchased to market value, and that flows through your results until that was out of them. So that's really what that relates to.","John Mitchell","And the only thing I would add is that did give us some additional volume in Lithium in the second quarter because of the amount of inventory that we acquired in the transaction.","Arun Viswanathan","Right, that was I was actually asking. And then the other question I ask was a follow up, was just on your second half outlook, maybe could just describe some of the issues that you've been experiencing weather-wise or if there was higher exploration cost or anything else that would lead you to believe the second half performance would be about the same as first half?","John Mitchell","Yes, this is John. So in the second half, we're going to have a product mix and also a customer mix that is going to lead to a slightly lower average sales price, as well as we have been ramping up exploration efforts so we have added costs in the second half. As Luke mentioned in his opening remarks, we have a number of exploration efforts going on around the world, and those efforts are ramping up. So the combination of those issues leads to the forecast that Luke and Scott mentioned earlier.","Luke Kissam","One thing I'll add on that is when you look at it in a full year basis. I know you've got it to look at it quarters and a half years and all that. When you look at it on a full year basis, we are right on track. We're doing exactly what we anticipated, the numbers may be moving around a little bit for the quarter. But for the full year, we feel great about where we are in Lithium. The exploration projects and really, all of our businesses, firing on all cylinders right now.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of John Roberts, UBS.","John Roberts","I think there's been some comments made about possible consolidation within the lithium competitive landscape here. How do you think about concentration in the industry and whether consolidation can occur?","Luke Kissam","What I think that for every -- as we've said, if you look at our balance sheet, our balance sheet is in very good shape. If you look at the acquisitions we've done, I think we've demonstrated the ability to integrate those businesses and get a return on the capital that we've invested in those businesses to drive long-term shareholder returns. And where there is an opportunity for us to acquire assets, be they a technology or a reserve or an operating assets, that allow us to de-risk and strengthen our strategy, we're certainly interested in doing it.","John Roberts","And then you gave us an update on your Wave 1 projects. Could you give us your understanding of competitor Wave 1 projects? And are there any periods that look unbalanced with respect to supply and demand over the next couple of years?","Luke Kissam","Yes, I can't comment anything more than what you've already read publicly about what the competitors may be doing. I think John can give you a pretty good view of our view of the supply and demand balance.","John Mitchell","Yes, I think our view on net supply and demand remains consistent. We see more product coming in from the Australian hard rock mines and China. Of course, the capacity that we are bringing on between now and 2020 and a few others. Overall, we see the market continue to be roughly in balance. There will be short periods of time where there could be some lumpiness in terms of capacity coming online. But really, overall, through the midterm, the market, overall in balance.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","David Begleiter","Luke and John, looking at lithium EBITDA guidance, the second half, is that good run rate for full year 2018? And if it's not, why not?","Luke Kissam","No, it's early to talk about 2018, but I wouldn't think that would be the guidance. I'd be very disappointed if that were our guidance for the full year, that run rate. Remember, we're talking about adding 10,000 metric tons a year. So we'll obviously have significant more volume in the second half in 2018, from a brine standpoint, we'll have more brine available, we'll be running La Negra, produce higher volumes out of that. So we still remain on track. We said our goal was to get 10,000 metric tons of additional volume in 2017 and 2018, and we believe we'll still be able to do that. So you shouldn't look at the second half of 2017 as a run rate from an EBITDA perspective, not at all.","David Begleiter","Good. And John, just on La Negra 2, are there any operating or ramp-up issues that could be impacting second half production rates or supplies to customers?","John Mitchell","So Q2, we produced more out of La Negra 2 than we did in Q1. We talked about the split of the 10,000 metric tons in previous calls, we're probably tilting a little bit a more toward lithium hydroxide versus lithium carbonate in the second half, in the overall year. But La Negra 2 continues to ramp up. We're managing the brine situation based on our commitments in our environmental permit. And as many know, there have been rain events in the Atacama, we're just really managing the brine situation there. But we continue to be focused on meeting the commitments of our customers and especially, the customers that have signed long-term agreements with us, and we're confident were going to make sure that we take care of them.","Luke Kissam","Yes, David, this is Luke. There's still a lot of noise out there about whether or not we're meeting our customers needs, or we declare force majeure. First of all, we have not declared force majeure. Second of all, every commitment that our customer has made to us, we fulfill that commitment. And we've seen no reason we won't be able to do that for the remainder of the year. The customers that are committed to us, we are going to meet their supply demands.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Bob Koort of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Bob Koort","Luke, I was wondering if you can characterize or maybe John, what your battery customer base looks like in say, 2018 or '19 versus where it is today in terms of scale of customers, diversity of customers, and where along the supply chain you might be getting inquiries? How would you expect that to transition if you become a much bigger part of that market?","John Mitchell","Bob, this is John. So we've worked really hard over the last couple of years in terms of developing relationships with the leading cathode and battery producers in the world. And I think as we go forward, our long term agreements and commitments are primarily, will primarily stay with that basket of customers as we go forward. As we evaluate the performance of different cathode and battery suppliers out there, we could engage them and bring them into our customer base. But we've been focused on really very high quality customer set and customers that have the same philosophy in terms of long-term planning and long-term commitments. And so we see going forward, at least, as far as I can see, a consistent set of customers going forward.","Luke Kissam","Yes, Bob. There's one thing I will say, I think this is accurate, although it may be anecdotal, we're seeing in Lithium, particularly in the battery space, more interest in the OEMs having discussions to make sure they understand the supply side of the business, maybe more so than we did in some of our other businesses. So we're having those conversations because it's always good. But right now, the supply chain over the next 2 years, at least, we see more in line with where we are today.","Bob Koort","And if I could follow up on the pricing side, I realize it's a pretty significant jumps in pricing. I know you've also talked about securing longer term contracts. How should we think about how your price dynamic moving forward either from restructuring contracts, writing new contracts or echoing maybe market price moves. How should we think about price flows through the line?","Luke Kissam","Yes, Bob. This is Luke. I don't want to talk about what pricing is going to be in '18 and '19. What I will say is that we pretty clearly articulated what our strategy was. Where we want to ensure that we're getting value today as well as long-term sustainable value for this business going forward, and I don't see anything that's going to change that strategy. We have big volume customers, the bigger the volume as a general rule, the lower the price. It's how we've operated and we're going to continue to look towards our margins in that 40% range. We believe we'll be able to keep that and where it makes sense to take pricing actions, we will. But we are focused on this short and long term, I don't see that strategy changing so long as the market dynamics that we see proceed as we expect.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn of Longbow Research. Please go ahead.","Dmitry Silversteyn","Just wanted to understand your guidance for the second half of the year, Lithium pricing. It sounds like if you just kind of averaged the first half, and which are guiding for the year, we're looking at kind of mid- to high-single-digit year-over-year growth in Lithium pricing in the second half of the year. So first of all, I want to make sure that my math is right. And then secondly, I'm just wondering if that's a question of just comps being more difficult in the second half of the year because that's where you started to ramp up pricing or if pricing is actually expected to decline a little bit because of the mix?","John Mitchell","This is John. As we mentioned a couple of moments ago, because of the product mix and the customer mix, we see average selling price across this past quarter, quarter 2, going down a little bit in Q3 to Q4. It's not anything related to how we negotiate, or the fact that we're lowering the price in the market. It's strictly just based on our contractual commitments and where we see [indiscernible] hydroxide carbonate and types of customers that we are obligated to supply, there's a slight decline in terms of average selling price versus what we are able to accomplish in Q2.","Scott Tozier","Dmitry, as you alluded to, this is Scott. As we ramped up the contract negotiations last year, we're filling up those contracts in the price moves that happened in 2016, the year-over-year comparison going into 2017 starts to get more and more difficult and I think that's really what you're seeing reflected in our guidance in the second half.","Dmitry Silversteyn","Got you. And then just a follow-up on the Fine Chemical, chemistry services, that market has been heating up a little bit, probably over the last year, year and a half. I know you tried to sell that business once, didn't come to an agreeable outcome. Are you also [indiscernible] are you seeing more activity in there, a little more, stronger performance out of that business in the second half of the year and into 2018? And secondly, has the consolidation environment in the industry prompted you to take a look at monetizing that asset again?","Luke Kissam","Yes, we're not planning any increase in FCS in the second half. We'll look to see what happens in '18. I mean, Dmitry, those are long-term contracts that you've got to go out and get commitments for and then roll into. So I'm not expecting to see anything that's going to move the needle from a profitability standpoint in '17 -- in the rest of '17 or in '18. But they do take steps to continue to improve that business. We need to rebuild that business before we talk about any type of looking at any type of strategic options for it right now, Dmitry.","Operator","And your next question is from the line of Kevin McCarthy of Vertical Research Partners.","Kevin McCarthy","Luke, would you comment on the viability or lack thereof of direct shipments of ore by your competitors from Australia to China. Is that something that you would expect to be ongoing over the medium-term or more of a short-term phenomenon?","Luke Kissam","Yes, I think it's more of a short-term phenomenon, I think. But I'll let John go ahead and talk, you're talking about DSO, you're talking about concentrate, just so we're clear, Kevin?","Kevin McCarthy","DSO.","Luke Kissam","Go ahead, John.","John Mitchell","Kevin, this is John. So just so everyone understands what we were talking about, DSO is essentially a blasted rock, totally unprocessed, it's not upgraded at the mine in any way. And so in order to actually produce a usable product, first have to have an asset that can actually upgrade this rock to an ore concentrate of a certain quality and then that ore concentrate then has to be converted or refined into a lithium salt battery-grade or tech grade salt. And so our view is that the economics, if you think about the economics of just shipping raw rock that's blasted out of the ground, it's definitely not sustainable. And so how long will someone ship DSO and how long will someone pay kind of the high prices and the high shipping costs, our view would be relatively short-lived. So just based on the pure economics of it.","Kevin McCarthy","A second question, if I may, on hydroprocessing catalyst. Luke, I think you mentioned that you anticipate a strong fourth quarter of 2017. Recognizing that shipments can be lumpy and timing can be variable, do you think the greater risk would be acceleration of those shipments into 3Q or postponement back into the first quarter of '18 as you see it today?","Luke Kissam","Yes, I think it's always an issue. It's hard to tell, but I think we highlight for the fact that there's a lot built into the fourth quarter and it can slide into the first quarter. It depends on what happens with a capital budgets of the refiners, where they are and what that need is. I think there's a risk it could slide into the first quarter of next year, more so than being pulled forward.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Mike Harrison from Seaport Global Securities. Please go ahead.","Mike Harrison","You guys mentioned that there's been some rain down in the Chile, Argentina area. And it sounds like you've been able to work and still be able to meet your customer needs without putting everybody on allocation. Was wondering though, have you incurred any higher costs associated with being able to meet all those customer needs, and is the weather affecting your expected mix that you referred to of shifting more toward hydroxide and away from carbonate?","John Mitchell","So first off, Mike, with regard to the rain event, we always have contingency plans from an operating perspective. The team has done a great job to ensure that we can meet our stated goal of 10,000 metric tons. And we have taken specific action to just make sure that we're smart about managing the brine system and the brine quality. We can actually make more carbonate today, but we wanted to make sure that we we're managing the pond system, we're managing the brine as best possible to make sure we have the most favorable economics and outcome.","Mike Harrison","And then you also mention the exploration efforts and kind of said that you're going to update us in 2018. But could you just maybe give us a little bit of color on exactly where the efforts are [indiscernible] most intensively as we look at the second half?","Luke Kissam","Yes, their ramping up all over. I don't know how else to say it. We started in the first half of the year. So we've got exploration work ongoing in numerous spots in the United States. We've got exploration in Argentina as we've talked about, we've got an option for rights in the Catamarca region there, that are very promising. We're also doing work in the Salar, in other areas of Chile as well as work being done in Australia, at our Talison facility. So we are ramping up everywhere. What's important for us is also to understand the quality of the reserves and to quantify the quality of those reserves by sometime in the first half of next year. So we can put some priorities and decisions and capital plans going forward. It just takes a long time to bring those types of resources online. Some would obviously be quicker than others but in the first half, first 9 months of 2018, we need to be making some decisions, and we'll update you when we know what we're going to do.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Mike Sison with KeyBanc.","Mike Sison","Your outlook for Lithium in second half, certainly, year-over-year is still pretty impressive. But it was wondering if you could just help us understand a little bit of how mix, maybe some of the variables that change mix for that business, meaning is more hydroxide better for mix, less hydroxide and where you're making it from, different type of customers, just to better understand what changes in the second half versus the first half?","Scott Tozier","Yes, so let's just start on the customer side. So different customers, depending on the volume commitments and the long term commitments have different pricing, and that is a big part of kind of what's driving it as some large-scale customers are beginning to ramp up the take. So you have just a customer mix there in terms of different agreements that are negotiated. And then in terms of the economics, again it really, it's tough to paint a product, lithium hydroxide versus lithium carbonate, with the same brush because you really have to compare it against a specific customers in terms of whether margins are being impacted or not. So I would say that there is a mix issue in terms of carbonate hydroxide. That's probably even more importantly is the customer mix is really driving the overall average selling price, difference between Q2 and Q3 and 4.","Mike Sison","Right. That's helpful. Just shifting gears a little bit, I think you guys mentioned that an FCC, that trials are more competitive. It's that right? Is that causing some margin pressure? And if so, why do think the trials -- trialing is more competitive these days?","Luke Kissam","I'm not sure it's more competitive. I'll let Sylvia talk about how competitive they are. If you look at the margin pressure, what happens is if you look across the industry, the max propylene is probably the highest value because it gives the highest upgrade to the refinery, so they get more value out of that. Whenever you're in a unit that is a max propylene unit and then a customer trial comes in for that unit, you drop down to a VGO or some other level, you're going to get margin pressure on that. So that's really what's causing the pressure that we're seeing on margins in the second quarter and FCC. But with regard to the competitive nature of the trials, I'll turn you over to Silvio.","Silvio Ghyoot","Silvio. Luke is correct that the higher-margin segments like a max propylene have been affected due to those scheduled trials and turn around and some of our key customers. Worthwhile to note is also the fat that even in the higher-margin market like the VGO application, you start seeing that -- and we are always doing this, that our customers are expecting high performing rate, while we build in more activity so there is somewhere a cost pressure together with some inflation that is also having a negative effect on those margins.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Tyler Frank from Robert Baird. Please go ahead.","Tyler Frank","There were a few reports recently about global advanced metals, potentially filing an injunction to halt your expansion in Talison. Could you discuss that and any thoughts you can provide there will be helpful. And then the bromine market, it seems like overall, things continue to stabilize there, but can you provide just your current thoughts on the second half and heading into 2018? What you're seeing for overall demand in that market and the ability, you think, to potentially raise price and bromine, will be great.","Luke Kissam","Yes, let me take the GAM injunction. GAM and Talison operate right there together. They have the Tantalum mines, I think, John, isn't that right? And Talison is operated from years. There's historically been some back and forth between the two companies. There's been discussions in the past. This is just an escalation of that. It's really kind of business as usual and we feel very confident in Talison's position as do our partners and we are united in that we will vigorously defend this and it won't have a material impact on the plans that we have for Talison going forward. With that, bromine question, I'll turn that over to Rafael.","Raphael Crawford","So to give you perspective on bromine. From a market perspective as you would ask, what does that look like in going into 2018, end of 2017, we still see flame retardant growth in the low single digits, that's been driven by server demand, really the automation of automobiles, the Internet of Things. So that's been a positive. So it continues the trend from last year to this year. We would expect that over the next several years to continue on flame retardants. If you'll remember that we're very much electronics-oriented in our flame retardants business and some exposure to the construction market.","Bromine supply in China remains tight. Lower production in China, prices have remained fairly good. They dipped down in Q2, but have come back up. And I think that the piece of uncertainty for us and of 2017 and 2018 is really on completion fluids. So that's what's going into drilling markets and oil field. Rig counts are low, we do benefit from having geographic diversity in our manufacturing sites. We're the only producer with a site in the Middle East and in the United States. So we're able to counterbalance trends in that area. But overall, I think bromine remains strong. We'll have mid- to high single-digit EBITDA growth this year doing a lot on our own productivity and efficiency improvements. That's gone very well so far this year and we'd expect that to contribute into next year. Just real quick on pricing. You asked a question about price. While we're always looking for opportunities to capture value. Some markets will be up. We've been able to capture some additional price in flame retardants, but we do see cost pressure continuing in the completion fluids market going forward. But they seem to net out this year and where there is an opportunity, we'll certainly look to capture those.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Lawrence Alexander from Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","This is Nick Sucera on for Laurence. So I just have a quick question in catalyst, how do you see the set up for FCC and HPC for 2018, should be think about it, about a mid-single-digit cadence from this year?","Silvio Ghyoot","This is Silvio. Can you repeat that question, please?","Unidentified Analyst","Sure. So how do we see the set-up for FCC in HPC catalyst in 2018? Should we think about it on a mid-single digit [Indiscernible] year?","Luke Kissam","Yes, and this is Luke. Let me take that one. It's a little too early to talk about 2018. What we've said, I think in the past, is we expect to see low to mid-single-digit kind of growth and right now, what I would do is given where oil prices are and that the impact can have on HPC I think it's probably toward the lower to mid single-digit, that would be below 5%. So that's how I would look at it right now. Haven't seen the AOP roll up yet, but that will be my anticipation.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, and maybe just an updated view on taxes and cash taxes this year and next.","Luke Kissam","Scott?","Scott Martin","Yes, cash taxes. As I mentioned, we paid a significant amount of cash taxes in the second quarter, so $255 million related to the Chemetall sale and the gain on that sale, that was as scheduled. And as we highlighted in prior calls, ongoing cash taxes remain in that mid-teen type of level, right where it's been the past several years, so right on tract. So no other surprises and no other large transactions coming through this year.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Jim Sheehan of SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Jim Sheehan","When I think back to 2016, I recall you raising your guidance based on some concurrency tailwinds you were seeing -- looks like currency is going to be another benefit here going forward in the second half. Are you incorporating a currency tailwind into your current outlook? Or why wouldn't you have [Indiscernible] considering what the dollar has been doing?","Luke Kissam","Yes, so far we obviously, watched the euro continue to strengthen as well as some other currencies, but primarily, euro for us. As you look at our range, we anticipated that the euro could strengthen. It's certainly not something that we bank on, not being FX traders at all. But at the end of the day, it's certainly in our range. So if the euro were to stay at the high end of where it is today, you should expect our guidance to be at the higher end of the range versus where we are at the midpoint. So but let's see how the year ends up because it certainly could go back the other direction between now and year-end. So right now, it's certainly looked at as part of what are, in our range.","Jim Sheehan","Great. And on Lithium margins, the 40% range, I guess, is a pretty wide range to think about. How should we think about these margins progressing in 2018, given that your La Negra 2 will be filled up and your spending for La Negra 3 shouldn't have really have started yet. So does that imply your margins expanding in 2018?","Luke Kissam","Yes, I think there's a whole lot of give and takes in that. So what we've always said is that we expect margins to maintain in that 40% range, maybe a little bit higher, 1 quarter. But if we get a mix of customers, maybe a little bit lower than other customer, maybe a little bit lower than other customers. And that's what I continue to model it. I wouldn't get margin creeping there. We've got additional cost that we'll have next year, and so because we'll have more exploration work. We'll have more work that will hit the P&L with regard to the early work on those new resources that we're bringing in and then we'll have the higher volume to offset that. So when we say kind of in that range of 40%, we mean that for the long term.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews for Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Andrews","Just on the exploration costs, can you just dimentionalize for us roughly, what the impact to margins is? And then also help me or remind me, I guess that you can't CapEx it or treat it as CapEx, because it's hypothetical at this point, the projects. But what's the trigger that allows that to become CapEx rather than an expense?","Scott Tozier","Yes, Jim, or Vince, such a good question. As you look at first half versus second half from the resource spending, I'm expecting that the margin degradation is somewhere in, I don't know, the 4 percentage point range is what I'm expecting from those resource explorations. The accounting for this is obviously, tied into the mining industry. And generally what will happen is you're expensing the cost of exploration until you get to the point of having a proven and probable reserve. That there is an accounting definition around that as well, a mining definition or actual engineering definition. And after that, it's basically the value added spend that goes into it. So it will not be at 100% of what we spend that gets capitalized but only a portion of that. So as we get closer to actually developing those mines in the resources, we'll have a better sense of exactly what we'll need to spend in each side whether it's expense or capital.","Vincent Andrews","Just as a follow-up. The reduction CapEx for the year, I assume that's just that timing issue and probably would just flow into 2018? Nothing's changed but that's you think the projects are going to cost?","Scott Tozier","That's exactly right. It's really just the timing of when we're receiving equipment. But actually, more importantly, in the adjustment that we've made, it's the payment terms that we've actually been able to secure are actually a bit longer than we normally have. So those cash dollars will actually go out early in 2018 versus what we originally thought in 2017.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Kapsch from Aegis Capital.","Chris Kapsch","Just a slightly more nuance follow-up on the sequential pricing commentary. The mix of customers that you're referring to that leads to down pricing in the second half versus what you saw in the second quarter. Is this a function of just strategic customers hitting volume rebate thresholds? Or is it -- does it have to do with the mix of customers that whereas maybe more significant customers are getting, with pricing, are getting a more disproportionate amount of the volumes in tonnage?","John Mitchell","This is John. It has to do really with the latter. Certain customers are ramping up at a faster rate than others, and it's just that. And our long-term contracts have that ramp built into them. And so when you look at what our obligations are to serve and based on their pricing levels, we can calculate what the average selling price is expected to be going forward into Q3 and Q4. So it's really just the demand profile of our contracted customers.","Chris Kapsch","And if I could just follow up on that. Can you -- I know it's early to talk about 2018, but since these are contracted customers, maybe you can just extrapolate what the thinking is on pricing looking to 2018 based on those contracts and seeing which customers, I guess, are ramping more quickly and doing better than others. And then also along those lines, you commented you're more engaged with OEMs, not just the supply chain customers. At this juncture, do feel good about your strategic choices in terms of customers based on the winners and maybe those that aren't doing as well, as the EV market develops further?","John Mitchell","First off, I said earlier, we feel really good about the customer base that we've formed long-term partnerships and long-term supply arrangements with, I mean these are the leaders in the industry. So we're going to work really hard to make sure that they're as successful as they can be. Second part, just on pricing, keep in mind, our long term agreements have pricing flexibility built into them. As Luke said earlier, it's a little bit early to start talking about what does pricing look like in 2018, but our long-term agreements do give us pricing flexibility going forward.","Operator","Thank you for your questions, ladies and gentlemen, and your participation in today's conference.

My name is Mark, and I will be your operator for today. As a reminder, this call is being recorded for replay purposes.","I would now like to turn the call over to Matt Juneau, Executive Vice President of Corporate Strategy and Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.","Matthew K. Juneau - Albemarle Corp.","Thank you, Mark. Thank you, and welcome to Albemarle's third quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Our earnings were released after the close of the market yesterday. And you'll find our press release, earnings presentation and non-GAAP reconciliations posted on our website under the Investors section at albemarle.com.","Joining me on the call today are Luke Kissam, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Scott Tozier, Chief Financial Officer; Raphael Crawford, President, Bromine Specialties; Silvio Ghyoot, President, Refining Solutions; and John Mitchell, President, Lithium & Advanced Materials.","As a reminder, some of the statements made during this conference call about the future performance of the company may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws. Please note the cautionary language about forward-looking statements contained in our press release. That same language applies to this call.","Please also note that our comments today regarding our financial results exclude all non-operating, non-recurring and other unusual items. Reconciliations related to any non-GAAP financial measures discussed may be found in our press release or earnings presentation, both of which are posted on our website. Page 8 and the appendix of the earnings deck provide details of our reported earnings along with non-GAAP reconciliations related to discontinued operations and other special items in the quarter.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Luke.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Thanks, Matt. And good morning, everybody. I'm very pleased with our third quarter results as we continued to deliver strong growth in both Lithium and Refining Solutions and our Bromine Specialties and PCS businesses performed in line with our expectations. Adjusted EBITDA grew by 32% in Lithium, and by 19% in Refining Solutions compared to the third quarter of 2015.","For all of our continuing operations, excluding the year-over-year net impact of the divestitures of Minerals and Metal Sulfides businesses, adjusted EBITDA grew by $16 million, an increase of 10% compared to the third quarter of 2015 and adjusted earnings per share increased by $0.19 or 26%. Overall, company adjusted EBITDA margins were almost 29%, up 270 basis points from the third quarter of 2015, and our three reported segments again delivered combined adjusted EBITDA margins greater than 33%. The third quarter was also highlighted by additional moves to strengthen our industry-leading Lithium business.","In August, we signed a definitive agreement to acquire the lithium hydroxide and lithium carbonate conversion assets of Jiangxi Jiangli New Materials Science and Technology Company, with the closing expected by the end of the first quarter 2017. Once closed, these assets will give us spodumene conversion capacity of 15,000 metric tons per year of lithium hydroxide and lithium carbonate with infrastructure already in place to support a 20,000 to 25,000 metric ton expansion.","Spodumene for the current operations and the planned expansion will be supplied from our Talison joint venture in Australia. The acquisition increases our control of the supply chain from spodumene mining through production and sales of battery-grade lithium hydroxide and lithium carbonate. In addition to the planned capacity expansion at Jiangxi Jiangli, we will continue to pursue development of a greenfield spodumene conversion plant of approximately another 40,000 metric tons a year so that we can fully utilize the Talison resources over time.","Full utilization of the Talison resources combined with the additional capacity we expect to add in Chile once a new quota is finalized will allow us to achieve roughly 160,000 metric tons per year of lithium carbonate equivalent production capacity by the beginning of the next decade. Based on current demand projections, we believe we will fully utilize that capacity by the early to mid-2020s. At that point, our assets in Chile and Australia will have many years of useful life remaining, but as of now, we do not believe further expansions are likely. Therefore, to meet the expected market growth past the early 2020s, we will need new resources.","The agreement with Bolland Minera S.A. that we announced in the third quarter is a positive step in that direction. This agreement gives us exclusive exploration and acquisition rights to a lithium reserve in Antofalla in the Catamarca Province of Argentina. Based on existing data, we believe this resource will be certified as the largest lithium resource in Argentina.","Given the development cycle to commercialize a new resource, we must begin investing now to bring new resources online by the early to mid-2020s. Our very preliminary evaluation on the Antofalla resource is encouraging, but you can expect it to take one to two years for us to make a decision on commercial viability.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott.","Scott A. Tozier - Albemarle Corp.","Thanks, Luke, and good morning. In the third quarter, we reported adjusted net income from continuing operations of $0.91 per diluted share, an increase of 26% compared to third quarter 2015, excluding the year-over-year net impact of the divested Minerals and Metal Sulfides businesses. The increase was driven primarily by core business growth and a lower effective tax rate compared to 2015.","Our corporate costs in the quarter increased, driven by increased compensation cost and some one-time costs related to relocations and legal settlements. As a result, our corporate costs for the full year will likely range between $85 million and $90 million. There was no change in our estimated 2016 effective tax rate in the third quarter from the second quarter. Excluding special items, non-operating pension and OPEB items, we continue to expect the 2016 ETR to be about 19%.","We continue to expect D&A in 2016 of $185 million to $200 million, with 2016 capital expenditures now expected to be $175 million to $185 million, down from an estimate of $185 million to $200 million at the end of the second quarter. We're not slowing any of our projects. The decline is simply a result of changes in the timing of spending and improved capital efficiency versus our prior estimate.","Operating working capital remained at 29% of sales at the end of the third quarter. Strong sales in our Refining Solutions business at the end of the quarter especially in Clean Fuels Technologies drove an increase in accounts receivables. We also saw an increase in our Refining Solutions inventories in the quarter. Forecasted demand in Clean Fuels in the first half of 2017 will necessitate further inventory growth in the fourth quarter to manage production for those expected sales. As such, our working capital is likely to remain in the 28% to 29% range at the end of 2016.","Through the end of the third quarter, our adjusted free cash flow including contribution from discontinued operations was $415 million. This number represents cash flow from operations, adding back pension and post-retirement contributions and subtracting capital expenditures, but excludes one-time synergy, acquisition and tax-related costs. Free cash flow included in those one-time costs of $325 million through September nearly doubled the cash flow generated last year in the same period.","Before I turn to our core business unit performance, let me briefly update you on our Fine Chemistry Services business. Sales and adjusted EBITDA improved in the third quarter, both year-over-year and sequentially. However, as we look ahead to the fourth quarter, this business faces top comparisons. Fine Chemistry Services made all of its total 2015 adjusted EBITDA over $17 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we only expect breakeven performance due to contract timing.","Moving on to our core businesses. Let's start with Lithium and Advanced Materials. Third quarter net sales were $240 million with adjusted EBITDA of $92 million, resulting in adjusted EBITDA margins of 38%. Compared to the third quarter of 2015, net sales were up 15% and adjusted EBITDA was up 18%. The Lithium portfolio again delivered outstanding results. The third quarter net sales were up 30% and adjusted EBITDA up 32% compared to the third quarter 2015. Adjusted EBITDA margins of 41% were consistent with our guidance. And this is the seventh consecutive quarter with margins above 40%.","Overall, volume grew in the quarter by 13% and pricing improved by 16%. We saw continued strong pricing momentum in our battery-grade products and price increases in technical-grade lithium carbonate and lithium hydroxide as well.","As in the second quarter, volume growth was driven by increased tolling of spodumene into battery-grade lithium carbonate and hydroxide. As a reminder, these results include a negative impact from year-over-year potash pricing, which we continue to forecast at $7 million for all of 2016.","PCS performance was in line with our expectations with net sales down just over $6 million and adjusted EBITDA down $2 million compared to the third quarter of 2015. Impact from the Sun Edison bankruptcy and pricing pressure in our Organometallics product lines drove the lower results. Our full-year expectations are unchanged with PCS adjusted EBITDA likely to be down by about $15 million in 2016 compared to 2015.","Bromine Specialties also performed as expected with third quarter net sales of $194 million and adjusted EBITDA of $52 million, resulting in adjusted EBITDA margins of 27%. Compared to the third quarter of 2015, sales were up 2% with adjusted EBITDA down 12%. Adjusted EBITDA and margins were impacted by negative pricing and mix, lower completion fluids, volumes in the Gulf of Mexico and Europe, lower volumes in certain flame retardants and reduced demand for agricultural intermediates.","Consistent with prior guidance, we continue to expect the business to deliver full-year adjusted EBITDA that is only a few percentage points below 2015 performance despite a $15 million year-over-year headwind due to the loss of a methyl bromine contract at the end of 2015.","Refining Solutions reported third quarter net sales of $190 million and adjusted EBITDA of $65 million, resulting in adjusted EBITDA margins of 34%. Compared to the third quarter of 2015, sales were up 3% and adjusted EBITDA was up 19%. As expected, Heavy Oil Upgrading, or FCC catalyst, was down year-on-year as refiners made small operating adjustments for higher-than-normal gasoline inventory in the United States.","Also, while our full-year expectations for Heavy Oil Upgrading are unchanged, that is we continue to expect 2016 adjusted EBITDA to be very similar to 2015, this business faces difficult comparisons in the second half of 2016 due to the very strong sales in the second half of 2015. Volume in 2016 has been more evenly spread across quarters while volume in 2015 was back-end loaded due to both turnarounds and competitive trials at our customer base in the first half of 2015.","Clean Fuels Technologies, or HPC catalyst, results were strong as expected with improved sales and adjusted EBITDA driven by increased volume and a more favorable product mix. Overall, Refining Solutions continues to exceed our expectations at the start of 2016 with full-year adjusted EBITDA now likely to be up close to 20% versus 2015.","Now I'll turn the call back over to Luke to update our view on the year.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Thanks, Scott. In the third quarter, we continued to deliver impressive year-over-year growth in our businesses. Growth in Lithium and Refining Solutions again led the way with the remaining businesses meeting our expectations coming into the quarter.","In the fourth quarter, we expect the Lithium business to continue its trend of strong year-over-year EBITDA growth. However, we're forecasting relatively flat year-over-year performance for Refining Solutions, Bromine Specialties and PCS.","As Scott already noted, our Fine Chemistry Services business had a strong fourth quarter in 2015 with over $17 million of adjusted EBITDA while we expect a breakeven fourth quarter for that business in 2016, which will impact our year-over-year comps. Still, in total, our view of 2016 continues to improve. We're adjusting our full-year 2016 forecast upward with net sales expected to range between $2.6 billion to $2.7 billion, adjusted EBITDA between $725 million and $745 million, and adjusted EPS between $3.45 per share and $3.55 per share.","We remain on track to complete the sale of the Chemetall Surface Treatment business to BASF before the end of 2016. All regulatory filings are complete and several more jurisdictions, including the European Union, have cleared the transaction. Once closed, we will begin implementation of a deleveraging plan that will allow us to achieve our targeted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.5 times in early 2017.","We're very pleased with our performance to-date in 2016. Our businesses have delivered impressive core EBITDA growth, and we have made much progress on our strategic objectives as well. While as expected, the fourth quarter of 2016 will be softer than our first three quarters, this does not mean a weakening in our outlook for 2017. We believe we have positioned the company for outstanding performance in 2017. Our budgeting process is well underway and we're very confident that our high-growth lithium business will drive another strong year of earnings growth for Albemarle.","Matthew K. Juneau - Albemarle Corp.","Before we get to Q&A, I want to call at your attention to our press release of November 4, announcing that we'll host an Investor Day in New York City on March 17, 2017. Additional details will be forthcoming, but we look forward to the opportunity to provide a detailed update on Albemarle and the strategy and priorities, both for the company and each of our global business units.","Operator, we're now ready to open the lines for Q&A; but before doing so, I would like to remind everyone to please limit questions to two per person to ensure that all participants have a chance to ask questions, then feel free to get back in the queue for follow-ups, if time allows. Please proceed.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Your first question comes from the line of Robert Koort, Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Good morning.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Hey.","Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Luke, I wonder if you can give us an update on CORFO or the environmental regulators down in Chile. How soon before you get all that buttoned up and what's the hold up at the present?","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. Well, let me divide it up and at a high level and then I'll let John give some more color if necessary. First of all, there're two separate issues down there. One, you remember was, and I don't want to miss it, one was the environmental permit that gave us the right to pump a certain amount of brine. We received that in the first quarter this year. There's no contest to that, so the environmental permits are not at issue at all down there. And we have sufficient brine to produce over 80,000 metric tons of lithium carbonate equivalent per year down there.","The CORFO agreement, there was CCHEN is going through that process, the nuclear agency, is in discussions down there. And I expect, at a high level, we're going to get that agreement done by the end of the year. I think they're just going through the administrative and regulatory process, which some time is somewhat bureaucratic to make sure that all the I's are dotted and T's are crossed, but I don't have any concern about that agreement getting finalized.","Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And then for my follow-up, you mentioned expanding capacity in your Chinese venture and then also maybe building another plant, a spodumene conversion plant. How much would all these efforts cost? And is there any chance you would combine forces with Jiangxi since they're also building a big spodumene conversion plant?","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. I think that all the numbers that we would have for capital are well within our plan, very consistent with what we've talked about during the course of the year on our capital. So, if you look at the Chinese capital, would probably be a good bit lower because a lot of that infrastructure is in place. So, we're just really adding it back in. If you look at a brand new site for spodumene converting 40,000 metric tons, you're probably north of $350 million. We hadn't done the engineering work for that yet. But as we stated, we're going to invest over the course of the next three to five years to ensure that we try to capture at least 50% of this growth and all of this is within financial modeling and we have more than sufficient cash flow throwing off these businesses that we can self-fund these, pay our dividends and service our debt with no problem at all.","Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you, Luke.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews, Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks, and good morning everyone. You saw a nice sequential price movement in lithium versus the first half. It seemed like from the comments that it was a mix of price and mix, but if I could just ask also on the technical grade product. Why is that price moving up? Is it moving up as much as the battery grade or what are the dynamics there?","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. John.","John Mitchell - Albemarle Corp.","Hi. This is John. The technical grade did not move as much as the battery-grade products, although we are seeing some pricing movement in technical grade. I do want to draw your attention to the fact that we started our tolling efforts in Q3 in 2015, and so we are seeing now good volume comps on the tolling volume out of Asia. And so, we're seeing kind of a shift of some of that value in the pricing area. So that's one reason you see a big uplift in price in Q3. I also just want to draw your attention to the fact that we have been getting pricing all along the way. And as we said on the last earnings call, I mean battery-grade pricing is in the range of up 20% year-on-year.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","So, just as a follow-up, how many more quarters do you think before you're sort of fully at the current run rate of battery-grade pricing? How much longer it will take to fully flow through?","John Mitchell - Albemarle Corp.","What we've told everyone is that from a modeling perspective, you should look at our business given the product mix that will see pricing continue to escalate year-on-year in a kind of mid single-digit range.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Begleiter, Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning. Luke, do you have an early read on 2017 EBITDA for both the Lithium business as well as your overall company?","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. I think we're in the middle of it. So, it's too early to talk about right now exactly. We're in the middle of our budgeting process. I think we're going to see growth. I think you'll continue to see good strong growth in Lithium from an EBITDA standpoint going forward. And I think we'll talk to you in January then. I wouldn't expect Refining Solutions to kind of have the same kind of EBITDA growth going into 2017 that you saw from 2015 to 2016. I think it'll moderate some.","And then, as always, I've talked about Bromine is going to be flat to up a little bit or down a little bit. And overall that's been the consistent message that we've been giving all year as we look forward to the longer term growth of these businesses. And I would expect that to hold in 2017, but not ready at this time to quantify what that type of growth might be.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And thank you. And just on the spodumene conversion plant, to be clear, you expect that plant to be online by year-end 2019 or 2020. Is that correct?","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","All right, so on the spodumene conversion plant, you're talking about a couple plants. The first one we talked about is the expansion of the facilities that we would be acquiring, and we would think we could bring that one online, John, by 2019, correct? And then, the following would be the greenfield site, which would be another 40,000 metric tons and what we've said is, probably by the beginning of the next decade. So, if you look at 2020 kind of time, that's about right. It might be a little bit early, it might be a year or two later. We're going to bring it online to meet the demand and not to just to have it there. We need to be sure that we can meet this demand, but we also don't want to be caught with a plant that's not operating. So, we'll be monitoring the markets and we'll continue to invest to meet our customers' needs as they make commitments to us.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Very good. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar, Citi. Please proceed.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Yes. Good morning. Your Lithium margins were 41%. That was up year-over-year. As you do more tolling in China, especially with your new acquisition there, where do you see lithium margins going, and can you talk about lithium extraction margins versus lithium conversion margins?","John Mitchell - Albemarle Corp.","Hi, P.J. This is John. As we've said before, we see our EBITDA margins for the Lithium business holding in the range that it's in right now for the foreseeable future. And there is a lot of puts and takes with regard to pricing impact but also as we're doing more exploration and we're bringing new capacity online and the cost of bringing that new capacity online. But what we've said on past earnings call and we reiterate on this one, we see the EBITDA margins continuing in the same range, going forward.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","And P.J., I didn't understand your second question about there was too many extraction in conversion technologies. Can you repeat that?","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Yeah. So, what are the margins in lithium extraction? For example, in Chile versus lithium conversion assets, what are their margins, let's say, in China?","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. I mean, P.J., we had broken that out and that's fairly competitive since there's competitive intelligence and we're not prepared to give that out in a public setting, right, while our competitors sitting here and listening to it. But I think this business will maintain excellent margins with the steps that we're taking from our resources to expanding those resources and to the relationships we're building with the winning customers out there. So, I expect we can maintain this type of margin for the foreseeable future.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. That's fair enough. And then you decided to go into Argentina to look at the new asset or the new resource. Can you talk a little bit about your Kings Mountain, North Carolina asset and what are you doing there?","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","John?","John Mitchell - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. Hi, P.J. First off, we have probably the most sophisticated resource team in the world. And they're looking at resources everywhere on every continent. And Kings Mountain is ranked with the rest of the resources that we continue to evaluate. And so, we do know that there's a hard rock ore body in Kings Mountain that contains lithium. We know that the quality of that lithium is very high. We like to say it's the second best resource, hard rock resource, in the world. And it is part of the mix that we look at in terms of developing resources going forward.","But we're not in a position to say when and if it will be developed. As Luke mentioned on his opening statements, the brine resource in Argentina is really exciting for us. We believe that it has the potential to be the largest resource in Argentina. And it gives us the ability to build a world scale plant and provide us a low-cost source of lithium that we could supply our customers in the world.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. If I might add, P.J., if you look at what we're trying to do in lithium, we've got resources identified that we've said it'll take us to about 160,000 met tons of production by the beginning of the next decade, so 2020, 2021. That will be the annual operating rate if we see those resources being able to provide. We need to be able to provide growth for this industry past 2020 and 2021.","So, we are taking steps today to look at resources around the world to ensure that we still have the resources to be able to bring to the market to meet this growing demand that we're going to see for lithium over the next 10 years, 15 years, 20 years. So, we are, I would say, the one company in the lithium space with a proven technical resources the current set of lithium-based resources, we have the financial strength to invest in the conversion capacity needed through 2021 as well as the technical skill and financial resources to bring on the next world scale resources that allow us to continue to meet that demand.","So at the end of the day, I love our position in this market and I love the strategy that John and his team have put together to meet the demand today and have a sustainable winning business well into the future.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Very clear. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of John Roberts, UBS. Please proceed.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you. How is the FCC catalyst price increase going? It's a little hard to tell from the numbers.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Silvio?","Silvio Ghyoot - Albemarle Corp.","Hi, John. This is Silvio. As we explained earlier, we are in the early days of that price increase. We have a couple of successes at different places in the world. So, we do believe and are committed to that price increase, but it will take two to three years before you see the full effect of that announced 10% increase.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Do you think a year from now we'll be seeing 2% to 3% average selling price year-over-year in your reported results?","Silvio Ghyoot - Albemarle Corp.","I think that's a fair assumption.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then in Fine Chemical Services, is a normal quarter near the average of breakeven for this quarter and $17 million for a year-ago EBITDA or how do we think about what normal is for that segment given its volatility?","Silvio Ghyoot - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. It's a very volatile business given the contracts. Since it's a custom-manufacturing business, it's got contracts that are coming in and out of the portfolio. I think it's fair to say that if I could put a normalized on it, it's probably in the single digits of millions of dollars is probably what's normal for that business.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Mike Harrison at Seaport Global Securities. Please proceed.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Hi.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Luke, can you hear me?","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Luke, can you talk a little bit about your expectations on the lithium royalties in Chile? I was just hoping that you could maybe give a sense of, should we just expect higher royalties to be about offset by lower cost at the new La Negra plant that's coming on-stream? I know you mentioned that you'd expect to keep margins about where they are, but it seems like there are a lot of puts and takes around the margins as we go forward.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. There are tremendous amount of puts and takes in the royalty and additional volume are two of the big ones that you'd mentioned. I think your assumption right now is a good one. Let me say that once the agreement is finalized and signed, and the agreement is finalized. But once we go through all that process and it's sign, we'll make it clear what the role of this structure is. I don't want to do that until such time as the agreement is signed by CORFO and signed by Albemarle, it's more than MOU. We'll make it clear for all you guys because I know you want to see that. I can tell you that it's commercially reasonable. We're excited about it, and we're looking forward to get that signed and get the information to you and continue to grow this business.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","All right. And then, was hoping also that you could comment on the Refining side. It seems like the FCC demand is suffering a little bit from higher refined product inventory levels. Can you talk a little bit about how you expect that to play out over the next quarter or two? And what is going on right now with your FCC utilization rates? Thank you.","Silvio Ghyoot - Albemarle Corp.","Mike, this is Silvio. Global picture structure, there is no difference. At current crude oil prices, we do see a strong demand for gasoline, but you know that we are sitting on larger inventories in the U.S. And to that extent, we have seen some lesser throughputs at the end of the third quarter, which is affecting a little bit our result. For the fourth quarter, we'd expect that refiners will continue to take some measures to address the high inventory and take the opportunity to do some maintenance. Structurally, going forward, I do not expect any major changes, and next year should be a comparable year to this year.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Jim Sheehan, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please proceed. You're live in the call.","James M. Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Good morning. Could you guys comment on your share buyback authorization and what the pace of buyback activity you might be considering for 2017?","Silvio Ghyoot - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. So, we announced yesterday afternoon that the board had approved an increase in the authorization really on the same program that we've been operating under since 2000, and that authorization takes us back up to 15 million shares. And frankly, that's just an anticipation that as we move forward that there will be opportunities for us to do some share repurchases.","At this point in time, we're still evaluating for 2017 the amount of investments required in the Lithium business in particular and the amount of cash required for that going forward before we make a formal commitment on the number of shares that we'll purchase. So, we'll continue to look at that and keep you updated as we proceed.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","This is Luke. You should not expect us to buy one huge slug of stock. Don't expect us to buy back $750 million worth of stock in one slug coming up in 2017. What we would do is, assess what we need for Lithium. In the end, we will enter into a programmatic thoughtful and methodical share buyback probe consistent with what we've done in the past.","James M. Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","That's great. And also regarding your ambitions in Argentina, there've been some issues with other producers there in past years around currency and political risk. Can you just tell us how you assess the political and currency risk situation in that country going forward?","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. It's ever moving. So, a piece of \u2013 somebody asked me about Kings Mountain and John talked about the resources that we look out around the world. There're also reserves in Bolivia. There're reserves in other places around the world, and we've got a methodology and a matrix that we're looking at. Country risk as well as currency fluctuations as well as costs as well as how long it's going to take us to develop, all that goes into play. And what we have to do is make some decisions and balance that risk against the opportunity and take a step that we believe is in the best interest of creating value for the company and for the shareholders. So, it's no easy answer. We're a long way from putting steel in the ground or even making the decision about putting steel in the ground in anywhere. But that is obviously one of the major considerations that we look to whenever we're going to make a capital decision such as this.","James M. Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Sison, KeyBanc. Please proceed.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hey, guys. Nice quarter there. Hey, Luke, when you think about Lithium, we had two years of really good, really strong double-digit EBITDA growth. Any impediments you see either on the demand side or the supply side that that type of growth want to be sustainable through the end of the decade?","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Not really. I mean, it's hard to sit here now and say what's going to happen. You could have a significant recession that could have an impact. You have a 2008, 2009 kind of, they can have a blip of an impact. But when I think about long-term and I look at the drivers for that market demand, when I look at the supply that we expect is going to come online when we look at the demand curve, there's going to be years and times where we're out of balance and a little bit oversupplied or a little bit undersupplied. But for the long-term, I expect to see good trend lines on the growth of that business.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Great. And then the Refinery Solutions, you've mentioned that you should have some growth next year. Would you expect it in both areas in HPC, FCC, this year was a little bit different for FCC and HPC. So, just maybe walk us through the dynamics for that business heading into 2017?","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. I think it's all going to be driven by transportation fuels and the demand for the gasoline and where that ends up. So, we've got great technology that whenever they got high margins or low margins in the FCC area, we help improve yields. So, we help the refiners to make more money. So, if we can do that and continue to do that, where they need that technology will be successful. And the ones the new refineries that you see coming online over the period of time, they're taking a more complex crude slate and they're looking to upgrade to make as much profit as we can. So, I feel good about FCC for the long term.","HPC, it all comes down to regulations, what those salt prospects are. You've got some good moves on bunker fuels and some other regulations that'll cause the use of more hydrotreating catalysts. So, longer term that business will have good, steady business. And it'll all come down to what the mix is of that business and what the mix that catalyst uses, and that will be more impacted by what their margins are. But overall, it's hard to break it down by what's going to happen next year in both of those businesses. But as we look at our plan and roll it up, we'll see what the turnarounds are going to be, et cetera.","But long term, Mike, this is a good business. This business is one that's got great technology. As long as those specs in gasoline and transportation fuels demand continue, we'll be in good shape with the technology we have in both of these sectors.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander, Jefferies. Please proceed.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC","Good morning. Just one question on Lithium; as you've been having pricing discussions with your customers, has there been any change in the quality of the discussions or the agreements in terms of are they interested in either jointly funding capacity expansions or giving you firmer agreements on volumes or any other improvements showing up in the contract terms?","John Mitchell - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. Hi. This is John. The relationships that we have with the customers, many of these customers go back decades. We are really focused on ensuring that we grow together and that we have a reliable supply for them. And so certainly, the quality of the conversations has gotten to a much more strategic level where customers are willing to enter into multiyear agreements. Currently, we have more than 60% of our lithium salts business under long-term agreement. And we think by the end of the year, we'll be in the 75%, 80% range, which is kind of our target range going forward.","And we want to make sure that we continue to invest with customers that are committed to us and we're committed to them. And so that's part of our whole investment strategy as well as our commercial approach with the customers. And so, given the strong relationships that we have with them, the quality of the conversations have been excellent and I think it feeds into a long-term growth story for Albemarle.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC","And to follow, I guess it's clearly early days, but do you think there's a line of sight to that location being as low cost or even lower than your current low cost capacity?","John Mitchell - Albemarle Corp.","Certainly, costs being low cost is critical for us. We're focused on maintaining that leadership position in terms of low cost supply. And there's always a combination, not just geography but the quality of the resource, the way that we apply extraction and conversion technology, and the way we deliver the product in the right form to the customers. So there is a lot of complexity that goes into being low cost provider for our customer and the high value adder for a customer. But we're focused on low cost and we're focused on making sure that we're translating as much value to the customer as possible.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tyler Frank, Robert Baird. Please proceed.","Tyler Charles Frank - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Private Wealth Management)","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. A quick follow-up to the last question. How does going into the longer term contracts for Lithium impact your ability to dictate price?","And then as a follow-up, for the overall lithium market, how have things changed since your Lithium Day almost two years ago in terms of overall demand expectations? I think at that point, you were expecting the market to grow about 20,000 metric tons per year with the goal of capturing half that demand. Has that increased at all? And more players are bringing on additional capacity, so any commentary you can provide will be greatly appreciated. Thank you.","John Mitchell - Albemarle Corp.","Sure. This is John. Let me answer your question regarding the demand capacity first. Our demand model, it still remains the same as what we communicated at the last Lithium Day. So, just simply put, we think that the overall market is growing at about 20,000 metric tons per year through the 2020 time period. The total market is about 185,000, 190,000 metric tons. So, we've seen that demand forecast play out. We are updating that demand forecast, and we'll communicate that at the Investor Day in the first quarter.","With regard to long-term agreements and how did that impact our ability to price product, of course, we are having those critical conversations with customers where we do need the flexibility to adjust price, but we want to treat customers fairly. So, there are provisions in our agreements that allow us to adjust price as appropriate and also gives the customer an opportunity to look at the market if they so choose to do that. But I think the important thing is that we're committing these long-term agreements, allow the customers to invest in the energy storage market because they know that they have a partnership with a company like Albemarle that has the ability to invest to supply them.","And I think as Luke outlined in the opening comments, when we said during the Lithium Day that the overall market's growing at 20,000 metric tons per year and we're going to invest to supply half of that, I think you've seen through the tolling, through the acquisition of the China conversion technology, the expansion of our mine in Australia, what we're doing in Chile, how we're expanding the capacity in Chile, that we have invested and will continue to invest to be able to supply at least 10,000 metric tons per year. We've done it this year. We'll do it next year. And I think we've given you guys the path to see that we can deliver on our promises.","And that is going a long way with the customers. I mean, as I said, we have very long and deep relationships with these customers. They appreciate it. They appreciate being with a market leader like Albemarle, and we're going to treat each other fairly going forward.","Tyler Charles Frank - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Private Wealth Management)","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Chris Kapsch, Aegis Capital Corp. Please proceed.","Christopher J. Kapsch - Aegis Capital Corp.","Yeah. So, some of the commentary about your contracts with Lithium customers got up my question, but it really has to do with strategy. And, Luke, you emphasized the strategy of being establishing a sustainable winning business really into the foreseeable future. And I think if you look back couple of years even some skeptical investors, then would acknowledge that this has been working. And then, the most recent portfolio changes where you've become even a more concentrated play on lithium.","The question is, as you've done that, there are some seasoned investors who are taking a step back looking a little bit more skeptically saying, hey, this has the looking for setting up to be one of this classic boom-bust cycle in lithium. And I don't really hear a lot of that. I mean, a lot of the discussion is about trying to keep up with demand into the foreseeable future.","So, I'm just wondering if you could just share with us how you think about that risk, that cyclical risk over time, and if there's anything that can be done in your strategic approach with your customers to mitigate that risk looking forward? Thank you.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. So, obviously, that's a lot of discussion that we have with the investors. We go out and meet with them as well as the board of directors, and what our concentration is and how do we maintain that growth and profitability going forward. If you look at what we're trying to do, it's a couple pronged approach. One, we want to be \u2013 have access to the best resources in the world. That allows us to drive our costs down. So if you get to a boom-bust, we're still going to be the winners in this industry because little cost always wins, right?","Secondly what we're doing is, we're working very hard to have the capability to expand to meet that market demand but do it in a phased approach, so that we can continuously monitor the supply-demand situation to understand when we bring on what portions of a capacity expansion that we bring on.","And third and importantly, we're entering into long-term agreements with our major customers that give us line of sight into their demand forecast going forward, and so that we want to make sure we have their views on what their demand is so we can meet that demand in a timely fashion. And they are very interested ensuring they have accurate and quality production to meet that demand. So, there's a lot of great conversations.","So, if you got the resource side, you got the technology side, you got the financial wherewithal to bring that online in a way in increments that makes sense for that market demand and you're in strategic relationships with the customers who are going to be winners in this industry going forward, that's the way you protect yourself and really drive shareholder value in a market such as this. Go ahead, John.","John Mitchell - Albemarle Corp.","So, just one comment to add with regard to the boom-bust comment. Our view on supply-demand is that it will remain in balance through 2020. Beyond 2020, none of us have a crystal ball in terms of exactly what the inflection points will look like, in terms of the EV adoption and who will actually figure out how to build capacity the right way.","But one thing, I think we have a high degree of confidence on anyone that has built any kind of large scale chemical plant understands this, it's one thing to announce a project. It's another thing to actually build it, commercialize it, qualify it, et cetera. And if you just look at what it takes to bring on capacity, we have hundreds of engineers and scientists working as fast as they can on our projects. But if you look at the marketplace and what it takes to bring on this capacity, I think you'll find some comfort in our prediction that the market will stay in balance through 2020.","Christopher J. Kapsch - Aegis Capital Corp.","And that's helpful color. Thank you much. And then, if I had one follow-up, it was actually more focused on the Bromine business. I think you guys are still in Bromine. Last quarter, you talked about some signs of the electronics end market was improving for brominated flame retardants. Could you just provide color on how that played out in the third quarter? And then any nuances to the specific connectors versus enclosures versus printed wiring boards will be helpful. Thank you.","Raphael Crawford - Albemarle Corp.","Chris, this is Raphael. And yes, we are still here. So, I'm happy to answer your question on electronics. So, the outlook still on a year-over-year basis still looks weak, but it's improving versus the weakness that was projected previously. So, year-on-year, in the third quarter, PCs were down, TVs were down slightly, but they're not down quite as much as what we thought they would be. The bright spots that we do continue to see is servers, that's up about 2% year-over-year. And I think the growth opportunity is likely to be in automotive. So, wire, cable applications or circuit boards within automotive. On a full-year basis, year-over-year, it's been relatively flat for us at Albemarle, but we certainly see that there are some bright spots that could counteract some of the downsides in PCs and in TVs.","Christopher J. Kapsch - Aegis Capital Corp.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn, Longbow Research. Please proceed.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Good morning. Thanks for taking my call. I actually would like to continue the Bromine question. So, you talked about in your prepared remarks that there was some weakness in the market and your drilling fluids in the Gulf of Mexico were down. Electronics doesn't sound like it was particularly strong, and yet you put up a positive growth number even excluding FX of 1%. So, are these all share gains of the drilling fluids in the Middle East? Are there businesses that may perhaps small or you didn't mention upfront that that are driving the growth here? What's offsetting the sort of the weakish environment that we've seen in Bromine overall?","Raphael Crawford - Albemarle Corp.","Dmitry, as Luke had mentioned, I think, third quarter was about what we expected it to be. We do see weakness in completion fluids in the second half of the year. First half of the year was stronger than what we thought, and second half is about what we thought it would be. So, it's weaker in Gulf of Mexico and in the EU. We're essentially holding our own in the Middle East.","Our position there as well as in the other core markets is to maintain the earnings quality of this business and as well as to hold on to our position in markets like completion fluids where we know it's going to be down because of oil prices and lower exploration investment, but we've held on to our position as best as we can because we know when that market recovers, you want to be in strong with those customers and participate in the growth going forward.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. Hi, Dmitry. This is Luke. I think, overall, there had been a whole lot of market share gains. I think that's relatively been where it has been for the last two years at a high level. I think one of the areas where we focused on whenever Raphael was looking at his business and we were really refining on strategy on how we're going to have businesses. We had to look at costs. So, if you look at costs across our portfolio and Bromine has done a good job in getting yield enhancement, yield improvement, just good old chemical engineering technology to get a better result for the same amount of dollars or lesser dollars. So, they've done a good job at cost.","And looking at opportunities, remember, we have the fluctuation to move production in some respects between Jordan and Magnolia, and that cab have an influence on our bottom line. So, they've done a good job managing that, if I look at overall for the full year. So, I don't want you to leave here with some view that there's been a big shift in markets and that's what's happened, because I don't think that's the case.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","But, I didn't have the view, I was just trying to understand pricing down and a lot of the businesses that you mentioned being weaker. Where did you get the volume growth, but we can follow up offline.","I guess, as a my follow-up question, I'd like to ask about the catalyst business and the guidance you provided for the second half of the year. You talked about second half being weaker relative to first half and perhaps versus a year ago, but then you delivered a pretty strong third quarter. So, does that mean we're going to have a really bad fourth quarter comp in Refining Solutions?","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","If you look at the comp in the fourth quarter for Refining, it's probably going to be the weakest quarter we have. It's probably going to be a little closer to the first quarter than it is to the second and third. Had strong second and had strong third quarters, we'll have a weaker fourth quarter. And I would say it's probably in the range of the first that's how you all look at it.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. Okay. I just want to make sure I was hearing the right things. Okay. That's all the questions I have. Thank you.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Thanks, Dmitry.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Rosemarie Morbelli, Gabelli & Company. Please proceed.","Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Just speaking with Bromine for a second, could you talk about your progress regarding the new flame retardant for construction installation?","Raphael Crawford - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. Sure, Rosemarie. This is Raphael. So that product for us is called GreenCrest. That's a polymeric flame retardant, and we have seen year-over-year growth both in volume as well as in pricing as the market moves away from HBCD. So, for us, the fundamentals are there both in terms of regulations as well as our own supply position to continue to participate in that market as demand grows.","Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company","So, when you talk about lower pricing and volume in Bromine overall, what came down substantially if the GreenCrest saw some price increases?","Raphael Crawford - Albemarle Corp.","Well, to put it in context, Rosemarie, GreenCrest is still a relatively small piece of our overall portfolio in Bromine. So, while that has been a bright spot, there's been a few things that have pushed pricing down in the third quarter, which are largely not tied to direct Bromine sales that being potassium hydroxide, which is a byproduct of our Bromine production in Jordan as well as the amines business, which is also a non-Bromine piece of our Bromine portfolio.","Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company","That is very helpful. Thank you. And I was wondering, I didn't see any price for your acquisition of Jiangxi's assets. So, if you could give us a feel for that, I don't know if it is public or out. And then the $3.2 billion of gross profit from the sale of Chemetall, what kind of a net profit are you expecting, fees and tax bleeds?","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. So, if you look at the transaction in China, what I would say is, we will provide that data once the deal closes. But for a number of competitive reasons, I don't want to give that number out right yet. Let us get it closed and then you'll see what that number is and understand what a great value we believe we receive.","With regard to the Chemetall transaction, we expect that to close by yearend. And the leakage on that because of the way that we structured the deal, Scott, is kind in that 10-ish percent range, is that fair?","Scott A. Tozier - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. That's correct. Yeah.","Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference.

Finally, reconciliations related to any non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call maybe found in our press release or earnings presentation, which are posted on our website.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Luke.","Luther Kissam","Thanks Lorin and good morning everyone. We appreciate the opportunity to share our third quarter results with you today. I'll begin by commenting on the Company's quarterly results and then Scott will review select highlights related to business segment performance and financial results. As usual, at the end of our prepared remarks, we'll open it up for your questions. While we are going to limit your questions to two per person at one time, so everyone has a chance, then feel free to get back in the queue for follow-ups if time allows.","Given the challenging economic environment we faced in the quarter I\u2019m pleased with our results and encouraged by the earnings power the company continues to demonstrate. Although, our income was significantly impacted by macroeconomic and metal trends and the year-over-year drop in the rare earth price index. Our overall profitability is proving resilient and cash generation was excellent.","Third quarter net sales was $661 million and net income was $99 million, $1.10 per share. Segment income was a $146 million and segment margins remained strong at 22%. While all of those metrics were down year-over-year, they were achieved against a much tougher economic environment. If you look at each GDU\u2019s performance in the third quarter Polymer Solutions which was our business\u2019 most negatively impacted by the global economic slowdown reported net sales of $217 million, segment income of $44 million and segment margins of 20%, much stronger performance in polymers than was the case the last time we faced similar economic conditions back in the 2009 time frame.","Catalysts had net sales of $251 million, segment income of $61 million and segment margins of 24%. As we explained in the second quarter call, second half year-over-year comparisons will be tough in 2012. Given the precipitous decline in rare earth index pricing and the impact of that decline on our results, but we are also down sequentially in year-over-year in Performance Catalyst Solutions due primarily to some customers reducing their inventories during the quarter and others having scheduled turnarounds. We expect that to be a one quarter issue. ","Fine Chemistry continued to deliver high growth and excellent profitability this quarter with net sales of $193 million, segment income of $42 million and segment margins of 22%. Income was up 39% year-over-year and margins were up 487 basis points year-over-year. The business got a late quarter boost from strong clear bromine fluid volumes in September due to some increased drilling activity in the Gulf of Mexico.","There are a couple of factors impacting our results that are worth noting. First of all as it relates to polymers, throughout the quarter there was a continuation of the broad based deterioration of electronics end markets and that will signal throughout the supply chain indicating a weaker second half. In addition, construction activity overall and in particular in Europe fell off substantially impacting our mineral flame retardant business and HBCD volumes and pricing.","We indicated in our second quarter earnings call that the second half outlook of Polymer Solutions had weakened considerably since the first quarter when we thought that the prospects for a second half recovery looked more promising and it begun to build the inventory in anticipation of that recovery. The outlook has continued to get worse if you look at the indicators that we typically discussed. The IPC book-to-bill ratio is a U.S. only ratio but it is nevertheless a decent proxy for our printed wiring board business.","At the time of our first quarter call, the March reading of this indicator registered 1.05 and it trended up for four straight months. The July reading was 1.0 and was the fourth straight month of decline. The most recent reading ticked up to 1.02, but the trend since March of this year has clearly been downward sloping. The most recent Gartner data on year-over-year global PC shipments indicated a decline during the third quarter of over 8% while the most recent data from iSuppli calls for a 5% decline in global TV shipments for 2012 with the trends most sluggish in developed markets where we tend to see reasonable fire safety standards all set by growth in developing markets which tend not to have a stringent of fire safety standards.","The Bishop Report is a global indicator that historically has also proven to have a good correlation with the volumes of our Connectors business. Back in April, this report showed a reading of 65.4 and four straight months of increases, by contrast the August reading was 39.3, the lowest it has been since the middle of 2009 and in continuing what is now a 6-month downward sloping trend. For comparison, in 2010 the reading dipped below the mid 80s only once. In construction, Dow\u2019s macroeconomic heat index released with their second quarter earnings reflected a downward outlook for construction within Western Europe from yellow to red to reflect globe slowing or negative demand growth, which proved an accurate leading indicator for the trends we ultimately saw during the quarter. This trend had a negative impact on mineral flame retardants as well as on HDCD, one of our brominated flame retardants.","Notably, the impact of recalibrating our inventory levels to be more in line with market realities was a $16 million hit to Polymer Solutions during the quarter due to less favorable cost absorption and it is expected to have an impact on the order of 30 to 35 million on this GBU[ph] for the second half of the year. For historical comparison purposes it is noteworthy that volumes for some of our more profitable flame retardant products have fallen to levels approaching those seen in the first half of 2009. As some of you will recall, that\u2019s when Polymer Solutions basically broke even, generating just $3 million in segment income during the six month period in June 2009. By contrast, polymers generated $44 million in segment income this quarter. Therefore, while we are positioning this business for a prolonged period of economic slowdown. It\u2019s earning power is much greater than any point in its history due to the actions that we\u2019ve taken since 2009. As a result, when the economy picks up, the contribution we get from each additional pound of product in this GBU would drive exceptional profitability.","In catalysts, the rare earth impact mess an otherwise good quarter. From a revenue perspective this rare earth price decline impacted the quarter by roughly $40 million year-over-year and is projected impact of fourth quarter by about $45 million year-over-year at current index price levels. In terms of the year-over-year decline in catalysts profitability, the majority of the $40 million year-over-year delta was attributable to FCC and this dynamic about around rare earth surcharges. While FCC volumes were up double digits year-over-year rare earth surcharges dropped dramatically year-over-year from an average of $115 a kilogram to an average of $24 a kilogram. The profit impact obtained from a combination of our cost of inventory that was being sold in the third quarter of 2011 being lower relative to the rare earth index used for calculating our price to our customers. Our own inventory management decisions and the timing of the customer contract surcharges. The reverse was true this quarter when our inventory on hand cost more than the rare earth index due to the indexes precipitous drop at the beginning of 2012.","Over the full cycle of the rare earth pricing bubble, we would expect this profit impact to net to zero, but the second half of 2012 will show the largest year-over-year negative impacts. It is simply a matter of timing and has no material impact on the overall strength of our business. In fact FCC volumes were up significantly year-over-year and base pricing remained strong.","Earlier this year, we share with you that we had begun studying available options aimed at reducing earnings volatility related to our pension expenses and reducing the risk of the company being required to make further large cash contributions to our pension plan in future years. We recently took an important step toward our goal by announcing the plan to migrate U.S. non-union participants in our defined benefit plan to a defined contribution plan. Specifically, our current defined benefit plan will be totally frozen by December 31, 2014 after which no additional growth in years of service or final average pay will be recognized. This action is in the best interest of moving the company towards a more sustainable strategy of managing our pension obligations. In connection with this change we are also evaluating the investment strategies and accounting methods that would allow us to increase earnings transparency and reduce the volatility of future cash contributions. We would expect to complete this evaluation before year end.","With regard to our major capital projects, the first two phases of our Bromine expansion in Jordan are currently on track to commence production in the first half of 2013, doubling JBC\u2019s elemental bromine completion fluids and HBr production capacity. With our current clear brown assets running at very high utilization rates and a strong outlook for that business. We need that additional capacity to better serve our customers and capture our fair share of this growing market. The outlook for HBr an elemental bromine is also encouraging driven by growth in agricultural, pharmaceutical, and bromobutyryl applications.","As I previously stated, we\u2019ll bring volumes to the market as needed to meet demand. We will not need 100% of the incremental capacity on day 1, but the expansion allows us to drive incremental opportunities in the short term and meaningful opportunities in the immediate term as stable trends in these markets drive growth, they would otherwise exceed our current capacity.","Upon commercial completion in the coming months what is already the world\u2019s low cost bromine sourcing platform will be readily able to satisfy current demand and future opportunities as global economies eventually improve and the growth in new applications for bromine continues. The three performance catalyst solutions related expansion we\u2019ve commenced. The Greenfield sites for our TEA joint venture in Saudi Arabia, the Catalyst Center in Korea, an additional specialty capacity in the U.S. all remain on track with Saudi project to come online by year-end, Korea during the first quarter of 2013 and the domestic capacity staged between this quarter through mid 2013. We also recently announced plans to expand the new Korean facility with capacities that will be dedicated to producing our pure growth line of high purity organometallics which are used in the process of manufacturing chips for semiconductors and LEDs. These expansions would allow us to maintain our leading global position in TEA, organometallics and Single Site Catalyst as well as advance our competitive positioning within electronic materials. Upon completion, we will be able to provide a reliable local supply for these critical products in areas of the world which are expected to enjoy this sustained growth and demand for these products over the next decade.","Finally, in terms of new investments, throughout the year Fine Chemistry Services has reported robust results, with profitability tripling year-to-date. The transformation of this business reflects the impact of evolving our Customer Services portfolio towards a diverse pipeline of opportunities across the agricultural, lubricant, electronics materials, renewable chemistry and specialty pharmaceutical sectors that we\u2019ve targeted for growth. As the current rate of growth is projected to outstrip our existing capacity. We recently announced plans to double capacity of our Tyrone, Pennsylvania facility. We are excited about this project, which require capital outlay of approximately $30 million. The growing impact of our custom business has been a key factor behind foreign chemistry delivering 20 plus segment margins in 2012. This investment will expand our base of highly flexible assets to support continued growth from a robust pipeline.","In terms of our outlook for the balance of the year, we currently expect the fourth quarter to be weaker than third quarter results. Although Catalysts should be strong, the sequential growth there is expected to be offset by weaker Polymer Solutions and Fine Chemistry results. Specifically within Refinery Catalysts, FCC volume should remain healthy that face ongoing metals surcharge headwinds, and FCC is poised to finish very strong. The PCS order book and customer checks suggest that operating rates should rebound from the fourth quarter, given fewer customer turnarounds.","While Fine Chemistry should benefit from continued strength in clear brine volumes, we will likely see softer customer service projects due to campaign timing associated with a few large contracts that has simply run their course for 2012, asset retooling and a sequentially higher negative volume variances across the portfolio.","We are seeing nothing in the economic indicators or our order book that would lead us to believe that we will see marked improvement in the market served by our Polymer Solutions business in the fourth quarter. There has been no meaningful change in the competitive or structural dynamics of our markets. As these macro headwinds stabilize and ultimately improve, so should polymers financial results.","Meanwhile, we expect the fourth quarter to be tougher than the third for polymers, with the next demand signpost expected to occur Chinese New Year, when customer order patterns and discussions will give us a more confident view on how 2013 is likely to shape up.","We are in the middle of our planning process and look forward to sharing our 2013 earnings outlook during our fourth quarter call in January. However, we remain optimistic in 2013, we will see a resumption of growth, with the structural drivers for Catalysts and Fine Chemistry more clear today than is the case with Polymer Solutions. In any case, we look forward to sharing more thoughts about 2013 with you in January.","With that, I will turn the call over to Scott, who will shed further light on our segment performance and touch on our few financial highlights.","Scott Tozier","Thanks, Luke. I will start with the details on each segment and then close with the financial highlights. Let\u2019s begin with Catalysts, where sales were down 16% and segment income fell $41 million year-over-year to $61 million. As the financial results of an otherwise fine fundamental refinery catalyst quarter were largely obscured by the dynamics around metals surcharges as described by Luke earlier and a weak quarter for Organometallics business.","The bulk of the decline in revenue and profitability during the quarter was attributable to FCC where revenue was down 17% and operating income fell over 40%. However, volumetrically, FCC is doing great, up 17% year-over-year and 23% sequentially, as customers were using more fresh catalysts and optimizing their output, now that rare Earth prices have stabilized.","The core fundamentals are excellent as the direction of the crudes plate continues to move toward more complex feeds, which is really our sweet spot within this business. HPC volumes improved 50% sequentially as expected and profit improved in line. Year-over-year, HPC volumes were slightly down with an unfavorable customer mix.","We also saw a reduction in metals surcharges in HPC of about $5 million, as the cost of certain metals like Molly, nickel and cobalt came down. However, this had only a minimal impact on profits.","A quarter of the overall drop in Catalysts profitability was due to Performance Catalyst Solutions, which reported weak results with revenue and operating profits down double digits due to extended customer shutdowns and customer inventory management. We also had some larger orders in 2011 that were one-time in nature. ","Finally, we also have started to see costs associated with the Saudi joint venture in the equity income line, which is nearing completion, but will not produce any revenue until production commences in 2013. Customer operating rates in PCS have resumed to more normal levels in the early weeks of this quarter. As a result, we expect PCS to finish the year stronger and expect catalysts overall to close the year strong and well-prepared for growth into 2013.","Polymer Solutions faced tough macro trends and delivered revenue 11% lower than 2011 and segment income that was 20% lower. Brominated Flame Retardant sales were down 13% during the quarter year-over-year on 7% lower volumes. These declines and unfavorable fixed cost absorption impacts resulted in a 22% year-over-year operating profit decline for polymers overall. On both the year-over-year and sequential basis, broad weakness was evident across each major electronic end markets as connectors, and closures, and printed wiring board all reported double-digit volume declines.","HBCD, our Flame Retardant in the construction segment was also down over 30% due to a slowdown in the pace of European construction orders. Mineral flame retardant sales fell 9% year-over-year and profits were down 20% due to lower pricing and an especially challenging construction and automotive environment in Europe. We believe that this trend has started to stabilize, but are watching the construction market closely.","We are track to exit our Phosphorous business by year end. 4 percentage points of polymers\u2019 third quarter revenue decline was due to shipments winding down in this business. On the other hand, we had segment income benefit in the quarter versus last year. We expect to see the full benefit of our exit strategy starting in early 2013.","Finally, Stabilizers and Curatives revenue was up 3% year-over-year and profits were down 15% year-over-year on 6% higher volumes. Anti-oxidant volume growth was offset by price weakness within anti-oxidants in China in particular and generally sluggish infrastructure demand trends.","We also faced some fixed cost absorption headwinds as we reduced inventory in this business. Overall, we expect polymer solutions to slog through another tough period in the fourth quarter, with profitability lower than the third quarter, as volumes come down further and we manage our factories to reduce inventory.","Fine Chemistry continue where it has been a tremendous year, with third quarter sales up 8% and segment income up 39%. Fine Chemistry services results continue to be strong year-over-year, with sales up 18% and operating profits nearly doubling. These exceptional results within this division continue to be driven by outstanding custom service performance, as this business reported its second highest quarterly profit levels ever, up three times the levels of year ago, attributable to the growth of new and existing contracts in each of our focus areas for growth, especially pharmaceuticals, lubricants and ag intermediates.","You may recall that a year ago around this time, we began an expansion of NBPT capacity for use in fertilizer stabilizers. We are benefiting from the incremental earnings related to that investment this quarter. As a result of plans for our customer to expand distribution of this product globally in a more aggressive manner, we recently received approval to double NBPT capacity again, with an anticipated startup of the new assets in the second half of 2013. This business also benefited from shipments to SIGA during the quarter, which will not repeat in the fourth quarter, and finally, we showed nice growth from our Amherst contract in Q3 that will start to wind down in Q4.","Performance Chemicals saw sales up 2% and operating profits up 3% on high single digit year-over-year volume growth. These results were driven in part by record clear brine profits, driven by broad-based demand in the Middle East and Southeast Asian geographies, and the pickup late in September in Gulf of Mexico well completions.","Growth was also driven by our portfolio of specialty Bromide Derivatives where sales were up 3% and profits were up 9% to a new record, driven in part by continued traction within food safety, which saw increased installations of our various antimicrobial products into the meat and poultry markets.","Our water treatment and industrial solvents businesses also performed well. Overall, although we are optimistic about the prospects for Fine Chemistry growth in 2013, the fourth quarter will be weaker as Luke stated earlier due to the timing of certain custom services contracts and higher fixed cost absorption related to lower bromine utilization rates, more than offsetting further growth in performance chemicals and clear brine fluids.","Turning to total company financial results. The pressure on our results was evidenced in EBITDA, excluding special items, which declined 12% year-over-year to $165 million and in profitability as measured by EBITDA margins, which fell 108 basis points to 25%. However, stepping back and looking at our results historically, it\u2019s worth noting that comparatively speaking, during the last period that we saw similar operating conditions. Pick any quarter of 2009, EBITDA margins were in the mid to high teens, a stark contrast to current levels.","So, overall while the returns our businesses generated against the current macro backdrop can be further improved, they provide evidence that the company\u2019s earnings power is considerably higher than it has ever been before.","Let me elaborate on the two special items we reported this quarter. One relates to a $4.1 million after-tax charge or $0.05 per share associated with our supplemental executive retirement or SERP plan, in connection with the retirement of our former CEO and Chairman.","This charge arose as a result of recent lump sum payouts triggering accelerated recognition of certain expenses under our SERP plan. The other special item relates to a $4.5 million or $0.05 per share in one-time tax net benefits, principally related to the release of various liabilities for uncertain tax positions. The two special items largely offset one another resulting in no net income per share impact.","Now, to highlight a few other P&L items. R&D expenses up 3% year-over-year \u2013 year-to-date, reflecting our investment in organic growth opportunities, including the strategic adjacency initiatives we have outlined as part of vision 2015. As a percent of revenue, R&D costs are running at about 3.0% versus 2.7% last year.","Year-to-date, SG&A expense is down 8% on a year-over-year basis, principally driven by a combination of lower personnel-related cost and performance-based incentives. Specifically, in the third quarter, we adjusted our accruals for performance-based incentives to reflect our lower outlook, benefitting the P&L by about $8 million. We also saw the benefit of our cost reduction efforts in the range of $2 million to $3 million in SG&A. These costs are down slightly to 10.4% year-to-date.","Pension expense has risen approximately $15 million year-to-date, including the special charge of $6.5 million pretax that we took this quarter for the SERP curtailment. The rest of the rise is due to a decline in the discount rate used to measure our pension obligations and lower-than-forecasted asset performance in 2011. We continue to expect pension expenses to rise roughly $20 million on an annualized basis this year, as we have noted throughout the year. However, our funded status remains quite strong nearly 100%, and we do not expect to make any meaningful cash contributions to our plans until 2014 at the earliest.","Our reported effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.6%, including the benefit from the special item. Excluding special items and one-time tax discreet, the tax rate was 25.9%, up 80 basis points compared with the year-ago rate of 25.1%, driven primarily by the balance of profitability in  higher tax countries versus lower tax. At this time, we continue to expect our full-year rate, excluding specials to be around 25.8%, no change from last quarter.","Finally, from a foreign exchange standpoint, we estimate that year-to-date, the strengthening of the dollar primarily against the euro has resulted in approximately $32 million lower sales and $10 million lower operating profits. Of this, the impact in the third quarter alone was lower sales of $16 million and lower profit of $5 million or about $0.04 per share.","If you persist near the current levels through the end of 2012, we estimate that the full-year impact will be on the order of approximately $45 million and $50 million respectively on sales and profits. Although EBITDA excluding special items declined during the quarter. Cash generation doubled sequentially to $122 million from $61 million due to a substantially lower working capital drag on cash. Specifically, working capital shifted from a use of $89 million last quarter to a drag of only $3 million this quarter, an $86 million delta. ","Through year-end, we will remain focused on reducing working capital, which rose 160 basis points as a percentage of sales to 22.9% sequentially. Polymer Solution, which reduced inventory days by 10 days sequentially, was the only business to see a decline in inventory days. Besides further declines of polymers, we also expect declines in catalyst, in particular, where we built sufficient inventory to meet what\u2019s expected to be a robust fourth quarter demand in HPC and ahead of scheduled maintenance shutdown in our HPC plants. ","Free cash flow, defined as cash flow from operations, adding back pension and post-retirement contributions and subtracting capital expenditures, was $107 million through the first 9 months, excluding special items, down $109 million year-over-year due mostly to higher CapEx. Specifically, cash from operations to date of $306 million is up $21 million year-over-year or 7%, while CapEx to date of $218 is up $92 million year-over-year, reflecting continued investment in the major strategic projects we have commenced in South Korea, Saudi Arabia, Jordon, and here in the US. With the delayed third phase of the Jordanian expansion, which we announced last quarter, we still expect CapEx to be at approximately $275 million to $300 million for 2012, with roughly $75 million attributable to the JBC expansion. ","Overall our balance sheet remains in excellent shape with net debt of $293 million, excluding $18 million in non-guaranteed debt from our JBC joint venture. This is up $20 million quarter-to-quarter, mainly due to higher CapEx and share repurchases. Net debt-to-EBITDA ended the period at 0.4 times and net debt-to-cap was 14%. We reduced long term debt by $41 million this quarter, primarily due to our restructuring of high cost debt in Asia.","We made $18 million in dividend payments during the quarter, up 21% year-over-year, and year-to-date we completed $40 million in share repurchases. Our strong cash flow and low leverage continued to give us options and tremendous flexibility as we work toward vision 2015. ","As an update at this time, we maintain the board authority to repurchase up to an additional 4.3 million shares left of a $5 million authorized under our existing share repurchase program. We would prefer to use our capital to support organic growth or acquisitions, we will continue to consider opportunities to repurchase our shares at times when valuations are attractive. ","With that, I will turn the call back over to Lorin for Q&A.","Lorin Crenshaw","Operator, at this time we are ready to open the floor for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar of Citigroup. Please proceed.","John Hertz \u2013 Citigroup","Yes, good morning. This is John Hertz [ph] on for P.J. this morning.","Luke Kissam","Hi John.","Scott Tozier","Hi John.","John Hertz \u2013 Citigroup","Regarding your comments that overall 4Q should be a little bit worse than 3Q, which it sounds like it\u2019s primarily a function of Polymer Solutions. Is it reasonable to think that Polymer Solutions\u2019 profit could be down on a year-over-year basis in 4Q?","Luke Kissam","I think if you look at it on a year-over-year basis that\u2019s kind of the range that you are looking at.","John Hertz \u2013 Citigroup","Okay. As an extension of that, do you think a sequential pickup in catalyst could offset that quarter-over-quarter decline in Polymers?","Luke Kissam","I think you will see nice pickup sequentially in catalyst but I also think we are going to have is we have tried to reiterate on the call, you are going to see some weakness in Fine Chemistry relative to some significant contracts that we won\u2019t be running in the fourth quarter, we won\u2019t have the benefit of and some cost absorptions. So, if you look at it, I don\u2019t think that the increase in catalyst will be enough to overcome the weakness in Polymers and Fine in the fourth quarter.","John Hertz \u2013 Citigroup","Okay. Can you talk about where exactly your Bromine operating rates are today and what are your expectations are for the rest of the year? As an extension of that, do you need to lower your operating rates even more to kind of keep inventories under control?","Luke Kissam","Yes. If you look at our Bromine operating rates and it\u2019s difficult to do, but if you look at our overall Bromine operating rates, they were in the third quarter kind of in the mid-70s for Bromine itself and I would expect that to drop probably to the mid-60s, mid to high 60s in the fourth quarter. If you look at our BFRs, BFRs are probably running in the range of \u2013 this is all Brominated Flame Retardants, probably at about 50% in the third quarter and I would expect to see that drop to the low 40s in the fourth quarter, which would mean obviously when you look at that that some of our (inaudible) we expect and those would run pretty hard in some of specialty Bromine run pretty hard in the fourth quarter.","John Hertz \u2013 Citigroup","Okay, great. Thanks for the color.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank","Thank you, good morning.","Luke Kissam","Hi David.","David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank","Luke, you commented on Bromine FR pricing sequentially year-over-year, any pressures you are seeing there?","Luke Kissam","Yes. I think if you look at, specifically Brominated Flame Retardants pricing, if you look sequentially in construction where we sell Brominated Flame Retardants in the constructions we saw a pretty significant decline in pricing. But it was really, if you remember in the last call we talked about a key raw material that goes into HPC called CDDT [ph], there was an explosion of one of the key raw material supplies in the third quarter that allowed, that there was tremendous demand that allowed some pricing there for people who really worried about whether or not they were going to supply. So, we have seen a drop down to what I would call a more normal rate, nothing for us to get along about long term from HPCD standpoint. As you typically see, Tetrabrom, you see a little nibbling around the edges, I would say, maybe sequentially probably 3% to 4%, something like that. But we are also seeing the evidence now of it tracked backup and that\u2019s mainly in Asia. So, overall Brominated Flame Retardants seem to be holding well with those two caveats, David.","David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank","And just on Bromine for volume, any market share losses given the consumer environmental issues or was it just purely end market weakness driving lower volumes here?","Luke Kissam","We do not believe that there has been any share loss for Albemarle from Brominated Flame Retardants standpoint. I am trying to figure out a way to give you guys a view on the level of the production and level of the sales. So, I want to go back and this is for all Brominated Flame Retardants. So, if you less index of the first half of 2009, if we index of the first half of 2009 and you look to the first half of 2011, Brominated Flame Retardants were at 186% of what they were in the first half of 2009, so almost doubled. During the third quarter of 2012, we were roughly a 120%, 130% of those volumes in the first half of 2009 and the fourth quarter will be down a little bit more than that. If you look at that on the edges, electronics would probably been a little bit better than that, construction probably a little worse than that in the quarter. So, I don\u2019t think there has been any market shift from a market share standpoint. It looks like to us it\u2019s all macroeconomics. But we are consistently watching it and making sure that we are bringing new products to the market that allow us to maintain that competitive edge.","David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank","Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.","Kevin McCarthy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes, good morning gentlemen.","Luke Kissam","Hi, Kevin.","Kevin McCarthy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Scott, I think you had commented that Polymer Solutions\u2019 inventory days declined by about 10 days in the quarter. I was wondering if you could tell us what the before and after numbers were for that business? Also, at the end of the quarter, how would you characterize Polymer Solutions\u2019 inventory levels relative to what you would consider a normal level for that business, is it 20% above or 50% above, how should we think about that?","Scott Tozier","Yes, I think Kevin, overall for the company you are going to see as you do the calculations that our inventory days are holding flat right now at around 65 based on revenues, so days sales in inventory, which is higher than what we would like it to be. Normally, we would like it to be for the total company kind of in the mid-50 range and continue to become more efficient there. As we said on the call also, we have built some catalyst inventory on purpose in HPC, in particular, as we have a heavy fourth quarter shipments and we have some shutdowns for some turnarounds in HPC in the fourth quarter. For Polymer Solutions, we have also seen, as I mentioned we have declines, we typically like to see them kind of in the mid-70 range, maybe a little bit lower than that as they become more efficient. So, hopefully we will be at that level by year end.","Luke Kissam","Kevin, this is Luke. If I could find what steady state for that business was going to be based upon the demand that we see it, just jerks around so quickly based on where we are on that supply chain. But what I would tell you is, if you listen to the call here, we have got cost loss absorption of roughly $16 million to hit that business in the third quarter and we will have about $20 million to hit it in the fourth quarter to give you the kind of idea where we are looking to go with inventory in that business.","Kevin McCarthy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","It\u2019s really helpful. I appreciate it.  As a second question on performance catalyst solutions, I think you had indicated that you see that as a one quarter issue and I was wondering if you just elaborate on what\u2019s giving you confidence that the pressure there is transitory in nature?","Luke Kissam","Yes, sure. We had a number of big customers in the Middle East who had shutdowns in the quarter related to turnarounds. So, multi-week turnarounds that impacted our volume there. They are back up and running and we are seeing the shipments resume. For one of them, it was actually tying where they are building another unit. So, in the longer term that will mean more volume for us as we keep that customer. So, as we look to that we are seeing everything in our order book and with our customers that would indicate that we are back on track and it just happened that those number of those customers all had their turnaround in the same quarter.","Kevin McCarthy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander of Jefferies. Please proceed.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies & Co.","Good morning.","Luke Kissam","Hi, Laurence.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies & Co.","I guess, first question just on cash flow. Can you parse out the pricing trends for each of the categories Polyolefin, FCC and HPC excluding metal pass-through? And then tie that pricing trend commentary to the 40% drop in profits?","Luke Kissam","What I would generally say on that is, as we have said in the past, you got to be really careful about the mix issue on that. It\u2019s complicated even further about that we got the raw material for (inaudible). So, if you look at where we are, catalyst base pricing from an FCC standpoint is holding very strong, sequentially enhancing any degradation of that and it continues to hold well. From HPC, we are seeing good pricing, we got a little bit of metal pass throughs from marle, nickel, and cobalt impacting the revenue lines, but that\u2019s a straight pass through. So, I don\u2019t have a whole lot of profitability impact. On PCS, pricing remain strong there. We have seen a little bit around the edges, but nothing substantial and it continues to be very strong and very profitable from an R&D standpoint. But Scott can go into a little bit more details.","Scott Tozier","Yes, I will just add. HPC is a difficult one because it\u2019s very customer specific customized solutions. So, pricing is a difficult measure to have there. So, Luke is right, the base pricing is holding well. PCS is also affected by mix. We have got a lot of different products as that business grows, but again, the pricing seems to be holding well.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies & Co.","Your press release had some initial cautious comments on Polymer Solutions out through the Chinese New Year. As you are taking us sort of early glimpse of 2013, what tailwinds or do you have that you can actually point to a solid already sort of effectively in the bag that we should all start against fairly soft demand environment?","Luke Kissam","You are talking about overall corporation?","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies & Co.","Overall corporation.","Luke Kissam","Yes, I think you will see \u2013 I think Fine Chemistry services is going to continue to see very nice growth. Over that I think clear brines, we\u2019ve seen a pick up in the Gulf in September. So, we\u2019re beginning to see some of those clear completion fluids orders. And clear completion fluids should have a very strong fourth quarter building to a very strong 2013. Continue to see good growth in that business, so I think Fine Chemistry services has some tail winds behind it that we feel really strong about it. And on those customs service\u2019s contracts, the contracts are done and we know we\u2019re going to get that volume. So, we feel really good that we can put that in the bank and go with it.","We also feel good about the continued growth in our catalyst business. So I think you\u2019re going to see that or return, once we get all this behind us and you\u2019ll see that and probably there\u2019ll be a little bit of roll over in the first quarter of 2013. But as a general rule, it should be behind us, and I think we\u2019ll continue to see strong volumes in FCC and HPC in growth in our PCS business. We\u2019ll have Korea coming on line in the second half of the year, which would give us a nice little boost there. So, I think there is some catalyst tail winds that we\u2019re counting on and counting on both Catalyst and Fine Chemistry to grow past single, double digit type of growth in 2013, but again we\u2019re working on the AOP and I\u2019ll get more details to that to you in January launch.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies & Co.","If I can just clarify in Polymer Solutions, is there any room for shrinking the business or cost cutting further?","Luke Kissam","Yeah. I think there is always room for cost cutting. If you look at what we\u2019ve done across our portfolio, but it won\u2019t be focused just on Polymer Solutions. If you remember in 2009, a lot of that plan C that we implemented was focused on Polymer Solution. And there is still good growth opportunities there. When that business, the macroeconomic trends turn right with the pricing and the cost position that we have in that business, every incremental pound contributes it is very profitable for us. So it\u2019s a strong business, we\u2019re looking forward to seeing it grow next year when we get some help from the economy, and I feel good about it overall. There is not another $160 million for me to go out there and cut loss. There is some cost savings that everybody would do from a common sense standpoint from travel, from incentives, from pay, from all of that, from hiring and replacing people. But I don\u2019t have another $160 million that we can go out there and cut. It wouldn\u2019t be the right thing for the business and to grow the business.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies & Co.","Thank you.","","","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Mike Ritzenthaler of Piper Jaffray","Mike Ritzenthaler \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Hi good morning guys. Can you talk a little bit more about the growth for NBPT[ph], is it the international distribution that\u2019s driving the growth there and given the domestic nitrogen bombs are having some of the fertilizer companies for this fall, I guess is there any risk of shortage or maybe I guess I would have expected maybe 4Q to be a little bit stronger because of the nitrogen volumes?","Luke Kissam","No, I think that long term that business is in great shape, we don\u2019t see that there is an issue with shortness in the fourth quarter or shortness anywhere else and I think begins that they\u2019ve always had a plan from an international standpoint to expand that business and position us to get assets outside of U.S. So we are working with that and hope we grow with that business and feel really good about it both in the short and long term.","Mike Ritzenthaler \u2013 Piper Jaffray","","Okay and then, is there anything outside of connector and circuit board and market release, that could solve these (inaudible) bromine volume problems. Could you give us a sense of maybe for your share in the early stages of Mercury abatement or any of the end markets that brominated (inaudible)?","Luke Kissam","I think that, if you look again from a flame retardant standpoint, we have some good opportunities and some additional markets for some new products that we\u2019re pushing at it and we talked about in the past probably Gemini, Green Armor and some other products there that could be a nice growth over the next two to three years for us. If you look outside the use of the brominated flame retardants, we\u2019re putting together a bromine task force and we\u2019ve got together a bromine task force and that, the job of that group is to come up with new uses for bromine, not just the new flame retardants. We got a group working on that, but its what\u2019s the another use for bromine and how can we drive more uses of bromine. And we\u2019re excited about some of the possibilities of that still very very early stage, but a lot of good work and good thought process is going on in there. We don\u2019t have a big market share of the mercury control market today and we\u2019re not in the Section 45 in the U.S for mercury control with those clear completion fluids and until we get meaningful regulations in the U.S. and abroad that market is going to be slow. So I think we\u2019re doing things in our specially bromide business, that we\u2019ve seen nice growth there. We talked about that would drive new uses for bromine and this is just going to be a continuation of finding new ways, gaining some market in a cost effective manner that allows to grow uses of that molecule.","Scott Tozier","And look at that in the shorter term clear brine fluids, clearly one that we\u2019re excited about, literally in the last week of September, where we had some significant shipments that helped us to deliver the results that we did and we\u2019re expecting that to continue through 2013. The growth that we\u2019ve seen in food safety as well as some of our industrial bromides like in water treatment are all showing really good signs of attraction and so all support over that bromine molecules. So, once the economy starts a turn around, we\u2019ll see that flame retardant business pick back up as well.","Mike Ritzenthaler \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Okay. Thanks \u2013 (inaudible)","Operator","And you next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas of JPMorgan, please proceed. ","Jeff Zekauskas \u2013 JP Morgan","Hi good morning. You talked about your relatively low utilization rates and brominated flame retardants.  I think you talked about them being in 60\u2019s and being a little puffer in the fourth quarter. So does it make sense to postpone the Jordanian capacity coming on, because it doesn\u2019t seem that you need that. And I would imagine that all of the bromine companies expanded capacity and expectation of the mercury removal markets coming along much faster than they did, or than they will. And so how is the industry going to manage the situation that there seems to be much too much capacity for a slow growing volume business?","Luke Kissam","Hey Jeff, that\u2019s a great question. If you look at the utilization rates for our brominated flame retardants, you remember we have delayed not just the start up but the commencement of the expansion of our tetrabrom expansion in Jordan. So we\u2019re not bringing that online, we haven\u2019t even started construction of that yet. So, we have postponed that tetrabrom expansion. If you look at Bromine and you look at Clear Completion Fluids as it\u2019s growing, those capacity rates for clear completion fluids are getting tighter, and so we needed some additional clear completion fluids capacity, we got that, it\u2019s coming online and it will be able to service the customers. ","With respect to bromine it didn\u2019t make any sense to expand clear completions without expanding the bromine at the same time in Jordan. I\u2019m not aware of other announcements by ICL (inaudible) acquired are now some acquisitions to Salah Russel, so that would be some additional capacity that they would have, but that\u2019s not a new capacity, it\u2019s already out there. But I think that what we\u2019re going to do and I can\u2019t speak for the others is, I have no intention of flooding the market with bromine. We\u2019re going to bring that online as needed to meet the demand. It is not going to be a situation where I feel compelled by any stress to run that at a 100% capacity on day 1 and we will not operate at that way.","Jeff Zekauskas \u2013 JP Morgan","","And then for my second question, can you review what the rate of demand growth has been for the nine months for fluid cracking catalysts versus HPC catalysts. My impression is that FCC has grown much faster and I was wondering if that were the case, why is the demand profile so much stronger in FCC than it is in HPC?","Luke Kissam","If you\u2019re looking at it from a volume metrics standpoint, okay Jeff, is that your question?","Jeff Zekauskas \u2013 JP Morgan","Yes, that\u2019s exactly right.","Luke Kissam","From a volume metric standpoint, that\u2019s the case. And one of the things that we saw in the third quarter in particularly, where FCC volumes were up, we had some customers buying ahead of a potential west coast strike that they were worried about in the third quarter. That strike has since been settled, but they were buying ahead of that. I think our HPC volumes this year will be relatively what they were in 2011, so pretty flat and we\u2019ve made good head winds, good head way in the FCC markets, I think a lot of it is deals with the heavy resid and the cracking up there with the propylene yields that we are able to provide at higher output on the FCC catalysts, then in part some of our competitors have been. So, I think that crude slide is helping us there, it\u2019s kind of in our sweet spot in FCC and HPC has been strong, it just hasn\u2019t grown like FCC has from a volume metric basis.","Scott Tozier","I would just add too Jeff, that we\u2019re seeing good growth internationally as those refineries are operating in India, Middle East and we\u2019re seeing the benefit of that in FCC.","Jeff Zekauskas \u2013 JP Morgan","Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","In the interest of time, our final question will come from the line of Mike Sison of KeyBanc, please proceed.","Mike Sison \u2013 KeyBanc","Hey guys, thanks for taking the call. Given the rough start in Polymer Solutions likely to see in the first quarter of \u201913 or so in the first half you talked about, weak demand. Is it possible to grow earnings next year?","Luke Kissam","Oh yes, it is possible to grow earnings next year.","","","Mike Sison \u2013 KeyBanc","Okay, and then when you take a look at Fine Chemicals and catalyst you got lined at your Analyst Day that \u201813 could be a year where we see that trajectory to 15 to come to fruition and so if you think about all the things you can control, your management team can control for those two businesses, is it possible that \u201813 will shape up where sort of that trajectory to you 15 goals seem still pretty feasible for those two segments?","Luke Kissam","Yeah, I do. I think what you\u2019re going to see is, you know remember there was a range and some of that was organic growth and some other was with an (inaudible). So, I am just talking about organic growth right now. And I think you\u2019re going to see that the Fine Chemistry and catalyst are going to be on a trajectory to put it right in that gap where we talked about where we would be. And I think Polymers, the count is going to come back and we are going to see that growth to that business and when it returns, you\u2019re going to see really really strong earnings coming out of that business, just like we had before. So, I\u2019m still remaining confident that we\u2019re going to be in the sweet spot long term for vision 2015 strategy on what we said we\u2019re going to deliver from each of our businesses.","Mike Sison \u2013 KeyBanc","Great, and last question since I am the last. Your balance sheet is still pretty good and you see other companies (inaudible) obviously take some pretty big risks and go after some nice businesses, any thoughts there? Are there any opportunities for you to generate some pretty good growth and the flow in economy may be acquisition?","Luke Kissam","Yeah, I think we\u2019re still looking at acquisitions in the market-to-date but we\u2019re going to take the same kind of measured approach that we have, and it fits within an overall strategy and grows out technological base. And it\u2019s one that where it\u2019s not going to loot our earnings and its going to be one that we think we can manage. I\u2019m not going to go do an acquisition just because interest rates are low and we want to do one. We\u2019re going to do an acquisition that makes sense for the strategy for this business to grow up to vision 2015 and beyond.","Mike Sison \u2013 KeyBanc","Got it, thank you very much.","Operator","At this time I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Lorin Crenshaw for closing remarks.","Lorin Crenshaw","Sure, now well we just like to thank everyone for their time and attention and encourage you to call with further questions.","Operator","Thank you very much, this concludes today\u2019s conference.

Please proceed, sir.","Lorin Crenshaw","Thank you, Kim and welcome everyone to Albemarle\u2019s first quarter 2012 earnings conference call.

Also, to the extent that we discuss any non-GAAP financial measures, you\u2019ll find reconciliations in our press release which is posted on our website at albemarle.com.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Luke.","Luke Kissam","Thank you Lorin and good morning everyone. We appreciate the opportunity to share our first quarter financial results with you today. And I will begin by commenting on the company's quarterly results and sharing updates related to certain strategic initiatives we have commenced. John Steitz will then walk you through the business segment performance before Scott Tozier reviews today's financial highlights. As usual at the end of our prepared remarks, we will open it up for your questions. I'm pleased to report first quarter results that reflect an excellent start to 2012 across each of our segments. First-quarter net income of $108 million or $1.20 per share was up 4% year-over-year and net sales of $712 million was up 2% year over year.","This marks the 10th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth in our earnings. In addition, we continue to generate a healthy amount of cash with $124 million of cash generation for the first quarter, up 28% versus the prior-year period excluding the $50 million pension contribution we made in the first quarter of last year. Collectively our businesses generated $176 million in EBITDA and achieved segment margins of 24%.","Year-over-year earnings growth in Catalyst and Fine Chemistry reflected continued positive trends in those businesses while Polymer Solutions saw an increase in demand from the fourth quarter and a continuing strengthening of demand with each successive month in the quarter. Great results and a very good start to 2012.","The quarter also included two special items that I want to highlight. We had a gain of $8.1 million, $5.1 million after-tax or $0.06 per share from proceeds we received as a result of the settlement of the litigation matter net of related legal fees. We used these cash to make an $8 million charitable contribution to the Albermarle foundation to begin the process of creating an endowment for the foundation. That contribution was a $5.1 million after-tax or $0.06 per share expense which basically offset the special gain of the litigation settlement. The Albermarle foundation is a non-profit organization dedicated to making a positive difference in the communities in which we operate and to the non-profit organizations in which our employees are involved.","Since the Albermarle foundation was established in 2007, its contributions to more than 100 partner agencies have steadily increased and I would expect that trend to continue. It's important that Albermarle does its part in trying to make our communities better places to live, work and raise a family and we are delighted to be able to start this endowment to ensure that the Albermarle foundation's impact can continue to grow in both the good and challenged economic times that the future will surely bring.","On the strategic front, we mentioned back in January that we've commenced a comprehensive portfolio review aimed at identifying opportunities to address underperforming assets. That process remains ongoing, but I would expect to be in a position to provide specific details in the second quarter. Our major capital projects are proceeding well.","I was recently in Saudi Arabia and Jordan and was able to see firsthand the progress being made on the construction of those two sites. It's always good to see concrete being poured, steel being erected and projects beginning to take shape. With regards to performance in Catalyst Solutions projects we expect mechanical completion by the end of 2012, for both the 6000 met\/ton TEA plant that we are building in Saudi Arabia with our partner SABIC and for our wholly-owned Greenfield Polymer Catalyst Center in Yeosu City Korea. That would mean start-ups for both sites in late fourth quarter of this year or early first quarter of next year.","In some instances we are already sending samples to customers and getting good feedback. In addition, we continue to invest in specialty organometallics capacity expansions as select domestic facilities to satisfy the growing market demand for these products. These expansions will be executed in stages and will be complete by the end of the year allowing us to maintain our global leadership position in organometallics. ","Turning to our bromine expansion in Jordan. The first base should be ready this summer when we expect mechanical completion for the additional bromine capacity. We expect the additional capacity for clear completion fluids to be completed in the October-November timeframe.","The last phase, additional tetrabromide capacity should be operational next year in late second or early third quarter. Each of these stages roughly doubles the existing capacity and we plan to bring this additional capacity on in stages as market demands dictate. This capacity remains necessary to meet the needs of our customers and positions us well to capitalize on what remains an extremely attractive global demand outlook for bromine and bromine derivatives.","We don't expect any meaningful overruns on any of these projects at this time. One of the new uses for bromine that we have highlighted in the past is control of mercury emissions. In March the US Trade Development Agency sponsored a China Reverse Trade Mission on mercury control hosting representatives from the Chinese Ministry of Environmental Protection and top Chinese power companies. The purpose of the mission was to showcase the most advanced US technologies used in controlling mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants.","It also provided an opportunity for the Chinese Ministry of Environmental Protection to collaborate with the US TDA and US EPA on policy and rulemaking in the area of mercury emission control. We were pleased to take part in the mission and be among the US companies the delegation chose to visit directly to review our emission abatement technology. As environmental protection continues to rise higher on the agendas of governments around the world, Albermarle is well situated to assist the global power and cement industries in particular in reducing pollutants throughout our diverse portfolio of products and services.","Finally, as you know, Albemarle has a long history of supporting our customers and evolving our technology in ways that anticipate their desire for the most sustainable solution. In that way, we were excited to announce last week a new addition to our existing platform of polymeric flame retardant solutions.","This new technology, licensed from a subsidiary of Dow Chemical Company, will be commercialized in 2014, as expected to become the preferred choice for flame retarding, both extruded and expanded polystyrene using foam insulation applications.","As we consider the outlook for the balance of the year, uncertainties clearly persists regarding the durability of the current global economic recovery. Though similar regarding the European debt crisis seems to have improved, concerns remain regarding the magnitude of the impact of austerity measures being implemented throughout that region.","Nevertheless, the full-year outlook for Catalysts and Fine chemistry remains favorable, supported by several positive industry trends, and healthy new business opportunities. In addition, our interpretation of the end-market patterns were currently seen is that they remain supportive of a continued acceleration of Polymer Solutions\u2019 business trends into the second quarter and through the second half of 2012.","In closing, our businesses remain healthy and we expect to perform well in 2012. Our best guess remains that our businesses will generate earnings in the first half of 2012, resembling levels achieved during the second half of 2011. Assuming that a second half recovery occurs, we continue to expect to grow our business for the full-year and make further progress toward the goals we outlined in Vision 2015. This would set us up nicely for 2013 when this impact of the major investments I discussed earlier should become positive contributors in our financial results.","With that, I will turn the call over to John to discuss our operational performance for the quarter.","John Steitz","Hey, thanks Luke and good morning everyone. I will start with Polymer Solutions, which reported first quarter net sales of 228 million, down 12% year-over-year but up 9% sequentially, and segment income of $54 million, down 23% year-over-year but 46% higher sequentially, and volumes that were up 20% quarter-on-quarter.","Of course, year-over-year comparisons for the first half of 2012 will not show gains given the strength of the first half of last year. I would like to point out that the distinct improvement in Polymer\u2019s performance versus the fourth quarter was very encouraging. From our advantage point, it represents returning the cycle but only time will tell the ultimate extent of its strength and duration.","In terms of intra-quarter color, demand began rising in late January following changed new year, and accelerated throughout the quarter, with revenues and volumes rising with each successive month. The increase in demand, combined with great cost management and execution to plan on the manufacturing side, resulted in a 600 basis points sequential improvement in segment margins to 23.5%.","Specifically, brominated flame retardant volumes and operating profits were down 19% and 12% year-over-year respectively, but up 4% and 15% sequentially, while mineral flame retardant volumes and operating profit showed some more strength versus the prior quarter, up 34% and 77% respectively.","Improvement was wide spread with the enclosure, connector, print and wiring board and wire and cabling markets all picking up nicely, while the construction and automotive end-markets also showed better trends.","Stabilizers and curatives also delivered strong sequential performance, with volumes up 30% and operating profit equally strong. The main drivers included an improved tone in North American infrastructure spending, which benefited curatives, fuel and lubricant, antioxidants, trends and great execution from the manufacturing perspective in meeting the increased demand.","Looking forward, among the many indicators we monitor, the IPC Book-to-Bill report picked up to 1.04 in February, while global connector confidence file 8 [00:00:48], as published by the Bishop report, has shown four straight months of upward trends, with March rising to 65.4 from 60.8 in February and up substantially versus 50.5 in December. ","Overall, I\u2019ll reassert the tone our fire safety end-markets has improved, and seems likely to strengthen further in coming months.","Moving on to Catalysts, which reported another great quarter, a stronger refinery catalysts volume growth and higher pricing growth of net sales of $294 million, up 13% year-over-year, segment income of $82 million, up 13% year-over-year, and segment margins of 28%, up 20 basis point versus prior year.","Operating results were strong in both divisions, with refinery catalysts sales now offering profits of 13% and 5% year-over-year on a respective basis. And Performance Catalyst Solutions sales rising 10% and operating profits 29% higher on a year-over-year basis.","It\u2019s worth noting that the earnings presentation indicates that the year-over-year catalyst revenue increased attributable-to-volumes flat. However, excluding a large alternative fuels order from last year, volumes contributed a mid-single digit percentage to the year-over-year sales increase.","Within refinery catalysts, HPC results were outstanding, with operating profits of 20% year-over-year, establishing a new all-time record on strong volumes and favorable mix.","SEC performance was also strong with volumes and earnings achieving double-digit growth. The high volume gains were attributable to a combination of improved operating rates amongst certain large customers in the United States versus a year ago period, and higher year-over-year growth in emerging markets while we are benefiting from the start up, also of its sizable new unit running on our technology.","The PCS division\u2019s financial results were principally driven by core polymer catalyst group. Sales and operating profits within Polymer Catalysts rose 21% and 58%, year-over-year, thanks to a solid organometallics volume growth, reflecting, encouraging global trends.","Looking forward, second quarter HPC volumes will be lower sequentially in year-over-year. But that is attributable to expected order patterns and changed thoughts of our customers as opposed to any reduced demand. However, for the full-year, we continue to expect a nice HPC volume growth.","Regarding SEC, while anecdotally certain refiners are challenged depending on the their geographic locale, access to heavier crude and conversion flexibility, the overall tone of our business is solid with growth expected from a combination of new units coming on using our technology and continued growth in developing markets.","Fine Chemistry delivered net sales of $190 million, up 7% year-over-year and segment income of $39 million, up 31% year-over-year. Segment income levels were the second highest of all time, while segment margins of 20% remain at historically high levels and were up an impressive 340 basis points from last year.","Both divisions reported excellent financial results with Performance Chemicals sales and operating profits up 4% and 5% year-over-year respectively while Fine Chemistry Services sales and operating profits rose 21% and 121% respectively versus the prior year period.","Performance Chemicals drivers included higher pricing across the portfolio, historically high clear brine fluids volumes and excellent results across a diverse range of intermediates into a variety of industrial and consumer end-markets.","The full year outlook for clear brine fluids remains favorable with global drilling rates expected to amass the outstanding 2011 levels driven by continued strength in developing markets and the eventual tailwind provided by rejuvenated Gulf of Mexico; though the impact from that region will likely be somewhat second half weighted.","The year-over-year doubling in our Fine Chemistry Services profits reflected that business beginning to reap the benefits of a diversified line of opportunities across the agricultural, lubricant, renewable chemistry and specialty pharma sectors we have targeted for growth. The impact of evolving our portfolio towards complex, higher margin, longer duration opportunities was evident during the quarter as operating margins rose impressively.","Drivers included continued healthy growth in Ag intermediates, positive trends within our pharmaceuticals portfolio and a growing contribution from several recent renewable chemistry business wins.","Notably, we believe that current Fine Chemistry profitability levels are at a new base reflecting the collective impact of a number of structural and strategic initiatives including a transformation of the product portfolio through asset sales and selective pairing and growing impact of several new bromine applications and ongoing make shift within the Fine Chemistry Services towards increasingly complex, longer duration, higher margin businesses.","An excellent example of direction this business is moving toward was a recent contract we were rewarded to complete the Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Divisions. First biojet fuel production run based on bio and butanol provided by Cobalt Technologies. Overall, Fine Chemistry is well positioned to continue delivering outstanding results this year.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Scott.","Scott Tozier","Thank you John and good morning everyone. Albemarle\u2019s first quarter financial results were excellent on several measures including earnings, cash generation and overall profitability levels. Specifically, the business generated EBITDA of $176 million, up 3% year-over-year and achieved EBITDA margins of 24.8%, 20 basis points higher year-over-year and up by 180 basis points on the fourth quarter [troughs].","Our balance sheet remains in superb shape with excellent cash generation driving net debt down $55 million during the quarter or 20% versus year-end levels to just $216 million, excluding $22 million in non-guaranteed debt from our JBC joint venture.","As a result, leverage as measured by net debt to EBITDA is at 0.3 times and our net debt to capital ratio was 11% at a quarter end. Our cash and leverage position continues to give us options and flexibility as we work to our Vision 2015.","Turning to some P&L details; SG&A expense rose 10% year-over-year principally driven by a combination of higher selling commissions, personnel costs and pension related expenses. As a percentage of sales, this line item is up around 80 basis points to 11.3% versus 10.5% during the same period a year ago.","In total, pension expense rose $3.5 million year-over-year to $10 million, due to a decline in the discount rate used to measure our pension obligations and lower than forecasted asset performance in 2011. As we noted in January, we expect pension expenses to rise roughly $20 million on an annualized basis this year.","However, our funded status remains quite strong nearly 100% and we do not expect the need to make any meaningful cash contributions to our plans until 2014 at the earliest.","R&D expense; it is up 8% year-over-year, as we continue investing in organic growth opportunities including the strategic adjacency initiatives we outlined as part of Vision 2015. R&D cost as a percent of revenue are up 20 basis points to 2.7% versus 2.5% for the comparable period in 2011.","Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 25.5%, up 130 basis points versus the first quarter of 2011 rate of 24.2% driven primarily by increased profitability in the higher tax rate countries and changes in tax regulations most notably in the US and Europe. At this time, we expect our full year rate to be around 25%.","Now on the cash flow trends; free cash flow defined as cash flow from operations, add the pension and post retirement contributions and subtract capital expenditures was $71 million for the period, up 7% year-over-year. Cash from operations was up 28% year-over-year to a $124 million and that\u2019s excluding the $15 million pension contribution we made in the first quarter of 2011. This was driven by good profitability and lower working capital requirements.","CapEx during the quarter was $55 million reflecting continued investment in the major strategic projects we\u2019ve commenced in South Korea, Jordan and selectively here in the US as earlier updated by Luke. We expect CapEx for the quarter to rise for the balance of the year and approach approximately $300 million for 2012 with roughly $100 million of that attributable to our Jordanian expansion which will be fully funded from operating cash flow of that joint venture.","Net working capital was up $39 million from December 2011 or 8% mainly due to receivables from higher quarter-end business activity and as we dealt inventory levels modestly to meet future market demand. Overall, net working capital as a percent of revenue was a healthy 19%, down 311 basis points year-over-year and up 126 basis points from year-end.","Finally, we made $16 million in dividend payments during the quarter, up 19% year-over-year and announced a 14% increase in our dividend to $0.20 from $0.175. The increase reflects our confidence in the cash generating capacity of our businesses and represents the 18th consecutive year that we have raised the dividend.","With that, I\u2019ll hand it back over to Lorin for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Lorin Crenshaw","Thanks Scott. Operator at this time we would like to open the call for questions.","Operator","(Operator Instructions). And your first question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank","And Luke on bromine forward price you mentioned in the slide, it is holding firm, any sign of any weakness anywhere in that chain in potential as the year improves for some price increases in brominated flame retardants.","John Steitz","David let me just give you little more detail around that. If you look at the whole brominated flame retardant business, prices year-over-year were up about 7% to 8% and even sequentially were up a couple of points. If you take out the mix effects like if I pull out tetrabromide for example, brominated flame retardants are up 20% year-over-year on a pure price basis. So right now I would say there is a growing concern about some of the raw materials, benzene, phenol there is an issue in Europe related to the CDT. So we are continuing to study that but I think as supply and demand balances out with an improved volume scenario we are keeping a strong eye out towards those kind of opportunities. So we will stay around on top of that but overall it's been very encouraging, especially through the volume declines over the last half of 2011 and everything appears to be lining up pretty well.","David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank","And John same question on catalysts, any more color on the pricing gain in that segment to just mix and what's happening specifically on FCC pricing?","John Steitz","Yeah, David FCC pricing you know the big driver of course has been rare earth and the year-over-year pricing is up pretty significantly and that\u2019s mostly a rare earth impact. Sequentially prices were down, the order magnitude about 10% and once again that\u2019s all rare earth. So the way we look at it is over the course of the year our rare earth situation will balance out for us. I think we\u2019ve done a really good job with our catalyst business of managing volatility around those kind of metals.","Now with that said, I think we\u2019re having some success of driving technology, driving some of the low rare earth alternatives and driving the heavier resid and higher propylene yielding FCC catalysts which is resulting so far this year in between a $100 and $200 improvement in base prices. So we\u2019re hopeful that we can continue to drive that kind of the value especially with some of the global improvement in volume sourcing.","David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank","And just last, Luke is there update on lithium you can provide?","Luke Kissam","Yeah, I can give you update, we continue to work on the technology in perfecting that technology. You know David every time you learn a little bit more in dealing with chemists, they got another question and they learned a little bit more and they want to ask a little more questions. So that process is still, we\u2019re working well, we\u2019re producing lithium carbonate, we\u2019ve got our pilot plant at Magnolia, run and own the hot broad and we\u2019re in the design phase right now. I think that\u2019s more of a 2014-2015 time of commercial launch than a 2013 because we got to perfect it and design it and build it. So but it is still the strides, still looking forward to get into that market.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of P J. Juvekar with Citi.","P J. Juvekar - Citi","You know volumes of polymer solutions have declined in the sixth quarter in year over year?","Luke Kissam","Hey P.J. this is Luke. I am sorry, we are having a very hard time hearing you, could you speak up please.","P J. Juvekar - Citigroup","What\u2019s going on sort of longer term, did all decline something from mineral flame retardants that are showing the declines?","Luke Kissam","P.J., I couldn\u2019t quite hear you. I think it has to do with volume issues around polymer solutions especially in flame retardants, if that is the case let me just kind of talk about volumes in general. In brominated flame retardants in the first half of last year volumes were extraordinarily strong, were sold out most of our units. Probably looking back now was an over-correction from volume declines in 2010.","After that we saw all the US political issues related to debt ceiling and a lot of the European issues related to Italy and Greece and Spain and we saw a pretty significant volume drop in the second half of last year. What we are seeing now is an improvement sequentially in volumes broadly and we have seen that in the first quarter. We believe, we will see that in the second quarter. It will be still less than the first and second quarters year-over-year, but we believe that all the trends are positive.","In mineral flame retardant, volumes were extraordinarily strong in the first half of last year as well. We saw them drop off precipitously in the fourth quarter, but they have returned in a very robust fashion in the first quarter of this year and the second quarter also looks like improving volume trends. So hopefully that gives you a little bit of color, longer term we feel really good about of our safety in general and we can talk about that in greater detail at the Investor Conference in May.","Unidentified Analyst","And just quickly what are the utilization rates currently at JBC and in Arkansas?","Luke Kissam","You know they have improved from the back half of last year and we are probably running in the range of 80% to 85% now. ","Scott Tozier","And P.J. I would say that, that changes a little bit as you look to each one of those units, some of the units on some of our products are sold out and we're running just as hard as we can and others are running a little bit more slowly and we are in a position in some instances where we are allocating bromine to the highest value product. So you got to be careful and John\u2019s answer on that was accurate but you got to be careful when you are looking at each specific unit operations and then how they might be running because some of the impact are sold out. So when we are looking at pricing, we are looking at how we manage our portfolio of bromine and we obviously, is specific on a product-by-product basis for the application and how that market is doing today, but overall that\u2019s where we are.","P J. Juvekar - Citi","And just quickly John you mentioned about certain refineries challenges based on the geography. I am just wondering if you can talk about the impact of the closure in the northeast, when the refinery is setting down and what's the impact for you?","John Steitz","Basically, the Northeast is really hampered from a refining point of view, but the real growth in this business is outside the United States and Europe, P.J. We are seeing strong trends in Asia, excluding Japan and strong trends throughout the Middle East.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Bob Koort - Goldman Sachs","Hey, John you had mentioned that the monthly trends in Polymer Solutions; was there anything atypical or is that sort of what you normally expect where February was better than January and March better than February?","John Steitz","Yeah, well, last year I would say it was real very unusual because everything from with the exception in January once we came out of the Chinese New Year in 2011, our business was just strong, I mean just really, really strong. And so while going into this year, we are hopeful that that would be the trend; you know its of course moderated from 2011, but its been a nice uptick and we are getting I think this quarter off to a good start too. And then all the underlying trends and indicators are positive too, so its just all gives us a lot more confidence than where we were six months ago.","Bob Koort - Goldman Sachs","And Luke, you guys got an awful lot of cash on the balance sheet, and I know in your Vision 2015 acquisitions are probably a third of the growth. Can you give us a sense are you getting close to there, I mean interest rates are low, you've got cash, but I also know that your definitions of what makes great companies are pretty limited in terms of the financial profile. So is there anything out there that's got you excited these days?","Luke Kissam","Yes, there are, we've looked at a number of things that have got us excited and we just had been able because I can\u2019t Bob being in a position where we\u2019re going to do a deal that limits our ability for these wonderful organic opportunities we have. But I would expect over the next 12 to 18 months Bob you will see us do a deal. We are kicking a lot of tires and we are taking some steps to develop some relationships that would allow someone to be more comfortable in doing a transaction with us over that time for us, I mean it takes a little while to get people comfortable doing that. But we\u2019re out there talking, we\u2019re out there kicking tires and we\u2019re active in the M&A market.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Please proceed.","Rob Walker - Jefferies","Good morning, this is Rob Walker on for Laurence. I guess first-off, can you comment a little bit on polyolefin volume trends in Q1 and kind of your outlook there?","John Steitz","Yeah, on polyolefin catalyst solutions business, volumes were up really and nicely sequentially year-over-year flat, but our organometallic volumes are strong and we saw some nice sequential improvements and overall that helped to bottom line for us. So it\u2019s a great start to the year and we\u2019re seeing -- our view for the year is doubled digit volume growth year-over-year in that business; it\u2019s a much smaller volume base business, I need no ramp up, but everything is very encouraging now, so thank you.","Rob Walker - Jefferies","And then I guess just in terms the volumes in overall in Polymer Solutions; roughly what would you say the volumes were for mineral frame retardants year-over-year and I think you said brominated flame retardants were down 19% year-over-year and then also kind of, what about curatives and stabilizers, how much of those contribute?","John Steitz","","Yeah, like we said, brominated flame retardant volumes year-over-year last year the time record profit start to record volumes which built into second quarter, all time record volumes at that point and all time record profits. So that\u2019s a comparable period.","But you are right, the volumes year-over-year were down by about 15% to 20%. Mineral, which generally runs this quarter were pulling volumes to be at bars, but they were down about 10% year-over-year and stabilizers and curatives were down also year-over-year.","So that comparable relation year-over-year is very, very difficult. Now we are starting to work through that. It becomes a less impact in the second quarter and we start to see more favorable comparables in the back half of the year and we are gaining confidence that that will be a reality.","Rob Walker - Jefferies","And just lastly for Luke, you mentioned briefly looking at some restructuring options, I am guessing kind of what room do you have in Europe operations; is the outlook there remains sluggish?","Luke Kissam","","Say that one more time?","Rob Walker - Jefferies","You had commented briefly about looking at some restructuring options I think in your prepared remarks?","Luke Kissam","","Yeah.","Rob Walker - Jefferies","How much room do you have to restructure your European operation?","Luke Kissam","","In 2009 kind of timeframe when we went back and look, when we did a restructuring, that was pretty heavy based in Europe. What we are really looking at now from a restructuring standpoint is assets. I mean, how our business performed and we have underperforming assets that we need to take action too. So there is enough of restructuring, anything we do from restructuring will be tied to what we would do with respect to any of these underperforming assets of businesses.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please proceed.","Jeff Zekauskas - JPMorgan","I think that the last time you had a conference call you forecasted your CapEx to be $180 million to $200 million and now its $300 million; what changed?","Luke Kissam","I think what we have always done is we have tried to talk to it in terms of two ways; one exclusive of JBC capital and two inclusive of JBC; because JBC if you look, we consolidate JBC so we have to include the CapEx for JBC as a part of our overall when you report it from a GAAP standpoint that\u2019s how we have to report it.","JBC this year will be roughly $100 million, we are not putting any additional cash into JBC; that\u2019s all going to be funded from a standpoint of the JBC operations. So that\u2019s $100 million of non-cash that we are putting there funded from JBC. Then if you look at our overall exclusive of JBC, we still believe we are going to try to spend that $180 million to $200 million in CapEx.","Jeff Zekauskas - JPMorgan","Second, there has been volatility in Rare Earths pricing and there were timing differences that sometimes positively affect you and sometimes negatively affect you. Can you talk about the year-over-year change from 2011 to 2012 in terms of the timing of Rare Earths price volatility and how that will effect your Catalysts operating income?","John Steitz","Just year-over-year in the first quarter Jeff, in FCC, the FCC business we had nice volume uptick mostly due to a number of, a couple of large US customers who really struggled to operate in the first quarter of last year. So if you look at the revenue improvement year-over-year I will just give you a little color on that, about two-thirds of sales increase was volume related and about another one-third was rare earth.","Okay so that hopefully frames that up for you. If you look at the sequential revenue decline, we've got a seasonal impact on FCC because when all these HPC issues or HPC turnarounds occurs they are not running the crackers and so the volume decline is on a similar basis, about two-thirds of that revenue decline was volume and about another one third was the rare earth decrease. So hopefully that will give you a little more color so you can frame it up. But over time I think we've done a good job of managing down inventories in FCC and where we can really manage this rare earth volatility much better.","You might remember a few years ago, we got caught with on the molybdenum issue with way too high finished goods inventories, too high molybdenum and it became quite a striking event for us to handle. So I think we learned from those experiences.","Jeff Zekauskas - JPMorgan","Okay and then lastly can you compare the pricing changes in HPC catalysts and FCC catalysts?","John Steitz","You know there's of course a big difference --","Jeff Zekauskas - JPMorgan","In mix issues, yeah.","John Steitz","Yeah I mean, prices in HPC tend to be between three and five times higher. So FCC pricing at 5000 a ton, HPC pricing would be you know 16,000 to 17,000 a ton. But we did see a little bit of sequential pricing improvement, but it was flat year over year.","Jeff Zekauskas - JPMorgan","It was flat year over year in which category and that\u2019s in \u2013","John Steitz","HPC was up year-over-year and FCC pricing was up year-over-year mostly due to the rare earth, its pricing was up you know 20% to 25% year-over-year Jeff.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America. Please proceed.","Kevin McCarthy - Bank of America","Yes, good morning. John on slide five of your deck in Fine Chemistry you indicate that demand for bromine derivates remains high with certain products and sold out positions, what products are sold out and why?","John Steitz","Yeah. We\u2019ve had just a couple of real specialty bromine derivatives that have done really well. Dibromoethane is brominated organic obviously used in water treatment applications and [purple] bromine is a very high value brominated solvent used in cleaning precision equipment. And that, that product is very niche oriented, that when it's sold out, we\u2019re pushing our units to produce as much as possible. The big volume driver in our Fine Chemistry business Kevin is clear brine fluids.","So let me just kind talk about that. What I thought was really striking in our Fine Chemical business in the first quarter was that, we were able to achieve this result with actually kind of mediocre results in our clear brine fluids business. And so while it was above average, if you look at the volumes over a multi-year period, it was above the average. It was probably down 50% from last year and 50%, 40% to 50% sequential and we had a really strong start in our clear brine\u2019s business in January and February, almost record volumes, but it fell down in March almost to nothing.","Now we are, it's picking back up again, but I was really encouraged that we were able to do that without anything significant upside in clear brine volumes. So hopefully that gives you a little better understanding of those issues.","Kevin McCarthy - Bank of America","Yes, it does. That\u2019s just not true, whether that comment related to some of the drilling fluids or something that was more niche to your specialties. I can switch gears to polymer additives, John it sounds like you saw some momentum as the quarter progressed.","If I think about that business in terms of product categories, may be brominated flame retardants, other FRs, curatives, antioxidants, stabilizers et cetera. Were you most encouraged on volume prospects and which product lines would you say remain most challenged volumetrically?","John Steitz","Well, just on a volume basis, we have been pretty delighted on the rebound and continuing improvement in our mineral flame retardant volumes, primarily in Europe. Our pricing has held firm which is good, minor year-over-year changes there due to the Euro but I have been, everything you read and hear about Europe, you will really think, things are really going to be destructive but the trends in our business are really encouraging there and it\u2019s continued -- those volume sequentially is continuing to improve. So that\u2019s good. The brominated flame retardant business Kevin overall, it\u2019s not one particular area we\u2019ve seen a lot of strength. They have all been sequentially just good momentum building products. But I\u2019ll I tell you, I am encouraged by what we\u2019re seeing in some of the indications for enclosures on televisions. It looks like those volumes are going to continue throughout the course of the year to improve. So that is, I would say, encouraging.","Kevin McCarthy - Bank of America","Okay, on the other side, what looks most challenged would you say?","John Steitz","The mixed read is on tetrabromide. So we just haven\u2019t seen a significant uptick in tetrabromide volumes. And so I think our basic read on that is customers are really watching inventory levels because of just the general uncertainty in the economy.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Sison with KeyBanc. Please proceed.","Mike Sison - KeyBanc","Like, when you sort of gave guidance for the first half, it would imply that second quarter EPS would be, you know, generally in line with the first quarter. So, can you sort of frame up? I mean, is it something that Polymer Solutions just continue to improve sequentially, and Fine Chemicals maybe improves and you noted HPC catalysts being weaker to few causing, so the flatness?","Luke Kissam","Yeah, I think that you summed it up pretty nicely, Mike. I mean that\u2019s kind of how we look at it. If we felt a little bit better about tetrabromide volumes in second quarter, that uncertainly out there, kind of drives into that. So you could see a little bit of an upside one way or the other, but that pretty well lined it out the continued improvement over there, a little deterioration in catalysts and fine chemistry kind of rocking along. So that\u2019s what it feels like.","Mike Sison - KeyBanc","Okay and then I just wanted to spend just a quick second on Polymer Solutions for the operating margin improvement sequentially, first versus fourth. I think you noted it was part volume, part costs and manufacturing execution. Could you, John, maybe give us a feel was it more volume? Was it more of the execution? Then maybe give us some idea what the execution was.","John Steitz","Yeah. Mike, I would say, you know, the volume increase and you know we came out of the fourth quarter really watching inventories, working capital, as you remember the cash generation was superb. So what we did as we saw volumes improve in polymers in January and February, I think we are able to supply seamlessly, you know, that increase in demand. And we did that, albeit, with a really, lets say, great management of spending. And so our supply chain really, I thought, adapted extraordinarily well to the increase in volume demand in a way that generated some really nice margins considering year-over-year, the lower volume level.","Mike Sison - KeyBanc","Okay, great. And last question. In FCC, you know, you rolled out a bunch of nice, slow rare earths, better margin products over the last year with rare earths coming down any push-to-go-back field technology. Is the adoption for the new stuff holding pretty well?","John Steitz","Yeah, you know, Mike, we have inherently a lower rare earths level and awfully high performing catalyst. I think, just generally, and this is just subjective. I think there's been less total push for rare earths, lower rare earths or zero rare earths catalysts, with an increasing emphasis on technology and what the products do. And I think that's overall really good for the catalysts industry in general.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Dimitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research. Please proceed.","Dimitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research","Couple of questions, and I think you\u2019ve sort of talked about them a little bit. I am just trying to -- there is a lot of moving parts here. So I am just trying to wrap my brain around just simply as possible. In Polymer Solutions on a year-over-year basis, you had your sales up about $30 million it looks like, and your EBIT was up about $9 million. So, I mean, that\u2019s a pretty strong contribution margin.","So, can you talk about, kind of, an year-over-year basis what the drivers of the strong performance were on the operating profit line given that volumes were down significantly? Is it just a combination of pricing continuing to flow through while rare earths pricing is coming down? I am sorry -- I am talking about Polymer Solutions. So is that -- I mean is this mineral retardants driving this improvement since they were kind of weak towards the second half of the year, or what\u2019s going on there? Is it a mix issue?","Lorin Crenshaw","Dimitry are you talking year-over-year?","Dimitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research","I am talking year-over-year, yeah. If I am looking at your slides, your presentation slides, you got Polymer Solutions going up -- Polymer Solutions.","Luke Kissam","Yeah, Polymer Solutions is down.","Dimitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research","Sorry, I am talking about Fine Chemicals.","Luke Kissam","Okay.","John Steitz","Alright. That makes more sense.","Dimitry Silversteyn -Longbow Research","Yeah, I actually got $30 million change in revenue and about $9 million change in operating profit.","John Steitz","Okay. If I look at overall Fine Chemistry, you know, we had a big uptick in Performance Chemicals. When I look at Fine Chemistry, when you really look at the volume decline, it is clear brine fluids in Performance Chemicals business and we also had a little bit of an issue related to our Ag intermediates, where one of our Ag intermediates customer withhold an organic product for them and we didn\u2019t have that availability of the product; that cost is a couple of million dollars.","Dimitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research","That\u2019s in 2011 you are talking about?","John Steitz","","Yeah, first quarter of \u201912 compared to first quarter of \u201911.","Dimitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research","So the issues with\u2026","John Steitz","","If you look at overall, our operating profit increased nicely year-over-year built on just really terrific performance in our Fine Chemistry Services business and I would say just average performance in Performance Chemicals.","Dimitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research","Okay. So it\u2019s a mix issue. Now with the volume that you lost was a much lower profit volume than the volume that you gained?","John Steitz","","Yes, absolutely.","Luke Kissam","","That\u2019s right Dimitry; and Dimitry I think one of the things, if you look at our Fine Chemistry Services, we talk about how that segment income doubled year-over-year and one of the reasons we label that, I think you got two effects. I think you\u2019ve got a mix in both overall of that segment and you\u2019ve also got a better mix within Fine Chemistry Services.","So as you have that churn that we\u2019ve talked about so much in Fine Chemistry Services, what we are doing is we are seeing as we are trading up to higher value, higher margin products that we are able to extract more value and the customers happy with it. So it\u2019s almost a double mix effect if you understand what I am saying to Dimitry.","Dimitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research","I got you that\u2019s helpful, well thank you. Switching gears to the Catalyst business, again there is a lot of things going on there with Rare Earths and surcharges and volumes and pricing. But if you just look at the business overall you know it was operating at a run rate of 15% to 16% operating profit prior to 2009 and then we had a jump up in 2010 and turn them on into the mid-20s.","I am not as concern with the sustainability of that level, I think it is sustainable, I am just trying to understand, we know you are yet to build a bridge between 15% and 25% that 10 points of margin.","Can you break it down for us and how much of it is maturation or organometallics and in the polymer catalyst business; how much of it is the Rare Earth impact and the delta between them and the surcharges if we put in; how much of it is HPC volume growth. Can you give us an idea of sort of what -- I think it\u2019s sustainable, but can you give me some confidence as to why it\u2019s sustainable I guess is what I am asking?","Luke Kissam","Let me try that for second if you don\u2019t mind, the answer to your question is yes to all of that. I think the way I break it down is this is in 2009 when we had the downturn, we took significant efforts to get our cost right first of all and we\u2019ve really maintained a focus on being low cost provider across that portfolio in HPC, SCC and particularly the Polymer Catalyst, polyolefin catalyst section.","So one is cost, we\u2019ve managed our cost. Two, we\u2019ve gone in from an operating efficiency standpoint and really increased our productivity without adding capital and without adding people, so from a lean manufacturing standpoint, from the way we operate our facilities we are lot better than we were.","Secondly, while the Rare Earth has contributed some, if you go back before we had any Rare Earth issue, we were hitting 30% margins in our businesses. So I wouldn\u2019t contribute it to the Rare Earth issue or lack of issue what there is, but I think that long-term what you are going to see is from prices standpoint, from an innovation standpoint that we are bringing new products to the market from expanding into these high value organometallics and electronic material businesses that you see from a catalyst standpoint, we firmly believe and we told you when we did Vision 2015 that we were going to bump around at high 20s and hopefully get up to 30%.","So we still think we've got some work to do there to drive up those 30% margins and we think we can maintain the way we've got the margins in the high 20% going forward over the course of Vision 2015.","Dimitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research","So the 31% you delivered in September of 2011, I guess you are talking about prior to the Rare Earth impact, given that you kind of got your 2015 level a quarter after you put out the 2015 level?","Luke Kissam","Dmitry, it was in 2010. If you go back and look in 2010 we were popping up even before we had the Rare Earths. We had a couple of quarters where we had the right mix with HPC, SCC and polyolefin catalysts and we had the right kind of mix with an HPC and we were able to pop-up around 30% before Rare Earths ever came in to being.","Dimitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research","And then one final question on the Nylon-12 issue that may be developing in Europe, I understand that some of it at least is being used for the flame retardant business. Are you expecting to see any impact as far as your ability to get the material and supply the market or is it not an impact for chemical for you?","John Steitz","Yeah, that is a raw material and a product called HPCD which goes into polyurethane construction foams Dmitry. And we feel pretty fortunate about our supply chain. But generally, I think its going to be really tight on the product, so we are continuing to evaluate that and how we react to that. But just generally it\u2019s a company I mean we handle problems in challenges like this very well. So I think it could be a good opportunity for us too.","Operator","And I would now like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Lorin Crenshaw for closing remarks.","Lorin Crenshaw","Well, I just like to thank everyone for participating and if there any further questions contact me at the number on the press release and have a great day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude today\u2019s conference.

At this time all participants are in listen only mode.  We will be facilitating a question and answer session towards the end of today\u2019s conference.  (Operator Instructions)  I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host Mr. Lorin Crenshaw, Director of Investor Relations and Communications.","Luther C. Kissam, IV ","Welcome everyone to Albermarle\u2019s second quarter 2012 earnings conference call. Our earnings were released after the close of the market yesterday and you\u2019ll find out press release, earnings presentation, and non-GAAP reconciliations posted on our website under the investor\u2019s section at www.Albermarle.com.  Joining me on the call today are [Lu] Kissam, Chief Executive Officer; John Steitz, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Scott Tozier, Chief Financial Officer.  ","As a reminder, some of the matters discussed during this conference call and webcast may include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  Please note the cautionary language about our forward-looking statements contained in our press release.  That same language applies to this call.  Also, to the extent we discuss any non-GAAP financial measures, you will find reconciliations in our press release which is posted on our website at www.Albermarle.com.","With that I\u2019ll turn the call over to [Lu].","Luther C. Kissam, IV ","We appreciate the opportunity to share our second quarter financial results with you today.  I\u2019ll begin by commenting on the company\u2019s quarterly results and share the updates related to some of our capital expansions as well as touch on our views for the rest of the year.  John Steitz will then walk you through the business segment performance before Scott Tozier reviews select financial highlights.  As usual, at the end of our prepared remarks we\u2019ll open it up for your questions.","I\u2019m pleased to report second quarter results that reflect the continuation of our solid start to 2012 across each of our segments.  For the quarter, our net income before special items was $111 million or $1.24 per share up 1% year-over-year.  Net sales were $685 million down 8% year-over-year.    Year-to-date our earnings have exceeded levels achieved in 2011 despite what I would categorize as a more challenging economic environment this year.  EBTIDA for the quarter before special items was $181 million up 2% year-over-year and for the first six months EBITDA was $357 million before special items, also up 2% year-over-year.","In the first half of 2012 volume gains in FCC catalysts and performance catalyst solutions coupled with strategic pricing moves and great cost management and execution on the manufacturing side offset lower volumes in polymer solutions and HPC catalysts allowing us to deliver a better financial performance than in the first half of 2011.  ","As John will discuss in more detail later, during the second quarter record fine chemistry results reflected continued strength in bromine & derivatives and continued growth in our contract manufacturing franchise.  Polymer delivered its second straight quarter of meaningful sequential earnings and margin improvements.  Catalysts delivered year-over-year earnings growth but slipped sequentially and versus our expectations at the beginning of the year as HPC catalysts saw more pronounced seasonal decline in volume of fresh catalyst than usual.  ","As we\u2019ve said frequently over the years the relatively long sales cycle ranging from between 18 months and three years, depending on the customer, and the large nature of HPC orders makes forecasting inherently complex quarter-to-quarter.  It\u2019s important to note that we maintained our HPC market share during the second quarter where we were the incumbent supplier we supplied the vast majority of resales in the quarter.  ","We even picked up a couple hundred net tons in situations where we were not the incumbent.  This was simply a quarter when not many of the units we supply were up for resale.  Fundamentally our catalyst franchise overall is maintaining market share, remains healthy, and continues to enjoy excellent competitive positioning and growth prospects.  ","At this time I\u2019d like to elaborate a little on the special item we reported this quarter related to approximately $95 million, $74 million after tax or $0.82 per share of charges related to our previously announced plans to exit the phosphorous flame retardant business.  The cash outlay related to this exit is expected to be in the $5 to $15 million range with a payback in approximately one year.  ","Earning wise, full year 2013 should benefit by somewhere between $0.10 and $0.13 per share from this action.  We have a history of managing assets that are not meeting our performance targets and our sites in Avonmouth and Nanjing were disadvantage from a location, scale and product mix standpoint.  The charges taken should be sufficient to cover all exit costs and this decision will not impact our ability to achieve 2015.  ","Although our recent deep dive portfolio review is complete, you should expect us to remain vigilant to ensure all of our businesses meet the challenging return hurdles that we have set.  I would like to emphasis that we remain committed to Project Gemini, a phosphorous based flame retardant with applications in high end servers and other attractive markets.  In fact, we\u2019re scheduled to launch our Project Gemini project towards the end of this year.  Shutting down Nanjing and Avonmouth will have no impact on our ability to launch or grow this exciting new proprietary technology.","With regard to our major capital projects we continue to proceed with the first two phases of our bromine expansion in Jordan.  The initial phase for the bromine expansion should be completed this summer and will double the elemental bromine capacity in Jordan.  While the second phase which will double capacity for completion fluids in HBr is also on track for completion by year end.  However, we have recently decided to delay the third and final phase of the expansion which would double our tetrabromide capacity.  ","Since we first announced this expansion project last spring we have consistently reiterated our commitment to being good stewards of bromine and to bring this capacity online as needed to meet market demands.  At this point it appears that the long range forecasted demand for brominated derivatives can be supplied by the current bromine balances in Magnolia and Jordan.  Of course, we retain maximum strategic flexibility and a competitive advantage as the only company with readily expandable assets in both of the world\u2019s most prolific bromine producing regions.  We are at a point where the design package for tetrabromide expansion is complete so it\u2019s a logical place to hold.  We will be able to restart the expansion in relatively short order as warranted.  ","With respect to the three performance catalyst solutions related expansions we\u2019ve commenced, the TEA joint venture in Saudi Arabia, the catalyst center in Korea, and the specialty catalyst capacity expansions in the US all are on track, within budget, and projected to come online by year end.  The investment rationale supporting these efforts is quite strong with long running industry and megatrends driving market demand for this capacity.  The US and Korean expansions will allow us to maintain our leading global position in organometallics and advance our competitive positioning within electronic materials.  While the world scale TEA joint venture in Saudi will be the first aluminum alkyl facility in the Middle East satisfying demand and the need for security of supply in that region of the world.  ","Coming into 2012 we knew we\u2019d face a tough year in terms of growth given our exceptional 2011 results and uncertain global economic outlook, price of consumer confidence and questions surrounding rare earth prices.  Six months into the year these headwinds have persisted and we expect to continue effectively managing through them.","During the second quarter we saw a deterioration of certain of the indicators we used to gage the health of the markets our business serve, particularly with respect to electronics.  Among the many indicators we monitor include the IPC book-to-bill ratio which remained above parity at 1.02 [inaudible] but has trended down the past two months.  This contrast with the reading three months ago of 1.04 that has been trended up for three straight months.  ","We also monitor Global Connector Conference as published by The Bishop Report.  Three months ago this report showed a March reading of 65.4 with four straight months of increases.  By contrast the June reading registered 44.1 and has fallen sharply in the past two months.  As a result our current thinking is that the likelihood of a second half electronics recovery has substantially diminished over the past three months.  Instead, a plateau seems more likely as best we can tell at the present time in which case assuming we don\u2019t see further deterioration in these key end markets we would expect second half polymer solution performance levels to resemble the first half rather than show further sequential improvement.","Other indicators for our business continued to show strength and bode well for the balance of the year including international, offshore, and Gulf of Mexico rig counts.  Although, I would note that most recently the deep water rig count in the Gulf was still only 19 versus the 33 deep water rigs that were in service before the BP oil spill.  Refinery margins remain fairly solid in most areas of the world and refinery conversion capacity growth seems to be trending up and to date bromine prices are holding up well.  ","In closing, we\u2019ve previously talked about our expectations for global economic expansion in the second half, that now does not appear to be the case.  As a result, we expect that our businesses will generate earnings for the full year flat to modestly higher than in 2011 and end the year having made further progress towards the strategic goals we outlined as a part of Vision 2015.  This will set us up nicely for 2013 when the impact of the major investments I discussed earlier should become positive contributors to our financial results. ","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to John to discuss our operational performance for the quarter.","John M. Steitz ","I\u2019ll begin with catalyst which reported second quarter net sales of $229 million down 14% year-over-year, segment income of $67 million up 2% year-over-year, and segment margins of 29.3% up 470 basis points year-over-year.  HPC revenues were down $60 million in the second quarter compared to both second quarter of last year and the last quarter.  This is without doubt the reason or the company\u2019s revenue decline this quarter.","We are encouraged that we will have a stronger second half resulting in growth for our HPC business this year.  We are also encouraged by an increasingly sour crude slate and trends of improving global air quality.  For example, recently Russia has instituted a 10 ppm sulfur standard for gasoline and diesel to be in place by the end of 2014 with incentives for early adoption.","FCC fundamentals were quite strong with double digit volume gains compared to a weak second quarter of last year.  We experienced a combination of improved operating rates among certain large US customers along with growth in emerging markets.  Higher base pricing is improving the bottom line and the available crude slate continues to become heavier, more complex, and more inconsistent.  FCC will continue however to face second half top line headwinds due to lower rare earth pricing.  ","Our performance catalyst solutions business continues to deliver strong results year-to-date and during the quarter saw operating profits rise 26% year-over-year, unit volumes up mid single digits year-over-year and profitability step up by 500 basis points.  The PCS division\u2019s results were principally driven by the core polymer catalyst group where operating profits rose over 30% driven by a continuation of long term trends, driving growth including capacity expansions among customers to meet increased demand for plastics in developing markets in particular and continued conversion in capacity among customers in developed markets working towards higher value specialty plastics which require our high performing metallocene activators.  ","Moving on to polymer solutions, we were pleased to see a continued profit recovery in this business and broad based sequential volume growth across most end markets.  Net sales for the quarter of $247 million were down 15% year-over-year and rose 8% quarter-on-quarter while segment income of $64 million was down 17% year-over-year compared to a record but rose 20% versus the prior quarter.  Although the first half year-over-year comparisons have not shown gains given the strength of the comparable period, sequential volume and profit gains were fairly broad based across our fire safety portfolio with connectors, wire and cable, and the construction end markets exhibiting a good tone while printed wiring board demand, which impacts our tetrabrome sales remains sluggish.","As a result overall, while brominated flame retardant sales and operating profits were down 17% year-over-year respectively, they rose 11% and 19% sequentially and mineral flame retardant profits were also stronger sequentially up nearly 20% as strength in Asia and the Middle East offset softer European construction and automotive end markets.  ","As we enter the third quarter, the July order book trends indicate an improvement over last year.  Overall it appears to support our current view that volumes are more likely to be flat to up modestly in the third quarter.  We remain focused on closely tracking our customer needs and managing our cash employed.  ","Fine chemistry has established an impressive growth and profitability pace year-to-date and generated record net sales of $209 million this quarter, up 13% year-over-year and record segment income of $44 million up 17% year-over-year.  Segment margins of 21% also represented an all time record and were up 80 basis points year-over-year.  Fine chemistry services results were particularly strong with sales up 33% and operating profits up 67% while performance chemicals sales were  up 5% and operating profits down 5% from last year\u2019s record quarter for this division.","The outstanding year-over-year growth in fine chemistry services was mainly driven by record custom service profits which nearly doubled year-over-year.  New contracts and growth of existing contracts across high viscosity lubricants, ag intermediates, and specialty pharma contributed to this growth.  Upside was also attributable to increased demand for our NBPT product for use as a fertilizer stabilizer.  Overall, the level of inquiries and estimated size of our current pipeline has never been higher within fine chemistry services which bodes well for the balance of the year and 2013.","Performance chemical strivers this quarter included sequential improvement in clear brine fluid volumes which continued gaining momentum as international offshore rig counts remain at healthy levels.  Growth remains biased towards developing markets while the eventual tailwind of a rejuvenated Gulf of Mexico is still expected to be more second half weighted.  This division also benefited from record performance within our specialty bromine derivatives portfolio reflecting excellent growth and in some instances new product traction across our food safety, water treatment, and industrial cleaning businesses.","We entered 2012 with the view that fine chemistry would deliver the greatest percentage earnings growth among all of our GBUs.  The business has certainly delivered through the first half and maintains a positive outlook for the balance of the year.  With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Scott to discuss our financial results in greater detail.","Scott A. Tozier ","In light of the current environment, we are pleased to have delivered first half financial results that show improved earnings generation and profitability levels year-over-year with operating profits and EBITDA excluding specialty items up low single digits and profitability as measured by EBITDA margins up 244 basis points to 26.4%.  ","Let me start by highlighting a few P&L items.  R&D expense is up 6% year-over-year through the first half of the year reflecting our investment in organic growth opportunities including the strategic adjacency initiatives we have outlined as part of Vision 2015.  As a percent of revenue, R&D costs were up 25 basis points to 2.9% versus 2.6% for the comparable period in 2011.  Through six months, SG&A expense is down slightly on a year-over-year basis principally driven by lower personal related costs and sales commissions.  Year-to-date as a percentage of sales these costs are up slightly by 28 basis points to 11.1%.","Pension expense has risen over $5 million year-to-date on a year-over-year basis due to a decline in the discount rate used to measure our pension obligations and lower than forecasted asset performance in 2011.  We continue to expect pension expenses to rise roughly $20 million on an annualized basis this year as we have noted throughout the year.  However, our funded status remains quite strong, nearly 100% and we do not expect to need to make any meaningful cash contributes to our plans until 2014 at the earliest.  ","Our effective tax rate for the quarter excluding specials was 26% up 430 basis points compared with the year ago rate of 21.7% driven primarily by increased profitability at higher tax rate countries, most notably in the US, and changes in tax regulations.  At this time we continue to expect our full year rate excluding specials to be around 25.7%.  ","Finally, from a foreign exchange standpoint we estimate that year-to-date the strengthening of the dollar primarily against the Euro has resulted in approximately a $15 million lower revenue and $2 million lower operating profits.  If it persists near current levels through the end of 2012 we estimate that the second half impact would be on the order of approximately $35 million lower revenue and $5 million lower operating profit.  ","Although EBITDA excluding special items grew during the quarter, cash generation slowed due to higher working capital levels.  Specifically net working capital rose $55 million during the quarter and is up $94 million versus yearend or 18% due to higher inventory levels built in anticipation of increased market demand and plant shutdowns due to turnaround and cap ex projects particularly in HPC catalyst and flame retardants.  We also saw higher accounts receivable levels given our strong June sales.  ","Net working capital was 21% of revenue at quarter end down 155 basis points year-over-year but up 358 basis points from year end.  With our expectations for second half recovery having been revised we will tightly manage inventory levels through the balance of the year to reflect end market realities.  This may result in some decree of lower factory utilization vis-\u00e0-vis our prior second half expectations.  ","Receivables remain good quality with our past dues at only 8% and of note, our European customers are paying on time with no indication that this trend will change.  Overall, our balance sheet remains in excellent shape with net debt of $274 million excluding $19 million in non-guaranteed debt from our JBC joint venture.  This is up $58 million quarter-over-quarter mainly due to the higher working capital.  ","Net debt to EBITDA ended the period at only .4 times and net debt to cap was 14%.  Our strong cash and low leverage continue to give us options and tremendous flexibility as we work towards Vision 2015.  Free cash flow defined as cash flow from operations adding back pension and close retirement contributions and subtracting capital expenditures was $63 million through the first six months excluding special items, down $71 million year-over-year due to a combination of the higher working capital and higher cap ex.   ","Specifically cash from operations to date of $190 million is down $12 million year-over-year or 6% mainly due to higher working capital spending.  While cap ex to date of $127 million is up $59 million year-over-year reflecting continued investment in the major strategic projects we\u2019ve commenced in South Korea, Jordan and here in the US.  With the delayed third phase of the Jordanian expansion, we now expect cap ex to be approximately $275 million for 2012 with roughly $75 million attributable to that expansion.  ","Finally, we made $18 million in dividend payments during the quarter, up 19% year-over-year and completed $14 million in share repurchases.  With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Lorin for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","","(Operator Instructions)  Your first question comes from David Begleiter \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities.","David Begleiter \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities","With respect to your lower guidance can you go through by segment where the biggest deltas are versus what you gave us back in April?","Luther C. Kissam, IV ","I think if you really look at catalyst we\u2019ve got really tough comp and we talked about 80\/80\/80 if you remember that, those were the kind of numbers and I think as we build back towards the fourth quarter we\u2019ll get there.  I think we\u2019ll be a little bit lower than that in the third, hopefully we can work to get up there but we\u2019ll be lower in the third and probably at that or above in the fourth as we build on that HPC volume back.  I think that we\u2019ll also see \u2013 I\u2019m confident in fine chemical\u2019s ability to be around that 40 range and then it remains to be seen what\u2019s going to happen with polymers.","We\u2019re seeing a different \u2013 if you listen to my comments, we\u2019re seeing different end market movements and the trends are different than they were in the first quarter so it remains to be seen what kind of that recovery is.  We think it\u2019s going to be flat rather than continue the sequential improvement so I think the polymers would probably be closer to what it is the first half and we wouldn\u2019t see that continued sequential growth.","David Begleiter \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities","John, with respect to bromine [F4] pricing, I know the deck says overall pricing is holding.  I know stock pricing for bromines have been a little bit weaker.  Any signs of weakness in your bromine [F4] pricing even in pockets?","John M. Steitz ","Let me give you a little commentary on that because overall it\u2019s a very positive story for us.  If you look at the entire brominated flame retardant portfolio, prices are up both year-over-year and sequentially here over 10%.  If you strip out tetrabrome our prices are up year-over-year just under 20%.  So I think we\u2019re really positioning the business very well when volume resumes at more normalized levels.  Tetrabrome is down a little bit sequentially but we\u2019re talking in the 2% to 3% range so it\u2019s really held up very, very well.","David Begleiter \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities","FCC I know was a weak quarter a year ago, but are you gaining any share in FCCs?","John M. Steitz ","I think to answer your question, no.  I think our particular situation if you compare it to last year, we had a number of large customers who had significant down time and that really affected our volumes last year.  So we\u2019re seeing now positive trends year-over-year for certain and normal seasonal sequential improvements as well.  I think the overall market is being aided a bit by this ethanol situation related corn too.  I think there\u2019s a higher amount of gasoline and diesel from petroleum basis rather than a lot of the ethanol that had been used previously.","Operator","","Your next question comes from PJ Juvekar \u2013 Citi.","PJ Juvekar \u2013 Citi","In catalyst your top line was down 14% but margins were up.  Can you just discuss how much of the top line was from lower HPC volumes and lower rare earth prices?","John M. Steitz ","Really if you look at the decline both sequentially and year-over-year it\u2019s really all HPC.  With HPC we had a unique set of circumstances.  We had metal prices declining, that was part of it.  We had an exceptionally profitable order go out in the second quarter of last year so mix was a bit of an issue for us and then we had volume declines year-over-year.  We also had a pretty good size order slip because of some bureaucratic issues in the Middle East, slipped into July.  But it is really all HPC.  ","Now, FCC we did have rare earth indexing on the pricing impact and my guess is that\u2019s between $10 and $15 million of year-over-year declines so hopefully that kind of frames it up for you.  But, overall we\u2019re very pleased with the margin holding up at 29% plus so that was very positive and I think positions us well for the future.","PJ Juvekar \u2013 Citi","Would you say that your margins in HPC and FCC are comparable at this point?  ","John M. Steitz ","Yes, I\u2019d say that all three businesses in our catalyst portfolio have comparable margins at this point.","PJ Juvekar \u2013 Citi","Just on bromine in electronics, I know you don\u2019t sell much in bromine but can you tell us what\u2019s happening to [merchant] bromine prices in China and then what\u2019s happening to clear brine\u2019s pricing?","John M. Steitz ","Pricing in China is down a bit compared to where it was last year.  Our elemental bromine pricing is heading very steady around $4,000 a ton so again, I think we\u2019re positioned when we see some volume improvement across the portfolio.  In clear brines we\u2019ve had some really nice traction in terms of pricing.  Year-over-year pricing is up by 14% and sequentially about 10% so once again positioned very well for continued improvement.","Operator","","Your next question comes from Laurence Alexander \u2013 Jefferies & Co.","Laurence Alexander \u2013 Jefferies & Co.","I guess two questions, first how much of an earnings headwind do you think you will get in the back half of the year from better working capital management and how much do you expect to reduce your working capital?","Luther C. Kissam, IV ","It\u2019s always difficult to say exactly what we\u2019re going to get a headwind from a volume variance because that\u2019s what we\u2019re talking about.  If you look at that range it can be somewhere in the range from anywhere from $20 to $35 million kind of range of a volume variance in the second half for us to manage to the working capital levels that we think are appropriate going forward.  I\u2019d say that part of that \u2013 I have to be mindful that in HPC catalyst where we\u2019ve built some inventory that was done and it has to be done to meet the fourth quarter demand as well as the first quarter of 2013 demand because we\u2019ve got some turnarounds at our own units and we\u2019ve got some capital projects that are going to benefit us in the long run to give us more flexibility in those assets. ","We knew those units were going to be down.  We always anticipated that we were going to be building that inventory and that it would be worked down over the course of the fourth quarter. W e were also, if you remember, end of the first quarter thought we were going to have an increase in the electronic demand, that\u2019s where the indices were tracking, we now see that so where it\u2019s going to hit us really is going to be in polymers and maybe a little ripple back into fine chemicals for the bromine production.  But that would be the kind of range that we think we\u2019ll see in the second half. ","Laurence Alexander \u2013 Jefferies & Co.","Can you speak a little bit about trends in curatives and stabilizers and whether you think there\u2019s going to be any destocking [inaudible] in the back half?","John M. Steitz ","Stabilizers and curatives, I think we\u2019re in a really good position on curatives.  If you look at the business sequentially volumes were up sequentially about 10% which is a good sign.  I think we went through a fair amount of destocking in additives in the back half of last year so we always had a view that we could grow the business year-over-year this year in both stabilizers and curatives and that\u2019s still our projection it hasn\u2019t changed.  So I think we\u2019re pretty well positioned there and have worked through the destocking issues of the back half of last year.","Operator","","Your next question comes from Analyst for Robert Koort \u2013 Goldman Sachs.","Analyst for Robert Koort \u2013 Goldman Sachs","I had a question on the fine chemistry, were the positive trends you saw in the quarter pretty consistent month-to-month or were there any changes?","John M. Steitz ","No, I\u2019d say pretty consistent.  It\u2019s a business that we can predict with a fair amount of accuracy.  The only exception to that is clear brines tends to be fairly lumpy but I think that was more heavily weighted in June compared to the other months.  Then fine chemistry services was pretty steady.  Our ag businesses, specialty ag and the NBPT product pretty steady through the course of the quarter.  This BioTerra drug, small pox drug for SIGA was pretty much we may produce that through the course of the quarter and made more shipments in June, but we had always expected that so pretty steady in that business.","Analyst for Robert Koort \u2013 Goldman Sachs","How would things have looked without the huge driver from the clear brine fluids?","John M. Steitz ","Oh, I thought one of the real bright spots was our fine chemistry services business and especially custom services so I think they\u2019re very equally proportioned this quarter.","Operator","","Your next question comes from Kevin McCarthy \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kevin McCarthy \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just to follow up on fine chemistry services would you expect profit in that business in the back half of the year to be flat, down, or up relative to the front half of 2012?","John M. Steitz ","I\u2019d say it\u2019s pretty steady compared to first half.  We have a heavier orientation towards some ag intermediates that begins in September\/October and that business is continuing to do pretty well and I know you\u2019re very familiar with drought and the corn issues and I think farmers are trying to do anything they can to hold these crops in line, especially corn.  We\u2019re seeing a pretty strong specialty ag and ag intermediates business and the NBPT product that we do for a fantastic company who is really driving it globally, is a great insurance policy in drought conditions and we\u2019re seeing that product really grow around the world.  As a matter of fact, we\u2019re working on our third expansion which will include a new plant for that business so we\u2019re very excited about it overall.","Kevin McCarthy \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","If I may shift gears to catalyst, with regard to HPC it sounds like you\u2019ve maintained share and have a fairly positive outlook in that product line for the back half of the year so is it the case that the Q2 volume weakness was strictly a function of order timing and customer maintenance schedules or has there been in your view any structural change with regard to the level of competitive intensity?","Luther C. Kissam, IV ","I don\u2019t think there\u2019s been any competitive change to the level of the intensity.  I think it really was, as I tried to say in my comments, where we were the incumbent we won what we expected to win, where we weren\u2019t the incumbent we picked up a little bit and so overall we won the units that we expected to win and we would have hoped to pick up some other ones where we weren\u2019t the incumbent but we didn\u2019t.  So I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any change in the dynamic, I don\u2019t believe the market share has changed at all.  I think we\u2019re winning the units where we\u2019re the incumbents and where we\u2019re not just like we\u2019ve always said it\u2019s a tough slate to get in there.","I feel strong about this business.  If you look at the fourth quarter we\u2019re going to be building \u2013 I don\u2019t know if fourth quarter is going to be a record but I think it\u2019s going to be close.  I feel like you\u2019re going to see two bookings in the first and fourth quarter of HPC volumes for the year that are going to be really really strong, second is going to be weaker and we\u2019re going to build in the third towards that record in the fourth.","Kevin McCarthy \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","A final one if I may, just a quick update on your lithium extraction project in Arkansas?","Luther C. Kissam, IV ","We talked about it the last time we\u2019re working on a new technology that could be a game changer for us in terms of cost, if we can get it to the cost place where we need to be.  We\u2019re  conducting those experiments in the lab in pilot scale and as always we\u2019re finding a little bit of problems that we weren\u2019t quite sure about but we\u2019re working through those and we\u2019re making nice progress and I think we\u2019re still on track for getting to the market in that 2014\/2015 time frame that we\u2019ve talked about.","Operator","","Your next question comes from Mike Ritzenthaler \u2013 Piper Jaffray.","Mike Ritzenthaler \u2013 Piper Jaffray","My first question, I just want to make sure I have something correct around the strength in fine chemistry.  Would it be correct to say that the clear brines have yet to see a real resurgence after a mediocre start to the year?","John M. Steitz ","That\u2019s dead on.  We saw sequential improvement but it\u2019s still a ways away from some of the record sales levels we\u2019ve had and so you\u2019re dead on there."," ","Mike Ritzenthaler \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Then just on the rig counts and things like that, does this resurgence, does it bode well for the timing of the phase two start up later this year for JBC? ","Luther C. Kissam, IV ","Yes.","John M. Steitz ","I was just going to say that I think that positions us very well for the long term especially with the global diversity of that business.","Mike Ritzenthaler \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Then just within polymer solutions, I\u2019d like to explore the lower charges for the non-controlling interest in JBC.  I guess I\u2019m a little confused about what that is and kind of the magnitude of the impact on operating income.  ","Scott A. Tozier ","This is related to our overall production levels within JBC being lower on a year-over-year basis.  Remember last year we had a record first half production and obviously this year we\u2019re still coming out of that trough and as a result of that the minority interest that goes to our equity partner is lower than prior year.","Operator","","Your next question comes from Jeffery Zekauskas \u2013 JP Morgan.","Jeffery Zekauskas \u2013 JP Morgan","Obviously ethylene prices and oil prices have come down which would influence the prices of the polymers you blend your flame retardants into and presumably your customer base would really want to decrease its inventory level so that it buys its polymers more cheaply.  Is that something that\u2019s affecting your bromine profile and do you disentangle that from your macro indicators that are showing weakness?","Scott A. Tozier ","Let me take a crack at that and also just add a little commentary about our raw material and energy situation today.  In 2012 compared to 2011 we\u2019re seeing roughly about $105 million of raw material and energy decreases.  About $10 million of that is energy, natural gas and utility related, another $85 of that is metals and rare earth.  So it\u2019s earth, moly, cobalt and nickel and then you have the balances is about $10 which is all petrochemical, benzene, phenol related.  Hopefully that kind of corrals it for you.  It\u2019s not as great for us as it would seem right now.","But to your question though, when I look at, and everybody has an opinion on that but when I look at the book-to-bill ratio in electronics being reasonable steady and then when I look at The Bishop Index which is a confidence index it has gone down dramatically so my view is that there is a fair amount of destocking going on also in our supply chain to answer your question.  So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s as much raw material related as more just confidence and uncertainty.","Jeffery Zekauskas \u2013 JP Morgan","Can you give us an update on bromine uses for mercury removal both in the US and China?  And, are you selling any material amount of product at this juncture and how do you see the next 12 months playing out?","Scott A. Tozier ","Our mercury control business right now is still a very niche business.  Our volumes are up both year-over-year and sequentially low double digit so it\u2019s doing pretty well and it\u2019s still though in those states that have regulations around mercury levels.  We\u2019re still hopeful over the long haul that it will grow but as you know there\u2019s a lot of pressure on coal and coal production is down dramatically so we\u2019ve got to keep a close eye on it.  The fascinating thing to me is it\u2019s such a cost effective economical solution for these utilities and so we\u2019re continuing to work that side of it long term.","Luther C. Kissam, IV ","I haven\u2019t heard any update from the case that was filed against the EPA on the regulations related to mercury removal so the status hasn\u2019t changed since the first quarter and I think there\u2019s some uncertainty whether that will push the implementation time back some for the implementation of those regs.  China still seems to be, as we talked in the first quarter, where they have been testing different products and understanding mercury emissions from the coal power plant.  That\u2019s obviously the biggest opportunity and we haven\u2019t seen a change in that.  Over the next 12 months while I would expect to still see moderate growth I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to see any kind of step out until you get federal regulations being implemented as well as regulations in China being implemented so it may be pushed back a little bit but nothing has fundamentally changed from where we were on the last call.","Jeffery Zekauskas \u2013 JP Morgan","Which market do you think will open up first for you the US or China?","Luther C. Kissam, IV ","That\u2019s a really interesting question given the US court systems.  I would anticipate that the US would open up sooner and I think with China you have to see what the next five year plan is and if they make that a priority or not.  It would seem to me all indications are that they would but I still think the US will beat them by a little bit.","Jeffery Zekauskas \u2013 JP Morgan","Lastly, in the previous conference call you seemed very optimistic about your opportunities to make acquisitions and acquisitions of some size.  Do you continue to be optimistic on that front or how do you see the acquisition environment?","Luther C. Kissam, IV ","What I said about acquisitions is there are opportunities out there, multiples are high and there are a lot of bidders.  So again, as I said at the investor day while we\u2019ll be looking for acquisitions we certainly are out there in the market place doing it, they\u2019re difficult to do.  We\u2019ve got to make sure we do the right one and I\u2019d much rather be on this call in 2016 explaining why we fell short in doubling the business because we didn\u2019t do an acquisition than on this call explaining why we did a bad acquisition.  We\u2019re going to remain diligent in looking for opportunities to return value to our shareholders but we\u2019re not going to reach to try and do a bad deal.","Operator","","Your next question comes from Michael Sison \u2013 Keybanc Capital Markets.","Michael Sison \u2013 Keybanc Capital Markets","","In terms of bromine operating rates where did you end up in the second quarter?  When you think about the third and the fourth given your outlook of second half being similar to the first half, does that operating rate go down, stay flat?  Can you sort of give us a feel on that?","Luther C. Kissam, IV ","I\u2019m talking now from a bromine standpoint, an elemental bromine standpoint we were in that mid 70s range, 70s to 80s range and I would expect that to kind of last for the remainder of the year.","Michael Sison \u2013 Keybanc Capital Markets","And the derivative?","Luther C. Kissam, IV ","The derivatives if you look at our performance chemicals they\u2019d have been operating at higher rates than that and if you look at brominated flame retardants they would have been operating at a lower rate than that but you\u2019ve got to really look \u2013 you\u2019ve got to understand it product-by-product almost so when John talked about tetrabrome volumes being down, when tetrabrome is not running hard which we didn\u2019t, it has a fairly significant impact on those operating rates so we were down below that for overall brominated flame retardants but tetrabrome was the leader in that.","Michael Sison \u2013 Keybanc Capital Markets","When you think about your confidence in the outlook that electronics stays sort of flat versus let\u2019s say getting worse, can you give us a feel are your customers telling you that or are inventory levels fairly lean that give you some confidence there?  Given where some of the semis have reported it seems like a bold forecast so far.","Scott A. Tozier ","I think our customers are running very lean inventories because of the uncertainty you just described.  If I look at connectors volumes have been fairly sluggish.  Our AD10 business primarily into enclosures and TVs has been what I described as moderate and tetrabrome has been pretty weak.  I think the tetrabrome inventories is really the first to go down and the first to come up and both situations usually happen very rapidly so we\u2019re really trying to keep a close eye on it.  But, once we see tetrabrome volumes pick up that will be I think a good indicator for us.","Michael Sison \u2013 Keybanc Capital Markets","Last question, you have a lot of capacity coming on into \u201913 and some other positives, can you give us some of the areas you see in \u201913 that is relatively visible for you as we close out the year?","Luther C. Kissam, IV ","If I look at 2013 going forward from a growth standpoint I think fine chemistry will continue to grow.  We\u2019ve got some big opportunities from custom manufacturing. You\u2019ll see the rig count in the Gulf of Mexico picking up and that should allow that lag time for when they are going to complete that well [inaudible] for our fluid completion business so I see fine chemistry continuing to grow year-over-year in 2013.  Catalyst should have a step out year in 2013.  We\u2019ve got the TEA joint venture coming online in Saudi, we\u2019ve got the Greenfield site coming online in Yeosu City Korea that gives us opportunity for customer manufacturing from a single site catalyst as well as electronic materials growth in that area of the world.  ","Our HPC business should start off the year strong in 2013 and we\u2019ve got what I believe will be a number of repeat [fills] and we\u2019ll be past all of this rare surcharges and we continue to see strong growth in our FCC business.  I think those two businesses particular have some strong growth.  John, do you have something to add?","John M. Steitz ","I\u2019m just going to add a couple of things.  We\u2019ve got a biodiesel refill next year and we\u2019ve just landed a order for some new technology for a new refinery that helps avoid the use of HF through catalysts.  This is in Asia and it\u2019s a big order and we\u2019re really excited about it.  I really think, just to reinforce what [Lu] said, 2014 can be a step out year for us.","Operator","","Your next question comes from Steven Schwartz \u2013 First Analysis Corp.","Steven Schwartz \u2013 First Analysis Corp.","The first question just around HPC, what are your current growth expectations for volume this year?  I think prior you have expected in mid single digits?","John M. Steitz ","We\u2019re still hoping to achieve that mid single digits.","Steven Schwartz \u2013 First Analysis Corp.","[Lu], when you mentioned fourth quarter could be a record in HPC is that just for fourth quarter given the seasonality that sometimes exists there or could it be even stronger than the first quarter you had this year which was I think exceptionally strong?","Luther C. Kissam, IV ","We\u2019re looking at numbers and if everything breaks right we could be looking at first quarter 2012 type numbers.","Steven Schwartz \u2013 First Analysis Corp.","Then just lastly, regarding SG&A and in the press release you mentioned performance based incentive compensation and perhaps this is a question for Scott, but I know you guys basically look at your potential performance for the year and then you accrue that compensation across the year.  What was your assumption for that expense in the first quarter and what is your assumption for 2012 now?","Scott A. Tozier ","Right now for between first quarter and second quarter we\u2019re holding our expectation on that accrual at target so really limited change in that outlook.","John M. Steitz ","And as our headcount goes up and down it gets adjusted.  Then I\u2019d add that the bigger impact was on commissions and that\u2019s almost directly related to HPC volumes.","Steven Schwartz \u2013 First Analysis Corp.","So can you give us some guidance on corporate expense for the second half of the year and in line with that what SG&A might look like?","Scott A. Tozier ","Corporate expense should be probably back in the low 20 range so I\u2019d call it $20 to $22 million.  Then I would expect SG&A to be in that $80 to $82 million range for the third and fourth quarter.","Operator","","Your next question comes from Dmitry Silversteyn \u2013 Longbow Research.","Dmitry Silversteyn \u2013 Longbow Research","I was just wondering if you can provide a little bit of a detailed breakdown in each of the businesses between price, volume, and mix?  I mean you talked about the individual moving pieces kind of within each business but it\u2019s still hard for me to come out to sort of an overall divisional volume versus price versus foreign exchange component.","Luther C. Kissam, IV ","Let me start and then I\u2019m going to turn it over to John.  In our business it is exceptionally difficult to talk about price and volume and that mix, that mixes impact on volume.  If you look at for instance in fine chemistry, even within fine chemistry we can have a clear brine which is a high volume can move the volume one way or not but we\u2019re also selling fine chemistry service which is for a lot of money per kilo or a lot of money per gram so it\u2019s not as meaningful as you have in certain commodities where you have similar types of volumes and that.  ","In polymer solutions where you\u2019ve got mineral flame retardants with a much higher volume than brominated flame retardants with a much higher volume than brominated flame retardants but brominated flame retardants is more profitable.  It\u2019s the same thing in catalyst but with that John will give it a shot.","John M. Steitz ","I think it\u2019s more important to think sequentially but if you want some year-over-year numbers I\u2019ll try to go into that but I\u2019ll try and answer your question very quickly.  Fine chemicals unit volume was actually up in the 5% to 6% range.","Dmitry Silversteyn \u2013 Longbow Research","That\u2019s sequentially?","John M. Steitz ","Sequentially, right.  Performance chemicals was kind of an important driver there with more improved volumes in clear brines.  We had our intermediates business as I said was reasonably strong too in the second quarter compared to the first.  That was also aided by the mix with our custom services business some of which as [Lu] pointed out have very little unit volume so it was aided by that mix. In polymers you know you had actual unit volume up about 4% but what\u2019s interesting is if I strip out phosphorous flame retardants out of that equation our unit volume was actually up about 6% so it\u2019s not as bad as it seems alright.  That was aided by mix because compared to the first quarter our bromine business, as I mentioned in terms of pricing held in there pretty well.","In catalyst volumes sequentially were down a bit and that was all HPC so that has both a mix and an actual unit volume impact because FCC was up sequentially about 4% or 5%.  Hopefully, that kind of frames it up for you.  Performance catalyst solution was roughly flat up nicely year-over-year.  ","Dmitry Silversteyn \u2013 Longbow Research","It\u2019s really down a little bit more in the polymer solutions business probably one of your more complex businesses when it comes to the different market exposures that they have.  Can you talk about volume and pricing in a little bit more detail?  I mean, you mentioned connectors and automotive markets being okay and printed volume board market being down a little bit so can you give us a little of detail of the difference between brominated flame retardants and mineral, curatives, antioxidants and also talk about what you\u2019re seeing in terms of pricing trends and if your outlook is significantly different for the second half of the year than what the performance was in the first half?","John M. Steitz ","Brominated flame retardants were up a little bit sequentially which was we think pretty good.  It was down year-over-year pretty significantly.  Last year in the first half I mean, it was really overheated in my opinion.  We were selling at record volumes and producing at record volumes but on the encouraging side both sequentially and year-over-year brominated flame retardant pricing for the whole portfolio was up 10%.  ","In mineral flame retardants it was roughly flat year-over-year but volumes were up by 5% sequentially.  Pricing was down in that business but mostly euro related.  There has been a lot of stability in our two key product lines here in our polymers business in terms of pricing.  As I mentioned the phosphorous flame retardants getting that out of the portfolio will be a nice upside for us for next year and that volume by the way was down pretty significantly year-over-year as we exit that enterprise.","Stabilizers and curatives pricing flat up a little bit year-over-year so it\u2019s flat sequentially up a little bit year-over-year and volumes were roughly flat year-over-year but up nicely about 10% sequentially.  Hopefully that gives you a little bit of flavor for it.","Dmitry Silversteyn \u2013 Longbow Research","As you move from being organometallics and zeolites supplier to becoming more of a polymerization, finished polymerization polymers supplier.  This market has established players in it and as you get bigger in it do you expect to see kind of a competitive response or maybe you\u2019re already seeing a competitive response either from the majors [inaudible] technology or some of your catalyst merchant competitors out there?","John M. Steitz ","No, I really don\u2019t.  You work at such an intimate relationship between the supplier and customer on this basis.  Pricing is very unique to the application.  We\u2019ve done a fair amount of licensing with some of the majors to expand our portfolio and then to expand into the high purity metal organics is a perfect adjacency for us.  That pricing by the way, is priced on a per gram basis not a per kilo basis.  As that market really picks up and this LED market really grows I think we\u2019re going to be in a really good position.  The last thing I\u2019d say about that LED market is the pricing for the end products has come down so dramatically I think we\u2019ll begin to see a lot more volume growth globally in that business.  So I think with Korea coming up we\u2019ll be really well positioned for it.","Operator","","Your next question comes from Edward Yang \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.","Edward Yang \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.","Just on polymer solutions and tetrabrome, tetrabrome really didn\u2019t see any recovery in the first quarter and was fairly weak this quarter as well so what kind of accounts for that relative weakness?","John M. Steitz ","To me, and you know these indices awfully well, the book-to-bill ratio has held in there but that confidence index has gone down and this is a product line where a customer is pretty comfortable with the supply chains around the world so they can fairly dramatically increase their off take if they need and so intends to be I\u2019d say more volatile than most of our other businesses.  I believe that there\u2019s been a lot of destocking this year as opposed to last year at this time where there could have been a fair amount of overstocking if you will.","Edward Yang \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.","How confident are you that destocking has run its course? Your outlook for polymer solutions in general is for flattening out or plateau but historically that business has been kind of up a lot or down.","John M. Steitz ","We\u2019re just anticipating kind of flat to slightly improving volumes in the third quarter.  We feel pretty confident in our ability to hit that so I think it\u2019s a far different situation compared to last year at this time where most of the issues at least for us related to mineral flame retardant volumes and in Europe we saw the typical seasonal slowdown at this time of the year but with all the Italian, and Greece, and Spain issues last year hitting a real crescendo we saw the confidence factor of our customers continuing to decline and we had a lot of destocking in that business in the back half so we don\u2019t see that happening.  That order book in that business continues to hold up pretty well.  To answer your question I think our confidence level is moderate to reasonably high that we can achieve what we told you today.","Edward Yang \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.","On the tetrabrome side is there any impact from structural issues PCs to tablets, or Smartphones or anything like that?","John M. Steitz ","I really don\u2019t believe there\u2019s been any secular issues like that.  It\u2019s such a global economy, tetrabrome is so cost effective in these applications the newer niche products has a very small penetration to date.  We\u2019re talking 5% to 6% of the total tetrabrome market so we\u2019re not hearing any of that issue from our customer.  But with that said we\u2019re excited about introducing our new Gemini generation of products and for us that would be an entry into the real high end Apple iPad type of market so we\u2019re excited about that.","Edward Yang \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.","Just finally on catalyst it sounds like you\u2019re expecting some pricing pressure degradation in the second half mostly related to rare earth.  Is that all going to be just tied to rare earth\u2019s pricing and what would be the magnitude of the price declines or pressures you\u2019d see from that?","John M. Steitz ","A great question, in the last quarter we saw about $12 to $15 million in decline in the second quarter.  We\u2019re probably looking somewhere in the $7 to $10 million decline in the third quarter but we\u2019re working to offset that by other cost reduction activities, base price increases, really based on performance and overall lowering the rare earth percentages in our formulations.  So with that we really hope we can moderate any additional profit hit this year and really set the stage for a robust 2013 so we\u2019re excited about that.","Operator","","Your final question comes from Christopher Shaw \u2013 Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co.","Christopher Shaw \u2013 Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co.","Just a quick one, I was just looking for a little more color on FCC in terms of you spoke a little bit of the geographies and that US operating rates were up and emerging markets were strong but why were the operating rates up in the US?  Do you know why?  And then just a little more color on what countries were strong and maybe what Europe was doing?","John M. Steitz ","FCC last year in the first half we had a couple of major customers who were operating at really, really low rates, they were really struggling both on the east coast and in the southwest.  It really hurt our volumes last year at this time.  With that said, the obvious suspects in terms of your question still exist, Europe continues to be slow but it\u2019s offset with some growth in India and the Middle East and then, this might be a little bit surprising but our Asian customer base continues to do quite well as they continue to build their petrochemical based business.  So our higher propylene yield catalyst in FCC continued to do pretty well.","Lorin Crenshaw","At this time we\u2019d like to thank everyone for their interest and encourage you to call with any further questions.","Operator","","Thank you for your participation in today\u2019s conference.

I'll start with some high-level comments on the quarter and then provide some perspective on the proposed Rockwood transaction. Scott will review the performance of our business segments and financial results, and I will end by providing perspective on our current outlook. At the end of our prepared remarks, Matt and Michael will join us to address your questions.","Second quarter results exceeded our expectations heading into our quarter with net income of $86.8 million or $1.10 per share, up 10% from the second quarter of last year and up 11% sequentially. Net sales were $605 million, up 5% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. EBITDA was $145 million, up 11% year-over-year and 6% sequentially. And second quarter EBITDA margins were 24%. Scott will go into the details, but this solid performance was driven mainly by Catalyst Solutions, reflecting better-than-expected customer demand across the segment and higher FCC operating rates in anticipation of a planned August turnaround at our Bayport FCC unit. The strength in catalyst offset Performance Chemicals results, where sales and profits declined year-over-year, mostly due to softer-than-expected clear completion volumes.","Overall, we were pleased with the results of the quarter and solid first half with sales growth of 4% and segment margins of 23%, up slightly from the first 6 months of last year.","On July 15, we announced an agreement to acquire Rockwood Holdings in a $6.2 billion transaction. This acquisition is all about growth: Growth that is more consistent and predictable than either company enjoys on its own; growth that will deliver outstanding cash generation and create long-term shareholder value. The deal will create a premier specialty chemical company with #1 or #2 global positions across 4 attractive growth businesses in lithium, bromine, catalyst and surface treatment. Each segment has attractive growth prospects, excellent margins and solid market dynamics. The transaction will bring together 2 groups of employees with a proven track record of delivering market-leading technology, product innovation and customized performance-based solutions for their respective customers.","The shareholder value which we expect to be created in this transaction comes from 4 main areas. First, Albemarle's revenue and earnings growth will be faster, more sustainable, predictable and consistent. The end markets, geographies and applications served by the combined entity are more diverse than either company enjoys today, which will make results less susceptible to a business cycle in any one area. Second, the $100 million in annual cost synergies we will obtain within 2 years. Third, the transaction will be accretive to cash earnings in the first year and accretive to adjusted EPS in the second year. Longer term, the profitability of the combined company will exceed what either company is forecast to deliver on a stand-alone basis. Finally, the combined company will generate stronger free cash flow, enabling us to rapidly reduce our leverage, fund organic growth and return more capital to shareholders in the form of dividend increases and share buybacks.","This transaction creates a much larger company. And while there are benefits to larger scale, such as purchasing leverage, SG&A leverage, enhanced credit ratings and others, this transaction is about much more than just being bigger. This transaction is about creating greater value for our stakeholders. This transaction accelerates growth; diversifies the portfolio; enables predictable, consistent and sustainable growth; and generates the free cash flow necessary to rapidly deleverage and continue returning capital to shareholders, all of which lead to higher shareholder value.","We are confident in our ability to deliver the $100 million in annualized synergies. About half of that total will come from the elimination of duplicate costs that both companies are incurring today. For example, we don't need 2 CEOs or 2 CFOs or 2 general counsels. The remainder will come from a more streamlined organizational structure with fewer layers of management, asset and site consolidations, implementing the best practices of both companies across the whole and leveraging our increased scale to realize improved raw material sourcing.","One example of a synergy that would fall in this latter category is the fact that in Jordan, we self-produce chlorine that we use in the production of bromine. KOH is a by-product of that chlorine production, and KOH is one of the key raw materials purchased by Rockwood's surface treatment business. We believe we can supply JBC KOH to the surface treatment business and improve our overall profitability.","We will follow a 2-in-the-box integration process with employees from Albermarle and Rockwood fully dedicated to the integration team. We have also engaged an experienced third-party in Deloitte Consulting to assist with our integration activities. I am confident our team will not only reach its goal, but it will -- that it will find other areas of cost savings once they become more engaged in the process. Also, we have not included any revenue synergies in our $100 million target, but I am equally confident that there will be those types of opportunities as well.","The final point I would make is that if one looks at prior specialty chemicals deals over the past decade, realized synergies have averaged around 8% of the acquired company's sales. Our $100 million target amounts to just under 7% of Rockwood's projected 2014 sales. That makes our target slightly below the historical average, which makes sense given that these 4 businesses don't have tremendous overlap, and the premise of the deal is growth, not cost savings.","From a capital structure standpoint, we will initially focus on rapidly paying down debt and reducing leverage. Our optimal leverage will likely be in the range of 2x to 2.5x net debt to EBITDA. Our free cash flow forecast calls for us to be well within these levels around 2017, assuming the deal closes in the first quarter of 2015.","As you can tell from our public documents related to the transaction, our debt paydown in 2015 is lower than in either 2016 or 2017. While we expect to generate over $500 million in free cash flow in 2015, a significant portion of that cash flow will be necessary to pay taxes due as a result of the structure of the deal. The structure, however, should allow us to repatriate around $4 billion from outside the U.S., both at closing and going forward. This upfront tax payment allows us to efficiently repatriate the cash necessary to close the transaction, deleverage and ultimately return additional capital to shareholders.","This transaction creates a premier specialty chemicals company with leading market positions and attractive end markets and a combined history of providing industry-leading returns to shareholders. Both companies share a culture of strong innovation and a passion for delivering customized performance-based solutions to meet the ever-increasing demands of our customers.","I am very excited about what the future holds for the combined company and for all our stakeholders. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Scott to discuss this quarter's results in greater detail.","Scott A. Tozier","Thanks, Luke. I'm going to begin by reviewing the financial performance of our 2 business segments and then turn to the details on our P&L and cash flow.","Overall, net sales rose 5% year-over-year to $605 million, and segment income came in at $141 million or 23% of sales, up 12% year-over-year, as strong Catalyst Solutions financial performance offset weaker Performance Chemicals results. Our year-to-date free cash flow was $253 million, triple the performance from 2013 on better working capital results.","From a P&L standpoint, this quarter marks the first time reporting with our antioxidants, propofol and ibuprofen businesses classified as discontinued operations. As previously announced, we have agreed to divest these assets in a transaction that is on track to close this quarter.","During Q2, we took a $60 million after tax or $0.76 per share charge to reduce the carrying value of these assets. And in the coming weeks, we will file an 8-K to recast our 2013 Form 10-K for discontinued operations.","Just to be clear on the quarter, for your models, the revenue and segment income related to discontinued operations are $59 million and $5 million in Q2 2014 and $57 million and $4 million in Q2 of 2013.","We also excluded $3.1 million after-tax or $0.04 per share in acquisition-related costs and a $2.1 million after-tax or $0.03 per share charge related to the write-off of certain cost related to the expansion of a custom services production facility.","Finally, we had a $0.01 per share benefit during the period related to nonoperating pension and OPEB items. These 3 items plus the impact of discontinued operations net to $0.82 per share, which added to the reported EPS of $0.28, gets you to our adjusted EPS of $1.10 for the period.","Turning to the details now. Catalyst reported second quarter net sales of $271 million, up 16% year-over-year and segment income of $68 million, up 56% year-over-year. Segment margins were 25%, up more than 600 basis points versus the second quarter of 2013.","Refinery Catalyst Solutions performed well with double-digit sales growth year-over-year and exceptional profit growth due to substantial margin expansion. Heavy Oil Upgrading results benefited from higher sales, primarily mix driven, and higher production rates ahead of the upcoming August expansion turnaround of our Bayport facility.","Clean Fuels Technologies also had a great quarter with profits up double digits driven by strong volumes and favorable mix.","Performance Catalyst Solutions also reported solid results with double-digit volume growth across finished catalysts and polyolefin catalysts, reflecting an improved tone to the metallocene polyolefin market.","Overall, Catalyst Solutions experienced higher pricing year-over-year with refinery catalyst pricing improvement somewhat offset by lower pricing in Performance Catalyst Solutions.","Performance Chemicals reported second quarter net sales of $334 million, down 3% from year-ago levels; and segment income of $73 million, down 12% year-on-year on segment margins of 22%. Profitability in both Specialty Chemicals and Fire Safety Solutions was down, while Fine Chemistry Services results were improved from 2013.","The lower Specialty Chemicals results were entirely related to customer-specific inventory management on clear brine fluids in the Middle East that resulted in lower-than-expected sales in the quarter. Excluding this impact, we saw no evidence of weakness across any geography. And from our vantage point, underlying deepwater fundamentals remain favorable.","Fire Safety Solutions profit was down mid-single digits year-over-year, largely reflecting weaker pricing and demand associated with HBCD, a flame retardant primarily used in insulation foam, which we are transitioning to an alternative polymeric product, GreenCrest. Across the rest of our brominated flame-retardant portfolio, we continue to see evidence of stabilization year-over-year from both a pricing and volume perspective and order book trends supportive of our view that servers, automotive electronics and other growing digital applications having begun offsetting, though slower, PC and TV enclosure end markets.","Fine Chemistry Services reported solid profit growth year-over-year, driven by double-digit volume growth. The primary driver of favorability in this business related to strong electronic materials driven demand, reflecting broadening acceptance of select consumer electronics in this marketplace. Results also benefited from a onetime payment from a customer as a result of a meet or release presented by that customer. Note that while the second quarter impact was positive, the impact on the balance of the year will reduce custom service profits.","Moving on to a few P&L items. SG&A expenses were $67 million during the quarter, up 9% year-over-year, driven by higher incentive compensation costs and commissions as we continue to accrue for annual incentive based on compensation versus an extremely low payout in 2013.","R&D expense ended the quarter at $22 million, up slightly at 2%. R&D expenses around 3.6% of sales and within our realignment goals to redeploy resources to growth areas.","Free cash flow defined as cash flow from operations, adding back pension contributions and subtracting capital expenditures, was $125 million for the quarter and has risen sharply year-to-date. Through the first half of 2014, free cash flow totaled $253 million, up from $80 million in the year-ago period, driven by a $63 million reduction in working capital versus a use of cash last year and $56 million lower CapEx. As previously announced, our goal is to permanently reduce working capital by at least $100 million by 2015 as part of our broader supply-chain transformation initiative.","I'm happy with the progress made to date with our net working capital rate as a percentage of sales at 23.5%, down over 130 basis points from year-end, nearly halfway to the $100 million goal. However, we do need to show that we can sustain the gains made and continue to make progress in the rest of 2014.","CapEx was only $23 million for the second quarter and totaled $47 million for the first half of 2014, down over 50% year-over-year. With major CapEx expenditures behind us, we expect CapEx to continue tracking toward our prior guidance of $100 million to $125 million for the full year.","From a total shareholder return perspective, we returned approximately $122 million to shareholders this quarter, of which $22 million reflected dividends and $100 million related to executing an accelerated share repurchase program.","With the announcement of the Rockwood acquisition, we have suspended our repurchase program, reflecting a shift toward cash accumulation between now and the closing of the deal and toward rapid deleveraging thereafter.","Overall, our balance sheet remains a source of strength and flexibility with strong liquidity of $515 million in cash reserves, net debt of $541 million, excluding nonguaranteed JV debt, and net debt-to-EBITDA of roughly 1.0x.","Our effective tax rate excluding special items nonoperating pension and OPEB items for the quarter was 22.6%, up 230 basis points year-over-year. At this time, with the same exclusions, we expect our full year rate to be 23.1%, driven by the level and geographic mix of income and benefits from a favorable mix of income in lower tax jurisdictions.","With that, I will turn the call back over to Luke to discuss our outlook.","Luther C. Kissam","Thanks, Scott. Six months into the year, I would characterize Catalyst Solutions results being in line with our expectations and Performance Chemicals results as being below the expectations we had at the beginning of the year.","In catalyst, we continue to expect double-digit segment income growth for the year. We continue to believe that Refinery Catalyst Solutions will be the largest contributor to earnings growth. Specifically, Heavy Oil Upgrading will benefit from continued strong demand globally for FCC catalysts designed to handle heavy resid-based feedstocks, maximize propylene yield and address the metal contaminants found in North America shale oil. With the capacity expansion in our Bayport facility, which those of you who attended Investor Day had the opportunity to tour, we have sufficient capacity to meet our growth objectives through 2016. The project is on track for completion in August.","Similarly, we continue to expect improved earnings from Clean Fuels Technologies in 2014, driven by similar volumes to 2013 but with a better product mix. Higher prices will also meaningfully impact refinery catalyst results year-over-year.","Catalyst segment income is up over 30% year-to-date. Our outlook for the second half catalyst results calls for the third quarter segment income in line with the first quarter levels and fourth quarter results more in line with second quarter levels, which would result in double-digit earnings growth for the full year, in line with our expectations.","Third quarter results in catalyst will be down sequentially due to a couple of factors. First, we expect lower FCC production rates in the third compared to the second quarter. Our Bayport plant will be off-line for a few weeks in August to bring the debottlenecking capacity online, reversing the benefits of the inventory build from the second quarter. Second, we anticipate that Performance Catalyst Solutions performance will be down sequentially due to weaker volume and mix versus a strong 2Q, despite an improving market outlook.","Third, segment margins will be impacted by our first-ever shipment of AlkyClean, currently scheduled for the end of the third quarter. This product is a new solid acid alkylation technology developed by Albermarle, Neste and Lummus. It's the first of its kind in the world. AlkyClean delivers higher octane without using the corrosive, hazardous hydrofluoric or sulfuric acid used in existing alkylation processes.","Several oil refiners have interest in AlkyClean, but are waiting to see the product perform in commercial operations. This initial sale is significant from a revenue standpoint, but margins are well below the segment average. We are excited about the growth potential of this new product given the size of the addressable market and expect future sales to be at margins more consistent with the segment average. It will, however, take some time to develop new sales.","Finally, we continue to monitor the dynamics around the potential EU and U.S. sanctions on Russia. At this time, it's too early to tell whether there will be sanctions that restrict us from shipping product for our existing orders. We'll obviously comply with all laws and regulations, but there is a possibility that any such sanctions could negatively impact second half catalyst results.","As we entered the year, our outlook for Performance Chemicals called for modest year-over-year segment growth primarily driven by clear completion fluids and curatives performance within specialty chemicals, stabilized brominated flame retardant pricing and mineral flame retardant growth within fire safety solutions, and a robust electronic materials and former pipeline, allowing custom services to effectively manage the expiration of several large contracts.","In custom services, as Scott mentioned, we have been presented with a meet-or-release price by one of our large customers, which makes future sales economically unattractive. We have elected to release rather than meet, which will result in a lower expected volumes for the remainder of the year and a loss of approximately $15 million in forecasted segment income from that contract in the second half. As a result, rather than this GBU delivering modest segment income growth in 2014, we now expect segment income to come in below 2013 levels.","With respect to brominated flame retardants in particular, our assessment of the market and our order book trends leads us to continue to assume, as we have all year, that while pricing trends continue to stabilize in most applications, we don't expect meaningful year-over-year growth in earnings or volumes.","As we roll up all of the various factors by business and factor in the impact of discontinued operations, we still expect overall company annual earnings growth toward the bottom of the 2% to 7% guidance that we provided back in January.","We expect earnings in the third quarter to be in between the levels we delivered in the first and second quarters of this year, and fourth quarter results to be close to what we delivered in the second quarter.","With that, at this time, I'll turn the call back over to Lorin for questions and answers.","Lorin Crenshaw","Operator, we're ready to open the lines for Q&A. [Operator Instructions] Please proceed, operator.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Mike Sison from KeyBanc.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Luke, in terms of -- when you think about your portfolio businesses going forward, assuming you get Rockwood, what in your mind is sort of the growth profile of a company -- or business that you want to keep in the portfolio? And maybe just maybe describe some of the characteristics that you want to have in each of the businesses going forward.","Luther C. Kissam","Yes, okay, Mike. I think if you look at the profiles for what we want, we want to be able to -- where we make money and where Rockwood makes money is when we provide customized solutions. We have products, but we're really selling solutions to the customers. And if you look across the catalyst, the bromine, the lithium surface treatment, that's clearly what's going on. They're also, if you look at most of those, it's a very small part of the cost of the overall solution for the product that's being delivered. But it is, in all events, very key to the qualities in that end product that make it do what it's supposed to do. In all events, they're technology driven. You have to -- you're not selling a commodity, you're selling a derivative product that provides value to that end user. So in essence, those are the quantities that we're looking for when we look at the products that we want to have in this portfolio. Because I think that at its core, that's what these businesses that Rockwood excels at, at its core, and that's what we do in our core businesses as well.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. Great. And one quick follow-up. When you think about where you want the return on capital of the business in total combined going forward, can you maybe talk about what level you think you can get the business to? And maybe some of the timing there.","Luther C. Kissam","I mean, what -- I'll turn it over to Scott. He can talk a little bit about the return on capital. I mean, when you're looking at organic growth and funding organic growth, we traditionally want to be at twice our cost of capital. And that's the bar that we use. I don't really see that changing from where they are because the projects that I've reviewed with Rockwood in the past that -- they're consistent now. Sometimes in the past, and if you look at Albermarle, and if you look at some of the steps Rockwood's taken, we've expanded recently in advance of demand so that we're there to meet the customers' demand. And it's caused some pain for Albermarle, as you're well aware, Mike, over the last couple of years. I certainly -- we want to learn from that, but we also want to make sure the demand's there to meet the growth, particularly in lithium, as you look toward the announcement about the gigafactory with Tesla and the Panasonic announcement. So we want to make sure that we're able to meet that demand as the market leader.","Scott A. Tozier","Yes, Mike, I'll just add to that. Mike, if I can just add to that. The businesses have substantially invested the capital required to drive the earnings growth that we have projected with the exception of the lithium plant that Luke just talked about. And as a result of that, plus the deleveraging that we're forecasting, we're expecting very good return accretion over the forecasted period over next 4 or 5 years, so we're very excited about that.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Vin Andrews from Morgan Stanley.","Matthew Andrejkovics - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","It's actually Matt calling for Vincent. Just on the Heavy Oil Upgrading, it looks like from your slide deck that the volumes were kind of starting to inflect downward. Could you just give us a little bit of color on that in contrast to some of the comments you made in the opening remarks?","Luther C. Kissam","Sure, I'll let Michael handle that.","D. Michael Wilson","Sure, Matt, this is Michael Wilson. It's true that for FCC volumes in the second quarter, they were up fairly marginally versus the prior year quarter. But I would discourage you from looking too closely at a single quarter. I mean, if you look at volumes in FCC for the first half of the year versus the first half of last year, we're up double-digit rates. And if you look -- our expectation is that for the full year, 2014 over 2013, we will see FCC volumes that are up double digits versus the prior year.","Matthew Andrejkovics - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Got it. And then just you saw a fair amount of pick up in margin on the volume that you had this quarter. Is there any color you can give us as to how we should think about the margin rate for the balance of the year? And how that might flow to the quarters?","D. Michael Wilson","Is that -- you're asking about catalyst or...","Unknown Analyst","Catalyst. Sorry, for catalyst, yes.","D. Michael Wilson","Yes. I think in the second quarter, we had particularly strong margins. It was really driven by couple of things. And first of all, we had good volumes. We talked about the fact that we had high production rates as we did build them in before, ahead of the outage that we have planned in August for our Bayport facility. But addition to that, we had strong customer mix. And to be honest with you, the customer mix drove more of the margin improvement than did the inventory build. And that's really because we're seeing that -- this continued trend of refiners processing heavy -- heavier, dirtier feeds, which are causing higher catalyst addition rates. And that happens to be occurring at that account. So customers are very profitable for us. Now I would expect as we go forward in the year, those trends are going to continue. I think the sort of segment margin that we had in the second quarter is a bit of an outlier. But overall, I mean, I think we see margins in the business improving from where they were at the 2013 level as we go forward.","Matthew Andrejkovics - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Got it. And then just quickly on the pricing in Performance Chemicals. Can you just give any color as to what you're seeing that's driving some of the stability in pricing?","D. Michael Wilson","So when you say Performance Chemicals, I'm assuming you're talking about bromine price stability. Is that right?","Matthew Andrejkovics - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Bromine. yes.","D. Michael Wilson","Okay, we'll turn it over to Matt.","Matthew K. Juneau","Okay. Matt. I guess in our area, what I'd say is we've seen kind of this ongoing stabilization that really started late in 2013. It's held up through the first half of 2014. As always, there are pockets, some areas are a little better, some areas are a little worse. But we've talked about the issue of demand, while PCs and TVs continue to be soft, we are seeing growth from the other areas, and that's helping to stabilize overall demand. In clear brines, while we did have this onetime second quarter event, overall demand has continued to remain strong. And that's also helped demand for the bromine chain, if you will, and helped to create a more stable pricing outlook.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Robert Koort from Goldman Sachs.","Robert A. Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Luke, I was wondering, I was looking at some of the stuff you guys had in terms of pro forma profile for Newco, and I noticed between now and 2018, you expected to generate something around 50% incremental EBITDA margins. I know you talked about the synergy number around $100 million. Is the reason for the rest of that pretty sensational uplift the take-off in lithium? Or is it the base Albermarle businesses? Can you sort of give us a sense of where you see that extra $450 million, $500 million of EBITDA coming from?","Luther C. Kissam","Yes. Well, I think, for one thing, you got to remember that in May -- and it's not in any of the numbers. But if you look in the end of May, Rockwood closed on the acquisition of Talison. So that will be a joint venture that will come in on that. From an EBITDA perspective, it won't increase -- it won't -- it's not consolidated, so it won't hit the revenue line, but it will hit the EBITDA and [indiscernible] line. So that's a big jump, Bob. And that business, that Talison joint venture, is projected to grow over and above what the lithium business is expected to grow overall. So that's a big piece of it. And then otherwise, when we look at those numbers, it's consistent from Investor Relations day, that midpoint case that we talked about at our Investor Day in Houston.","Robert A. Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. Okay. And then you mentioned KOH as an example of a raw material synergy. And I guess I would think that they're selling at market prices and you're buying it market prices. So is it a function of you're buying it from somewhere farther away and now it's closer? How do you actually get synergy if you're both operating sort of at arms length in the market? Where do you pick up any benefit?","Luther C. Kissam","Yes, so we aren't -- we don't buy KOH. We produce it. So we're selling it and they buy it. But KOH is a byproduct for bromine, and we're not -- we don't make enough KOH to be a real player in that KOH market. So we are moving it however we can move it because it gets in the way of our producing bromine. Some years, we make some money on it, some years we don't. It really all depends what the KCl price is that we get when we make -- to use to make the bromine. So I think there is more than a couple of million dollars sitting there for us to go capture by being able, from a logistic standpoint, to take that and ship it. And it really cuts down on what -- whatever profit somebody's making by selling them the KOH should inure to the benefit of the combined company, if that makes [indiscernible].","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Laurence Alexander from Jefferies.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","If you combine the potential hit from Russia and the meter release in the Fine Chemistry, what is the potential headwind that you face in 2015? And secondly, if you look at performance of the polymers business or the bromine chain, I guess, do you have the right cost structure? Or is that something that could be dealt with in conjunction with integration? Or will that wait until that after the integration?","Luther C. Kissam","Okay, let me take the first one second -- let me take the first one first. I'm sorry, Lawrence. First of all on the headwind, Laurence, that contract that we lost, that's a headwind for 2014 in the second half, that approximate $15 million profit that I've talked about. The second, for the full year, it would be in a range of $20 million or so or something like that because it's back-end loaded kind of contract. So that's kind of the range of headwind. And the team's working really hard to replace that. They've got some contracts. They're not going to be able to replace it in 2014, but they'll work very hard in the rest of this year, and they've already got some leads. And I'm hopeful we're going to cut that down, that deficit down. And I expect they'll be able to fill that for 2015. But there's work to be done for that. From a standpoint on the sanctions, it's not quite as big, but for this -- for the second half of the year, it could be somewhere in the range of, Michael?","D. Michael Wilson","Well, I think from the catalyst standpoint, you're talking about mid-single digit millions in terms of standard gross profit. So it's not all that great.","Luther C. Kissam","Yes. And it would be -- I'm not sure that we would have an order schedule in 2015 if hadn't one for 2014. So it shouldn't be a meaningful impact in '15. And as regard to the structure of Performance Chemicals, we just went through a restructuring, looked at that hard. I think that we will obviously, when we -- during the integration, we're certainly going to look across all organizations to be sure we're being as efficiently -- as efficient as we possibly can. And it'll be part of the integration. I wouldn't say it will be part of anything that will follow, Lawrence.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of James Sheehan from SunTrust.","James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Question on HBCD. You mentioned GreenCrest is being adopted there. What percentage of your volumes now are represented by the new product versus HBCD?","Matthew K. Juneau","So for us, James, it's very small because we are really going to be entering the market in a big way in 2015. So it's -- the big reason for us it's having an impact in profitability now is because as we're seeing this transition, we're seeing reduced sales of HBCD before we're able to deliver GreenCrest to the market. But we will be in the market as that full conversion happens in 2015.","James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","When you do convert, what will be the pricing benefit to you? Or I should say, how much are prices higher for the Green product versus the old product?","Matthew K. Juneau","Chemtura has commented on that in their earnings call. I'm probably not going to comment beyond what they said. Those kind of numbers are in the right range of delta in price. I think the watch out on that though is there's clearly new capital involved, there's investment involved. So I wouldn't take that delta in price straight to the bottom line.","James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Guys, can you also, real quick on FCC pricing. What were pricing trends like?","Luther C. Kissam","Michael?","D. Michael Wilson","Yes, I think in the quarter and also for the year-to-date, we've seen some modestly higher prices in FCC. And as I look at the full year forecast, I think across the refinery catalyst business, both FCC and CFT, we're going to see higher prices, and they're going to be contribute meaningfully to our year-over-year profit improvement.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Luke, just on catalysts, really more on your Q4 guidance. If it is similar Q2, I think that would imply it's down versus Q4 a year ago. I might be wrong, but could you just talk about the year-over-year trends in Q4 in catalyst, as well as sequential? And also, what's the impact for TAKREER in the back of this year?","Luther C. Kissam","Okay. Let me -- we will be down year over -- the fourth quarter for catalyst will be down year-over-year. If you remember, we had a huge quarter last year. It was -- that was a record quarter. So we will be down, but still, I think -- we're looking still for a good fourth quarter here. It's not going to be significantly down. But it will be down for the quarter. TAKREER, all the public announcements are still on track for a fourth quarter start up. We are shifting some of the catalyst, the schedules for the end of this quarter at E-cat. And then we'll have, we believe, either 1 or 2, we don't know. Probably 1 of the FCC catalysts for the initial load going in the fourth quarter. So that is kind of an October, November kind of start up. And that's the expectations from the engineering firm, from TAKREER and from the order pattern that we're seeing. So that will be a little bit of an uptick in the fourth quarter, which is in our forecast. But next year, it will be a meaningful impact to our FCC demand.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And just on this $15 million hit from this release of the contract. Was that more of a Q4 impact or Q3? Or can you help us with that?","Luther C. Kissam","It's spread across. It's almost half and half.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And this last for me for Scott. Scott, the other -- corporate other line, should we -- what's a good run rate for the back of the year?","Scott A. Tozier","So really where we're head is around that $20 million to $21 million per quarter.","Operator","And your next question will come from the line of Mike Ritzenthaler from Piper Jaffray.","Michael J. Ritzenthaler - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Outside of Talison. This is a bit of a follow-up to a previous question, but outside of Talison and the lithium ramp, can you give us a list of the things that have to sort of converge in order for that 2015 to 2018 EBITDA CAGR to come to fruition on the Albermarle side? It's -- just looking at the past 4 or 5 years for Albermarle has been pretty much flat EBITDA growth. Just -- what has to happen on the Albermarle side for that -- for all that to come true?","Luther C. Kissam","Yes. If you look at it on the Albermarle side for that kind of segment income growth to come through, if you go back to what we said in Investor Day, it really comes down to -- from a catalyst standpoint, our portfolio management. So exiting the antioxidant business that we've divested, some manufacturing help, some improvements in manufacturing, and from the additional volume that be run into those plants, at the cost that we have that's right. We had a little bit of price built in. And then we had some capacity utilization improvement. You'll know what, remember in PCS in the last quarter, we talked about exiting a PCS facility because the organic pricing, there's just too much capacity out there. So we are exiting that unit, bringing it back to a low-cost area at Pasadena and filling our SABIC center. And then -- but that was generally the ramp up that you would get from a catalyst perspective. If you look at the segment income margins at the level of Performance Chemicals, again, we talked about the portfolio management. So it was the ibuprofen, the propofol divestiture will increase our margins there. Improvement, focus improvement on our mineral flame retardant margins, a way to -- some projects to reduce cost there. And also watching our customer base to be sure we're getting the best mix of products that we can there. And then it became pricing that was built into that as well as increase utilization rates for bromine. You'll remember it in Houston, we talked about, on a run-rate basis, that we have today in 2014. With that allocation of bromine to the derivative products that we do. On average, every additional met ton of bromine results in $3,000 of profit, over and above what we're making today. So tremendous leverage as the growth for bromine and we utilize those assets better. So what we need to do from the Albermarle legacy business to deliver that kind of EBIT margin spread and growth that's in there isn't any different than the middle case that we talked about at our Investor Day presentation in Houston.","Michael J. Ritzenthaler - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. On -- let's switch a little bit to completion fluids. Have completion fluids normalized into 3Q? And I'm curious whether the impact in 2Q was just the Gulf. Or was there sort of softer component internationally as well?","Matthew K. Juneau","So, Mike, I'll take that. No, specifically as I think Scott noted that our issues in the second quarter were related to the Middle East. And it really just a matter of customer inventory management. The trends that we see overall for us are unchanged. The Middle East right now, as you know, has gone through Ramadan and now the Eid holiday. So now we're probably going to see what happens as we head into early August and they really go back to work. Gulf of Mexico for us was okay in the first half of the year. Southeast Asia was a little soft in the first half, has now picked up as we start the second half of the year.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn from Longbow Research.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","A couple of questions, mostly with a follow-up nature, if I may. You talked about -- or your slide presentation as well as your prepared remarks, you talked about the polymerization catalyst market, the performance catalyst market, conditions improving, but you're looking for a down quarter in the third quarter versus second quarter in that business. Is that seasonality? Is it timing of orders? Is there something going on that we should keep in mind as we look towards second half of the year?","D. Michael Wilson","Yes, Dmitry, this is Michael Wilson. I think overall, the fundamentals in that business are improving. But I think the second quarter was a bit exceptional in terms of the product mix we had and the volume. Sequentially, we saying that we will be down third quarter versus second. But overall, I'm encouraged about the demand outlook that we're seeing, particularly in the finished catalyst portion of the business and the component side of the business. Now we've talked about the organometallics, or basically the sort of precursors to those finished catalysts. And there's no question that there's overcapacity in that market, and there's price pressure in that market. And that's the reason that we took the actions that Luke talked about around our contract manufacturing earlier in the year. So pricing on the organometallic side is going to remain under pressure for some time, but the fundamentals of the volume improvement, as well as the components and finished catalysts business are encouraging, So I expect to see continued improvement over a longer time period as we go forward.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. And then the second question on the strong volume growth that you're seeing in FCC catalyst. I think you talked about double-digit growth expectations for 2014 versus 2013 if I heard you correctly. Some of that obviously is mixed with the heavy resid and some of this other products that the market is demanding right now. But I mean, I think you will have to agree the double-digit growth is very uncharacteristic for FCC business. So how long can you keep it up? And sort of what do we see on the other side of it come 2015, 2016?","Luther C. Kissam","Well, I think of first of all, we get to look -- that is -- it is hard to keep up, Dmitry. I agree with that. So I don't -- you might not have a view we're going to grow volume in FCC catalysts 10% every year. I'd love to be able to do that, but that's hard. Next year, what we'll have coming on line is TAKREER. And that will be a big volume. So I think next year in 2015, I expect to grow our catalyst volumes again in '15 with a full year at TAKREER. Now we've got a -- here's what we got to do though. We've got to keep that business. And the way you keep business in FCC is you meet -- you help those refineries make more money by providing that customized solution, which means our technology has to be cutting edge, and it has to be the best. So we're investing R&D, we're working with our technical sales organization to ensure we do that. But we don't take any of this volume for granted. We don't take any existing volume we have for granted because there are obviously competitors out there who are working on that technology for our sweet spot just the way we are. So we've got to keep that expertise and that technological edge. But if we do that, I'm confident in that '15 will grow. And then we'll see about '16 down the road.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Chris Kapsch from Topeka Capital Markets.","Christopher Kapsch - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Luke, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the impending Rockwood transaction. How about -- with your stated of objective of generating strong cash flow and rapidly delevering once that deal closes, I'm just wondering if you anticipate or am contemplating any sort of change in behavior either strategically or tactically in your existing business to help enhance the profitability of those businesses or cash generation there to -- with the eye towards delevering?","Luther C. Kissam","Yes, I -- so from a strategic standpoint, we're not going to run our core businesses any different than way we run them today. I mean, catalyst, we're going to continue to sell for value, as well with bromine. I think the important thing is most of the capital that we need to fund the growth for those businesses, we spent in 2011, 2012. And so I don't see a whole lot of capital coming. We'll continue to work our working capital, we'll free up cash as we -- well, we've started that already. So I don't see any strategic change in our -- in the way we operate our core businesses.","Christopher Kapsch - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then I think in your prepared remarks, you talked about getting inside your targeted 2 to 2.5 turns of leverage ratio by 2017. And I'm just -- obviously, to reduce that leverage ratio, you don't necessarily have to reduce the numerator, you can also increase the denominator, of course. And then if you'll -- there's slide in your SEC filings where you have a 5-year projected Newco EBITDA bridge. In 2017, it looks like you're sort of projecting $1.4 billion in EBITDA for the combined company. So basically, if you grow EBITDA to that level, it looks as though you would be within your targeted leverage ratio without really paying down any debt. In other words, you just grow into a more favorable leverage ratio. So I'm wondering over that time frame, between now and 2017, if you're generating at least $1 billion in cumulative excess free cash flow, what would be the intention of that $1 billion above and beyond just paying down debt? Because it looks like you don't even necessarily have to pay down debt to get some more coverage -- leverage ratio.","Luther C. Kissam","That's right. Now, look, that's a forecast, and there's upsides and downsides to every forecast, okay? And everybody that lived through 2008, 2009, knows that bad things that can happen. And so what we're going to do is we -- we're not say we're going to deleverage, I also said we're going to pay down debt. So our initial focus is going to be we're going to pay that debt down. And if we're generating that kind of EBITDA, we'll be able to pay it down fast, we'll get to that leverage quicker. And then what we're going to do is we're going to do what we always do. We're going to drive shareholder value. We going to look at organic growth opportunities. We're going to at stock buybacks. And we'll certainly look at increasing the dividend. So our total focus on this is going to be on driving shareholder value and quality returns for our stakeholders.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Steve Schwartz from First Analysis.","Steven Schwartz - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","First, a nuts and bolts question. Luke, you mentioned lower end of the earnings growth range, 2% to 7%. Is that baseline for 2013 being adjusted with the product line sales? And can you give us that number?","Luther C. Kissam","Yes, it'll need to -- if you need to take that into account. And Scott?","Scott A. Tozier","About $0.05 adjustment on last year, so.","Luther C. Kissam","Yes, about $0.05 adjustment.","Steven Schwartz - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","Okay. And then just as a follow up, another bromine producer mentioned this week that they were having some difficulties in Israel because of the local strife. Is that an opportunity for you? Or is it impacting Jordan? Can you give us some color there?","Matthew K. Juneau","So Jordan is not being impacted yet, Steve. We haven't seen any impacts on our ability to ship or move bromine. There's only one port out of Jordan, that port in Agaba is still moving product okay. We have not yet seen significant impact related to the issues in Israel impacting shipments.","Operator","This is all the time we have for questions.

My name is Towanda, and I will be your coordinator for today. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Matt Juneau, Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.","Matthew K. Juneau - Albemarle Corp.","Thank you. Thanks, welcome to Albemarle's first quarter 2016 conference call. Our earnings were released after the close of the market yesterday. And you'll find our press release, earnings presentation, and non-GAAP reconciliations posted on our website under the Investors section at www.albemarle.com.","Joining me on the call today are: Luke Kissam, Chief Executive Officer; Scott Tozier, Chief Financial Officer; Raphael Crawford, President, Bromine Specialties; Silvio Ghyoot, President, Refining Solutions; Joris Merckx, President, Chemetall Surface Treatment; and John Mitchell, President, Lithium & Advanced Materials.","As a reminder, some of the statements made during this conference call about the future performance of the company may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws. Please note the cautionary language about forward-looking statements contained in our press release. That same language applies to this call.","Please also note that our comments today regarding our financial results exclude all non-operating or special items. Reconciliations related to any non-GAAP financial measures discussed may be found in our press release or earnings presentation, which are both posted on our website.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Luke.","Luther C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Thanks, Matt.","I'm very pleased with our start to the year, as we opened 2016 with a great first quarter for each of our businesses. Excluding adjusted EBITDA from divested businesses and year-over-year currency exchange impacts, revenue grew by $58 million, or almost 7%. And adjusted EBITDA grew by almost $44 million, or 22%, compared to the first quarter of 2015. Adjusted EBITDA growth was driven by increases of 31% in Refining Solutions, 26% in Lithium, 16% in Bromine, and 14% in Chemetall Surface Treatment.","Overall, company adjusted EBITDA margins remained strong at 28%. Our four core businesses delivered combined adjusted EBITDA margin of 32%, up from 29% in the first quarter of 2015. Additionally, actual free cash flow in the quarter was in line with our expectations.","Profit improvement was driven by volume growth, price gains, and lower costs across most of our businesses. These results highlight the strength of our businesses and the quality of our employees. In January, we reached the one-year anniversary of the Rockwood acquisition, and we are now truly one company with a focused, performance-driven organization.","Before I turn the call over to Scott to discuss P&L and business unit highlights, let me update you on two strategic projects. First, our synergy projects continue to add to our bottom line results. As of the end of the first quarter, we have achieved synergies that will deliver $105 million in cost savings versus 2014, putting us well within reach of our goal of $120 million. We are working a number of identified projects that should allow us to easily meet our target, with our supply chain initiatives making significant contributions.","Second, as we discussed in the fourth quarter call, we successfully divested two non-core businesses, Minerals and Metal Sulfides, in early 2016. This left us with only one business, Fine Chemistry Services [FCS], of the three targeted for sale in early 2015. We ran a structured auction process for this business, but the offers received and negotiations with potential purchasers failed to result in a value proposition that met our expectations. As such, we believe it is in the best interest of our shareholders to keep Fine Chemistry Services and to run it as a standalone business. First quarter 2016 results of this business showed a slight improvement over 2015, and keeping the business will not impact our ability to deleverage in any meaningful way.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott.","Scott A. Tozier - Albemarle Corp.","Thanks, Luke.","For the first quarter, we reported all-in diluted earnings per share of $2.02, or $1.12 per share excluding special items. The major special items were the gains of $1.02 related to the sales of the Minerals and Metal Sulfides businesses. A full reconciliation of all special items in the quarter can be found in both the earnings release and in the earnings presentation posted on our website.","Before going into the details, I want to put our EPS performance into perspective. Our first quarter 2015 adjusted EPS was $1.17. This included $0.36 from the one-time non-cash foreign exchange gain and a net $0.03 from the two divested businesses. Excluding these items from 2015 yields a first quarter 2015 pro forma EPS of $0.78. So on a like-for-like basis, the EPS of $1.12 from this year is up 44% from 2015 pro forma.","Most of the growth, $0.28 per share, was driven by core business performance. We had small benefits from corporate, FCS performance, lower interest costs, lower D&A and tax rates, and a headwind of $0.04 per share from a higher average share count. A detailed walk can be found on page eight of the earnings presentation posted on our website.","In the first quarter, we saw changes in business mix by country, particularly a great quarter by our Jordan Bromine Company joint venture. That led to a lower but expected company-wide effective tax rate. As such, we now expect our 2016 tax rate, excluding special items, non-operating pension, and OPEB items, to be about 22% to 23%.","Depreciation and amortization for 2016 is now forecasted at $260 million to $270 million for the year, lower than originally expected. Final revisions to purchase price accounting related to the Rockwood acquisition and a slight change to the depreciation schedule for the new La Negra battery-grade lithium carbonate plant are driving the lower forecast. First quarter capital expenditures were right in line with expectations, and we continue to expect and forecast capital expenditures in 2016 of between $230 million and $240 million.","Operating working capital, including the Fine Chemistry Services business, was 27% of sales at the end of the first quarter, up slightly from the end of 2015 but fully in line with our expectations. And we expect operating working capital to range between 26% and 27% for the year.","In the first quarter, our adjusted free cash flow, defined as cash flow from operations, adding back pension and post-retirement contributions and subtracting capital expenditures, was $160 million. This excludes one-time synergy, acquisition, and tax-related costs and is right in line with our full-year expectations of $550 million to $650 million. All-in reported free cash flow, including those one-time costs, was $119 million, also in line with our full-year expectations of $450 million to $550 million. Note that we made a final cash tax payment of $20 million related to the repatriation of cash from overseas in the first quarter, as costs related to the Rockwood integration continued to wind down.","At the end of the quarter, Albemarle's net debt-to-EBITDA ratio as measured by our bank covenants was 3.5 times, down from 3.8 times at year-end 2015. This improvement reflects both a strong first quarter performance in both adjusted EBITDA and on free cash flow and allowed us to retire the $300 million one-year term loan following the completion of the two business divestitures in early 2016.","Finally, negative currency exchange impacts, while not as significant as in 2015, continue to affect our results. In the first quarter this year, these impacts reduced net sales by $23 million and adjusted EBITDA by about $4 million versus first quarter 2015, very much in line with our guidance of $10 million to $20 million of adjusted EBITDA impact for the full year.","Now, let me get to the details from our business units. But before we get into the numbers, remember that we are reporting in our organizational structure that became effective on January 1. We are now aligned under four global business units. Refining Solutions and Chemetall Surface Treatment are unchanged. The prior Performance Chemicals GBU is now aligned into two GBUs: Bromine Specialties, which encompasses all of our bromine-related business; and Lithium and Advanced Materials, which includes both Lithium and PCS, our polyolefin catalysts and curatives businesses.","Let's start with Lithium and Advanced Materials. First quarter net sales were $216 million with adjusted EBITDA of $87 million, resulting in an adjusted EBITDA margin of 40%. Compared to first quarter 2015, net sales were up 9%, and adjusted EBITDA was up 11%.","The Lithium portfolio continues to deliver outstanding results. First quarter net sales were up 19% and adjusted EBITDA up 26% compared to the first quarter of 2015. Adjusted EBITDA margins were 47%, the fifth quarter in a row with margins greater than 40%. Overall volume grew in the first quarter by 17%, and pricing improved by approximately 5%. Battery-grade products, as expected, drove the increases, and it helped to overcome headwinds related to lower potash volumes and pricing. Remember that potash is a byproduct of our lithium production in Chile.","We have previously discussed our intent to move our customers for lithium carbonate and hydroxide to multiyear contracts. While the initial reception was mixed, we are pleased with our progress to date. More than 60% of our lithium carbonate and hydroxide business is now covered by multiyear agreements, and we expect that percentage to continue to increase in the coming months. We see this as a win-win. Our customers benefit from improved security of supply, and we increase volume certainty and create additional opportunities to adjust price based on market conditions, which will support our capital investments in this business.","PCS performed in line with expectations. Net sales were down 6% and adjusted EBITDA was down 16% compared to the first quarter of 2015. But note that last year's first quarter benefited from the timing of customer demand for a key catalyst component. While most of the PCS business continues to meet our expectations, the rest of the year may be challenged due to the bankruptcy filing of SunEdison, a customer in this segment that also has manufacturing facilities located at our Pasadena [TX] plant site and purchases services there from Albemarle. While the bankruptcy is in the very early stages, SunEdison's issues could impact PCS adjusted EBITDA by as much as $10 million this year.","First quarter adjusted EBITDA for our bromine-based business was $62 million, up 16% year on year, with net sales up just under 4% to $197 million and adjusted EBITDA margins of 31%. The improvements were driven by better than expected clear completion fluids demand, particularly in the Middle East, timing of some flame-retardant orders, and favorable costs as a result of our synergy projects and lower raw material prices. While we do not expect to see this level of performance for the rest of the year, we were pleased with the first quarter performance across the Bromine portfolio.","Refining Solutions reported first quarter net sales of $171 million and adjusted EBITDA of $55 million with adjusted EBITDA margins of 31%. Year over year, sales were down 5%, but adjusted EBITDA was up 30%. Both Clean Fuels Technologies, or HPC catalysts, and Heavy Oil Upgrading, or FCC catalysts, performed in line with expectations. Heavy Oil Upgrading volumes, revenue, and adjusted EBITDA were all up as expected compared to first quarter 2015, which was negatively impacted by an elevated number of customer trials. Though the operating environment continues to be a challenge for Clean Fuels Technologies, the business delivered a solid quarter with improved EBITDA, driven by a better product mix and lower variable costs.","Chemetall Surface Treatment net sales in the first quarter of 2016 were $208 million with adjusted EBITDA of $53 million, resulting in margins of 25%. Net sales were up 8% and adjusted EBITDA was up 14% compared to the first quarter of 2015. The business remains on track to expectations and is seeing especially good growth in automotive and coil applications.","Regionally, Asia-Pacific and Western Europe continued to lead the growth, with year-over-year growth in China and India particularly noteworthy, which bodes well for the future growth potential of this business.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Luke to update our view for the rest of 2016.","Luther C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Thanks, Scott.","As I said, I'm very pleased with our start to 2016, with all of our businesses delivering adjusted EBITDA growth of double digits on a percentage basis versus the first quarter of 2015. In the second quarter, we expect Lithium, Chemetall Surface Treatment, and Refining Solutions to again show growth versus the second quarter of 2015.","Bromine faces a tough comp against the second quarter of 2015 due to the loss of a methyl bromide contract that contributed roughly $15 million in adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter of 2015. PCS will likely struggle to overcome the impact of the SunEdison bankruptcy that Scott discussed. Overall, however, our businesses are outperforming our initial 2016 expectations and are more than overcoming significant headwinds like SunEdison and lower potash volume and pricing.","Given that, we now expect 2016 net sales of between $3.3 billion to $3.6 billion, up from $3.2 billion to $3.4 billion at the beginning of the year. We are also raising our adjusted EBITDA guidance to between $920 million and $970 million. Adjusted EPS should be between $3.90 to $4.25, up from $3.45 to $3.80 at the beginning of the year.","We told you in early 2016 that we expected to build on the momentum that we have developed across our businesses in 2016. In the first quarter, we did just that and have every expectation that we will continue to do so for the remainder of 2016.","Matthew K. Juneau - Albemarle Corp.","Operator, we are ready to open the lines for Q&A. But before you do so, I would remind everyone to please limit your questions to two per person at one time so that everyone has a chance to ask questions. Then, feel free to get back in the queue for follow-ups if time allows. Please proceed.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Your first question comes from the line of Aleksey Yefremov with Nomura Securities. Please proceed.","Aleksey Yefremov - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Good morning, thank you. Can you discuss your long-term lithium contracts? How far out do they go on average, and what kind of price openers do they typically include?","John Mitchell - Albemarle Corp.","How are you doing? This is John Mitchell. Our current agreements are typically three to five years. We will continue to move those to even longer-term agreements as we go forward. And the pricing provisions give us the flexibility to adjust pricing as we see the market conditions change. But I do want to reiterate our position that we want to continue to support the market and its growth. And we're not seeking to exploit any kind of spot market pricing that people seem to talk about, where they see that type of spot market prices in China.","Aleksey Yefremov - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Thank you. And on tolling arrangements, do you expect to sign more arrangements later in 2016, or are you happy with your current portfolio agreements?","John Mitchell - Albemarle Corp.","We're happy with the current portfolio of tolling relationships that we have. And those tolling relationships will allow us to continue to support our key customers and their growth and increase the volume growth to those customers.","Aleksey Yefremov - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good morning. Thanks, guys, maybe not surprisingly some more lithium questions. Can you tell me what exactly is required going forward in Chile to get your new plant up and running both from a regulatory standpoint and maybe a technological or process standpoint?","Luther C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Hey, Bob. Let me ask a question and then I'll turn it over to John. When you say the new plant, are you talking about the one we're just \u2013 we're starting up now?","Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yes, sir.","Luther C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Okay, go ahead.","John Mitchell - Albemarle Corp.","Okay. So just to be clear that there's really nothing that stops us from starting up plant number two, which is the new 20,000 metric ton battery-grade expansion. We have the permits in place. It was a very long, expensive, and in-depth permit process. We're very confident that we'll continue to operate under that permit, and we have the ability to increase pumping rates in the Atacama and supply that new investment. So there's nothing holding us back in terms of expanding the capacity of plant number two.","Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And then could you talk a little bit about what you expect on the following plant, and whether it's I guess with the MOU and now you're going to put it in Chile? Does that squelch any plans to create a spodumene conversion plant of your own? And what do you think about the carbonate\/hydroxide balance as you look forward to your next incremental expansion? Thanks.","John Mitchell - Albemarle Corp.","First off, with regard to converting the MOU to a definitive agreement, that's going extremely well. We hope to have that finalized within the next couple coming months. That MOU and that agreement allows us to accelerate the expansion of La Negra and fully utilize the pumping rates that we're allowed to deliver under the permit. So we're going to be able to increase the capacity of La Negra to around 70,000 metric tons, maybe more than that.","That project does not necessarily mean that our spodumene to salt conversion project is going to be cancelled in any way. In fact, we're still in the design phase and we'll continue to develop that project as we see market demand. And so we see that project coming online probably a little bit after 2020, the 2021 \u2013 2022 timeframe. But we see that that's also an important project to be able to meet the needs of the customers. And again, if we see the market demand shifting forward, we have the flexibility to meet that demand.","Luther C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Bob, if I could just add, this is Luke. If you look at the returns on both of those, they're both very good returns. But the Chile plant, because of the cost position and because you're coming out of Atacama, has a better return. So we have focused on fast-tracking that project and delaying the spodumene conversion project, and also because we have the toll converters that we know we can still supply the customers there. So we feel like that's the best approach to take.","Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great, thanks very much and welcome back, Scott.","Scott A. Tozier - Albemarle Corp.","Thanks, Bob. I appreciate it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Matthew Andrejkovics - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yes, good morning. Actually, this is Matt Andrejkovics calling in for Vincent. Thanks for taking the call. Can you just talk about the volume growth that you saw in Lithium? Were there any new customers that you signed up as a function of this contract renewal process, or is that volume growth what you see as the underlying demand for that business right now?","John Mitchell - Albemarle Corp.","Good morning. This is John again. So out of the 26% increase of adjusted EBITDA, about 17% is due to volume. And we see \u2013 there's always a mix of organic growth within the customer base and new customers coming in. But I can't point to one new blockbuster customer that's come into the market that's driven the growth. It's really across the portfolio.","Matthew Andrejkovics - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great, thanks. And then, just in PCS, you hadn't previously listed BASF as a competitor for that business, but you had listed Grace. With their acquisition of BASF's polyolefin catalyst business, do you see any potential change in the dynamics of the industry? Thanks.","John Mitchell - Albemarle Corp.","No, that acquisition really doesn't have a bearing with regard to the markets that we're focused on.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed. David, your line is open. Your phone may be muted. Your next question comes from the line of Jim Sheehan with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please proceed.","James M. Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you. So in your raised 2016 outlook, you talked about the benefit in there from having Fine Chemistry Services retained in the portfolio. Could you just quantify how much of the increase in guidance was due to Fine Chemistry?","And also, it looks like FX rates have improved versus your initial expectations. Can you break out what the benefit is you see from improved FX headwinds?","Luther C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","If you really look at the improvement that we've pointed to year over year from our initial earnings, I'll do that and then I'll let Scott talk a little bit about currency.","FCS is not going to perform as well in the second half of the year as we forecasted it to perform in the first half of the year in 2016. Plus, we've got headwinds that we've got for SunEdison that we've got in there as well as lower potash pricing and volume. So the view that you ought to have is the increase in our guidance for the year is not only a buildup of a pass-through of our first quarter beat, but in addition to that, overcoming some of the headwinds, but it's very, very \u2013 it's a minimal amount in there for the custom services. And Scott, for currency, that would be \u2013 can you take that please?","Scott A. Tozier - Albemarle Corp.","Currency right now, we had forecasted at the beginning of the year a $10 million to $20 million impact on EBITDA. We saw about $4 million in the first quarter. At current rates, we have a little bit of benefit, but we'd still be within the range of our guidance. So we did not adjust our forecast for FX at all. So I think right now, it's still quite a volatile market out there, and it doesn't make sense for us to try to adjust for it at this point.","James M. Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay, great. And on lithium pricing, you mentioned the increase there. I'm just wondering. In the battery-grade market, there were price increases denominated at some 15% or so. Can you talk about how much of an actual price increase you're realizing in battery-grade?","John Mitchell - Albemarle Corp.","This is John again. I appreciate the question. Our guidance for overall pricing in the Lithium business has been mid-single digits on a percentage basis. Q1 was consistent with that guidance. And of course, we're seeing better pricing on the battery side. Our battery business is about 25% to 30%, but we're not going to distinguish pricing between the different markets at this point.","James M. Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citigroup. Please proceed.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Yes, good morning. My first question is on lithium. Can you just talk about what's happening to spodumene rock prices out of Talison? And then on the brine side, how much of your sales and profits come from potash?","John Mitchell - Albemarle Corp.","Okay, this is John again. Hi, P.J. So with regard to spodumene, I think one important thing is that the Talison mine currently provides the spodumene ore to its shareholders, so to Albemarle and to Tianqi. So the Talison mine is not supplying spodumene ore to third parties at this time. So there's no pricing implication, market implication with regard to the Talison spodumene ore. Sorry, your second question again?","Matthew K. Juneau - Albemarle Corp.","Potash.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","It was on the potash side. How much are your sales and your profits?","John Mitchell - Albemarle Corp.","Yes, so the potash revenue represents about 5% of our overall business. Typically, it doesn't have much of an impact. However, with the pricing situation, we could expect a few million dollars of impact just given the pricing and demand of potash, hoping for a recovery toward the end of the year.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","And then secondly, can you talk a little bit about bromine pricing, and so a little less elemental bromine versus brominated flame retardants versus what you're seeing in clear brine pricing? Thank you.","Raphael Crawford - Albemarle Corp.","P.J., this is Raphael Crawford. I think our general view on pricing for 2016 is general stability year over year. There is increased pricing, slightly higher than what we saw earlier in the quarter in China for elemental bromine. Some of that has moved into derivatives in China. The rest of the world is fairly stable with exception, as you mentioned, of the completion fluids business, where we see pricing pressure on that business around the world.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Raphael, can you quantify that a little bit more?","Luther C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","It's hard for us to quantify. I'll answer this. We don't want to quantify it, to be honest with you. And the reason we don't want to is because you almost have to go customer by customer, product by product. In any type of quantification that we would give, you worry it's going to be misleading because it is so specific to customer, region, and product, P.J.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Roberts with UBS. Please proceed.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you. With high-yield rates continuing to normalize, why do you think private equity wasn't willing to give you an acceptable bid for the Fine Chemical business?","Luther C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","I have no idea. I can't give you an answer for that. We're going to keep it and run it. Why they would or why they wouldn't, it wouldn't meet our expectations. So we're going to keep it. We're going to continue to operate it. And hopefully, it's a steady business. I've got confidence in the new leadership team that we've put in there. And hopefully, we'll never have to talk about it on a call like this again, so that's the goal.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, thank you. And then the bromine clear completion fluids business was down less than expected. Has it actually stabilized, or are you still expecting it to decline sequentially going forward?","Raphael Crawford - Albemarle Corp.","This is Raphael Crawford, John. We expect it to decline in the second half of the year. It was stronger for us than what we had previously indicated. That was really because of the regional mix, much stronger for us in the Middle East than in the Gulf of Mexico. As you know, we have a strategic advantage with our site in Jordan on the Dead Sea, and that enabled us to capture some additional volume in the Middle East.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Do you have visibility to where it would stabilize, or I guess given the first quarter surprise, you maybe don't have that visibility?","Raphael Crawford - Albemarle Corp.","We think \u2013 all the indications we get from our customer base as well as what we read into from forecasted E&P spending is that it will be down in the second half of the year.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Harrison with Seaport Global Securities. Please proceed.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Hi, good morning.","Luther C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Hello.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","I was wondering if you could talk about how much of a contribution you're seeing from the GreenCrest products as you shift away from HBCD. How much of a revenue or margin benefit are we seeing in the bromine business there?","Raphael Crawford - Albemarle Corp.","This is Raphael, Mike. So the GreenCrest piece is a strategic product for us. That is, we have announced recently that we have discontinued HBCD, and we are focusing on GreenCrest for those applications. That is still a relatively small part of our portfolio but growing at a fairly fast clip in 2016.","Luther C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","The other thing I'd add on that is we make less profit on this product than we did on HBCD just because of the volume and because of the cost position of that product, royalties that have to be paid to the owner and such things like that. So it's not \u2013 from what HBCD was, it is a negative as opposed to a positive.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","All right, thank you. And then I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the cadence of FCC volumes this year. I know you have a big customer that's going to roll off eventually and you're working to replace those volumes, but any sense of how we should be forecasting and modeling the FCC business going forward? Thanks. (33:58 \u2013 34:05)","Silvio Ghyoot - Albemarle Corp.","This is Silvio. On your first question, the cadence of the volume for this year is probably determined by the fact that there is, on the one hand, a strong gasoline market, which determines good utilization of the majority of units all over the world. On the other hand, compared to last year, there were no additions this year or commissioning of any new units. So in essence, there is a stable number of assets there that's all being run at a good pace. And this is driven by the fact that there is good gasoline demand all over the world.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ben Kallo with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed.","Benjamin J. Kallo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hey, Luke, Scott, Matt, and John; two questions. First on the catalyst business, both FCC and HPC, can you guys talk about the pricing environment, if we are entering, in your opinion, truly a new cycle where you can push on some price maybe with the backdrop of where oil has come off its lows?","And then the second question is for Scott, and welcome back, Scott. How do you think about your current capital structure, especially as your stock price keeps increasing? Anything you can do around the debt side or equity side to help you guys delever faster than you had anticipated? Thanks.","Silvio Ghyoot - Albemarle Corp.","Okay, this is Silvio again. On the FCC pricing, we have announced an increase earlier in the year and have been clear on the specific reasons for doing so. That has not changed. We are working on implementation. You know that it's going to take some time before we're going to see the results of it. It's probably too premature to express on where things are heading, but we have had some minor successes so far. And we are confident that over a period of two or three years that the price increase will come through.","Scott A. Tozier - Albemarle Corp.","Then on the...","Luther C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Hold on one second, Scott. He asked about HPC too, Silvio as well.","Silvio Ghyoot - Albemarle Corp.","Okay. On the HPC, you know that the metals are playing a vast or a big part in the price setting for those products. So price to some extent is determined by the volatility of the metals prices. And for the rest, there is no downward pressure whatsoever on the pricing.","Luther C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","So if I could add to that, that metals is generally a pass-through. So it may impact your margins somewhat, but it won't impact your actual profit that you would make off that when you see these pass through.","On FCC and on HPC catalysts again, as we've said, as long as we can deliver the technology that helps the refinery make more money, to have more throughput, to be more efficient in their operations, we can get a pass-through. We can increase prices because we're helping them make more money, and that's our goal. That's the industry's goal. We want to help refineries make more money, and then we want to get a piece of it. And that's what we're working hard to do, to push through these price increases, and we feel good about where we are with that. So, Scott, sorry to interrupt, but the capital structure and deleverage.","Scott A. Tozier - Albemarle Corp.","Yes, so I'm happy with our capital structure and its readiness, if you will, for deleveraging. We were able to borrow for the transaction of Rockwood as well as refinance the debt that we took over from Rockwood at very favorable rates. We have in place a term loan now. The remaining term loan, it's about $900 million that's fully pre-payable. It's due in 2019. So we fully expect that that will be the target that we use to go down. And frankly, we just need to execute on converting these great EBITDA margins into cash, and we'll be well placed. So I think we're in great shape, and you'll continue to see us delever.","Benjamin J. Kallo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","All right. Thanks, Scott.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research. Please proceed.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Good morning, thanks for taking my call. Can you talk a little bit about the decision to separate Bromine into a separate division? And what can we take away from that as far as your future plans for that business, and why do you think it's better to be run outside of the Performance Chemicals division?","Luther C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","So if you look at it \u2013 I appreciate the question. First of all, you shouldn't read anything into it. But if you look at the Lithium business, the Lithium business has significant growth opportunities before it. It will require capital in order for us to achieve the type of growth that the entire industry is going to have and maintain our leadership position in that.","Bromine is a much more mature business, and it requires it to be run differently. So we're going to run Bromine not for growth, but we are going to maximize the cash that we get out of that business to fund Lithium. And I think it takes two different focuses to run those businesses. One is all about growth and delivering these great opportunities we have. The other one is ensuring our cost structure is where it needs to be, maintaining what we have, ensuring that we are a solid supplier, achieve growth where possible, but run it for cash. It requires two different focuses. And to us, it made the most sense to do that.","In addition, whenever we were speaking with investors, after the transaction we were going around, there was a clarity from our major investors that they wanted to see transparency on how Bromine was doing, but mainly how Lithium was performing versus what we said and what we thought it was going to do. So we thought that given the two different focuses of the leadership teams as well as the request for clear transparency from the investors, this made the most sense to operate in that regard, Dmitry.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. Look, I appreciate that commentary. Secondly, you talked about raw materials coming down in pricing in your refining catalyst business. Was that the metal price that you referred to, and should we expect to see your sales price come down? So again, no impact on profitability, but should we be looking at perhaps a lower top line as you pass through these lower prices?","Luther C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yes, as a general rule, Dmitry, that's exactly right.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Okay, all right. Thank you.","Luther C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Please proceed.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC","Good morning, two questions. First, on bromine, are you seeing any end markets for bromine derivatives actually improve? And are we at the point where the electronics contraction is offset by the data server demand versus flame retardants?","And then a strategic question, it's obviously a long way off, but what do you think would need to fall into place for you to consider another large transaction? What would be your criteria?","Luther C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Okay, I'm going to let Raphael take the first.","Raphael Crawford - Albemarle Corp.","This is Raphael Crawford. So on your question on end market demand for bromine, the largest market for us is brominated flame retardants [BFR], and the largest piece of that is going into electronics. So far, we're seeing a relatively flattish outlook for BFRs into electronics. There are some things going up and some things going down. As you mentioned, server demand is up. We're expecting, at least from what we've seen in published reports, that to be up 8% in total server demand year over year. But offsetting some of that is a low single-digit decline in PCs and TVs year over year. So on the balance, it's relatively flat.","When we do look at some of the other indicators, so for example, Bishop & Associates puts out a Global Connector Confidence Index. That's at about 76 right now, and anything north of 50 tends to be a positive sign for electronics. So we're cautiously optimistic. But so far, the indications we get from our customers looks relatively flat to slightly positive.","Luther C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","On your second question, the criteria for us to do another large acquisition, Laurence, we need to follow through on this one first. We've still got to finish the integration. We've got to capture those synergies that we talked about. We've got a lot of focus on getting more efficient as a company, and we'll do that. We need to pay down our debt. We made a commitment that we were going to deleverage, and we need to do that. That will take us probably through the end of 2017, early 2018, that kind of range to pay off, to deleverage. And we need to follow through on the capital plans for Lithium and the growth.","So I don't see another large acquisition in our future, in our near future, in the next 12 to 18 months. I would assume that we've got our plate full executing on what we are doing. And then, if you fast-forward out then, we're going to look at the kind of acquisition, if we do one at that time, where we would build on the growth that we've got, build on the great technology positions that we would have. But it's really premature to talk about that now because the focus is all about finishing this integration, executing against the strategy we have both with our businesses and the corporation, and deleveraging and cleaning up our balance sheet. So it's really premature to talk about any potential acquisitions.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC","Perfect, thank you.","Luther C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please proceed.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much. The tax payment of $20 million that you made, is that the end of the tax payments, or is there another $30 million to go?","Scott A. Tozier - Albemarle Corp.","Yes, Jeff, that's the end.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. The second thing is you said that your free cash flow actual is about $119 million, but you've taken $82 million of cash payments related to acquisitions and other in addition to the $60 million in CapEx. So why isn't your free cash flow $30 million?","Scott A. Tozier - Albemarle Corp.","When you talk about the $82 million, I'm assuming you're talking about the appraisal shares in the Verition settlement that was a leftover of the acquisition and the transfer shares. Is that correct?","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","In your funds flow statement, you have a line, Cash Payments Related to Acquisitions and Other. What is the $82 million? Is that the settlement amount?","Scott A. Tozier - Albemarle Corp.","That's the settlement amount, and that normally does not get captured in a free cash flow calculation. So that's actually in the financing section of the cash, the cash section. So that's the settlement. So that does affect our cash overall. So it does not affect free cash flow, but it does affect our cash overall. And obviously included in our ability \u2013 slow down our ability to pay down debt in Q1, it gives us some momentum going into Q2 and the rest of the year.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","So that's not included in your actual free cash flow calculations?","Scott A. Tozier - Albemarle Corp.","It does not, no. Free cash flow and actual free cash flow is really cash from operations. We do add back pensions and OPEB contributions and subtract CapEx. So those are the components. Other financing activities, pluses or minuses that come through that, would not be included.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thank you so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Kapsch with BB&T Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Christopher J. Kapsch - BB&T Capital Markets","Good morning. I had a follow-up on the MOU in Chile. And I was just wondering if you could elaborate on what the anticipated implications are for your royalty structure and therefore segment margins. I think it's understood that in the prior arrangement your royalty was prepaid, but there has been I think some misinformation about what the implications might be. Thanks.","Scott A. Tozier - Albemarle Corp.","So first off, we're not going to disclose the details of the agreement until it's actually signed. But we anticipate that the EBITDA margins for the Lithium business will still be in the range of that 40% over the life of that agreement.","Luther C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","If the MOU is signed in the way it is, we would start paying royalties in 2017, as we've said. So we hadn't said what amount that is because the agreement is not finalized, but we would see that. So you would be a little bit of a dip in the margins because you're paying some for royalties, but we still expect to have growth. And you've got pricing that will continue. And we would expect to be able to maintain healthy margins in that 40% rate.","Christopher J. Kapsch - BB&T Capital Markets","Okay. And if I could follow up on the Catalyst segment, in HPC specifically you mentioned beneficial mix helping. But last year there was a bunch of \u2013 as oil prices have been coming down, there was pressure on the integrateds and there were some deferred change-outs in the refining space. And so I was just wondering now how you see that. Is that generally representing \u2013 deferred change-outs generally represents latent demand. I'm just wondering how you see the change-out cadence in 2016 and maybe even into next year. Do you have good visibility based on your order book? Thanks.","Silvio Ghyoot - Albemarle Corp.","Hey, this is Silvio. In essence, I would just hold on to what we communicated earlier. The market is still somewhat nervous in terms of the oil price and how they spend their budgets for change-outs or delaying catalyst change-out. So nothing has changed fundamentally there. However, we see a higher number of change-outs year over year. Within the context of the lower oil price, we have been doing good in securing those volumes. And at the same time, the catalyst that we'll be using had a better mix versus what we had last year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Wang with Morningstar. Please proceed.","David Wang - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Thank you for taking my question. I have just one on the Lithium business. So the 40% rate that you're discussing for I think maybe the 2020 expansion, is that representative of what the existing Lithium business in Chile is able to achieve? So will you be able to use that to contrast between your cash flows from Chile versus those from the spodumene that you get from Australia?","Luther C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","I'm not sure I understand the question. So today we have margins in Lithium \u2013 if you just look at Lithium alone that are in plus 40%. And that's a global average that we have for all of our business, battery, non-battery-grade, everything. It's north of 40%.","What will happen, you said 2020. But if the MOU \u2013 once the MOU gets signed, then we will pay royalties in 2017. That will impact the royalties from the carbonate and hydroxide produced out of Chile, not the rest of the world. It won't have any impact on spodumene. So you will see some downward pressure on margins because of the royalty that should be able to be offset because of the additional volume we'll be running through as well as price increases.","So to model something now into 2020 and try to extrapolate what the margins are out of Chile versus the margins out of spodumene versus the model out of specialties, you're quite frankly just slicing it too thin. We will maintain margins in the general area in Lithium where we are for the foreseeable future.","David Wang - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","All right, great. And as a quick follow-up, can you talk about what you see as the overall dynamics of the business going forward? Presumably, growth on electric vehicle and hybrids actually should benefit though, looking at the business, will eventually be a headwind for the catalyst business. So can you talk about what you think about the mix of business is I guess in the long run and how you view them relative to each other?","Luther C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","I'm assuming you just asked about catalysts and lithium, so that's the question. I think if you look at the most aggressive assumptions in the marketplace, it would be 3% type of penetration of electric vehicles in the annual sales fleet. There's still going to be the need for hydrocarbons for the gasoline and for the diesel. So we don't see the success of one hurting the other. We haven't seen that with low oil prices or high oil prices. There's been consistent growth for Lithium. And last year, FCC had a record year.","So when you talk about \u2013 you'd have to see a titanic shift to electric vehicles, to a 50%-plus range, to really see a huge negative impact on our catalyst business, particularly as we see the slate around the world, the crude slate getting heavier and getting more sour. So that will require more catalysts even to process the same amount of crude if it's heavier, if it's more sour. So we love both of the businesses. We think for the foreseeable future that both of them can flourish in the environment and one not hurt the other.","David Wang - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Great, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rosemarie Morbelli with Gabelli & Company. Please proceed.","Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - G.research LLC","Good morning and thank you for taking my question. Looking at the bromine market, could you give us a feel as to what the Chinese market looks like and as production comes back on after the end of the winter? What is generating additional price increases on elemental bromine and moving into some derivatives?","Raphael Crawford - Albemarle Corp.","Rosemarie, this is Raphael Crawford. As mentioned, bromine prices have stayed higher longer than I think we would have expected coming out of last year and into this year. On the supply side, there are a few things that have affected pricing on elemental bromine. Most recently in February, there were storm tides in the northern coastal regions that damaged pipelines and other infrastructure. And that slowed startup of several units, several operations in China, so that's led to somewhat of a supply shortage.","What we saw last year and into the beginning of this year was really lower imports. Imports have resumed back up to 2014 levels, and now we think it's local production. And in Q1, our estimate had been that roughly 30% of the capacity within China was utilized for elemental bromine. But we see a run rate of increased production, which would perhaps double that later in Q2. So we think that on the supply slide, it will certainly loosen up. On the demand side, there were lower inventories of tetrabrome that led to increased demand for bromine. So on the balance, it looks favorable. For us personally, the bromine business in China, the elemental bromine business is not a significant piece of our business. But where we can, we are taking advantage of the increased pricing in China to capture additional margin for Albemarle.","Luther C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Rosemarie, this is Luke. I think if you listen to any of the \u2013 Matt and I went to a couple conferences in the first quarter. And one of the things that we said there was we have seen a slower pickup than anticipated out of production out of China. What I'm anxious to do is get through the summer, get through the second quarter, see where we are in June and July. And what has happened with the production out of China bromine fields, I think we'll know by then. And it will give us a much better feel of whether we've got some opportunities going forward in bromine or whether it's still the steady state that we're looking at today. So I'm optimistic, feel good about what we've done. But I think as it relates to China specifically, we need a few more months just to make sure that what we're seeing is not a blip as opposed to a trend.","Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - G.research LLC","That is helpful. And so following up on that, if at the moment you are most likely benefiting from the price increases you instituted last year, and that will continue through the end of the summer, at which point we may or may not see additional price increases. Am I looking at this the right way \u2013 new ones meaning as opposed to catching up with last year?","Raphael Crawford - Albemarle Corp.","I think right now we're holding the pricing that we had from last year. And as Luke said, we'll continue to evaluate as we get a few months down the road to see, does the pricing hold out in China and are there opportunities for us to capture more or at a minimum hold what we have.","Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - G.research LLC","Thanks, and if I may, I have a question on lithium. So you are adding capacity. Oro Blanco (57:50), or however you pronounce that, is adding capacity as well. And it looks as though a lot of small players are coming out of the woodwork more intensely than they were before. Is all of this additional capacity going to affect the pricing of lithium, or do you think that demand is going to be strong enough that you could actually see additional price increases?","John Mitchell - Albemarle Corp.","Hi, this is John Mitchell. We see supply\/demand in balance through the midterm, say, through the next five years or so. And so given that the market is in balance, we think that we should not see a lot of volatility in pricing.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, that concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference over to Luke Kissam for closing remarks.","Luther C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Thank you for your time and your interest in Albemarle.

GAAP financial measures and reconciliation from those to the adjusted numbers discussed today may be found in our press release and the appendix of our earnings presentation, both of which are posted on our website.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Luke.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Thanks, Eric. I look forward to having you on the team. I also want to thank Matt Juneau for his many years of dedicated service to Albemarle and wish him all the best in retirement.","Turning to the numbers. The fourth quarter of 2017 capped off the year, in which Albemarle continued to deliver on our long-term strategy of growing revenue and EBITDA, generating cash, actively managing our portfolio and investing in lithium.","2017 adjusted EBITDA from our three GBUs increased by $160 million or 19% compared to 2016. Lithium again delivered strong double-digit adjusted EBITDA growth of 56%, and Bromine adjusted EBITDA increased by 14%. Our adjusted diluted earnings per share grew by 29% compared to 2016.","Strong segment cash flows coupled with the sale of the Chemetall Surface Treatment business late in 2016 enabled a significant deleveraging of our balance sheet while still affording us the opportunity to repurchase $250 million of stock and increase our dividend for the 23rd year in a row.","Just last week, our board approved the dividend increase for 2008, extending that streak of increasing the dividend to 24 years in a row. At the end of 2017, our net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio stood at 0.9 times. During the fourth quarter, we announced that we entered into a contract to sell our polyolefin catalysts and components business to W.R. Grace for $416 million. This transaction should close in the next few months and will provide additional financial flexibility to support our growth strategies.","Our capital spending in 2017 totaled $318 million with the lion's share deployed in our Lithium business. We made substantial progress on our Wave One projects, and they are all on track. In addition, the Lithium business successfully integrated the Jiangxi Jiangli China asset acquisition and commercialized our La Negra 2 battery grade production line in Chile.","In summary, throughout 2017, we put ourselves in a very strong position to capitalize on the potential and competitive advantages of our Lithium business. As we look to the future, our plan to realize this potential is coming together. We are seeing a significant acceleration of demand and expectations for EV penetrations now range up to the high-teens percentage of light vehicle sales by 2025. Our own view of 2025 EV penetration has risen to 12%. That would result in a global lithium market of over 800,000 metric tons, representing a CAGR of about 18% for the 2017-2025 period.","We are already seeing this growth reflected in the volume requirements of our customers. In fact, our Wave One capacity additions, which will bring total capacity to 165,000 metric tons, are essentially committed through 2021. As a consequence, we are now at the point where it is critical for us to accelerate our investment in additional capacity ways to meet the needs of our customers, while continuing to deliver value to our shareholders.","With respect to our Wave One expansion plans, we remain on schedule and currently expect capital spending to be over $1 billion between now and 2021, with about half of that spend in 2018 alone. Projects in this wave include La Negra 3, a 40,000-metric ton carbonate expansion in Chile; Xinyu 2, a 20,000-metric ton hydroxide expansion in China; and a greenfield conversion plant in Western Australia. The first phase of this greenfield site will initially have 40,000 metric tons of conversion capacities, so we will build an infrastructure that is scalable for significant expansion.","To address what would otherwise be an oversold position after 2021, we are now accelerating our Wave 2 plan, which will deliver approximately another 100,000 metric tons on an LCE basis early in the next decade. We have already commenced Wave 2 spending on clearly-identified projects that include the yield enhancement technology in the Atacama, coupled with a further conversion expansion in Chile and additional capacity at the Western Australia greenfield site that I just described in order to leverage the growth in hard rock capacity in that region.","Finally, we are also in the very early stages of assessing Wave 3 opportunities, which are largely new resources including Kings Mountain, North Carolina; Antofalla, Argentina; and other prospective opportunities in our pipeline. These capital waves collectively imply a significant multi-year deployment of our free cash flow towards growth in Lithium, while maintaining the flexible, investment-grade balance sheet and enabling consistent growth in our dividend.","Absent any corporate actions such as M&A or stock buybacks, we would expect to end 2018 at a net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio of around 0.9 times, essentially flat compared to the end of 2017. We are confident in our ability to execute this multi-year capital expansion and preserve the strength and flexibility of our balance sheet.","Before I turn the call over to Scott, I want to stress three important points related to this capital deployment. First, we will only build out capacity to meet long-term commitments from our customers. We're not going to be in the business of speculating on demand that might materialize. Second, we have the flexibility to adjust the size and timing of future increments, giving us the ability to modulate the pace of expansion so that some change in demand materialize with our customers. Finally, we have the ability to produce both carbonate and hydroxide. Both markets today are growing strongly. But to the extent to which one outpaces the other, we will be able to adjust to meet that demand.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Scott.","Scott A. Tozier - Albemarle Corp.","Thanks, Luke. We ended 2017 with strong performance and great momentum going into 2018. Let me give you some of these details. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.34 for the fourth quarter, an increase of $0.56 per share or 72% compared to fourth quarter 2016. All of our businesses performed well, providing about $0.50 of that growth.","For the full year 2017, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $4.59, an increase of $1.02 or 29%. Growth in Lithium and Bromine accounted for all of that growth. Diluted GAAP earnings for 2017 were $0.49 per share, the largest adjustment to get to adjusted EPS was $3.20 taken during the fourth quarter for discrete tax items related to U.S. tax reform. Debt restructuring cost and acquisition and integration cost were the next largest contributors, totaling $0.54.","During the fourth quarter of 2017, as a result of U.S. tax reform, we reported a provisional income tax expense of $429 million for the transition tax and an income tax benefit of $62 million for the reduced U.S. federal corporate tax rate on our existing deferred tax balances, netting to a charge of $367 million. The transition tax will be paid out over eight years. Our effective tax rate, excluding special items, non-operating pension and OPEB items, ended 2017 at 18.8%.","Operating and working capital, which was a use of cash in 2017 compared to 2016, improved to about 24% of sales at the end of the fourth quarter compared to 28% at the end of the third quarter of 2017. Several factors were at work. Net payables increased as capital spending continue to ramp up to support Lithium growth, and working capital related to polyolefin catalysts and components was reduced when this business was reclassified to assets held for sale. Capital expenditures ended 2017 at $318 million, ramping up from $197 million in 2016 reflecting growth capital deployment in our Lithium business.","Before I report on our business unit performance, I'd like to remind you that, effective at the beginning of 2018, management of the PCS business was moved from Lithium and Advanced Materials into the Catalyst GBU along with Refining Solutions. I would also like to note that the divestiture of a portion of the PCS division, our polyolefin catalysts and components businesses, is treated as an asset held for sale and therefore will still be part of our reported earnings results through the closing date.","And now, to the business results. Lithium and Advanced Materials ended the year with sales of $1.3 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $519 million, increasing by 35% and 43%, respectively, compared to 2016. Lithium full year sales increased by 52% and adjusted EBITDA increased by 56%, with adjusted EBITDA margins of 44%. Volume growth for 2017 was an impressive 24%, with prices improving by 28%, driven by the increasing demand from our contracted customers and the lithium price reset that started in 2016.","The fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA margins of 41% marks three full years of consecutive quarters with margins above our guidance of 40%. Discussions with our key accounts to lengthen contract terms continue through year-end 2017, as the market gears up for long-term demand growth linked to EV launch plans and concerns over securing reliable, high-quality supply. PCS ended the year with annual sales of $289 million and adjusted EBITDA of $72 million, down mid-single digits from 2016.","In Bromine, full year sales of $855 million and adjusted EBITDA of $259 million were up by 8% and 14%, respectively, compared to 2016. Full year adjusted EBITDA margin was 30%, 164 basis points above 2016. The market for flame retardants, especially in electronics and construction, remains healthy, reflecting the stronger local consumer trends during 2017. The demand for clear brine fluids, which are used for deepwater offshore oil well completions, was about flat compared to 2016. Higher selling prices across certain products resulted from production shortages particularly out of China.","Refining Solutions reported a strong fourth quarter with net sales of $238 million and adjusted EBITDA of $69 million, resulting in an EBITDA margin of 29%. Full year Refining Solutions sales of $778 million increased by 6% compared to 2016. Adjusted EBITDA was $212 million, down 11%. Hurricane Harvey contributed 5 percentage points of that decline.","During 2017, higher sales volumes in hydroprocessing catalysts, or HPC catalysts, were driven by good demand compared to the prior year. Higher sales to the traditionally lower margin heavy resid segment, higher input costs and higher logistics costs resulted in lower adjusted EBITDA for HPC than we saw in 2016.","2017 sales volumes for Fluid Catalytic Cracking, or FCC catalysts, were up with relatively flat pricing across customers and products compared to 2016. Adjusted EBITDA for FCC was negatively impacted by Hurricane Harvey, as well as the timing of customer trials in our max propylene product line during the first half of 2017. These headwinds were partially offset by strength in FCC volumes in North America, where lower margin BTO (16:12) products are more prominent.","Now, I'll now turn to 2018. First, I'll frame the impact of tax reform on earnings, capital spending on our free cash flow and key elements of our balance sheet. Then, I'll turn the call back to Luke to cover the business and our overall company forecast for revenue and earnings growth. While there is certainly long-term benefits to the recently enacted U.S. tax reform, we expect our effective tax rates to increase in 2018 as compared to 2017.","There are several components at work. First, our operations in Chile will bear higher income and mining tax rates going forward. Second, we expect our projected geographic revenue mix to be slightly biased toward higher tax rate jurisdictions than in 2017.","And finally, based on our current understanding, we anticipate the U.S. tax reform to push our domestic rates slightly higher. As a result of these factors, we currently expect our effective tax rate, excluding special items, non-operating and pension and OPEB items to be approximately 23% to 24% in 2018.","As Luke earlier described, market demand and customer commitments have resulted in an acceleration of future capital waves to ensure Albemarle meets long-term customer commitments. In total, you can expect capital spending of $800 million to $900 million in 2018, resulting in breakeven to negative free cash flow generation, once all other factors are accounted for.","Net cash from operations is expected to exceed the $304 million of 2017, ranging between $660 million and $730 million in 2018. In addition to earnings growth, the increase in net cash from operations is expected to benefit from improved working capital and lower cash taxes.","Finally, estimating the risk of foreign exchange movements is always challenging and seems even more so in the current global environment. Our 2018 guidance is based on rates close to today's FX rates, an average U.S. dollar to euro exchange rate of $1.23 and an average Japanese yen to U.S. dollar exchange rate of \u00a5109.","Now, I'll turn the call back over to Luke.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Hey. Thanks a lot, Scott. Assuming the economy doesn't suffer a slowdown in 2018 and based upon the current exchange rates, we expect net sales in the range of $3.2 billion to $3.4 billion and adjusted EBITDA of between $955 million to just over $1 billion, a pro forma growth rate of 11% to 17% compared to 2017. This growth would result in adjusted diluted earnings per share between $5 and $5.40. This assumes a March 31, 2018, closing date on the sale of the polyolefin catalysts and components business.","We currently expect the cadence of earnings to be slightly lower in the first half of the year versus the second half. Note that the normal fluctuation in our businesses, such as a large HPC order moving from one quarter to another can have a significant impact on quarterly results.","Turning to each of our businesses. With over 1.2 million vehicles sold worldwide, global sales of plug-in hybrids and battery electric vehicles in 2017 increased by 58% compared to 2016 with pure electric vehicles growing faster than plug-in hybrids.","A similar growth rate is expected again in 2018. Based on the strong demand from our lithium customers, we expect lithium earnings to increase greater than 20% and adjusted EBITDA margins to average greater than 40% in 2018. We continue to see favorable pricing trends with overall pricing in lithium expected to increase by high-single digits on a percentage basis relative to last year. Our volumes are fully committed for 2018 and are forecasted to grow at least 10,000 metric tons, driven by growth in battery grade applications.","Nice growth is also expected in catalysts, which now includes Refining Solutions and the Performance Catalyst Solutions business. Despite anticipated cost inflation in refinery catalysts, adjusted EBITDA is anticipated to increase by the mid to high-single digits on a percentage basis compared to 2017.","Fluid Cracking Catalysts are forecast to benefit from strong demand, high utilization rate and improved product mix with increased sales of our max propylene product line. We also expect a similar trend in Clean Fuel Technology during 2018 with the product mix more skewed towards some of our higher value products. Though less pronounced than in 2017, we currently forecast a somewhat stronger half of the year in Catalyst. But as always, timing of change outs in the refineries could impact actual results.","After a solid year in Bromine in 2017, we expect 2018 performance to be about flat compared to last year. Though we do expect modest growth in flame retardants, these gains are expected to be offset by higher cost for raw materials, freight and distribution. As is the case with Lithium, in 2018, our volumes in certain of our Bromine derivatives are fully committed.","In closing, our strategy is unfolding as we planned. We exceeded our operational and financial commitments in 2017. Lithium continues to deliver exceptional growth. Our Wave 1 projects are on track, and we're accelerating our Wave 2 and Wave 3 projects to meet the increasing demand from our existing customers.","In addition, the steady cash generation in both Bromine Specialties and Catalyst, combined with our strong balance sheet, gives us the ability to generate growth that will deliver superior value for our customers and our shareholders. I have never been more excited about the opportunity that we see in front of us.","Eric W. Norris - Albemarle Corp.","Operator, we are ready to open the lines for Q&A. But before you do so, I would remind everyone to please limit your questions to two per person at one time so that everyone has a chance and feel free to get back in the queue for follow-ups.","Please proceed, Lisa, with the queue.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we'll now conduct the question-and-answer session. Okay. Your first question is from the line of Bob Koort of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Dylan Campbell - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi. This is Dylan Campbell on for Bob. Good morning. Thanks for the question. On the BEV and PHEV penetration rates last year during an Investor Day, you noted 2.3% and 2.7%, respectively, of your revised outlook. How is your current estimate compared during this 2021 year?","John Mitchell - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. Hi, Campbell. This is John. It's a great question. The way we were building up our models right now is really by model \u2013 by specific model. And so, we're really looking at the battery systems in each of the models that are announced. And as we look at 2017, after 2025, we see the battery side increasing about 40%. So, there is a combination of technologies, as you know, that's coming out of the market. There has been a few hundred different models announced just in the last, say, six months. So, rather than giving you a split of plug-in hybrid versus battery electric, you really need to break it down model-by-model. But what I can tell you is that, from 2017 through 2025, the kilowatt hours per vehicle escalating in our model is about 40%.","Dylan Campbell - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you. And then, you mentioned kind of EBITDA margins I mean, greater than 40%, which is helpful for 2018. But can you help us understand directionally whether you expect margins to be above or below 2017 levels or kind of any puts and takes that we should be thinking about with the year-over-year bridge for Lithium?","Scott A. Tozier - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. This is Scott. So, we're expecting that we'll be above 40%. Don't expect that we'd break 45%. So, again, we'll be in the lower part of that 40%. That range is what our expectation is right now.","Dylan Campbell - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you for your question. Our next question is from the line of Arun Viswanathan of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Daniel DiCicco - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi. This is Dan DiCicco on for Arun. Thank you for taking my question. If I could just kind of go back to that first one and maybe ask it another way like your penetration target for 2025, I mean, if I'm correct, that now assumes 70,000 tons of average annual demand growth. And then, your previous forecast to 2021 was for 35,000 tons of average annual demand growth. So, has that accelerated at all, or has that number changed?","Scott A. Tozier - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. That's a great question. And your math is right. So, back \u2013 during the Investor Day, our models were looking at incremental LCE growth over the next five years at about 35,000 metric tons per year and our new demand model suggest it's about 70,000 metric tons per year over the next five years on average. And so, it's an accelerating curve. It's an accelerating growth curve. And that's really driven by a multitude of factors. The biggest one is really just all the new model announcements by the OEMs.","I also want to just mention that from a grid storage perspective, we have almost \u2013 we have very little, almost none, no incremental demand on the grid storage side in our model right now. So, it's being driven by the electrification, the transportation system.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. And this is Luke. If I could just add a little clarifying comment on that. Remember, we had said that we expected it, on average, to increase by about 35,000 metric tons from 2017 to 2021. And we'd always said that it would be lower in the early years, so that in the out years it would be higher. And I think at the Investor Day we said within those outer years, we'd expect it to be closer to 50,000.","Now, what we're saying is, if you look at the average \u2013 the penetration rate by 2025, it would be 12% and that \u2013 you will continue on that curve. You ought not look at it as a straight line, but it will have a bell curve going out. So, consistent with what we said in our Investor Day last year, but in accelerated penetration, thereby, driving accelerated demand for our customers. Hope that helps.","Daniel DiCicco - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thank you. And just as a follow-up. With you guys accelerating your Wave 2 and Wave 3 investments, does that mean we can expect volumes from these projects sooner? And could that potentially have a negative impact on prices down the road?","Scott A. Tozier - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. We've not accelerated \u2013 we never said that Wave 2 or Wave 3 will be coming in before 2021, and you should not expect it. That is a post-2021 type volume that would come online. And as always, we're going to marginalize it to bring it online to meet the demand of our customers. We're going to build it in 20,000 net ton increments and we will be able to speed it and slow it based upon the demand that we see with our customers, so I don't see having any impact at all on price.","Daniel DiCicco - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you for your question. Our next question is from the line of P.J. Juvekar of Citi. Please go ahead.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Yes. Hi. Good morning.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Good morning.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","So, you expect EV penetration to reach 12% by 2025. What is the cadence of that? Is that front-end loaded? And that's your forecast in demand from automakers. And between you and automakers or the battery guys, is there a choke point in the battery? I mean, is the battery capacity keeping up with the forecast that you have?","John Mitchell - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. P.J., this is John. We don't see any indication that there's going to be a choke point in the supply chain to be able to meet the 12% by 2025 right now. And from a Lithium supply and demand perspective, when you look at the product that we sell to our end customers, we feel that that supply and demand is going to remain in balance at least through the 2021 period.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. And my second question is on Bromine. Can you talk about the Chinese leased parts? Was that related to environmental shutdowns and their starting back up? There was also the water level that rose in China that diluted a lot of production. So, what is going on with these restarts? And can you just give us a little bit more detail on this?","Raphael Crawford - Albemarle Corp.","Sure, P.J. This is Raphael. So, we did see \u2013 as you've referenced, there were shutdowns mainly in the third quarter of last year that went into the fourth quarter. So, overall, Chinese production was down in the second half of last year. It was actually down about 10% from a total year-over-year basis. Some of the plants that were shut down for Bromine and actually some of the downstream plants from Bromine production have restarted. Most are expected to come back up by the end of March. But that being said, we're watching it closely. We don't know if there's further environmental action that will be taken in China.","We do know that overall rates of production in China for bromine, just bromine quality, the quality of the brine concentration has gone down. So, we're in a little bit of a wait-and-see mode as to what transpires over the year. We have benefited from increased prices for most of our derivative products because of the shortage in bromine supply.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","So, this is more on the BFR side and not elemental bromine side? I just want to clarify.","Raphael Crawford - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. It's both. It's both on the elemental bromine side and the downstream on the flame retardants as well. So, there's been less elemental bromine production as well as downstream production as a result of the shutdowns. There's also, P.J., been less downstream production because the price of bromine has been higher than historical level. So, the economics of producing those downstream derivatives competitively in China has shifted. So, it's both the environmental shutdown effect as well as the effect of just overall higher prices. And what that does for the competitiveness of Chinese products.","But, overall, P.J., for the Bromine business, we watch that closely. In the background we're always working on our own competitiveness with productivity and efficiency to our plants. So, as it moves up and down, we want to stay competitive in our global markets.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you for your question. Our next question is from the line of Aleksey Yefremov of Nomura Instinet. Please go ahead.","Aleksey Yefremov - Nomura Instinet","Good morning, everyone. Thank you. Could you discuss your price expectations for lithium for 2018? And then, also if you could offer any view of 2019-2020 price change.","John Mitchell - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. Sure. This is John. So, for 2018, I think it's \u2013 in the prepared comments, we said that we expect high-single digit pricing for 2018. And longer term, it was also mentioned previously, we don't see a negative impact on price and I'll tell you why. At least, from an Albemarle perspective, we are focused on long-term partnerships, long-term supply agreement. And what the customers are buying from us, reliability and supply, the ability to grow with them to meet market demand, the quality assurance that they can put our product into a battery system that's going to last 10-plus years and also the ability to continue to evolve the molecule into a performance-based product that's going to give them a competitive advantage that their battery is going to actually have a better performance than someone else's.","So, when you look at all those characteristics, I mean, we are really bullish in terms of making sure that we're getting a fair value that we're supporting our customers for the significant growth that they have ahead of them. So, that's kind of how I would look at the long term.","Aleksey Yefremov - Nomura Instinet","Thank you. And then, as a follow-up. I'm just trying to understand the magnitude of CapEx in 2018. If I look at overall Albemarle CapEx, it's rising about $500 million in 2018. If I look on slide 14, Wave One entirely would cost around $500 million. So, maybe what percent of that 2018 Lithium CapEx is dedicated to Wave One versus Wave 2, Wave 3? And also, did you see any escalation in your CapEx costs and your expected manufacturing cost here?","John Mitchell - Albemarle Corp.","So, the way you should read slide 14 is that the $450 million to $550 million is specific to Wave One build-out, which \u2013 our Wave One build out is an incremental additional 100,000 metric tons. It gets us to 165,000 metric tons on an LCE basis. The $100 million to $125 million, that's CapEx dedicated to the development of Wave 2 and Wave 3 capacity, both on the mining side and also on the refining side.","Aleksey Yefremov - Nomura Instinet","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you for your question. Our next question is from the line of David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey. Good morning. Luke and John, on the 10,000 tons of volume increase in 2018, will that all come from La Negra? And if it does, is that \u2013 will that plant be fully sold out or fully up running?","John Mitchell - Albemarle Corp.","So, this is John. David, the incremental 10,000 metric tons and that's a minimum, that's we're hoping for. A big portion of that is going to be Chile-based, but there also could be some other volumes out of Asia, China and Australia as well.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And in terms of...","John Mitchell - Albemarle Corp.","Go ahead.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Go ahead. I'm sorry.","John Mitchell - Albemarle Corp.","And I'm just going to say, in terms of your second question around will La Negra be sold out when we reached the peak capacity, there's still some additional room in La Negra. So, we will not be at full capacity, but we're still ramping up to full capacity by the end of 2018.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Very good. And maybe \u2013 and, Scott, for you, just on CapEx, in 2019 and 2020, should we think about a similar CapEx number as we're seeing for 2018?","Scott A. Tozier - Albemarle Corp.","That's our expectation. It may vary up or down slightly from that. But that's kind of the range that we're expecting right now. And as I look at the implications on the company, while we're expecting flat to slightly negative free cash flow this year, we expect with earnings growth in other initiatives that we'd go free cash flow positive in that timeframe as well, again, contributing to that flexibility of our balance sheet to take more strategic actions.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you for your question. Our next question is from the line of Kevin McCarthy of Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.","Kevin W. McCarthy - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Yes. Good morning. With regard to your price forecast of a high-single digit contribution in 2018, would you comment on where your weighted average contract price levels finished last year? Just wondering how much of that price uplift is from roll-through effects on existing contracts versus prospective market movements in pricing.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Well, you can assume that a lot of that or the majority of that price movement is based on our long-term agreements because a lot of the volume that we have on the sulfate is more than 80% of our volume is based on long-term agreements. So, I think a good assumption is that a majority of the pricing that we're getting is embedded in our long-term agreements or a part of our long-term agreements with customers. I think that's probably all I can say about pricing.","Kevin W. McCarthy - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. And then, Luke, I think you made a comment that your lithium supply is fully committed through 2021. Please correct me if I'm wrong about that. But I just wondered if you could comment on what that aggregate volume commitment is and in kilotons?","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Well, I mean, if you look at it, what we said is we'll bring online. We expect to be at 165,000 metric tons on an LCE basis by 2021. And so, as we build that out, we might not run at 165,000 in 2021 because we'll be ramping up and we're bringing the last project online in 2021. But we're expanding this capital and spending this capital to meet customer orders. So, you should have anticipation when we bring it online. We're essentially going to be sold out when we bring it online. We could place it.","Kevin W. McCarthy - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thanks for your question. Our next question is from Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you very much. I just want to clarify what you said earlier which was that you saw the market in balance through 2021. Did you mean to say that you \u2013 that it might not be in balance thereafter? And I also heard your comments that you don't see any negative impact to you from price. So, I just wondered if you could just clarify those things to make sure that we all understand what you mean.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. Vincent, the question was did we have \u2013 how do we look at it through 2021, and we said we'd think it will be in balance through 2021. So, if you look out, we did not mean to imply that there will be an oversupply or an undersupply after 2021. So, please don't read that into it. Again, from our perspective, our long-term agreements allow us to bring this volume online and have the confidence that we're going to be able to place that volume under our existing contracts. So, when we look at it, we believe that the market is going to remain tight. And if you look \u2013 and that's what the supply chain is saying. If you look at what our customers are willing to do, they have entered into long-term agreements and talking about even longer term agreements.","So, the \u2013 our customers want the comfort of that reliable supply. If you've read the articles in the press about the automobile makers and the OEMs trying to go directly to grab lithium, that tells you the automakers believe that the market is going to be tight, and they want the security in supply that they need to be able to bring their electric vehicles online. So, what the supply chain is telling us, what the customers are telling us and what we believe is that this market is going to remain tight for the foreseeable future.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you for that clarification. Just as a follow-up, what is your view on, sort of, the supply side of the equation? Not just over the next few years, it may be going out to 2025 to match up with your EV and lithium demand forecast.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. There's a whole host of gas out there about who's going to bring on supply and who's not going to bring on supply. I think that, if you look what has happened since we bought this business in 2015, there's been a steady delay of projects. Projects have been delayed. Projects have come on at a higher cost, and projects have also come in at a lower volume. So, I think, when we look again at the supply side, we believe that this business will stay in balance for the extended period of time.","And also, I think if you look again, when I point to what the OEMs are doing, you point to what the supply chain tells us with those long-term agreements, they believe that those will be out in relative supply. I'd also point out that, from our standpoint, we're going to be able to modulated and we can bring this capacity online in 20,000 metric ton increments and we'll be able to speed up or slow it down to meet the needs of our customers.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you very much. I really appreciate it.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","You bet.","Operator","Thank you for your question. Our next question is from the line of Mike Harrison, Seaport Global Securities. Please go ahead.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. Just kind of following up on your last comment there about your ability to modulate the lithium capacity addition. Can you maybe just give a little bit more color? I mean, obviously, a lot of these projects are two to three years or more in the making. How much of the increased spending here is being dedicated toward giving you guys the more optionality in terms of the size of the timing of these projects so that you can be more responsive to the customer requirements?","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","So, I would say, on Wave One, very low with the exception of Pemberton. And let me give you an example. If you, the permits that we've applied for Pemberton are for 100,000 metric tons of capacity, but we're going to bring in only 20,000 incremental tons. We're not going to build a 100,000 met ton plant. We're going to be \u2013 we're going to build five 20,000 met tons plant.","So, on the initial infrastructure, we'll build an infrastructure for 100,000 metric tons, and then we'll build 20,000 operating plants. And I'm sorry, I said Pemberton. But Pemberton is in Western Australia. So, that \u2013 we believe that will give us the module, the format, everything we need to then just pop out the 20,000 met tons on a more rapid basis than if we were trying to build a 100,000 met ton plant at one time. John?","John Mitchell - Albemarle Corp.","Thanks, Luke. A couple of points to keep in mind when we talk about supply. You have to look at supply as what is the end customer really looking to purchase. And it's a performance product. It has a quality standard that can actually withstand the 10-year warranty in an automobile and that molecules are different and they have different specification. And so, from a supply perspective, we are entering into long-term discussions today for capacity that's coming online post 2021. We need commitments today for that capacity that's going to be coming on the. And that's why we have a level of comfort that, as we bring capacity online, it's going to be sold.","And together, with our customers, we're the leading battery producers in the world. We're going to ensure that they have the right materials in the right place and the right form so that they can grow and meet the demand of their customers, the OEMs.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","You also mentioned wanting to maintain some optionality around whether you would be producing carbonate or hydroxide for some of those longer-term customer needs. Is that a situation where the customers just aren't exactly sure what type of technology they're going to be using by that time? Or is it more an issue of not knowing maybe which particular customers are going to be growing faster or slower over that timeframe?","John Mitchell - Albemarle Corp.","So, the battery makers are working with OEMs on different model announcements. Those models tend to survive a five-year cycle. So, they know the battery chemistry that's going to go into the models and they \u2013 and it's sustained at least over a couple year period.","Over the long term, I'm talking decade or more, there could be chemistry changes that change the product. But as we work with our customers in long-term planning, which is going to be necessary for all of us, if they have to change chemistry in the battery, they need to work with us so that we can modify our operations to provide them the tailored molecules they need so that their battery can meet the performance spec of the OEM. So, this is why \u2013 I mean, this is a fairly complex supply chain and it's a mistake to oversimplify the supply dynamics in the market.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","All right. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thanks for your question. Our next question is from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn of Longbow Research. Please go ahead.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Since the lithium market seems to be beat to death here, let me do my typical question on bromine. You've had pretty good price realization there in 2017. And we sort of know that the Chinese reduction in capacity and the strong demand from flame retardants is behind that. Is there any chance of that reversing in 2018? You talked about Chinese capacity perhaps coming back online by the end of March? And \u2013 or conversely, if pricing environment is still expected to be good, can it help you offset some of the higher input costs you were referring to and perhaps provide a little bit of an upside to your flattish EBITDA guidance for 2018?","Raphael Crawford - Albemarle Corp.","Dmitry, this is Raphael. I think that \u2013 I think you've characterized it well. We'll be watching the back half of the year to see what pricing does and what volume does in China. It's possible that it slips from where it is today. That being said, in 2017 going into 2018, we have been able to lock in large pieces of our volume at higher prices for the duration of 2018.","So, those price increases we would expect to carry through the year and offset the higher raw material costs, higher freight costs that we're expecting to see throughout the year. We're hopeful for the second half of the year, but we're not counting on it that that higher average pricing in China would maintain. We'll see what happens after we enter the summer with how strong production comes back in China, what that does to global pricing.","As I mentioned, when P.J. asked the question, we're sort of always looking for how we can manage our business from an efficiency standpoint to maintain our earnings quality of this business. So, we're preparing ourselves for a decrease in pricing, but hoping to offset that with higher operating performance.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Got it. Okay. Thank you. And then, my second question would \u2013 switching to your Catalyst business. You mentioned that in the heavy oil resid market or in the HPC part of the business, whatever, you're looking for a little bit of a better mix in results in 2018 versus 2017. Now, my understanding is the bottom of the barrel kind of the heavy oil resid, which was a nicely growing business for you, was a lower mix business. So, the fact that you expect mix to improve in 2018, does that mean that you're going to be slowing down in the growth of heavy oil resid or maintaining it and something else growing faster that's higher margin and therefore a better mix contribution for you?","Silvio Ghyoot - Albemarle Corp.","Again. Good morning. This is Silvio. I did hear a lot of questions. First of all, let me be positive. The growth of the resid or the user conversion of resid globally, whether it's through FCC or through HPC, keeps on growing. It's just a matter of getting more out of the barrel. And on an average resid oil amongst all the crude is somewhat cheaper. So, everybody is looking for processing that material.","Taking it from the HPC angle and the mix of products from the distillates to the VGOs (50:55) to resids, you'll see a growing amount of resid that needs to be treated for the simple reason that more resid is being processed and being dug up. And the same is valid for the FCC, the conversion of the bigger amount of resid plays well to our portfolio. So, we're still trying \u2013 we're still focusing on making petrochemicals primarily starting from resid feet up.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","But \u2013 hey, Dmitry. This is Luke. I think there is also the fact that we've got some specialty catalysts that we'll be selling this year. And as you know, from time to time in the past, on HPC, when we have a good \u2013 a good volume of those specialty catalysts which are higher value, we get a bump. And that's what we're expecting in 2018 on that specific issue in HPC. Okay?","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Got it. Okay. So, it's not a question of slowing down Resid sales, it's a question of just the timing of some of your higher-value specialty product sales.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","That's the way to look at it. So, think about last year. We didn't have that higher sales. This year, we've got some of that higher value catalyst in the sales for the 2018 slate.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Got it, Luke. Thank you very much.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","You bet.","Operator","Thanks for your question. Our next question is from the line of Mike Sison of KeyBanc. Please go ahead.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hey, guys. Nice end of 2017. When you think about your forecast through 2025 and kind of the thought that demand and supply would remain balanced, how much of that supply will come from you and the majors and how much supply will need to come from China, junior miners and such?","John Mitchell - Albemarle Corp.","So, this is John \u2013 I always like to try to put my feet \u2013 myself in the seat of our customer, and I think when they're building our capacity for the future, they're making commitments to the OEMs. I think they want to rely on a substantial company that has the financial wherewithal, the technical wherewithal, the operating wherewithal to be able to supply them.","So, personally, I think that the major producers are going to play a significant role in the market. Not to say that other capacity won't come online, but I think that if I'm sitting in a battery company, I want to rely on those companies that have the capability, skill sets and financial strength to be able to grow with me and provide me the right molecule at the right time.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Right. Thanks. And then, Luke, when you think about getting the capacity up and running by 2021 for Lithium, can you maybe give us a feel for where you think EBITDA would be at that point? Would it double from current levels? Would it more than double? Just kind of curious what the long-term earnings potential of the first wave will be.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. I mean, I think if you just look at where we are today and look at our 40% margin and you roll that out somewhere with the volume we have \u2013 40%-plus margin and you roll that out 165,000 metric tons, that's where I would think it would be at least 2 times at a minimum.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Right. Thank you.","Operator","Thanks for your question. Our next question is from the line of Colin Rusch of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.","Colin Rusch - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.","Thanks so much. Can you guys talk a little bit about the customer mix for these longer-term commitments from a geographic perspective, as well as how many of them are from auto OEMs versus battery OEMs?","John Mitchell - Albemarle Corp.","Hi. This is John. The basket of customers that we have are really in the cathode and the battery space. Since most of the cathode and the batteries are produced in Asia, you can expect that most of them are Asian-based. China, Japan, Korea make up the center and the heart of the battery \u2013 the global battery industry right now. Over time, we see that diversifying into the Americas and into Europe, but that's the current basket. And you can also make the assumption that these are the leading names in the space. These are the ones that the OEMs are really going to rely on to advance the technology and be able to supply their new model launches.","Colin Rusch - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.","Okay. Great. And then are you seeing any initial activity from this recent ruling in the German high courts to allow cities to ban diesel vehicles. Stuttgart and Dusseldorf are now able to ban diesel vehicles and we think that potentially ends up accelerating some PHEV and EV demand and production in Europe. Are you seeing any response from the customer base at this point from that decision?","John Mitchell - Albemarle Corp.","I mean, we're seeing all over the world, mayors of cities, governors of states or provinces and countries take more aggressive steps to electrify the transportation system and shift over to renewable energy. And the rationale there is one of attacking urban pollution and the health crisis that many of the cities have, attacking climate change and energy independence. And those macro themes still resonate heavily, and you see a lot of momentum across the world in different world leaders and city leaders and state leaders taking actions. So, it's not just those stories, it's happening everywhere.","Colin Rusch - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.","Great. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you for your question. Our next question is from the line of Joel Jackson of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Robin Fiedler - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)","Hi. This is Robin on for Joel. When do you guys expect to receive the increased extraction quotas from Corfo? Is there a risk to this considering the upcoming government change? Thanks.","John Mitchell - Albemarle Corp.","Hi. This is John. We have a great relationship with the Corfo and the Chilean government. These negotiations and getting all the documents in order and following the process they have just takes some time, highly optimistic that we're going to come through with the additional quota. It just makes too much sense for the State of Chile. We are not pumping any more natural resource out of the ground. We're just using a technology to be able to improve the yield and generate additional value for the State of Chile and for the community. And so, I mean this is a no-brainer, really. It just takes a little bit of time for us to get the papers in line. So, hopefully, we'll be back here shortly with some good news there.","Robin Fiedler - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)","Okay. Thanks. And just lastly, just on Wave 3 expansion, is there a priority between Kings Mountain and Antofalla?","John Mitchell - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. We're still assessing that, and the priority will be when you look quantitatively at the resource and the returns that we get and, when you look qualitatively, the ease of getting there. So, it's a combination but we haven't finished that assessment yet.","Robin Fiedler - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)","Okay. Great. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Thank you for your question. Our next question is from the line of John Roberts of UBS. Please go ahead.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. Luke, you have a target of 50% of the industry growth in lithium. Do you think that's still the right way to characterize your growth target? Do you need to be more flexible depending on competitor plans? Or do you think it's more important so the competitors know exactly where you're going, so you signal to them exactly what you're going to do?","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. I think that we laid out as a target so we could have the growth back whenever we were looking at a much lower growth expectation through now through 2021. Our goal is to be the most profitable lithium business in the world. So, we're not going to chase volume. We're not going to chase volume at the expense of value for the company and the shareholders just so we can say we got 50% of the growth. We want to make sure that everybody understands that we have the balance sheet to be able to meet the demands of our customers, and we're going to do it in a way that drives the valuation of the company for all of our stakeholders. So, there's no magic number out there other than to be the most profitable lithium company in the world.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then, does the acceleration in CapEx increase the likelihood of another asset sale like you just did with Catalyst?","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","If you look at our balance sheet, we don't have the need to do that. But we certainly have the flexibility to do it. Should that, we're always looking at our portfolio to understand how we can drive shareholder value. So, if we think we can divest something to drive shareholder value, we'll do it. But we have no need to do it in the short, medium or long term to be able to achieve our objectives, okay?","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Okay.

As a reminder, this call is being recorded for replay purposes.","And now, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Matt Juneau, Senior Vice President of Corporate Strategy & Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.","Matthew K. Juneau - Albemarle Corp.","Thank you, and welcome, everyone to Albemarle's second quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Our earnings were released after the close of the market yesterday, and you'll find our press release, earnings presentation, and non-GAAP reconciliations posted on our website under the Investors section at www.albemarle.com.","Joining me on the call today are Luke Kissam, Chief Executive Officer; Scott Tozier, Chief Financial Officer; Silvio Ghyoot, President-Refining Solutions; Joris Merckx, President-Chemetall Surface Treatment.","As a reminder, some of the statements made during this conference call about the future performance of the company may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws. Please note the cautionary language about forward-looking statements contained in our press release. That same language applies to this call.","Please also note that our comments today regarding our financial results exclude all non-operating or special items. Reconciliations related to any non-GAAP financial measures discussed may be found in our press release or earnings presentation, which are both posted on our website.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott to discuss our second quarter results.","Scott A. Tozier - Albemarle Corp.","Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. I'll start by discussing the quarter at a high-level and then cover some P&L and balance sheet details, and then close by reviewing the performance of our three GBUs in more detail. Following that, Luke will discuss progress against our key strategic objectives, and close our prepared remarks by updating the outlook for the rest of 2015.","To start, the key take away from the second quarter is, we delivered on all of the operational commitments we made at the beginning of the year and that were affirmed in our first quarter call. We are on track to meet our expectations for the year.","The second quarter performance of all three of our core GBUs was in line or better than our expectations at the beginning of April. On a constant currency basis with 2Q 2014, these GBUs delivered sales growth of 7%, and adjusted EBITDA growth of 10% in the quarter lead by Performance Chemicals, which delivered double-digit growth in both sales and adjusted EBITDA.","At a total company level, including the three businesses targeted for divestiture, net sales in the quarter totaled $931 million, down 3.7% from 2Q 2014, with adjusted EBITDA of $230 million, flat with last year.","Adjusted EBITDA margins of 25% were up slightly. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, sales and adjusted EBITDA would have increased by 3% and 5% respectively. The second quarter results demonstrate the strength of our core businesses with three GBUs delivering adjusted EBITDA margins of 30%, up from 29% in 2Q last year. Our synergy program contributed to these improved margins as most of the new synergies achieved in the quarter were in areas directly related to our GBUs. Performance Chemicals adjusted EBITDA increased by over 24% versus 2Q 2014, with our bromine and lithium businesses driving most of the increase. We also benefited from a large bromine related order moving up to 2Q from 3Q.","Chemetall Surface Treatment results were similar to both 1Q 2015 and Q2 2014, despite significant FX headwinds. While down versus 2Q 2014, Refining Solutions performance improved sequentially, as heavy oil upgrading or FCC catalyst returned to more typical levels of volume, revenue, and profitability. However, results in Clean Fuels Technology were again negatively impacted by delayed change-outs, cost-cutting initiatives by refineries due to low oil prices, weaker product mix compared to 2014, and increasing competition from euro-based competitors and US dollar denominated markets.","Essentially, as you look at the total company, the increased earnings in the second quarter over the guidance we gave in early May were due to the shift in the timing of the bromine related order from the third quarter to the second quarter. The end result is no change for the full year, but a shift in earnings from the third quarter to the second quarter.","Now, I'll turn to some detailed P&L and balance sheet items. As a reminder, all year-over-year financial comparisons are based on pro forma 2014 results, as shown in the April 8-K, to facilitate a cleaner comparison. Overall, for the second quarter, we reported all-in diluted earnings per share of $0.46 or $0.84 per share excluding special items. There are a number of one-time special items during the quarter, and the largest of these related to the Rockwood acquisition. The inventory step-up resulted in a $0.25 loss per share. One-time acquisition and integration costs resulted in a $0.15 loss per share. A full reconciliation of these items is in the press release.","We now expect our effective tax rate, excluding special items, non-operating pension and OPEB items for 2015 to be about 27%, somewhat higher than prior expectations due to changes in the geographic mix of our revenue. The tax rate, along with an estimated increase in depreciation and amortization related to the acquisition, will negatively impact earnings per share by $0.03 to $0.05 per share for the full year.","With the commissioning activities underway at our La Negra lithium carbonate expansion in Chile, we now have more certainty on capital expenditures and reaffirm that they will be fractionally over 6% of revenue in 2015.","Working capital was somewhat behind our target at the end of June at 26% of sales, partly driven by a strong month of June sales, which increased accounts receivable at the end of the quarter. However, our full year expectations are unchanged as we are maintaining gains that Albemarle made in 2014 and increasing focus on working capital management in the former Rockwood businesses.","Putting all of these pieces together, free cash flow, defined as cash flow from operations, adding back pension contributions, and subtracting capital expenditures, was at $217 million through June, excluding one-time synergy, acquisition and tax-related costs. While free cash flow may appear slightly behind our full-year targets, this is simply a result of the elevated working capital at the end of 2Q, as I already noted. And we remain on track to reach January guidance of $450 million to $550 million before those one-time costs.","Free cash flow including these costs is now expected to be between $150 million and $250 million, as some of the cash tax payments related to the acquisition are scheduled to be paid in the first quarter of 2016.","At the end of the second quarter, Albemarle's net debt-to-EBITDA ratio, as measured by our bank covenants, was 3.6 times. Our year-end projection of 3.7 times to 4.0 times prior to any impact from divestitures remains unchanged from the first quarter. And finally, exchange rates, especially against the euro and the Japanese yen, have continued to have a significant impact on our comparisons to 2014. Based on year-to-date results and updated ranges of $1.07 to a $1.11 for the euro and a \u00a5122 to \u00a5127 per U.S. dollar, we still expect a negative year-over-year adjusted EBITDA impact of $50 million to $60 million for the full year, with approximately $26 million of that impact already felt in the first half of the year.","Now, let me turn to the business unit performance in the second quarter. Before I address the three GBUs, note that the three businesses planned for divestiture, both Mineral and Metal Sulfides performed in line with expectations from the beginning of the year. But Fine Chemistry Services was down significantly versus 2014.","Refining Solutions reported second quarter net sales of $165 million and adjusted EBITDA of $48 million with margins of 29%. On a constant currency basis, sales and adjusted EBITDA were down 16% and 26% respectively, versus 2Q 2014.","However, compared to first quarter, adjusted EBITDA increased by 14% with adjusted EBITDA margin improving by 500 basis points. The year-over-year decline was driven entirely by Clean Fuels Technologies, which continues to struggle with delayed change-outs, cost-cutting initiatives by refineries in the current low oil price environment, and a weaker product mix driven by fewer first fills in 2015.","In addition, we are seeing increased competition from euro-based competitors in markets where sales are made in U.S. dollars. Heavy Oil Upgrading, or FCC business performance, met our expectations with volumes, revenues and profitability returning to more typical levels after a weak first quarter due to a number of customer trials.","We ultimately retained all of this trial volume, obtaining multi-year contracts with good pricing, reflecting the value of our catalysts. While these trials impacted first quarter of 2015 profitability, we saw sequential 2Q growth, and we continue to forecast growth in Heavy Oil Upgrading for the full year, with even stronger year-on-year adjusted EBITDA growth now anticipated and compared to our first quarter outlook.","With the weakness in Clean Fuels Technologies expected to continue, our forecast for Refining Solutions GBU is now weaker than at the end of 1Q, with full-year EBITDA expected to be down roughly 20% versus 2014. Performance Chemicals had an outstanding second quarter with net sales of $437 million and adjusted EBITDA of $149 million, and margins of 34%. Compared to 2Q 2014, net sales were up 10% and adjusted EBITDA was up 24%. On a constant currency basis, results were even stronger, with net sales up 16% and adjusted EBITDA up 30%.","All three businesses in Performance Chemicals contributed significantly to earnings growth in the quarter. Lithium sales were up 9% with adjusted EBITDA up 26% compared to the second quarter of 2014. EBITDA margins were 43%. The primary performance drivers were volume growth in battery grade products, increased pricing in battery grade and other lithium products and the impact of the Talison joint venture. We continue to be bullish on the outlook for battery grade products.","The portable electronics market continues to grow at 10% to 12% annual rates, and global battery electric vehicle sales have increased by more than 30% year-to-date. Our sales growth in battery grade products has been consistent with these trends. Overall, the business continues to meet our expectations, and we expect the positive trends to continue.","Underscoring our confidence in the growth of battery grade products, we have begun commissioning the new La Negra battery grade lithium carbonate plant and are moving to the next phase of planning for a world scale battery grade lithium hydroxide plant based on direct conversion of spodumene from the Talison joint venture in Australia.","Our bromine-based business had a very strong 2Q with sales up 15% and adjusted EBITDA up 31% compared to 2Q 2014. Adjusted EBITDA margin improved to 31% compared to 27% in 2Q 2014 and 28% in 1Q this year. These numbers clearly highlight the incremental earnings power of our bromine business. We saw both sequential volume and price movement in our flame retardants business, improved pricing in our industrial bromides products and benefited from a large sale of methyl bromide for an agricultural synthesis application. This order was similar in size and profitability to an order we supplied in the third quarter of 2014. In fact, we had forecasted this order in the third quarter this year as well. But the customer needed earlier delivery.","Finally, our clear completion volumes in the quarter held up okay, driven by demand in the Gulf of Mexico as the rest of the world continues to be weak. Given this strong 2Q, we now expect modest year-on-year adjusted EBITDA growth in bromine, a significant change from the beginning of 2015. We continue to gain pricing traction and are pleased with the modest flame retardants volume growth, but the 2Q timing of the methyl bromide sale in 2015 and a weaker outlook for clear completion fluids in the Gulf of Mexico compared to the first half of the year will result in more difficult sequential comparisons in the second half. Still, the stabilization of the business and overall improvement versus 2014 is very encouraging.","Finally, Performance Catalyst Solutions, which also includes Curatives for reporting purposes, had another strong quarter with both our Catalyst and Curatives businesses performing well. Adjusted EBITDA was up 9% compared to 2Q 2014, driven by strong Curatives volumes and pricing. Order timing, some one-time business and seasonality in Curatives will likely lead to a somewhat weaker second half in this business. But we now expect double-digit year-over-year growth, which has markedly improved from our initial flat outlook for 2015.","Chemetall Surface Treatment net sales were $213 million, with adjusted EBITDA of $48 million, resulting in margins of 23%. On a constant currency basis, sales and adjusted EBITDA were up 14% and 9% respectively, compared to 2Q 2014. All key end markets are showing solid growth compared to 2014, with automotive, coil, aerospace and aluminum finishing leading the way. We're seeing growth in all regions, with Asia-Pacific, where we benefited from the buy-out of our Shanghai joint venture and North America, particularly strong.","Growth was modest in the European region as weakness in Eastern Europe and Russia along with foreign exchange impacts reduced overall growth. Based on our current outlook and the order book for the business, we expect an even better second half of the year, in line with prior expectations.","Now I'll turn the call over to Luke to discuss progress against our key strategic objectives and to update our full year guidance.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Thanks, Scott, and good morning, everybody. Let me start by noting how pleased I am with the first half of 2015. Our team is executing well, and we are on track to deliver our previously forecasted earnings for the full year. All of our businesses, with the exception of Clean Fuels Technologies and Fine Chemistry Services are meeting or exceeding our expectations for January. We are overcoming significant headwinds related to lower than expected oil prices and the strength of the U.S. dollar.","Finally, we're making great progress against our strategic and organizational objectives for 2015 and positioning Albemarle to be even more successful in the future. First, our integration team has now executed projects that will deliver at least the targeted $50 million in savings for 2015. This represents an increase of over $10 million from the $40 million or so that we discussed in our first quarter earnings call.","On a full-year basis, actions already taken will deliver savings of roughly $66 million in 2016, meaning we are already two-thirds of our way to our $100 \u2013 excuse me \u2013 two-thirds of the way to our $100 million 2016 target in savings. The team continues to uncover new opportunities and we are confident in our ability to meet this commitment.","Second, the consultation process with the various works councils is continuing with much progress made in the second quarter. As a result, our global business unit realignment is substantially complete. Our first half results highlight the progress we're making in our new reporting and operating structure. Commissioning of the La Negra expansion and the announced rationalization of the butyl lithium capacity in New Johnsonville are two additional examples of this progress.","Third, as Scott highlighted, in the second quarter we again demonstrated the cash generation power of Albemarle with adjusted free cash flow before one-time items reaching $217 million through June, in line with our forecast at the beginning of the year.","Finally, the planned divestitures of Minerals, Metal Sulfides and Fine Chemistry Services are progressing in line with our expectations. While confidentiality obligations prevent any detailed comments, our goal remains to complete these by the end of the year. In short, year-to-date, the team has delivered on our commitments, and we expect that to continue for the rest of the year.","Looking ahead, we expect continued solid results from the three businesses: Bromine, Lithium and Performance Catalysts Solutions that make up Performance Chemicals. However, sequential comparisons could prove challenging for bromine due to the second quarter methyl bromide order that Scott highlighted and the expected weakening in clear completion fluids demand for the rest of the year.","Similarly, PCS faces tough sequential comps for the rest of the year related to the benefits from order timing in the first half of 2015. Nevertheless, we expect Performance Chemicals' adjusted EBITDA to be up by double-digits year-on-year excluding currency impacts. Given the increased pressure on the Clean Fuels Technologies, our HPC business, our outlook for Refining Solutions has weakened since the end of the first quarter. However, Heavy Oil Upgrading or FCC continues to deliver outstanding results with strong year-over-year growth expected based on strong demand and a favorable pricing environment.","Chemetall Surface Treatment continues to perform very well and as Scott noted, we expect even better results in the second half of 2015. Based on the second quarter results and our expectations for the rest of 2015, we now project full year EBITDA between $940 million and $1 billion. On an earnings per share basis, we are affirming our annual guidance of $3.65 to $4.05 per share in spite of the $0.03 to $0.05 earnings per share headwind due to the higher tax rate and depreciation that Scott discussed.","In closing, through the first half of 2015, Albemarle and its employees are meeting our commitments. Our businesses are overcoming significant headwinds and delivering outstanding results. Both our total adjusted EBITDA and our margins underscore the strength of our three GBUs. We are operating in a disciplined, consistent fashion with a focus on managing what is within our control. We're effectively managing costs, capital spending and working capital and creating new savings through synergies.","We're creating new platforms for growth as evidenced by the commissioning of the new battery-grade lithium carbonate plan in La Negra, the performance of our Talison JV and the acquisition of our partner's shares in the Chemetall JV in Shanghai.","Finally, the divestitures of our non-core businesses are on track. Overall, we expect more of the same from our organization and our businesses in the second half of the year as we build on our industry-leading Specialty Chemicals platform to deliver superior returns to our shareholders over time.","Matthew K. Juneau - Albemarle Corp.","Operator, we are ready to open the lines for Q&A. But before you do so, I would remind everyone to please limit your questions to two per person at one time, so that everyone has a chance to ask questions. Then feel free to get back in the queue for follow-ons, if time allows. Please proceed.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And your first question comes from the line of Bob Koort of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Scott A. Tozier - Albemarle Corp.","Hey, Bob.","Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Luke, I think it's probably human nature to sort of pick on the business that's not doing as well since \u2013 you seemed to do pretty well on some of those other business where they were concerns but the HPC business appears to be struggling, I think. Scott mentioned low oil prices causing challenges. I guess I was thinking maybe crack spreads are more important to the health of the refining industry. So can you talk a little bit about why you haven't seen a better response, given that refinery margins are actually reasonably healthy right now?","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. I think, it's a couple of things and Silvio may have some more details. Let me just talk at a high-level, Bob. I think crack spreads are more important, but I think if you look at the announcements that you've seen from the big intergraded's like Exxon, Chevron, BP, they are really looking to cut their costs anyway that they can. In addition \u2013 so they are looking for costs everywhere. Maybe that's a cheaper catalyst, maybe that's running the catalyst that they have a little bit longer. The second thing is, they are not having to run as hard because there's a big supply out there of the refined product that greatly exceeds demand. So when you look at the cost cutting initiatives that they are seeing and when you look at the \u2013 how the operating conditions are lighter, the catalysts are just lasting longer and then when they're switching out, sometimes they're switching out a cheaper catalyst. Silvio?","Silvio Ghyoot - Albemarle Corp.","I agree with that Luke, and like you said, that overall it's the demand of HPC, that volume that is lower than we had expected. And that, driven by the fact that the refiners see opportunities to delaying change-outs, to use weaker mix or even going to the extent of not using fresh catalyst, and using recycled materials. And all that adds up that the overall demand is lower than expected.","Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And then if I could follow up, my second question on the Heavy Oil Upgrading part, you mentioned retention of all your customers that had trialed. Should we expect that might require, given the same characterization of your refinery customers looking for cost savings, that they required a cost concession? And then you and Grace don't want to ever say the word Takreer, but it appears there's some progress there. Is that going to tighten up the markets enough to get some, a resumption of the pricing that you guys had started implementing a couple years ago? Thanks.","Silvio Ghyoot - Albemarle Corp.","I think I can be firm on that; I'm not expecting that trend on the HOU side. The business is strong, the fuels demand is high. There is a globally increase in gasoline demand, which is favoring the HOU or the FCC operations. So I'm not expecting any impact there from the oil price.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","And just to add on that, on all of those refills that we had \u2013 not refills, but on those contracts that we got, we weren't giving away price on any of that. That was one on performance trials. So you shouldn't view that in any respect. The market is tight, the capacity is tight. So we're looking \u2013 it's a great pricing environment right now, and our product performance is what's wining those. We haven't heard any \u2013 the question is have you heard anything on Takreer? We haven't heard anything on Takreer. Our catalyst is in there; it's performing as per expectations in the unit, and we are, just like everybody else, waiting to see what's going to happen.","Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks, Luke.","Operator","Thank you for your question. Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Matt Andrejkovics - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, yes, good morning, guys. This is Matt Andrejkovics calling in for Vincent. Thanks for taking the call. Last quarter, you guys had a nice table that broke out equity income contributions by the different segments. I didn't see that this time is; are you going to go back to that at all because it's difficult to parse out how \u2013 for example, how lithium progressed during the quarter as you have Talison coming in. So just maybe, if you can help us parse out like what drove maybe the growth, the new order and then Talison and how we can think about that?","Scott A. Tozier - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. So as you think about that, I mean the details will be in the Q, which should be out today, latest tomorrow. As you look at lithium specifically with Talison, of course, that was purchased in the end of May of 2014. So we had one month and a couple days of performance in 2014, of course a full quarter of performance this year. On a year-over-year basis, it's contributing roughly $6 million to $6.5 million incremental performance versus last year. It is performing better than expectations, so we're very happy with what's going on down in Australia.","Matt Andrejkovics - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. And then just to follow up: the free cash flow number, it looked like the range increased by $50 million to $150 million to $250 million, but I didn't see anything else moving in the outlook. Can you just maybe help reconcile how that would have moved?","Scott A. Tozier - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. The one item that moved in the outlook \u2013 so if you look at our normalized outlook, so that's without the acquisition costs and the one-time tax costs related to the acquisition, that did not change. So $450 million to $550 million, we're feeling very good about that range, given the performance and our current outlook in the second half.","On an all-in basis or reported basis, that free cash flow number, it did move up to $150 million to $250 million, and it's related to the tax payments for the acquisition. Part of those tax payments, so about $50 million of those tax payments are being pushed into the first quarter of 2016. And so it's really just related to the timing of those payments.","Matt Andrejkovics - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you for your question. Your next question comes from line of David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning. Luke, nice strong Q2 results, but you maintained the full year guidance. Can you talk about what it would take to hit the low-end or the high-end of the 2015 guidance in the back half of the year?","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Well, to hit the low end of the guidance, we've got to see completion fluids really fall off more than what we've anticipated for the year. I think that that we've got \u2013 we could see additional foreign exchange \u2013 you've got bromine pricing. So if we see some more bromine volume and the pricing continues to stick more than we have, we could see more upside there. The Clean Fuels Technologies that go along there, as you know, it always comes to order time. If we have an order slip one way or the other in the fourth quarter, that could have an impact on our earnings. And really, it comes down to one of the non-core businesses that we have that we're looking to divest in custom services, they have got a big second half. So that could move the needle there, and there is some upside if we can get some synergies earlier. But I think really lithium is pretty solid for what we got \u2013 the estimate at the midpoint. A lot of those contracts are baked in at the beginning of the year on price and volume, and at the capacity we're running there, not a whole lot of potential for major upside there. And on Heavy Oil Upgrading, we just got to deliver what we said we're going to deliver and feel very, very confident about our ability to do so there. So, some upside in the bromine area if we can get pricing in a broader area than we have today and then some watch-outs on the HPC and on the Fine Chemistry Services.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Very good. And Luke just on the bromine price increase you announced in late March, can you discuss how that's progressing and what you're seeing from other competitors, including the Chinese?","Matthew K. Juneau - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah, this is Matt. David, I'll take that. So, overall we continue to be very encouraged by what we're seeing in price. If you remember our original view is that we would not really see any net price versus volume this year, and that's changed a little bit with this update, that we're seeing some net benefit. There has been \u2013 your point about China, there has been some movement in China of the price heading down a little bit that I know a lot of people have commented on. We don't view that as anything to be too concerned about at this time. There is always some movement in price to the downside in the summer in China because their production rates go up. The price increase is kind of something we got to deal with over the long haul and we're feeling good about where we are right now, and the modest demand improvement that we're continuing to see to kind of underpin the basis for the pricing as well.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. And last thing, Scott, was the methyl bromide order about a $5 million EBITDA impact into Q2?","Scott A. Tozier - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. So if you look at it, I mean at the end of the day, it was probably $0.07 to $0.08 of EPS.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Chris Kapsch of BB&T Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Christopher J. Kapsch - BB&T Capital Markets","Yeah. Good morning. My questions are focused on the lithium business. I think you said that, based on contracts, that pricing is generally understood or fixed for the balance of 2015. Just wondering if you could talk about, given those strength in demand for EDVs, how do you view the pricing entitlement for that business, maybe looking beyond 2015 into 2016?","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. I think, if you look at 2016 there's obviously opportunity for pricing; this is a good pricing environment. People are pretty much sold out of battery-grade lithium carbonate and battery-grade lithium hydroxide. If you look at the cost today of lithium in a battery, it's probably around 2%. So it's very critical for the use of the battery, yet at the same time it's a small cost of that overall battery and we're sold out. So we feel good about the opportunities for lithium pricing in 2016 and it's already started having early conversations making sure the markets understand what those expectations are.","Christopher J. Kapsch - BB&T Capital Markets","Okay. And then, if you could just maybe qualify a little bit more on the demand shrink in EDV; where was it geographically pronounced and the plant that you're building to directly convert spodumene-based lithium to battery-grade hydroxide, is that intended to supply just Asian battery customers or is that intended to really supply customers globally? If you could talk about the timeline on that. Thanks.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. It will be a world-scale plant. So it will supply globally. We'll be able to do that, not just for Asian customers. Really it doesn't make sense just to do it just for Asian customers because the size and scale that you need to build that world-scale plant to meet the needs of the markets. And the timing on that is, as we've said, we've started the work on that, so it will come on line in a 2019, 2020 kind of timeframe. And in the interim, we're making arrangements to ensure that we're able to meet the market demand of that lithium hydroxide as it grows and we're not concerned at all about our ability to do that. We have great plans in place for 2016. I can expand those.","So we're going to be \u2013 we're going to meet the market demand. We're going to have the hydroxide available to meet the market demand. And we feel great about our process there and are extremely excited by the growth of battery grade and what it's going to do for this business.","Scott A. Tozier - Albemarle Corp.","And Chris, if you want to, I'll touch maybe just a second on the first question around the battery vehicle growth and where it's coming from, and where really the battery grade growth is coming from. One, you ought to think \u2013 remember that consumer and portable batteries continue to be a very big driver. And while a lot of that maybe ultimately will be consumed in Asia, it's for global markets. And then if you think about battery electric vehicles, what's continued to really hold up are the true, pure battery electrics. So people think about Tesla, but it's more than just Tesla; it's the other true battery electrics as well \u2013 they're also growing. They're holding up very well and continuing to grow. Those are the two combinations that are the biggest drivers for the business. And in a way, I'd say you ought to think of it is the global \u2013 where we supply is somewhat irrelevant, it's really global demand that's driving this.","Christopher J. Kapsch - BB&T Capital Markets","Gotcha. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you for your question. Your next question comes from the line of Mike Ritzenthaler of Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Mike Ritzenthaler - Piper Jaffray & Co","Yes, good morning. Just on Refinery Solutions, I guess with the outlook looking a little softer than three months ago, can you remind us of the magnitude of CFT versus HOU in the revenue mix? And then, could you walk us through some of your assumptions for pricing mix and volume over the next couple of quarters? That would be helpful. Thanks.","Silvio Ghyoot - Albemarle Corp.","Okay. Well, I think it was reported before. Both businesses have always been important and contributing both good cash flow and margin. Obviously, with the strength of the FCC today and the weaknesses of the HPC today and foreseeing for the rest of the year, there is an imbalance between the two businesses now. And the FCC is a bigger contributor today than the HPC.","Mike Ritzenthaler - Piper Jaffray & Co","Okay. Any thoughts on pricing mix and volume or is that just not something you're willing to comment on at this time?","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","If you look at the second \u2013 if you look at the 2015 versus 2014 in HPC, the volume will be down and we'll have a much worse mix than we had in 2014. 2014 was a pretty high-water mark, but it's really all volume and mix. We hadn't seen much degradation in price at all, when you're looking at Catalyst per Catalyst. So it's really been a mix issue and a volume issue in HPC. And on FCC, volume is strong; we'll see volume up and we'll see earnings up and a really good pricing environment for FCC catalyst, Mike.","Mike Ritzenthaler - Piper Jaffray & Co","Okay. Fair enough. I'm curious too about the sale process of the three businesses. Has it impacted the year-to-date \u2013 has the sale process itself impacted the year-to-date results? I guess especially within fine chemistry solutions, has it been more difficult to win new business? And have those assets at all been, I guess, sort of impaired because maybe it's harder to sign up new customers?","Matthew K. Juneau - Albemarle Corp.","Mike, this is Matt, I'll take that. In reality, two of the businesses, I want to say, Minerals and Metal Sulfides or what they call trivatech (39:24), those business are doing just in line with what we expected, no impact at all. They're really having solid years.","If you talk about Fine Chemistry Services, we knew going into the year we had some tough business comparisons with contracts that were rolling off. We were counting quite a bit on getting some benefit in the electronics material space to help cover the year-on-year change. We've seen some supply chain issues and some delays in that electronics area. That's really been the big driver for the negative year-on-year in Fine Chemistry Services. Don't think it has anything to do with the sales process.","Mike Ritzenthaler - Piper Jaffray & Co","Okay, fair enough. Thank you, very much.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander of Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Unknown Speaker","Hi this is Dan Lizo (40:17) in for Laurence. With \u2013 just with the changing, or the unfavorable MATS ruling from the Supreme Court last \u2013 at the end of the quarter. I mean how does that affect just bromine demand or does it have a significant negative effect at all, or it's not something you're really counting on? Just a little a color, please.","Scott A. Tozier - Albemarle Corp.","Sure, if you look at MATS, there is a lot of uncertainty about how MATS will ultimately play out and I won't comment in detail, because there's been plenty of that in the last few days in the various earnings calls. But in reality, our business related to mercury has improved year-over-year, as anticipated up to now. And the uncertainty comes in with what will happen post the Supreme Court ruling. We're just going to have to see how that plays out, what the D.C. appellate court does. MATS has not yet been stayed or vacated. We are still within our guidelines clearly for this year of what we expect from Mercury Control. I don't think it will have any impact on this year's numbers. And then depending on what happens in the appellate court, we'll see what happens longer-term.","Unknown Speaker","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you for your question. Your next question comes from the line of Mike Sison of KeyBanc. Please go ahead.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hey, good morning, guys, nice quarter.","Scott A. Tozier - Albemarle Corp.","Hey, Mike.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","If you think \u2013 I just wanted to run through the cadence of earnings in the second half. You had a 7\/8ths in (41:45) headwind, methyl bromide it looks like. Sequentially, the third quarter looks a little bit tougher. So, when you think about a third quarter EPS, does it sort of come down from the second quarter and the fourth quarter? Is it a lot better or are there things that, like cost savings, integration, that gets your third quarter maybe up or flat from the second quarter?","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Go ahead, Scott.","Scott A. Tozier - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. I would say, Mike, as you look at the third quarter to fourth quarter, that we would expect that the third quarter be at or above the third quarter slightly, and then we'd see sequential improvement going into the fourth quarter. So if you think about that second half, roughly 45% to 47% in the third quarter and the rest in the fourth quarter.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Great. And then, Grace talked about the FCC capacity largely being slow heading into 2016 and \u2013 based on their wins. Can you talk about how your wins are heading into 2016, and where you're going to be in capacity. And are you feeling better about the price, potentially, as we think about FCC catalyst heading into 2016?","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah, so go ahead Silvio.","Silvio Ghyoot - Albemarle Corp.","Okay. Thanks, Luke. Well, on the capacity I think it has been stated before with the growth in the demand \u2013 with a strong demand and the additions of new units, capacity utilization is increasing, and obviously that situation with the tight supply, the dynamics of the market are creating an atmosphere where there is room for price improvements.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","So Mike, this is Luke. As you'll remember we have a debottleneck process going on right now at our Amsterdam site. And we needed that to be able to supply customers in 2016 based on the business that we have. Even when that comes online in early 2016, and again it's a debottleneck, it's not significant capacity, we're still going to be operating at plus-90% in our FCC production units when you look at Amsterdam and Bayport in total.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Jim Sheehan of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please go ahead.","James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you. On your Surface Treatment business, it looks like you're performing quite well there and some of the macro trends are getting a little bit better. Can you talk about your outlook for the second half? Are you seeing increasing order patterns and an acceleration in your business?","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah, Joris, can you take that please?","Joris Merckx - Albemarle","Yeah. Sure, Luke. Well, we expect a better second half in 2015. First of all, we will have carryover effect of market share gains we've done in 2014 and in the first half of 2015. We also have a favorable pricing impact and the impact of our acquisition in Shanghai. So we are operating on a global scale, and we see a very positive demand in automotive globally and also from aerospace.","James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Great. And just on bromine pricing, can you talk about what impact the strike in Israel had on the tightening of that market? And as that strike has ended, do you think that the pricing environment is moving towards value-based pricing in the industry or do you see any drop-off in pricing power as a result of increased production in Israel?","Matthew K. Juneau - Albemarle Corp.","So, Jim, this is Matt, I'll take that one. We've said all along that the impact of ICL strike was much less on supply than you might have expected. They clearly did a good job in preparing for the strike, had an inventory available for the strike and serving their customers during the strike. So, I'd really say that the strike had a lot less impact than a lot of people seem to think. And we're much more comfortable with where pricing is going based on the trends we've seen overall in demand and based on \u2013 yeah, that the push to value is one way to describe that, obviously reflected in our adjusted EBITDA margins this quarter. And our outlook is for that to continue right now.","James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you for your question. Your next question comes from the line of Mike Harrison of Global Hunter Securities. Please go ahead.","Michael Harrison - Global Hunter Securities","Hi. Good morning.","Scott A. Tozier - Albemarle Corp.","Hi, Mike.","Michael Harrison - Global Hunter Securities","Joris, within the Surface Treatment business, you noted higher SG&A costs related to that Shanghai joint venture. Is that just structurally a lower margin business or are we going to be able to rationalize some of the SG&A costs over time?","Joris Merckx - Albemarle","Well, yes, we will see synergies and savings impacting our P&L going forward. The acquired business is pretty much automotive-driven and it is our strategy to diversify also our sales in China towards other segments with traditionally higher profitability as well. But it's more or less in line with what we see in other regions, so there is no big impact there.","Michael Harrison - Global Hunter Securities","All right. And then you announced a butyl lithium capacity rationalization. Obviously you had a key application go away there. Do you envision other applications coming back over time on the synthesis side? And can you also maybe speak to the butyl lithium demand more broadly, particularly as we look at some potential weakness in China. I know that's a key polymerization market for you.","Scott A. Tozier - Albemarle Corp.","Sure. Michael, I'll take it. If you look at butyl lithium, originally, we thought we would see enough growth in butyl lithium and other applications to fully cover the loss of that synthesis application from last year in 2015. We've covered a part of it, but not all of it. But other, if you will, other specialty lithiums have continued to grow, and that's reflected in some of the numbers. So I think, while we might not have covered it fully in butyl lithium, we've covered it in other ways at this point. And if you look at the outlook for the growth of elastomers over time, which is the key polymer application for butyl lithium or synthesis application, it will grow. It will grow over time. There's going to be \u2013 it's going to get covered; it's more a question of will it be 2016 now than 2015.","Michael Harrison - Global Hunter Securities","All right. Thanks very much.","Scott A. Tozier - Albemarle Corp.","Let me \u2013 maybe I should say one more thing though, that if you think about the rationalization, there was always a fair amount of redundant capacity in the butyl lithium supply chain that Rockwood had. And given our setup with organometallics, and the way we've looked at things, it's given us some freedom. So I don't think you should view that we're reducing our capacity to serve the butyl lithium market by this rationalization. We're still in good shape from a supply point of view; it's more just using our assets in a better way.","Operator","Thank you for your question. Your next question comes from the line of Tyler Frank of Robert Baird. Please go ahead.","Tyler Charles Frank - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Private Wealth Management)","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you could just give \u2013 provide a little bit more color on what you're seeing for the drilling completion fluids? Do you think that this will continue to decline over time if low oil prices stay where they are heading into 2016?","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah, I think \u2013 remember that we are strongest where our applications are in deepwater drilling. So, I believe that if they continue to come low, it depends totally what happens with the capital dollars related to drilling and where they go to drill. There is a lot of data out \u2013 I forget who put it out, but I read it earlier this week, that to keep the production flowing of the oil that they are pulling out, some of them are moving to quicker paybacks on some of the drilling, which takes them into the shallower water. So if oil stays low, I think next year you could continue \u2013 we expect the second half would be weaker than the first in 2015. And if oil stays where they are, you just have to see what they're going do from a capital standpoint, but it could certainly stay -w e could see the second half of 2015 longer. And historically, the longer oil prices have stayed down during a period of time, the longer it takes from an E&P standpoint for it to pick back up. And then we're the tail of the E&P. So, the longer it stays down, the longer drought I think you would expect to see. But, again, we're going to control what we can control from a cost standpoint, from a technology standpoint, from servicing our customers and meeting the demand where it's there.","Tyler Charles Frank - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Private Wealth Management)","Got it. And it sounds like demand for bromine remains strong; can you just talk about how you guys look at the overall market demand and price stability in terms of potential future price increases and when we should expect this, the original 30% price increase, to be fully baked into numbers and the model, and then how you guys look at potentially increasing prices again?","Scott A. Tozier - Albemarle Corp.","So, Tyler, clearly we're still in the implementation process on the initial price increase. I think we will differ the next price increase until we fully implement this one, but we feel good about the trends. What we've said along is that the demand question long-term around bromine is centered on flame retardants. And it's good now to see that we're seeing growth in 2014 over 2013 and we're seeing that growth continue in the first half of 2015. And we continue to feel good about that.","If you look at all of the other applications for bromine outside of FR, really the only one that's really a watch-out right now is the one we've been talking about just a second ago, which is what's going on with clear brine fluids. Long-term, that's still an area we feel very good about. Shorter-term or medium-term with low oil prices, we've got to deal with that. So, the trends are headed the right way in our view for overall bromine demand, with the exception of clear brines, which is more of a short-term to medium-term issue related to oil prices.","Tyler Charles Frank - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Private Wealth Management)","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you very much indeed for your questions. I would now like to turn the call over to Matt Juneau for the closing remarks.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. This is Luke. We've got a number of questions probably that I want to go ahead and address about Michael Wilson. When I talked to Michael about joining Albemarle a few years ago, I knew he had career aspirations to be CEO of a publically traded company, but the kind of guy he was I knew it was worth bringing him in and he came in and he has done an absolute fantastic job for Albemarle over the last two years, driving the business, and more importantly, putting in a leadership team in place that can run that business for him.","Now, Michael's got \u2013 received a great opportunity with Ingevity to become a CEO, to put together a brand new Board of Directors, to build his management team and do it all in a great place like Charleston, South Carolina. So we're very, very happy for Michael and wish him all the best. But that team that he put together in Performance Chemicals is clearly one of the top teams in the Specialty Chemical area in those businesses. And I'm absolutely confident in their capabilities to continue to drive this business, and we don't expect our Performance Chemicals business to skip a beat. Matt?","Matthew K. Juneau - Albemarle Corp.","Okay. Thanks, everyone, for joining the call. We appreciate your time and attention. And everybody have a great day.

(Operator Instructions).","As a reminder this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Lorin Crenshaw, Director, Investor Relations and Communications. Please proceed.","Lorin Crenshaw","Thank you, Suwanda and welcome everyone to Albemarle\u2019s fourth quarter 2011 earnings conference call. Our earnings were released after the close of market yesterday and you\u2019ll find our press release, earnings presentation and non-GAAP reconciliations posted on our website under the Investor Section at albemarle.com.","Joining me on the call today; are Luke Kissam, President and Chief Executive Officer; John Steitz, Chief Operating Officer; and Scott Tozier, Chief Financial Officer.

That same language applies to this call. Also, to the extent that we discuss any non-GAAP financial measures, you\u2019ll find reconciliations in our press release we just posted on our website at albemarle.com.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Luke.","Luke Kissam","Thank you Lorin and good morning everyone. We appreciate the opportunity to share our fourth quarter and full-year results with you today. I\u2019ll begin today by commenting on the company\u2019s quarterly and full-year results and we\u2019ll share a few highlights of some of the major initiatives that we have previously discussed with you. John Steitz will then walk you through business segment performance before Scott Tozier reviews financial highlights.","As usual, at the end of our prepared remarks we will open it up for your questions. I am delighted to report that despite a challenging global operating environment in the fourth quarter, Albemarle closed 2011 on a strong note with fourth quarter net income of $99 million or $1.11 per share, up 21% year-over-year. This marks the ninth consecutive quarter of year-over-year profitability improvement for us.","Net sales of $707 million were up 17% year-over-year while operating profits of $136 million were up 22%. Fourth quarter operations generated $209 million of cash flow and we ended the quarter at targeted inventory levels and better than expected working capital levels. Great results. In fact, from an earnings standpoint, it was the best fourth quarter in our history and prior to 2011, would have been the best quarter in our history.","These strong results capped a great 2011 for Albemarle. Full-year 2011 earnings were a record $436 million or $4.77 per share compared to $3.56 per share in 2010. Net sales for the year totaled $2.9 billion, up 21% year-over-year. Full-year EBITDA was a record $701 million and was up 29% year-over-year. Profitability as measured by either operating margins of 20% or segment margins of 24% respectively achieved new highs. ","Great year and a great first step towards Vision 2015.","Scott will talk more in a moment about our financial results in detail. However, I want to highlight that we generated around $0.5 billion of cash this year. That allowed us to increase our capital expenditures and plan for future growth, fund our pension liabilities, repurchase 3 million shares of stock and increase dividends to shareholders for the 17th straight year.","Even with those cash expenditures, we ended the year with the strongest balance sheet in our history and the financial flexibility to fund the many opportunities that we have before us to grow our business and provide reasonable returns to our shareholders. 2011 was not only an exceptional year from a financial standpoint, but I am also very proud of how we went about delivering these results. From an operation standpoint, our safety and stewardship performance was one of our best ever.","From an innovation standpoint, we were excited to announce the development of a proprietary technology for lithium extraction from our Magnolia branch. We proved the technology is commercially viable and competitive, set up our power plant in Magnolia and are well along in the development and design phase of our commercial unit.","As a further testament to our innovation, 31% of our sales were from products that were commercialized within the last five years. That type of innovation has helped us continue to expand our margins over the years. I am very proud of our 4000 employees around the world whose talents and discipline allowed us to deliver such outstanding results.","As I look to 2012 and beyond, there's many reasons to be optimistic about our business prospects. I am happy to report that we've met each of the critical milestones that we outlined for our major capital projects. We broke ground and are proceeding on schedule with our TEA joint venture with SABIC in Saudi Arabia and our wholly-owned poly-olefin catalyst center in Korea.","We are on schedule in the design and development stage of our HPC project with Petrobras in Brazil and are well on the construction on the doubling of our bromine and derivatives capacity in Jordan. All of these investments are required to address the needs of the marketplace and we look forward to bring them online over the next few years. ","Specifically bromine and Clear Completion Fluids in Jordan are expected to be operational in mid to late 2012 with Tetrabrom to follow in 2013. The Saudi and Korean sites should be operational in late 2012, early 2013 and the timing of Brazil which we currently project to be operational in 2015 will be largely dependant upon Petrobras\u2019 demand forecast.","The recent release of the EPA Mercury and Air Toxics Standards which require power plants to limit their emissions of toxic air pollutants including mercury should also be positive for us. We began positioning ourselves with this opportunity when we acquired Sorbent Technologies in 2008 and that business now forms the core of our environmental division which is well situated to assist the power industry to comply with this multi-pollutant standards through our portfolio of products and services.","In particular, we offer state-of-the-art demonstration services to provide air emissions monitoring and mitigation fees ability and engineering expertise to the market. This service allow prospective clients to evaluate various strategies for compliance before making significant capital outlays. As a result we remain optimistic about our ability to capitalize on this growth opportunity in our Vision 2015 timeframe.","Another example of how we are expanding our existing technology into adjacent markets is in the area of organometallics. For many years, Albemarle has been the market leader in organometallics with leading positions in TEA, MAO and TMA. TEA is the co-catalyst for poly-olefin and other growing markets. MAO is a leading activator for the production of single-side poly-olefins and TMA is an essential building block in the production of single-side activators serving the poly-olefin market and of ultra-high purity organometallics served in the LED and electronics markets. In recent months, we have completed capital projects that will enable us to increase production of our PureGrowth family of products to serve these growing markets. In 2012 we expect to add additional production capacity that will allow us to continue to maintain our leadership position in these markets for the foreseeable future.","Additionally, the projected trends in crude slates and refining economics bode well for our refinery catalyst business. We provide a wide range of over 60 different FCC catalysts and additive products and over a 120 different HPC catalyst products. However, our strong suite is where refineries are looking to upgrade the heaviest, dirtiest resist feeds that will generate maximum propylene yields. Given the fact, this is the sweetest light crudes are expected to become price year, it is becoming increasingly evident that we are poised to be profitable in the long run and need to invest in new units with the most advanced capabilities in processing cheaper, heavier crudes and still meet more stringent environmental standards such as lower sulfur specifications.","We continue to invest in catalyst developments in this area to maintain our competitive advantage and are well positioned to continue winning more than our bear share of installations and refills as refiners continue to migrate to heavier and more sour crude.","While this calls for an optimistic view of our future, there are headwinds to deal with and 2012 will be no exception. Some we already know about and others will surely develop during the year. For example, in 2011 we saw pension increase by $6 million to approximately $27 million. ","In 2012, pension expense will increase by approximately $20 million due to the combination of a decline in the discount rate used to measure our pension obligations and lower than forecasted asset performance in 2011.","I like to underscore that our funded status remains quite strong. Nearly 100% and we do not expect to need to make cash contributions to our plans until 2014 at the earliest. We are however, sworn methods of restructuring our defined benefit plan such as our non cash expense will be smaller and more predictable going forward, while at the same time providing the competitive benefit plan to our employees. We will share more on this topic in the coming quarters as we complete our assessment.","From a portfolio management standpoint, over the years, we\u2019ve shown consistent discipline in addressing underperforming assets. Such actions in fact have accounted for a portion of the margin expansion we\u2019ve experienced over the years.","We\u2019re currently engaged in a portfolio review that could result in our strategic alternatives for certain assets and businesses. As we\u2019ve done in the past, we will keep you updated as our plans begin to take shape.","In closing, our businesses are healthy and we expect to perform well in 2012. Our best guess today is our businesses will generate earnings during the first half of 2012, resembling levels achieved during the second half of 2011 and that the end markets we serve, would begin to accelerate in the second half of 2012.","If that recovery occurs, we would expect to grow our business in 2012 and continue to make progress towards the goals we outlined in Vision 2015. With that I will turn the call over to John to discuss our operational performance for the quarter.","John Steitz","Thanks Luke and good morning everyone. I will start with Polymer Solutions, which reported fourth quarter net sales of $209 million and segment income of $37 million on a double-digit volume decline. Weak mineral flame retardant volumes and unfavorable fixed cost absorption were the key drivers.","Polymer still achieved 18% segment margins reflecting the impact of structural changes in the business and an overall healthy pricing environment. Mineral flame retardants profits fell by more than 50% year-over-year during the quarter on 37% lower volume. Because Europe represents majority of our mineral flame retardant revenues, results were directly impacted by progressively worse sentiment throughout the quarter. ","Brominated flame retardant volumes rose 10% year-over-year or were down 8% sequentially as economic uncertainty prompted more conservative inventory management across the electronic supply chain. Lower anti-oxidants and curatives results also contributed to Polymer\u2019s quarterly performance.","Segment income for this division was down largely due to absence of a major production campaigns supporting high speed rail orders and the timing of select anti oxidant campaigns, which will now occur in the first quarter.","For the full year excellent pricing, reasonably strong demands through three fourths of the year and structural initiatives allowed Polymers to deliver full year net sales in excess of $1 billion for the first time, up 11% year-over-year; a record segment income of $238 million up 20%, and record segment margins up 24% an expansion of 180 basis points year-over-year.","Looking forward to 2012, January flame retardants order patterns are picking up with enclosures, connectors and printed wiring board order patterns all reflecting more positive trends in recent weeks. We continue to monitor customer order patterns closely and remain focused on keeping our inventory levels in line with customer demand.","In catalyst, higher pricing and healthy global volume drove fourth quarter net sales of $290 million, up 25% year over year; segment income of $84 million, up 43% year over year and segment margins of 29%, up 400 basis points year-over-year. Refinery catalyst revenue and segment income growth of 30% and 53% year-over-year was largely driven by strong and balanced portfolio.","For the full year broad based strength across each division resulted in sales exceeding $1 billion for the first time at $1.1 billion, up 25% year-over-year. Catalyst also reported record segment income of $324 million, up 30%, and all time high segment margins of 29%, up 100 basis points.","Each division delivered excellent financial results with refinery catalyst sales and segment income rising 28% and 32% to all time highs as FCC and HPC both generated record income levels. Similarly the performance catalyst solutions sales and segment income rose 20% respectively to new records.","Polymer catalyst results were driven by combination of continued growth within the components business where we have a long standing leadership position and excellent traction within the finished catalyst adjacency.","Notably, the electronic materials divisions is an emerging growth driver. The successful introduction and acceptance within the market place of our PureGrowth family of products into the emerging LED markets is a having a positive impact.","Heading into 2012 the first quarter outlook for HPC is quite strong. FCC should generate modest growth, as emerging market driven demand offsets developed economy\u2019s sluggishness where weaker miles driven remain apparent. Within Performance Catalyst Solutions, long running trends driving demand for specialty and bulk plastics should continue to support organometallics growth supplemented by the impact of new technologies.","Fine Chemistry had a superb quarter setting a record for net sales which rose 36% year-over-year to $209 million; segment income of 62% year-over-year to $43 million and profitability with segment margins rising 300 basis points year-over-year to 20%. Results were driven by record Performance Chemicals and Fine Chemistry Services revenue up 20% and 67% and record segment income at each division.","Performances business unit reflects a diverse net of growth opportunities and the successful transformation of its product portfolio in recent years. Performance Chemicals growth was driven by completion fluids which ended the year in a strong position to support higher growth levels in the Middle-East and rejuvenated Gulf of Mexico. However, strong market control, water treatment and food safety growth also contributed handsomely to results.","Fine Chemistry Services growth was driven in part by doubling of long-term programs in the Specialty Materials and Ag sectors and our strategy of evolving this business toward becoming an enabler and partner in developing complex chemical processes is beginning to payoff. A year-on-year doubling in Ag and remediates profits and good specialty pharmaceutical results were also important.","For the full year, strong pricing and excellent volumes within each division were a record net sales of $750 million, up 32% year-over-year and they are doubling in segment income to a record $140 million, and the highest profitability in segment history to segment margins of 19%. The performance of our quarter brine fluids business was noteworthy, as the business is poised for a strong 2012.","Overall, Fine Chemistry set for another excellent year of growth in 2012 with a great pipeline of custom projects within Fine Chemistry Services and a healthy portfolio of exciting new advancements of bromine chemistry into food protection, energy and stewardship of our environment.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Scott to discuss some more financial results.","Scott Tozier","Thank you John and good morning everyone. It\u2019s tough to overstate how impressive the company\u2019s 2011 financial results have been given the macroeconomic backdrop. I am pleased to confirm that on a full year basis, we met each financial objective laid out in the Vision 2015 planning framework articulated at Investor Day. You will recall that framework cultured double-digit growth in revenue, earnings per share and cash flow, a focus on disciplined capital allocation and 20% returns on capital. Each year, on our march towards 2015, will not be as robust as 2011, but it\u2019s nice to be off to a great start.","In the fourth quarter, we generated EBITDA of about $153 million [$163 million], up 16% year-over-year and an EBITDA margin of 23%, roughly in-line with the year ago period. Full year EBITDA rose 29% to $701 million, year-over-year to a new record with full year EBITDA margins of 24.4%, up 140 basis points and also setting a new record.","In terms of P&L items of note, R&D expense was $19 million during the quarter, up 29% and ended the year at $77 million up 32% as we continue to invest in a number of organic growth opportunities including the strategic adjacency initiatives we outlined as part of 2015. For the full-year R&D cost as a percent of revenue were 2.7%, rising 20 basis points versus 2.5% in 2010.","Fourth quarter SG&A expense rose 12% year-over-year and ended the full-year at $312 million, up 17% versus 2010 driven principally by performance-based pay and higher pension expense. These costs were well contained for the year declined 30 basis points as a percentage of net sales to 10.9% versus 11.2% in 2010.","Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter and full-year was 23.3% and 23.6% respectively, essentially flat versus the full-year 2010 rate of 23.6%,as the level and location of our income helped us to maintain our rate year-over-year.","Our Vision 2015 planning framework set-forth an expectation of generating a cumulative $3 billion in cash from operations over five years. Fourth quarter and full-year 2011 results place us on target in this regard. Specifically, exceptional earnings results and our focus on cash generation during the quarter translated into cash flow from operations of $209 million excluding pension and post retirement contributions during the fourth quarter, which contributed to outstanding full-year cash from operations of $553 million excluding $60 million of pension contributions up 34% year-over-year. We closed the year with net debt of $294 million, down 11% from year-end 2010.","During the year when each business unit established new net sales records maintaining working capital discipline was essential to our success at driving such strong cash flow generation. Specifically, net working capital as a percentage of sales ended the year roughly 200 basis points lower at 18% compared with 20% in 2010. In absolute dollars, net working capital only rose 7% year-over-year to $507 million compared with a 21% net sales increase for the year, an extremely healthy 1,400 basis point gap between the two.","We are also on or ahead of target from a capital allocation standpoint as measured by CapEx, dividends and share repurchases. Specifically in 2011, we invested $198 million in CapEx of which $41 million was related to our joint-venture Jordan Bromine Company or JBC as we made strategic investments essential to capitalize on opportunities we have identified and just deliver the organic growth strategy we\u2019re pursuing.","Regarding dividends, we raised our quarterly rate by a total of 25% this year and overall distributed $58 million in dividends to shareholders during the year. Notably, the total increase was much higher than the 10% to 15% average increase per annum guidance indicated in our planning framework.","In terms of share repurchases, in 2011 we returned $178 million to shareholders by purchasing 3 million shares or roughly 3% of the total shares outstanding at the end of 2010. Given that our planning framework indicates that we intend to buyback between $200 million and $400 million by 2015, we\u2019re clearly ahead of plan on this measure as we nearly bought back the low end of that range this year alone.","Looking forward to 2012, we expect CapEx to approach $300 million as we commence the expansion of bromine derivatives capacity at JBC in Jordan. We continue construction of the plant that we are building in Korea and expansion of our U.S. metal [appeals] capability to name a few of the investments.","Nearly all the projected $100 million year-over-year delta between projected 2012 CapEx versus 2011 is related to the expansion at JBC, a joint venture that is consolidated on our financial statements. It\u2019s worth noting that this will be entirely funded from JBC\u2019s cash from operations with no long-term incremental debt preferred.","From a foreign exchange standpoint, we foresee that the decline in Euro in recent months if it persists near current levels through 2012 will represent a headwind at the average rate reflected in our 2011 financial results was approximately $1.40 per Euro. We estimate that each $0.01 change in the dollar-Euro exchange rate impacts earnings per share by approximately $0.01 due to translation. Today, the Euro is trading at $1.30 which will result in an annualized headwind of roughly $0.10 per share.","In terms of taxes, at this time, we expect our 2012 effective rate to be around 25%. In 2012, we will continue to focus on generating excellent cash flows and making improvements in our working capital efficiency. Our ability to generate cash from earnings will give us the ability to fund our organic growth and acquisition opportunities and return cash to shareholders.","With that I will turn the call back over to Lorin for Q&A","Lorin Crenshaw","Operator, at this time we will take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you (Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank","John, you mentioned some order in pattern improvements in bromine as far as in January, is that normal seasonality or is that something more from restocking or a pick up in market demand you think?","John Steitz","Yeah, David, normally we have a weaker December with inventory corrections and I think that was a bit exaggerated at the end of 2011. So I think a bit of that is normal seasonality and we have the Chinese New Year kicking in relatively early. So we are still hoping for a bit of a boost in the first quarter here as customers restock. But I will add this David. We saw more emergency orders in the brominated flame retardant chain than I think I can recall in near-term history.","So it\u2019s just another asset to consider and there is a lot of destocking going on along in the chain.","David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank","And just on HPC, you mentioned a strong Q1 order book. How does Q2 and even Q3 look in that product chain?","John Steitz","Well, I would say overall where say six months ago, we thought very confident that we would have pretty high mid-teens year-over-year volume growth. I would say we have mitigated that a little bit, but year-over-year we still see volume growth in the 7% to 10% range in HPC. So we are starting out very strong in the first quarter. As we said sold out and second quarter, we will dip a little bit from that level.","But generally, I mean, there is a lot of better seasonality there too because everyone is at least in North America and Europe preparing for the driving season. So we typically have stronger HPC volumes in the first quarter and that mitigates a little bit in the second quarter, but overall for the year we feel still very good about it.","David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank","And John just last on your JBC expansion, what will take your bromine capacity to and where is it coming from?","Luke Kissam","From a JBC expansion, it will take JBC in the range of 120,000 met tons at JBC for running flat out.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of PJ Juvekar with Citigroup. Please proceed.","PJ Juvekar - Citigroup","You know in polymer additives, it\u2019s almost like two different segments with brominated flame retardant seems to be doing well and then you have the struggling portfolio of mineral flame retardants, antioxidants and curatives. I was wondering if you could slice those two pieces and compare the profitability for us?","John Steitz","The real driver for us has always been brominated flame retardants in our polymer\u2019s business, no question about it. So typically we are talking about in the range of 2\/3rds of our profitability on brominated flame retardants, but one thing I\u2019d note for you is what we saw in bromine in the fourth quarter was reasonably healthy volumes, you know we talked about a 10% up year-over-year, down a bit sequentially. But when we saw that, we really took some aggressive steps, you know we had sales down sequentially 7% to 8%, but we did take production down over 20% and we brought our inventories down very healthily, so to give us a good position for 2012.","But anyway, hopefully that frames up the various pieces for you. The biggest issue we had in the fourth quarter in polymers was by far mineral flame retardants with all of our, majority of our business being based in Europe and every time Italy or Berlusconi or Greece was mentioned, you know, we saw a decline in customer orders in that business. So the good news is we see volumes picking back up in the first quarter which is good.","PJ Juvekar - Citigroup","And then secondly you talked about lithium extraction in Arkansas, can you tell us how much lithium is there in the brine compared to some other deposits and what kind of operating earnings impact can you expect from that?","Luke Kissam","","Yeah, from a standpoint of what lithium is in the brine, PJ, it\u2019s hard to tell until we get in there and actually start operating. We\u2019ve got estimates based on what the brine is and we think that we\u2019re going to have, what I would say is a commercially viable process and volume. You obviously can\u2019t enter that market with too limited a volume where you can\u2019t really have a real play to be consistent for your customer. So we wouldn\u2019t be going in if we didn\u2019t think we could have a commercial scale product there.","And I think that when we look in at it, when we get both of them done, both sides done we would be in the range of 10% or so of the market. It is what we would hope to be able to capture from those lithium extraction technology we have today.","John Steitz","But very cost competitive position, PJ, at the end of the day.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Bob Koort - Goldman Sachs","I was wondering if you could give us a little update on taking out the rare earths in your catalyst business. Obviously there was a strong need to do that just six, nine, 12 months ago and looks like that need is moderated a bit, so has that sort of stifled the transition, are you agnostic to that change and just give us an update there.","John Steitz","Yeah, you bet, Bob. Bob you bet. I mean over the summer, rare earths were approaching a $140,000 a ton and now they are in the $50,000 ton range, so I mean it seems to me from everything I have read, from customers around the globe that that pressure you know is mitigating. There is some definite relief there. We always inherently had lower rare earths levels. We've got our rare earths level down to on average about 1.5%.","I think we are being helped a bit by the volatility in the crude slate as Luke mentioned, very much heavier crudes being utilized globally, but anyway to answer your question it has mitigated a bit, but us and others I think have been reasonably successful in helping this broad slate of refiners globally achieve what they are trying to achieve with on rare earths.","Bob Koort - Goldman Sachs","And Luke you mentioned something about maybe finding or coming through and finding some assets that you can do some with from an M&A standpoint. I guess maybe I wasn\u2019t paying attention closely enough, but is that separate and distinct from the 2015 plan and if so why wouldn\u2019t that have been incorporated then?","Luke Kissam","When I was talking about M&A, what I was looking at is some of our underperforming assets, so we have got some assets that we look at from time to time, are all these assets giving kind of returns that we need. And you know we want to surprise you guys with the fact that you are doing an evaluation today and maybe taking some actions. Well I want to highlight today that we have got that evaluation under way which should result in possible divestiture or shutdown some assets or consolidating and want to give you heads up on that. ","We are still looking on the outlook for M&A that would be still be included within that Vision 2015, hadn\u2019t pulled the trigger on anything, very meaningful today, but that don\u2019t mean we haven\u2019t been out there knocking on doors and looking and still think that\u2019s a critical piece of our Vision 2015. ","Bob Koort - Goldman Sachs","So is it fair any assets you are considering would be modest in scale?","Luke Kissam","Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies & Company. Please proceed.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies & Company","I guess first of all a question across your bromine derivative portfolio. Can you give us updates on pricing trends and if there were no further price increases in 2012, how much of a tailwind, you'd expect all else being equal?","John Steitz","Overall, our price environment has remained very healthy across the bromine chain. If you look at brominated flame retardants and I strip out the mix effects, our brominated flame retardant pricing improved sequentially 3% and up over 25% year-over-year. That\u2019s a pretty significant driver for us. In clear brines, that\u2019s in course fine chemistry, you know our pricing has remained pretty healthy there and we\u2019re seeing some significant step up in volumes.","So we will revisit that as we go forward, but overall very across bromine, brominated flame retardants and some of our advanced bromine derivatives remains very healthy from a pricing point of view. I say the biggest impact going forward in 2012 is the improvement brominated flame retardants beyond the first half and that\u2019s going to be I\u2019d say the most significant issue that they we are tracking from a pricing volume point of view.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies & Company","But is it fair to say just triangulating very roughly on the derivatives portfolio, it looks as if that will contribute about 2% to 4% total topline sales? Is that roughly the right order of magnitude?","John Steitz","On the entire bromine chain, yeah I\u2019d say that\u2019s a pretty good assumption.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies & Company","And then for the custom you know the custom chemistries that you are doing in fine chemistry for some of the new technology applications, do you have a rough sense for how much of the tailwind that could be?","John Steitz","Next year?","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies & Company","In 2012?","John Steitz","You know we\u2019ve always said it you know some of these new products extended out of full year would be in the $0.15 to $0.20 per share range. So our fine chemistry model is really working well, very proud of it and a lot of new opportunities coming in.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies & Company","And than just lastly, can you give an update on mineral flame retardant pricing?","Luke Kissam","Mineral flame retardant pricing in the fourth quarter held-in there pretty well. So it was roughly flat sequentially, up 4% to 5% year-over-year. We got the euro going down year-over-year. That impacts our translation on pricing. The general view in Europe is with volumes softening in the fourth quarter, pricing discipline was awfully good and now we are seeing volumes pick up. So overall we are hanging in there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Sison with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Mike Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets","In terms of 2012, you sort of gave us a couple of headwinds of foreign currency, pension, and looks like tax rate teeny bit higher. Could you help us frame up some of the positives that could offset those headwinds and I think you sort of softly suggested earnings should grow in \u201912 versus \u201911?","","Scott Tozier","I think what I am trying to do Mike is, right now, we have got some good dynamics for our catalyst business. So catalyst, I feel good. I think when we talked to you previously, we were talking about if we got an 80, 80, 80, 80 kind of four quarters from catalyst, just kind of strong quarters like that, we would feel good about that and we\u2019re still doing it, we could pop up there. ","In fine chemicals, John had outlined some of the things in fine chemistry services. Clear completion fluids should be strong in 2012. Halliburton was pretty bullish, on the Gulf. So that bodes well for us because we did in 2011, did a lot of clear completion fluids in the Gulf. Those were internationally.  So, fine chemical services should continue to build on that momentum and I think have a stronger year in 2012 than it did in 2011, so both of those feel really good.","It really comes down to polymers and what\u2019s going to happen from a mineral flame retardant standpoint in Europe. How Europe is going to recover in that wire and cable market and how our mineral flame retardant will respond, as well as, are we going to see a pickup in the second half of the year on Brominated Flame retardants and actually key into that electronics markets. So, if we see the economy recover in the second half of the year, like we expect, we should be able to grow our business and continue on our path, the Vision 2015, Mike.","Mike Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Okay, great, and then, John, in terms of the fourth quarter, where were your operating rates for bromine and where they are tracking now?","John Steitz","Mike. The derivatives from the flame retardants were running about 70%. The overall Bromine chain was pretty close to sold out, Mike. I would tell you the pick up in clear completion fluids our more controlled business is doing much better, second half was really strong for us. We mentioned some of the new products in food protection. And so our bromine chain was very tight, call it 98%, 95%.","Mike Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets","So, these you had in the fourth quarter from, sort of, reducing your inventories. How big was that and that sort of comes back in the first in terms of profitability?","John Steitz","Yeah. The, well, what I tried to indicate in our script was we\u2019re going to keep an eye closely on inventory. So, we stay in line with customer demand. But we also believe that the fourth quarter 2011 bottomed up from profitability perspective and we\u2019re taking that number up in the first quarter. So, that feels pretty good. So the impact of reducing production volumes in the brominated flame retardant chain was probably $10 million to $15 million of absorption issue for us in the fourth quarter of \u201911. So we feel we got inventories in a good position right now.","Mike Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets","And then last question on brominated flame retardant pricing is, you have some flow through, don't you, heading into this year and any expectations on further price increases depending on I guess how demand unfolds in the second half?","John Steitz","Yeah, Mike we are just going to keep a real close eye on that. We feel really positive about it and we get a nice correction and political environment calms down a bit and we get on top, I mean those kind of volume trends all help the pricing environment.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas of JPMorgan. Please proceed.","Jeff Zekauskas - JPMorgan","So in the first quarter to just to clarify, you expect your average prices to be higher than they were in the year ago period?","John Steitz","Yeah, that's correct, yeah. There would be pricing across polymers probably up mid-single digit year-over-year excluding any mix effects.","Jeff Zekauskas - JPMorgan","Secondly, can you talk about your, I guess maybe your three or four major raw materials and how you expect them to fair for 2012 and what might be the effect on your income statement?","Luke Kissam","Jeff, let me give you a shot on that. I mean if you look at that from a dollar stand point, I understand it's the metals that our going to our catalyst business, moly and the nickel and the metals as well as the rare earths. So we talked in detail about rare earths, where that's going from the 140,000 in that time to 55,000 in that time. ","The key on that is this going to be how the pricing in the contracts that we passed through that rare earths and the cost that we acquired rare earths for and what that spread does and how we are able to manage that. The metals for HPC does seem to be fairly stable John, across 2012. So we wouldn't see that, John.","The other impact is where we\u2019ve got our biggest volume of products would be due to a high rate in our mineral flame retardant business and there are limited numbers of suppliers there and we finalize on negotiation of those contracts and should have a little bit of headwind there but we are working to mitigate that and are trying to find a way to find some alternative sources that that will allow us to be better there. So from a volume standpoint I think it is 88 from a dollar standpoint we got the metals and the rare earths we talked about previously. ","John Steitz","Okay and then you have the fencings and all, BPA and a change in the volatility associated with it Jeff. So we always try to work to get that passed through. As we mentioned rare earths and metals and overtime that should really have no impact on the P&L.","Jeff Zekauskas - JPMorgan","And do you get some benefits from lowering natural gas prices and from lower chlorine costs?","John Steitz","Chlorine is pretty stable. We\u2019re in bit of tailwinds situation network on natural gas. Natural gas consumption is based on production levels. But that could be a little bit of better, every buck is call it a nickel.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Schwartz with First Analysis. Please proceed.","Steve Schwartz - First Analysis","John if you could at least help us with the year-over-year volumes change for HPC and FCC in the fourth quarter give some idea how those changed?","John Steitz","Yeah, it was, HPC was flat year over year and up just year sequentially, Steve.","Steve Schwartz - First Analysis","Okay. So that was HPC and FCC?","John Steitz","Yeah, FCC was up little bit sequentially you know call it 27 and 8% and really flat year-over-year.","Steve Schwartz - First Analysis","Okay.","John Steitz","Really impact there. Though I will say that the mix really improved and as I have said this crude slate is getting more difficult to deal with. We\u2019re seeing more heavy resist FCC catalyst sales than we did year ago.","Steve Schwartz - First Analysis","Okay. and as you are going to the first quarter here in the order book for HPC is strong. Doesn\u2019t that usually have an impact to negative impact on FCC volume?","John Steitz","Yeah, there is that seasonal impact Steve for sure. So we probably start to get little bit slower on FCC volumes but picking up through the course the summer spring season.","Steve Schwartz - First Analysis","Yeah.","John Steitz","That\u2019s right.","Steve Schwartz - First Analysis","And so you are coming off a quarter to fourth quarter where the operating margin in that business was pretty strong. What impact would you expect that to have on first half margin in that part of the business?","John Steitz","For the whole year, we think we can hold this margin. So, we had a really nice spike in the third quarter of longer term. To get our margins at that level is our real goal. But we feel pretty confident about holding onto the margin level of what we achieved in the fourth quarter.","Steve Schwartz - First Analysis","Would you feel you had a bit of a tailwind in the fourth quarter as a result of declining cost in rare earths versus pricing?","John Steitz","Right. We have talked about that in the past and that impacts that business by 150, depending on the mix 150 to call 250 basis point margin this year.","","Steve Schwartz - First Analysis","Okay, and then just one last one for Scott. You guys mentioned the higher pension expense, should we just assume then corporate expense for 2012 would be about $20 million to $25 million higher than it was in \u20182011?","Scott Tozier","Yeah. Corporate expense, yeah. That\u2019s about right from the pension impact, although some of it gets absorbed into the businesses as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Edward Yang with Oppenheimer. Please proceed.","Edward Yang - Oppenheimer","Just feed-backing on the previous question on catalyst volumes in the fourth quarter were marginally negative and you mentioned HPC and FCC were basically flat. Could you just elaborate why the volumes were flat there?","John Steitz","Yeah, yeah. That\u2019s a good pick. Yeah, you are right. In fourth quarter 2011 volumes were down a bit. In the last quarter of \u201910 there is a lot of, what I\u2019d call, experimentation going on and we did sell some regenerated catalyst in FCC, which is a little bit unusual for us and that happened in fourth quarter of \u201910. So the year-on-year volume comparison is a little bit awkward, if you will because of that, volume spike last year.","Edward Yang - Oppenheimer","Okay, and what are your expectations for 2012? Catalyst volumes what would that be?","John Steitz","I am sorry, Ed, I was talking over you.","Edward Yang - Oppenheimer","Overall expectations for catalyst volumes, you mentioned HPC up a mid-single digit, FCC you expect to be up positively as well?","John Steitz","Yes, we do, yeah. I would call mid-single digit as well. So overall our volume outlook right now is reasonably healthy.","Edward Yang - Oppenheimer","Okay. And Fine Chemistry, your volumes were very strong there, up 24%. Was that more, you mentioned, custom projects in both clear and [bulk] brines, which was the larger contributor and your expectation for 2012 volumes?","John Steitz","Yeah. The Fine Chemistry, [ag, intermediates] and the new materials was probably about 60% of the total 40% was clear brine\u2019s mercury control and food safety. So hopefully I will give you a little feel there.","Edward Yang - Oppenheimer","I mean, what\u2019s a good run-rate for growth in 2012 because I know, Fine Chemistry could be somewhat lumpy in terms of the growth.","John Steitz","Yeah, because of the nature of those products, and we sell some products in gram quantities that could drive down the share for us, right? But I would say overall, projection, we will grow volumes in Fine Chemistry, the [SBU] and total year-over-year and we\u2019re seeing a pretty strong tailwind right now in Clear Brine fluid\u2019s activity, especially with the products slate we play into, deeper exploration and usage of heavier brines.","Edward Yang - Oppenheimer","Okay, and just finally on Polymer Solutions volume could you just talk a little bit on the volatility you are seeing there; you know your guidance for fourth quarter volumes were more flattish, it came in below that and you had indicated you are seeing some improvement there, but in the prior quarter you saw some improvement as well. So what happened from November to December to lead to the sequential volume decline you saw?","John Steitz","So, you know I would say the biggest volume driver for us was clearly mineral flame retardants and we saw a weaker back half, the half of October, we saw a weak November and really running on thins in December. As a matter of fact, I remember our biggest US customer, we actually had a delivery scheduled on a Saturday just giving an idea of inventory levels and it didn\u2019t arrive till the following Monday and it shut our plant down. This was the raw material of entire shipments probably $30,000 or $40,000.","So it just gives you a feel of how low our customer base is running their inventory levels to, but it\u2019s just crazy. And it has the mineral flame retardant volumes have as I said, appear to be picking up now in the first quarter.","In brominated we had a pretty good September so we talked about we are feeling pretty good going into the fourth quarter. We also saw it really slowdown in November which surprised us; a lot of destocking there. And as I mentioned, we saw more emergency orders and we can recall in near term history in December and volumes appear to be picking back up. So overall, we don't want to get carried away with our polymer view for the first quarter, but we believe our profit level will improve in the first quarter of \u201912.","Luke Kissam","Yeah, this is Luke. To give you a little bit of idea, if you look at mineral flame retardants, our volumes in mineral flame retardants in the fourth quarter will lower than the volumes that we saw in first quarter of 2009. So we had all time low from a volume standpoint in mineral flame retardants. Bromine like John said was up, but that\u2019s a big volume over there; we\u2019ve made a lot of volume in it and it was down to that level.","So remember when we talked in the third quarter or in autumn we talked to you about how we have strengthened this business over the years taking these hard steps with pricing, with asset consolidations, with some efficiencies\u2019 that we've got. I think the fourth quarter, we\u2019re sitting here talking about how we had a sluggish quarter, if you really look overall from an Albemarle standpoint, it would have been the best quarter in the history of the company before 2011.","So we had some real challenges that we have overcame and our hope that people understand what this means for the strength of our business. We\u2019ve got strong business and we feel good about 2012; if we can get some help from that economy, in the second half we can grow this business; but it is going to be the second half here in 2012.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from the line of Dimitry Silversteyn with Longbow research. Please proceed.","Dimitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research","A couple of questions that I have and one you sought of answered that on a couple of discrepancies that we are seeing in the growth of volumes in the Fine Chemicals division and in the Polymer Services division or solutions division. But it sounds like majority of the volume growth was attributed to the custom synthesis part of the business.","On the catalyst margins, if you kind of take what Luke has said about that sort of 80 million a year a quarter run-rate you know roughly speaking in terms of profitability, it looks like your year-over-year profitability will be similar 2012 to what you have delivered in 2011 about 26%, 27%.","You know you have quite a bit of step-up in the last couple of years; so what you know with metal price declining, with rare earth prices declining, with all of these projects that you have going on-stream in 2012 in South Korea and in Saudi Arabia with a much maturation of the Polymer Catalyst business, why would we not expect to see more meaningful margin expansion and profit growth in the Catalyst division in 2012 versus 2011?","John Steitz","Yeah, let me take a crack at that Dimitry; but just to clarify, you know what Luke said is, we see a new base in the catalyst call it 80 million a quarter with one quarter of that is likely to pop-up for us, you know maybe in the heavier driving season, we don\u2019t know if its going to be second quarter or third quarter you know at this point, but we see that and we believe we will grow our catalyst business, I mean we\u2019re really clear about that. And margins, managing margins with raw materials and like you said rare earth is all part of that equation.","So some of the larger projects you highlighted which we are really excited about and our Performance Catalyst Solutions business which is probably often Catalyst business, we\u2019re very excited about, we\u2019re very excited about the growth in LED in our Korean plant, but those aren\u2019t really positioned to have an impact on 2012. I would say that and our SOCC joint venture SABIC on organometallics in Saudi Arabia, those are all 2013. And so we really feel good about being positioned for long-term and lithium falls into that too.","So, but we believe we can just summarize, and we\u2019ve been to grow our Catalyst business 2012 and we\u2019re positioning it for some exciting growth in 2013 and onward.","Dimitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research","Okay, alright. Thanks for that color John. And then a question about Polymer Solutions margins, I understand that when you are running your flame retardant business at 20% utilization rate, it\u2019s hard to get good margin. On the other hand mineral flame retardants, which sounds like the area where you suffered the most volume decline; it also happens to be I believe, one of your lower margin businesses. So why wouldn\u2019t you have a positive mix impact on margins and you know -- I mean, I would expect to see that at mid-teens operating margin out of the polymer additives. So, I guess I am just looking for some clarification of what happened there in terms of under-absorption versus pricing and declining raw materials and improving mix?","John Steitz","Yeah, so I think the overwriting point I like to make as year-over-year and sequentially for that matter in the fourth quarter, we had probably a 15 million in under-absorption in brominated flame retardants and it was probably in mineral flame retardants in the $5 million to $8 million range. So that gives you a feel, if it haven\u2019t been for that we would have been right in the box of where our profitability was at the end of 2010.","So it\u2019s really, I would say we kind of had the luxury of two really strong businesses performing very, very well and we saw that midway through the quarter. And we decided to get more aggressive in terms of our inventory levels in the flame retardant chain and for that matter curatives and anti-oxidants.","Dimitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research","Okay. So it sounded like that the slightly positive volume year-over-year account that you had in brominated flame retardants you talked about was mostly in inventory liquidation rather than manufacturing, so your under-absorption was over-emphasized if you will, relative to the numbers which you\u2019ve delivered?","John Steitz","Yeah, just to state, in brominated flame retardants, our sales sequentially were down about 7%. We took production down 20%. And we took inventories down between 15% and 20%.","Dimitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research","Okay.","John Steitz","In polymers, so, I mean it was, I thought, really good cash management and you saw some really strong cash generation from the company. So I mean that all has kind of played into trying to position ourselves you know, to grow a company in 2012.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Todd Vencil with Sterne Agee. Please proceed.","Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee","Most of my questions have been knocked out, but you mentioned expansion in the U.S polyolefin catalyst capacity this year. Can you remind us of what\u2019s going on there and how much you\u2019re adding?","John Steitz","Yeah, I mean, what we\u2019re trying to do is a lot of these new, we talked about organometallics with TEA and MAO and TMA. This apply that all fall into that market for plastics as well as the LED and electronics chains and we\u2019re doing some fairly significant debottlenecking so that we can make sure that we are ready to supply that growing demand going forward. So, that\u2019s a big growth area for us. We\u2019re excited about it and we want to make sure that we\u2019ve got the capacity there to serve the customers that what they need around the globe.","Luke Kissam","Yeah, and in our plant here in Baton Rouge where we make our active Cat line of products, which is a total catalyst solution for polyolefin producers. We expanded that plant during the downturn and it was sold out almost immediately. So that\u2019s an additional debottlenecking we\u2019re doing here right in town.","Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee","So broadly speaking, I mean are you sort of super tight and generally sold out across the polyolefin catalyst in the US you know in addition to the active Cat recently?","John Steitz","As the general rule, that's a very broad statement but as a general rule, yes, its been very tight and we feel we need to take the steps to expand around the globe in addition to what we are doing in Korea and in addition to what we are doing in Saudi to be able to service the customers and be there with the solutions that they need and when they need it.","Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee","And broadly speaking, how much do you feel like you are going to be able to get these debottlenecking?","Luke Kissam","In terms of revenue?","Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee","Percentage wise.","Luke Kissam","Oh boy.","Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee","Or revenue, either way.","Scott Tozier","15% to 18% to 20%.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line Aleksey Yefremov with Bank of America. Please proceed.","Aleksey Yefremov - Bank of America","I just wanted to double check on elemental bromine chain, on bromine chain. In elemental bromine, John I think you mentioned your utilization was about 95% in the quarter?","John Steitz","Right Aleksey.","Aleksey Yefremov - Bank of America","Does that mean that you might be capacity constrained in the first half of \u201912 before Jordan expansion kicks in?","Luke Kissam","This is Luke. We do not fore say what we\u2019re going to have any situation where we are capacity constrained. There are some debottlenecks that we can do, we\u2019ve expanded some wells in Magnolia, that will becoming online and we feel great about the capacity that we need to be able to service it and when we bring it online there is going to be a lot of questions about this. So when we bring that capacity in Jordan online remember we\u2019re going to bring it on an as needed to meet the demand that we see out there. Its not such that we've got a habit of running a 100% on day one, we will be very good at storage of that bromine and bringing online as needed. So I don\u2019t say we\u2019re in under supply in the short term or an over supply in the long term.","Aleksey Yefremov - Bank of America","And then just a quick follow-up on antioxidants campaign that has spilled over into Q1 what\u2019s the approximate impact on sales or earnings? ","John Steitz","You know that all these things said when we run one of these campaigns for our curatives business it usually absorbs, call it $4 million to $5 million. So we\u2019re continuing to manage inventories very tightly as we mentioned Aleksey. So broadly speaking, we view that our polymers business is going to pick up in the first quarter, but we're managing it very closely and we don't want anybody to get carried away with the expectation here, but we feel, we've have been through the worst in the fourth quarter.","Operator","And with no further questions, I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Lorin Crenshaw for closing remarks.","Lorin Crenshaw","Well, we thank you for your time and your questions and look forward to seeing you at Investor Day and certainly give me a call with any further questions.","Operator","Thank you for joining today's conference.

At the end of our prepared remarks, Silvio, Joris, and Michael will join Scott and me to address your questions.","Scott will discuss complete company results in just a few minutes, but to start the call I'd like to focus on the first quarter performance of Albemarle's three GBUs: Performance Chemicals, Refining Solutions and Chemetall Surface Treatment.","On a constant currency basis, with the first quarter of 2014, these businesses delivered revenue growth of over 4%, including the 12 days of unreported January sales for the former Rockwood businesses. On the same basis, adjusted EBITDA grew by over 6% in the quarter. We are very pleased with our start to 2015, which demonstrates the resilience and margin power of our businesses and our ability to cope with challenges in some of our key markets, and currency headwinds caused by the strengthening U.S. dollar. Indeed, the combined adjusted EBITDA margins of our three GBUs was 28% in the first quarter of 2015.","Scott will talk business segment performance in more detail and will help reconcile to the reported numbers, but at a high level, Performance Chemicals had a strong quarter in all segments, with our Lithium and Performance Catalyst businesses both showing strong improvement versus the first quarter 2014 pro forma results, and our Bromine businesses delivering a solid quarter that exceeded our January expectations.","Chemetall Surface Treatment showed excellent growth on a constant currency basis, with both volume and price improvement compared to the first quarter 2014. Refining Solutions was weaker than expected, driven by weakness in Clean Fuels Technologies related to delay change-outs, weaker mix and fewer first-fill opportunities.","After closing the Rockwood transaction on January 12, we continued to make strong progress toward all of our key 2015 objectives. First, our integration team has already initiated projects that deliver $40 million of synergies in 2015, and we are confident that we will achieve our full year 2015 goal of $50 million through ongoing projects. The $40 million in 2015 savings will become $48 million of full year savings in 2016, putting us well on our way to our $100 million target for 2016.","Second, our businesses are already being run in a structure consistent with the global business unit realignment announced in January. This new structure is helping to increase our market focus and push the organization to capture additional synergies.","Third, our first quarter adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow and net debt only increase our confidence in our ability to rapidly delever in line with our target of 2.5 times net debt-to-EBITDA by the end of 2017. Consistent with the confidence in our cash generation power, we increased our dividend by 5% to an annual rate of $1.16 per share in February, marking our 21st consecutive year of dividend increases. As a result, in February, we were proud to be added to the S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats Index that recognizes companies with 20 years or more of increasing dividends, a streak, we expect to continue.","Finally, we have kicked off the planned divestitures of Minerals, Metal Sulfides and Fine Chemistry Services, which will allow us to focus completely on our key businesses and will accelerate debt reduction. All three processes are well underway and we are seeing strong interest in all three businesses.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott.","Scott A. Tozier - Albemarle Corp.","Thanks, Luke, and good morning, everyone. First of all, before getting into the numbers, let me remind you that we are now reporting in our organization structure, which became effective in the first quarter. Our businesses are now aligned and operating in three global business units: Refining Solutions, Chemetall Surface Treatment and Performance Chemicals.","Refining Solutions includes our Heavy Oil Upgrading and Clean Fuels Technology's catalysts businesses. Chemetall Surface Treatment will continue its focus on the pre-treatment of metals. And finally, Performance Chemicals is comprised of the Bromine, Lithium, Performance Catalysts, and Curatives businesses. This realignment should accelerate growth and focus even more attention on the identification and achievement of both strategic and cost base synergies.","We released an 8-K in April, detailing eight quarters of pro forma financial results for 2013 and 2014 for the combined Albemarle and Rockwood businesses in the new reporting structure. This will allow for a better understanding of underlying business trends.","There are two items of particular note that I would like to address. First, the all other category reflects the businesses planned for divestiture: Minerals, Metal Sulfides and Fine Chemistry Services. Second, the corporate line item includes foreign exchange gains and losses related to cash balances and various legal entity accounts. Historically, this has not been significant, but with the acquisition of Rockwood there was notable impact in the first quarter, as I will talk about.","As a reminder, our year-over-year financial comparisons will be based on pro forma 2014 results as shown in that April 8-K to facilitate a cleaner comparison. Overall, for the first quarter, we reported all-in diluted earnings per share of $0.40 or $1.17 per share excluding special items. There were a number of one-time special items during the quarter, the largest of these related to the Rockwood acquisition. The inventory step-up resulted in a pre-tax charge of $48 million or a $0.34 loss per share after taxes, and one-time acquisition and integration costs resulted in a pre-tax charge of $59 million or a $0.39 loss per share. A full reconciliation is in the press release.","Net sales totaled $884 million and adjusted EBITDA was $266 million for the quarter. While profitability as measured by adjusted EBITDA margin improved to 30%, even though sales were down 7% compared to the first quarter 2014. The stronger dollar impacted our results by reducing sales by $41 million and adjusted EBITDA by $14 million, with most of the impact from the euro and the Japanese yen.","Another unique item in the quarter was a gain of $52 million in EBITDA or $0.36 per share driven by per share, driven by a non-cash foreign exchange gain related to cash held in foreign entities after the acquisition and before we paid down our bridge loans.","Our European entities held a significant amount of cash in U.S. dollars and the drop in the euro during the quarter created an accounting gain. This situation has always been in our numbers, but never to this magnitude, which was driven by the combination of the amount of cash on hand and the steep drop in the euro.","Additionally, the year-over-year, comparison was impacted by stub period sales for the former Rockwood businesses that are not reported in our Q1 results. The 12 days in January that represents a stub period would have increased total company revenue by $33 million and adjusted EBITDA by $3.4 million.","If I normalize our results for the impact of foreign exchange, the non-cash foreign exchange gain and the Rockwood stub period, sales would have been up slightly and adjusted EBITDA would have been up by 7%.","We now expect our effective tax rate, excluding special items, non-operating pension and OPEB items for 2015 to be about 26%, again, driven by the level and geographical mix of our profits, including those generated as a result of the recently completed Rockwood acquisition. While this is a bit higher than what we expected in January, it is fully within the range of our acquisition modeling.","In January, we forecasted capital expenditures in 2015 to be close to the top of the 4% to 6% of revenues that we expect to spend on capital over the next few years, with completion and startup of the La Negra lithium carbonate expansion in Chile, one of the items pushing capital to the top end of the range. As we work to complete this project, we now see a need to spend additional capital that could push us a little over that 6% of revenues in 2015.","Free cash flow, defined as cash flow from operations, adding back pension and post-retirement contributions and subtracting capital expenditures was about breakeven in the first quarter at a negative $5 million. 2015 will have a number of moving parts and one-time charges as we work through the integration and acquisition related projects.","In the first quarter, there were about $100 million of these one-time cash outflows, including various transaction fees. Despite the changes in tax rate and capital, we remain on track to be within our January guidance of $100 million to $200 million of free cash flow for the full year. Excluding the one-time items, our full-year free cash flow will be between $450 million and $550 million, demonstrating the tremendous cash generation of our businesses.","In addition, we are working to update our working capital targets. We believe there is substantial upside in this area, with opportunities in both the legacy Albemarle and Rockwood businesses. We closed the quarter with working capital at just under 25% of revenue and our long-term aspirations are to reduce this to about 20%, which represents a substantial cash opportunity. There are a number of complicating factors, but we will work to develop initial targets toward that 20% aspiration over the next several months.","At the end of Q1, Albemarle's net debt-to-EBITDA ratio as measured by our bank covenants was 3.6 times. As the full impact of the acquisition rolls into our leverage ratio, I expect net debt-to-EBITDA to creep up toward 3.7 times to 4 times by year-end, before any help from the divestitures. We are focused aggressively on deleveraging based on our strong cash generation, disciplined capital and cash management and by delivering on our synergy targets. We are seeing a high level of interest in the three businesses targeted for divestiture. And our goal is to complete these by year-end and the proceeds will be used to drive additional debt reduction.","Our initial guidance of $40 million to $50 million of adjusted EBITDA risk related to foreign exchange was based on a U.S. dollar to euro range of $1.12 to $1.18 and a Japanese yen, U.S. dollar range of JPY117 to JPY121. While the yen remains in that range, the strength of the dollar against the euro has created additional foreign exchange risk. And based on that adjusted expected U.S. dollar to euro range of $1.04 to $1.12, our adjusted EBITDA risk has increased to $50 million to $60 million on the full year.","Now, let me turn to business unit performance in the first quarter. Before I address our three GBUs, note that we had a weaker start to the year in some of the businesses planned for divestiture, which negatively impacted both revenue and adjusted EBITDA. Refining Solutions reported first quarter net sales of $179 million and adjusted EBITDA of $42 million, with adjusted EBITDA margins of 24%.","On a constant currency basis, sales and adjusted EBITDA were down 3% and 23% respectively. About 5% of that EBITDA decline related to higher freight costs, as a result of the West Coast port strike, as we spent more on freight to ensure our customers received their products. The decline was driven primarily by Clean Fuels Technologies and to a lesser extent by an elevated number of commercial trials in Heavy Oil Upgrading, as we discussed in January.","Heavy Oil Upgrading business performance was in line with expectations, and we do not expect ongoing impact from these customer trials. Our expectations for the year in the Heavy Oil Upgrading remain unchanged with both volumes and profits expected to increase versus 2014.","In January, we noted are concern that low oil prices created risk to our Clean Fuels Technologies forecast. That concern was borne out in the first quarter as Clean Fuels Technologies saw a more negative EBITDA impact than initially expected from delayed change-outs, weaker mix when compared to 2014's unusually strong mix and fewer first-bill opportunities. As a result, we are now more cautious on outlook for Clean Fuels Technologies in the remainder of the year, and we expect 2015 EBITDA to be down versus 2014.","Clean Fuels Technologies remains a lumpy business and while there may be some near-term impact, especially associated with the delayed change-outs in a low oil price environment, on a long-term basis, this business should continue to perform and grow.","Performance Chemicals reported first quarter net sales of $388 million and EBITDA of $131 million, with EBITDA margins of 34%. On a constant currency basis, sales were up 3% and EBITDA was up 17%. Normalizing for the equity income from the Talison JV, which closed in the second quarter of 2014, EBITDA was still up 10%. The improved earnings and margins were driven by a combination of improved PCS sales and volumes, and improved sales in our Lithium business.","Excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange and including the stub period in the results, Lithium revenue and EBITDA were up 17% and 34%, respectively, compared to the first quarter of 2014. The primary performance drivers were pricing improvement and the impact of the Talison JV, which delivered stronger-than-expected equity income on strong volumes and margins for technical grade spodumene.","We continue to be bullish on the outlook for battery grade products. Note that the portable electronics market grew 10% to 12% in the quarter, and the growth in battery, electric vehicles continued with global sales up more than 25% compared to the first quarter of 2014. Year-on-year comps were also impacted by the larger butyllithium customer lost in the second quarter of 2014. Overall, the Lithium business continues to perform well, meeting or exceeding the expectations we set at the beginning of the year.","On a constant currency basis, bromine related sales and adjusted EBITDA were both down 4%, but we're above our January expectoration. Completion fluid volumes were better than expected in the Gulf of Mexico, and we also benefited from deepwater fracking sales there as well. These two factors helped to counter weak completion fluid volumes in the rest of the world. Brominated Flame Retardant volumes continued to improve, as did volumes in a number of other brominated derivatives. While pricing was down year-over-year in the quarter, it was sequentially stable and while still early, we are seeing encouraging price and volume trends in this business, even if our outlook for the year still remains down compared to 2014.","Finally, Performance Catalyst Solutions, which also includes Curatives for reporting purposes, had a very strong quarter as the polyolefins market continued to show steady global growth. And we benefited from some one-time sales as well as timing of customer demand for our key catalyst component. Net of foreign exchange impact, sales were up 17% and adjusted EBITDA was up 65% year-over-year. In addition to the customer wins, low raw material costs, an improved tight (20:21) utilization benefited the quarter and helped to counter ongoing price pressure in the base organometallics segment.","Chemetall Surface Treatment net sales were $192 million, with adjusted EBITDA of $46 million, resulting in margins of 24%. Excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange and including the stub period, sales and adjusted EBITDA were up 8% and 11%, respectively, compared to the first quarter 2014. Surface Treatment is continuing to benefit from broad-based volume growth and pricing gains in most end markets, particularly driven by higher sales in automotive OEM and automotive components, general industry, coil and aerospace applications. Overall, market dynamics remain favorable, with continued opportunities for bolt-on acquisitions, similar to the recently concluded acquisition of our partner shares in our Shanghai JV.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Luke to talk about our guidance.","Luther C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Thanks, Scott. In January, we projected 2015 adjusted EBITDA of $875 million to $965 million, and adjusted EPS of $3.15 to $3.70, with an earnings cadence of 40% in the first half and 60% in the second half of the year. As you heard from Scott, in the first quarter of 2015, our overall business performance exceeded expectations, generating adjusted EPS of $0.81 per share, exclusive of the non-cash FX gain that Scott explained. A great start to our year.","One month into the second quarter, we expect continued solid results from the three businesses, Bromine, Lithium and Performance Catalyst Solutions that make up Performance Chemicals. Similarly, Chemetall Surface Treatment continues to meet our expectations. Refining Solutions is mixed; Heavy Oil Upgrading or FCC catalysts should deliver volume growth in line with our January forecast. However, volumes and profitability in Clean Fuels Technologies will be more negatively impacted by the late change-outs, fewer first-fill opportunities and negative mix than initially projected.","Combining all these factors, we are more confident in our 2015 outlook, and now see adjusted EBITDA in the range of $935 million to $1 billion, including the FX gain related to the U.S. dollar cash on hand at the completion of the Rockwood acquisition.","On an earnings per share basis, this results in updated guidance of $3.65 to $4.05 per share. This improved outlook reflects the strong first quarter results, as well as our confidence in business forecasts for the remainder of the year and in our ability to overcome the additional headwinds we face from a strong U.S. dollar, low crude oil pricing, and weaker Clean Fuels Technologies performance.","Due to the strong first quarter and to better-than-anticipated volumes in our oilfield completion fluids business in the Gulf of Mexico, our projected earnings cadence is now less tilted toward the second half of the year than initially forecasted. While we still expect higher operational earnings in the second half of 2015 compared to the first half, especially in Refining Solutions, the projected EPS split with the inclusion of the foreign exchange gain previously noted is now closer to 50%-50% than 40%-60%.","As we look to the rest of 2015, we see the same macro issues that have impacted us year-to-date, strength of the U.S. dollar, sluggish global economy, and crude oil pricing continuing to be major factors. Just as in the first quarter, our focus will be on what we can control, and you can expect disciplined operation of our businesses and our assets, strong cash management and a continuing push to deliver on our integration and synergy targets.","In closing, while we are only one quarter into the year, I believe our first quarter results underscore the earnings power of the new Albemarle and demonstrate our ability to deliver results regardless of the business environment. I am more excited than ever about the combination of Albemarle and Rockwood and our ability to deliver increasing shareholder value through our industry-leading businesses.","Matthew K. Juneau - Albemarle Corp.","Operator, we're ready to open the lines for Q&A, but before you do so, I would remind everyone to please limit your questions to two per person at one time, so that everyone has a chance. Then feel free to get back in the queue for follow-up, if time allows. Please proceed.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And your first question comes from the line of Bob Koort of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks, guys. Good morning.","Luther C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Hey, Bob.","Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I was wondering, Luke, if you could talk a little bit on the Bromine side? You mentioned some improvements and encouraging trends, but not really changing your view yet. Is that just a function of maybe once burned, twice shy? Or what's the reason for the greater conservatism mix here that some of the production issues in the industry get rectified, why not a little bit more bullish?","Luther C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. I think that we're seeing positive trends, and I'll let Michael comment on some specifics, but we're seeing positive trends across the pricing front. We're seeing positive trends on volume, but we also understand that the operational issues of some competitors is ultimately at some point going to come to an end. And so, it's hard to gauge what will happen when that does. So we feel very good about where we're going in Bromine. This price increase is necessary for us to continue to operate the assets, and we're not going to chase volume.","So we're going to lose some volume in accordance with this, with this pricing announcements, we expect that. It's built into what we expect to do for the rest of the year, but we're in this for the long-term. And so, don't hear in our comments a hesitancy in what we're doing is right or a concern about the long-term value that these products are going to bring. We're committed to this price increase, and we're going to push it through.","D. Michael Wilson - Albemarle Corp.","Just so, Bob, this is Michael Wilson. Yeah, I got just a comment. We obviously got off to a very solid start in the first quarter. I think clear completion fluids were a positive surprise for us. We really benefited from ongoing activity in deepwater. So, I think that gave us a bit of tailwind that we were cautionary about at the beginning of the year. So, I would say that's a real positive from a volume standpoint. We still have some caution about the second half of the year. Everybody knows that the number of drilling rigs is going down. If deepwater continues to hold up though, I think we'll be fine. I've really not changed the outlook on that since the beginning of the year.","If I think about the Brominated Flame Retardants side of the business, we are for now maybe two quarters in a row, seeing higher year-over-year volume growth. It's low-single digits, but it's positive. And then I think to Luke's comments on the pricing front, it's too early at this point to try to quantify any impact from that, but I am optimistic. I do believe we are seeing traction in the marketplace, which is a positive and I can give you a sort of one anecdote, the one place where prices are published publicly is in China. And since the announcement that we put forward, prices in China are up about 20%. So, I see all of those as positive signs for our business going forward.","Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And can you talk on the lithium side, where you see the ramp of the carbonate plant down in Chile? And then it seems like we're getting some positive news flow out of the EB market (29:02). Can you give us a sense of when you'll have to make a decision on a new hydroxide plant? Where you might place that? What the expense would be? Thanks.","Luther C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. To answer your first question regarding the capacity on Chile, nothing has really changed from my comments at our fourth quarter call. I indicated at the time that we expected the plant to start up in late second quarter, beginning third quarter. So, mid-year timeframe; we're still on track for that. But I also cautioned that we would not expect any significant volume benefit from that plant probably until mid-2016, just because that plant is designed to produce battery grade lithium carbonate and it is a very rigorous qualification process that we will have to go through.","So, we will start that plant up. We'll do some campaigning of it, producing products that we'll send out for qualification, and we'll gradually bring that capacity on. But we're looking forward obviously to doing that as we continue to see strong demand for battery grade materials. We saw that in the first quarter of this year versus last year. Battery grade product demand was probably up 20%, which is in line with the comments that were made about what we're seeing in consumer electronics and EBs overall.","So, with respect to the need for lithium hydroxide, that's a decision \u2013 an activity that we have ongoing. We've got an active project to evaluate opportunities for investment, and we just got to work through our internal processes on the approval of that and in the process of development design, decide where we're going to invest and win. But as I look at that market, there is definitely a need for additional capacity in lithium hydroxide, and we intend to serve that.","Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you for your question. Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Matt Andrejkovics - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Yes. Good morning. Actually, this is Matt Andrejkovics calling for Vincent. Thanks for taking the call. Just wanted to clarify, in the CFT catalyst business, you mentioned the risk for delays. How long can the refineries typically delay these change-outs? And is that something you might expect to get maybe back within this year? Or might it get pushed out? And then, a follow-up on that, the fewer first-fill opportunities that you mentioned, is that lost business maybe that you expected to get? Just maybe a little color on that would be appreciated. Thanks.","Luther C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","If you look at the \u2013 I'll let Silvio talk about it, but it really varies. I can't tell you whether it's going to move out of the year or whether it's going to move to later in the quarter. Some of them that we look out would definitely move out of the year. Some of them that we had built into the forecast for 2014 \u2013 I mean, for 2015, have definitely moved out to 2016. Some of those first-fill opportunities would be lost business, if our partner \u2013 in some instances, if our partner, we were expecting to get a fill at a period of time and it's delayed for the quarter or for the year, it would move out. But if our partner loses that design, we would obviously lose that business. But we purely (32:15) have further line of sight into those.","So, for what we're talking about today, you're seeing \u2013 the two questions would be, one, for the first-fills, it really has a mix issue because we don't get those higher value first-fills that we thought we were going to get in the year. And we're completing out with some lower value products. And then, from a \u2013 when they're pushed out, it just really depends on each refinery.","Silvio, you want to add some color to that?","Silvio Ghyoot - Albemarle Corp.","Yes, thank you, Luke. On those change-outs, which are being pushed, we have fairly good visibility on how far they'll be pushed out, whether it is further in the year or whether it is into next year. Some of them are pushed out. Some of them have a short-term replacement of catalysts, which like Luke said, a lower mix volume.","Luther C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Okay.","Matt Andrejkovics - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you for your question. Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy, of Bank of America. Please proceed.","Kevin W. McCarthy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes. Good morning. With regard to your free cash flow guidance, just wonder if you could walk us through some of the one-time items, including cash repatriation taxes? And on the subject of working capital, it sounds like you're taking a fresh look at that, maybe you can update us on what you have embedded in the current range for working capital, and what opportunities you might foresee there?","Scott A. Tozier - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. Hi, Kevin. Yeah, as you look at that range, obviously, the big movers are around the acquisition costs and the transaction costs and filing the tax repatriation costs. So, those numbers haven't changed. So we're still in that kind of almost $200 million in terms of the acquisition and integration costs. Tax repatriation is going to be in the \u2013 just under $150 million. Those are on track. Tax repatriation doesn't really affect Q1 yet, but it'll layer in over the next three quarters.","Working capital, as you mentioned, is an opportunity for us. We're not anticipating significant improvement in working capital this year. However, as I mentioned in the script, certainly, it's something that we're looking for the long-term to drive. So, you can expect some minor improvement for this year in generation of cash flow.","Kevin W. McCarthy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. As a follow-up, you've elected to leave the one-time non-cash foreign exchange gain of $0.36 in the numbers. You've been, I think, very overt and clear about what you're doing there, but maybe you could just address why you've elected to leave that in, when there's a whole variety of other adjustments in the quarter?","Scott A. Tozier - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. No, that's a good question. Foreign exchange gains and losses have always been in our numbers at the end of the day. So, if you go back in time in terms of Albemarle's reporting, we've always had some level of foreign exchange gains and losses.","It's the magnitude of this situation that is driving obviously the fact that we have to call it out. And in this case, we had a significant amount of cash in our foreign entities related to the transaction and it was denominated in U.S. dollars. And with a significant drop in the euro, that created that gain in those foreign entities. So, it's really no change in how we've been reporting, but it is a large item. We'd expect as we go forward, that we'd be back into the normal range of a million dollars or $2 million per quarter, plus or minus, and we'd be right back to where we've been in the past, so.","Kevin W. McCarthy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you for the color.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas of JPMorgan. Please proceed.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Can you hear me?","Luther C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah, we can hear you now, Jeff.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, good. Thank you. Your sales adjusted for FX were down 3% in the quarter. Can you describe what your volume change was and your average price change for the company as a whole? And that is \u2013 I'm interested in the organic volume and price change. And I know that there's some joint ventures that sort of move around, I was hoping you would exclude that?","Scott A. Tozier - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. With the addition of Chemetall, Jeff, volume is less impactful because it's not a volume-based business, much more of a service and the technical delivery-based service. So, it's a little bit more difficult to break that down. We can break down as we go forward into the other businesses. But as you look at the overall company from a pricing perspective, we saw good price traction within Chemetall. We've seen good price traction within our Performance Chemicals businesses, as we talked about; relatively flat I would say in the Catalysts businesses.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","So...","Scott A. Tozier - Albemarle Corp.","And if I look \u2013 just if I could clarify, if I look at our overall revenue and try to normalize it, there's two big factors. One is foreign exchange. As you mentioned, that's roughly $40 million impact on the quarter. There's also the stub period, which are the 12 days that we did not own Rockwood at the beginning of the year and that represents around $33 million. So, if you adjust for both of those, we're actually up 0.5%. So, just about basically, breakeven flat.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","So basically, your prices are up, I don't know, 3%? 3% and your volumes are down 3%, is that the way to look at the company?","Luther C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","For the quarter...","Scott A. Tozier - Albemarle Corp.","For the quarter, that's probably right, I would say maybe 2% on price, on average across the company.","Luther C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. For the quarter, that's right. And remember that one of our bigger volume products is FCC catalyst. And on FCC catalyst, our volume is down in the quarter because of the larger turnaround \u2013 not turnaround, the larger customer trials that we talked about in the first quarter. So, I would expect over the course of the year that that would even out, because we expect to see nice volume, particularly in the second half of the year for FCC catalyst.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","So, how much was FCC \u2013 what was the volume and price change in FCC and then HPC for the quarter?","Luther C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Jeff, hold on one second.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you.","Luther C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Let me just grab it. If I look at High Oil Upgrading, down roughly for the quarter, down about 10% for the quarter. And then for the full-year, we'll be up. Okay, and if look at Clean Fuels for the quarter, Clean Fuels roughly up a hair, and I would expect it to be down for the full year.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks so much, Luke.","Luther C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah, man.","Operator","Thank you for your question. Your next question comes from David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. Luke, you mentioned that in Bromine that you might lose or you would expect to lose some volume pushing this price increase. To whom and where would you be losing that volume do you think?","Luther C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Well, I mean, it goes across the board. I mean, there are only so many participants out there in the marketplace, so. But the bulk of the time, as in the past, anytime we've raised prices, what generally happened is we'd lose some volume to some Chinese producers. And so, I wouldn't expect this to be a whole lot different.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Fair enough. And maybe just on lithium, Luke, talk about lithium carbonate pricing trends and potential for higher prices going forward in lithium carbonate?","Luther C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. I'm going to let Michael talk about that, if that's okay?","D. Michael Wilson - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. David, this is Michael. So for 2014, we're going to see higher prices. We're going to have higher realized prices across the lithium salts, particularly for lithium carbonate and lithium hydroxide. So, that's going to be sort of mid-to-high-single digit price increases on average for the full year. The time \u2013 we closed the acquisition in January, a lot of the lithium volume was already contracted on an annual basis. So, there's not significant opportunities, I would say during the course of 2015. But as we see the market developing going into 2016, I would certainly say I'm optimistic about the outlook for being able to raise prices further.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And sorry, Luke \u2013 thank you. And Luke, just comment on FCC pricing trends and where we stand on the overall price increase here?","Luther C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yes. Silvio, you want to talk about pricing?","Silvio Ghyoot - Albemarle Corp.","Yes. Thank you, Luke. On FCC, I do not see any downwards trend for pricing. I think everything will be holding as we have scheduled earlier in the year.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you for your question. Your next question comes from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn of Longbow Research. Please proceed. Changed his mind and the next question comes from James Sheehan from Suntrust Robinson Humphrey. Please go ahead.","James Sheehan - Suntrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Good morning. Thank you. On your commentary on lithium you mentioned spodumene doing better than expected. I think that was in the more technical grades. Can you talk about what's driving the demand for spodumene and whether you think it will continue to be in the more technical grade of lithium?","D. Michael Wilson - Albemarle Corp.","Actually, it's in both technical grade and chemical grade lithium, which is used for conversion into downstream derivatives. So the way to think about is technical grade lithium carbonate is really used in glass and ceramics. So, that's a GD plus, or GDP type of growth businesses, I think, is the way to look at that long-term. So, the real volume growth is for the chemical grade, which is being used to make either lithium carbonate or lithium hydroxide, which is sold either into technical applications or into battery grade applications. In some cases, it's used to make derivatives that are even further downstream. But, that's really what's going to be the long-term driver of demand. So, I think you have to look at overall lithium growth, which is probably averaging 8% to 10% per year, and we should expect that to continue for spodumene.","James Sheehan - Suntrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you. And just on PCS, you mentioned some order timing issues there. Did we shift orders forward into the first quarter from the second quarter? If you could just discuss what you think the cadence of order timing is for the rest of the year?","D. Michael Wilson - Albemarle Corp.","Well, I think, if I look at PCS overall for the full year, our outlook is largely unchanged from the beginning of the year. I would just say that we had a much stronger Q1 than we anticipated. We're interpreting that that some volumes that might have come to us in the second quarter were pulled forward, but I don't know that with certainty. I mean, the upside may be that volumes continue to be ahead of our expectations. But at this point, we're sort of holding to the forecast that we gave at the beginning of the year, so.","James Sheehan - Suntrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you for your question. Your next question comes from the line of Mike Sison of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hey, guys. Nice start to the year. In terms of your outlook for 2015, I'm trying to gauge kind of the cadence for upside. You're getting a strong start to the year, it doesn't seem that you've raised the outlook for 2Q to 4Q, yet, you might have some building (44:52) price increases. You've talked pretty positively of Lithium and Surface Treatment, so can you maybe talk through what is offsetting maybe all the positives? And is there potential for a better year, as given the good start?","Luther C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Sure. It's really a couple of buckets that I'll put them in. First of all, we've got an additional $10 million of currency headwinds, $10 million to $12 million of currency headwinds than we did when we talked about the outlook in January. So, we've got additional currency. The second thing is Clean Fuels Technology the volume and profitability of that business will be weaker than we anticipated it in January, and it'll be down year-over-year. So, we're going to see some reductions in Clean Fuels.","From a Bromine standpoint, the first half of the year is stronger, particularly in clear bronze than anticipated, but as the crude prices continue to stay at the kind of levels they are, we are getting more and more information from our suppliers in the drilling fluid about the second half of the year being up in the air. So, we had built some of that into the original model, but you don't see the improvement that we saw in the first quarter carrying through for the rest of year in our forecast.","So, those are the big buckets that we've got that we believe we're overcoming in our other businesses to lift the bottom end of our range and hold on to what we did in the first quarter and still maintain that guidance for the year.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Got it. And then in terms of Bromine, do you need a certain level of demand or volume growth to achieve the price increases? Or do you feel pretty good that given there's, as you mentioned, there's not a lot of you guys that if you push through that you'll get in irregardless of sort of the volume backdrop?","D. Michael Wilson - Albemarle Corp.","Mike, this is Michael Wilson again. And I guess just to reiterate what I said before, I'm optimistic about our ability to get traction on the price increases. I recognize everybody is aware sort of that we've talked about historically about capacity utilization. And there is no question that if you looked at nameplate capacity utilization for Bromine, you probably have global operating rates that are in the upper-60s% to 70% now. But I think what we've been communicating to customers and they recognize is that we're matching our production planning, we're matching our investments in this business to meet contracted demand for products that we're getting fair value on.","And as Luke said earlier, we're not going to chase low-margin business. We're not particularly interested in the spot business. We want to contract with the customers who recognize the value that we provide in terms of our products and services. We feel it's only fair to ask for that value. That's the argument that we're making, and we're resolved to push this through.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of P. J. Juvekar of Citigroup. Please go ahead.","John J. Hirt - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi, good morning, this is John Hirt on for P. J. today. Given the (48:17) tightness that you've seen in the bromine market that you've talked about, can you talk about kind of the pace with which you anticipate getting pricing through? And then perhaps more importantly in terms of the impact, I mean, how should we think about the timing of the impact? Do you anticipate that starting to impact you in 2Q, but perhaps more of the impact in the second half?","D. Michael Wilson - Albemarle Corp.","Again, this is Michael Wilson. I think the way to look at it is it's going to be a gradual thing that will occur over time. And first of all, you have to realize that we have contracted volume. So, we're raising prices as contracts permit. Some of those contracts will go through the end of this year. So, the opportunity to even have the discussion with customers won't happen until then. But that being said, I mean, some of it's happening now. I would think early on we probably see some volume that will offset some of the pricing benefits, but then over time, I think, the pricing benefit begins to overpower the volume loss and then we see the impact of that coming to the bottom line.","So, the answer to your question is we certainly didn't see that in the first quarter because it was late in the quarter when we announced the increase. I would expect marginal, if any benefits, in the second quarter. I think by the time we get to the end of the second quarter, we'll have better insight as to whether we're really getting a significant impact for the second half. And then I think really where we would hope to see the benefit is as we go into 2016.","John J. Hirt - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. That's helpful. And then just a follow-up on Talison, which you said performed ahead of your expectations, I know capacity there was doubled I think a few years ago. So I'm curious where your operating rates are for the Talison assets? And given that lithium demand has \u2013 it sounds like it's stayed pretty resilient despite lower oil prices. I mean, I would imagine you could ramp up production of that rock base resource a little bit faster than you can on the brine base resource. So, can you kind of just talk about that dynamic and kind of where you're operating today? Thank you.","D. Michael Wilson - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. So, if I look at the technical grade product, which again is sold directly into glass and ceramic applications and that we take through an off-take agreement for distribution, that's running at relatively high capacity utilization rates. The chemical grade product, which is used for conversion of the downstream derivatives, is running at about 70% of capacity. So clearly, there is headroom as market demand grows to increase that and to grow volumes. However, much like the approach I indicated with Bromine, we intend to manage that capacity in a way that we match the supply to demand. And we do that so that we're matching supply to demand where we're able to get prices that we think are fair value. So again, we're not just going to increase capacity to try to get volume growth at the expense of value.","John J. Hirt - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Understood. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you for your question. Your next question comes from the line of Mike Ritzenthaler of Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Mike Ritzenthaler - Piper Jaffray & Co","Yeah. Good morning. In Refining Solutions, how does the adoption of relatively new products like AlkyClean factor into your outlook? Or are they just too small to move the needle?","Silvio Ghyoot - Albemarle Corp.","Good morning, Mike. This is Silvio. The AlkyClean, as you remember, we had the first sale last year. That unit has been built at a tremendous speed. And I'm looking at a calendar, it's supposed to be started up in the next couple of weeks. So, that will give us an indication on how that new technology runs, and we are confident that everything will happen as scheduled. But as you know, new technology, new plant that there's always a little surprise.","Mike Ritzenthaler - Piper Jaffray & Co","Sure. Okay. And then, one question about the three businesses that are for sale, should we be expecting some degree of, I guess, softer performance year-over-year from those three businesses? And are the soft results that we saw in 1Q a function of their sale and perhaps losing customers? Or is it a list of things like that are end-market related and is that impacting the valuation on those entities?","Luther C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. I think it values across the three businesses. I think Minerals business is about right on where we thought it was going to be. Metal Sulfides, down just a hair, but not too much and the big downsize is coming from custom services. And what that comes from is from timing of some of the products, as they've got a tough comparison on Q1. And then as we look at the electronics business over the course of the year, some of that is moved out into 2016. So, that's what it is, it's a mixed bag. It's not anything related to the business, and I don't expect it to impact the valuations because they're looking at a history of the business and the profitability of those businesses as well as the opportunity.","And in custom services there's a great pipeline of products in there that they're real excited about. And there's some opportunities for them to make some moves on pricing and some generics that they're working through right now. So, I think that will work itself out in the course of the year and early next year. And I expect us to be able to get the right value for our shareholders for the investment of those businesses, and if we don't, we'll keep them.","Mike Ritzenthaler - Piper Jaffray & Co","Fair enough. Thank you, Luke.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Aleksey Yefremov of Nomura. Please go ahead.","Aleksey Yefremov - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Good morning. Thank you. Could you comment on the difference in the outlook for HPC and FCC catalysts? It seems like lower CapEx at refineries is impacting these two products in a different way. Is there something in the nature of these products that signals that maybe the weakness in HPC is transitory? Or is there anything else going on?","Luther C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. At a very high level, when you think about FCC catalysts, and you look around where we are at the world, remember, we've got some big customers coming on line this year. So we continue to have good growth, particularly in areas where they're looking to maximize the propylene yield in that heavy residual, and so we feel good about that. And you'll see nice growth year-over-year. At the end of the day, it's all about transportation fuels.","In FCC, you can think of it as a gasoline maker. When you have lower energy costs, when you have lower gasoline costs, people may be driving more. So I think we'll see nice continued growth in demand for the FCC catalysts. And I'm very confident about our technology and very confident about our ability to meet our customer needs for this year, and I think we'll see that continue to grow.","On the HPC catalysts, where we are stronger is in the ultra-low sulfur diesel and into distillates. And what we're seeing is, one, in the U.S. there's some lighter sweeter crude that's been brought to play that you don't have to use as much catalyst and they don't have to run as hard to process.","We're also seeing in HPC, remember, it's a fixed bed. So they have to shut the unit down, unload that, and shut down the whole unit and bring it back in. Whereas the FCC, you have a constant feed into the unit, so you don't have to have that. So when they are pushing out those turnarounds, couple of things are going on. One, the catalyst is lasting longer. Two, the demand for those outputs that they have out there is not growing as fast as the capacity. And three, the catalyst is just working better.","So we're seeing longer turn-outs and longer delays and the units are running while they can with what they have. So, its two different drivers on hydrotreating catalysts and FCC catalysts. At the end of the day, we've got to be able to provide the technology and the services and the products that help these refineries make more money. And that's what we're looking to do.","HPC is a lumpy business, and we're in a lumpy spot this year for where we are the incumbent versus others. We don't have as many incumbencies come and open for turnarounds this year as we did last year or as we expect to have in next year. So, I'm not too worried about it from a long-term standpoint, but this year is going to be challenging for HPC.","Aleksey Yefremov - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Great. Thank you, Luke, for this explanation. In polyolefins catalysts, how do you view the sustainability of this improvement? Is this based on restocking in some of the polyolefins chains or is there something more lasting in this market?","D. Michael Wilson - Albemarle Corp.","I think \u2013 this is Michael Wilson. In the polyolefins catalysts, you have a fundamental growth rate that's probably in that 4% to 6% per year. So, my longer-term expectations are with that. Now, we have our downstream proprietary catalysts, the single site catalysts that are probably growing at double-digit rates. So, that's inherently what's going to drive the business. I think in the near-term, we are seeing stronger demand for products. So, the pricing environment for some of the aluminum alkyls still remains very competitive, particularly in certain regions of the world.","But again, I think with the moves that we made last year to rationalize some capacity, with increasing demand we're seeing that pricing begin to plateau in most regions, so hopefully we also get to a point soon where we have some pricing leverage in that segment, so. I think as I look across all the performance chemicals and the questions around what's happening from a pricing outlook standpoint, whether its bromine, whether its lithium, whether it's our PCS products, the approach we're really talking is one of operating discipline, right. We're going to be disciplined in how we manage capacity to be sure that we're getting good value for our products.","Aleksey Yefremov - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Great.

At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Matt Juneau, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Strategy. Please proceed.","Matthew K. Juneau - Albemarle Corp.","Thank you. Welcome to Albemarle's second quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Our earnings were released after the close of the market yesterday. And you'll find our press release, earnings presentation, and non-GAAP reconciliations posted on our website under the Investors section at albemarle.com.","Joining me on the call today are: Luke Kissam, Chief Executive Officer; Scott Tozier, Chief Financial Officer; Raphael Crawford, President, Bromine Specialties; Silvio Ghyoot, President, Refining Solutions; and John Mitchell, President, Lithium & Advanced Materials.","As a reminder, some of the statements made during this conference call about the future performance of the company may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws. Please note the cautionary language about forward-looking statements contained in our press release. That same language applies to this call.","Please also note that our comments today regarding our financial results exclude all non-operating, non-recurring and other unusual items. Reconciliations related to any non-GAAP financial measures discussed may be found in our press release or earnings presentation. In addition, with the execution of a definitive agreement to sell the Chemetall Surface Treatment business to BASF, U.S. GAAP requires that we report the business as a discontinued operation. As such, all of our comments today, unless specifically noted, refer to our continuing operations and exclude the impact of Chemetall Surface Treatment.","However, given the timing of reporting Surface Treatment as a discontinued operation, we have provided bridges in our earnings deck to better explain the impact of this change. These can be found in pages four, seven and 16 of the deck, which is posted on the website. In addition, page eight and the appendix of the earnings deck provide details of our reported earnings, along with non-GAAP reconciliations related to discontinued operations and other special items in the quarter.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Luke.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Thanks, Matt. And good morning, everyone.","In the second quarter of 2016, we again delivered outstanding results in our core businesses and made significant progress against our strategic objectives. Adjusted EBITDA grew by 20% in Lithium and by 28% in Refining Solutions compared to the second quarter of 2015.","For all of our continuing operations, excluding the year-over-year net impact of the divestitures of the Minerals and Metal Sulfides businesses, adjusted EBITDA grew by $19 million or 11% compared to the second quarter of 2015, and adjusted earnings per share by $0.25 or 37%. Overall, company adjusted EBITDA margins remained strong at 28%, with our three reported segments delivering combined adjusted EBITDA margins of 34%, up from 33% in the second quarter of 2015. The second quarter was also highlighted by the signing of a definitive agreement to divest the Chemetall Surface Treatment business to BASF for $3.2 billion, over 15 times trailing 12-month EBITDA. Combining the expected proceeds from this sale with those already received for the divestiture of Metal Sulfides implies that we purchased the Lithium business at a pre-tax multiple of about 10 times 2014 EBITDA. The closing of this sale, which we expect before the end of 2016, will mark another major step in our transformation into a company focused on our high growth Lithium and Catalyst franchises.","Also in the quarter, we became a component of the S&P 500 and received the 2016 Presidential Green Chemistry Challenge Award from the EPA in recognition of the development of the AlkyClean process technology and the AlkyStar catalyst used in conjunction with that technology.","This is the world's first solid acid alkylation technology and was successfully commercialized in 2015. AlkyClean is a potential game changing technology, and another demonstration of the innovation we bring to our customers.","Our businesses and our employees continue to deliver strong results despite a weak and uncertain macro environment, a testimony to the quality of both our businesses and our people.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Scott.","Scott A. Tozier - Albemarle Corp.","Thanks, Luke, and good morning, everyone. For the second quarter, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.09, including Chemetall Surface Treatment, but excluding special items. On a continuing operations basis, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.93, an increase of 36% compared to second quarter 2015, excluding the year-over-year net impact of the divested Minerals and Metal Sulfides businesses. The increase was driven by strong core business growth, a lower effective tax rate, and lower corporate and interest costs.","Before I turn to other financial metrics, let me remind you again that all of these will be discussed on a continuing operations basis, unless noted. In the second quarter, business mix by country and continued strength in our Jordan Bromine Company joint venture again drove a favorable effective tax rate. As such, we now expect our 2016 effective tax rate, excluding special items, non-operating pension and OPEB items, to be about 19%.","D&A for 2016 is now forecasted at $185 million to $200 million, with 2016 capital expenditures, excluding Chemetall, expected to be in roughly the same range. Operating and working capital crept up to about 29% of sales at the end of the second quarter. Very strong sales in Bromine and Lithium in the second half of the quarter drove an increase in accounts receivables and a corresponding increase in working capital. However, we expect to reduce operating working capital to between 27% and 28% by the end of the year.","In the first half of the year, our adjusted free cash flow, including contribution from discontinued operations, was $237 million. This number represents cash flow from operations, adding back pension and postretirement contributions, and subtracting capital expenditures, but excludes one-time synergy acquisition and tax related costs. Free cash flow, including those one-time costs, was $163 million through June, up significantly from 2015. The impact of foreign exchange on our businesses continued to decline in the second quarter to the point that the overall year-over-year impact was essentially negligible, with a negative impact on adjusted EBITDA of less than 1% in the quarter.","Before I turn to our core business unit performance, note that our Fine Chemistry Services business remains a challenge. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA in that business was several million dollars below expectations at the beginning of the quarter. In addition, Fine Chemistry Services is facing challenges due to the difficult environment for customers in the Ag industry, and the need to rebuild relationships and business with the customer base after the extended sales process. As a result, our forecast for full-year adjusted EBITDA in 2016 has now been reduced by about $15 million since April.","Moving on to our core businesses, let's start with Lithium and Advanced Materials. Second quarter net sales were $233 million with adjusted EBITDA of $83 million, resulting in adjusted EBITDA margins of 35%. Compared to the second quarter of 2015, net sales were up 10%, and adjusted EBITDA was up over 3%.","The Lithium portfolio again delivered outstanding results. Second quarter net sales were up 24%, and adjusted EBITDA up 20% compared to the second quarter of 2015. Adjusted EBITDA margins were 41%, the sixth quarter in a row with margins greater than 40%. Overall volume grew in the quarter by 19%, and pricing improved by approximately 3%. All of the growth and most of the pricing improvement were in battery-grade applications, where we achieved double-digit price increases compared to second quarter of 2015. Margins were in line with our expectations as we continued to ramp up lower margin tolling of spodumene into battery-grade lithium carbonate and lithium hydroxide to meet demand growth.","Lower year-over-year potash pricing continues to be a headwind for this business of about $7 million of full year adjusted EBITDA. From an operation standpoint, the startup and customer qualifications of our new La Negra lithium carbonate plant in Chile are progressing as planned, and we continue to see good reception from our customers on the shift to long-term contracts.","We are also pleased to announce the initiation of a collaborative effort between Albemarle and SQM to safeguard the ecosystem of the Salar de Atacama, and to ensure the sustainable extraction of brine over the long-term.","PCS experienced headwinds during the second quarter from both polyolefins catalysts and curatives. Net sales were down just over $10 million, and adjusted EBITDA was down almost $8 million compared to the second quarter of 2015.","Lower curatives volumes and pricing due to increased product availability from competitors, and the impact from the SunEdison bankruptcy, were the primary drivers. PCS adjusted EBIDTA could be negatively impacted by as much as $15 million in 2016 compared to 2015, a worsening of $5 million from our expectations at the time of the first quarter call. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA for our Bromine-based business was $67 million, down 3% year-on-year, with net sales down almost 8% to $207 million. Adjusted EBITDA margins were 32%. Better than expected clear completion fluids demand in the Middle East, timing of certain large volume flame retardant orders, favorable costs, and a better than expected pricing environment for some of our bromine derivatives, helped the business overcome most of our $15 million year-on-year adjusted EBITDA headwind due to the loss of a large methyl bromide customer in 2015. While we do not expect to see a repeat of the strong first half performance in the second half of 2016, we now expect the business to deliver full year adjusted EBITDA that is only a few percentage points below 2015 performance of $223 million.","Refining Solutions reported second quarter net sales of $178 million and adjusted EBITDA of $62 million, with adjusted EBITDA margins of 35%. Compared to the second quarter of 2015, sales were up 8%, and adjusted EBITDA was up 28%. Heavy Oil Upgrading or FCC catalysts continued to perform at a high level, with volume, revenue and adjusted EBITDA all up, as expected, compared to second quarter 2015. Heavy Oil Upgrading also benefited from a more favorable product mix and lower variable cost compared to second quarter 2015.","Clean Fuels Technologies or HPC catalysts' results also continued to improve as expected, with improved adjusted EBITDA driven by volume, a more favorable product mix, and lower variable costs. Overall, Refining Solutions expectations for 2016 remained fully in line with our view at the start of the year.","Now, I'll turn the call back to Luke to update our view of the year.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Hey. Thanks, Scott.","Just as in the first quarter, Lithium, Refining Solutions and Bromine Specialties exceeded our high expectations in the second quarter, and helped us to overcome weakness in Fine Chemistry Services and PCS. For the first half of the year, we've exceeded our initial 2016 expectations in all three of these core businesses.","In the third quarter, we expect Lithium and Refining Solutions to again show solid growth compared to the third quarter of 2015. While our full-year outlook for Bromine has improved due to the strong first half performance, we do expect to see both sequential and year-over-year weakness in both the third and fourth quarters of 2016.","Strong first half clear brine fluid demand outside the U.S. is not expected to continue, and certain large volume flame retardant sales in the first half are unlikely to be repeated in the second half of the year.","Finally, the issues that Scott noted in Fine Chemistry Services and PCS lead to an adjusted EBITDA headwinds of about $15 million compared to our guidance in the first quarter earnings call. Even with those headwinds, the overall balance for the year continues to improve, and we are increasing our guidance for the year.","On a continuing operations basis, our updated full-year 2016 net sales expectations are now $2.5 billion to $2.8 billion. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $705 million and $750 million, and adjusted EPS to between $3.35 and $3.60 per share, driven by the increase in our adjusted EBITDA forecast and the impact of a lower effective tax rate.","As a reminder, given the changes to guidance resulting from the move of Chemetall Surface Treatment to discontinued operations, we've provided a bridge to prior guidance on page 16 of the earnings deck posted to our website.","Albemarle's power to generate free cash flow will remain strong, even with the sale of Chemetall Surface Treatment. We estimate that Albemarle's free cash flow in 2016, excluding one-time items, and the expected free cash generated by Chemetall will range from $400 million to $500 million. We expect to close the Chemetall Surface Treatment sale before the end of 2016. Our priorities for the use of the proceeds from that sale are the same as those we have consistently communicated since we acquired Rockwood in early 2015.","First, we expect a deleverage to a gross debt-to-EBITDA range of around 2.5 times. Second, we will leave some cash on the balance sheet to accelerate growth in our core businesses. In the near-term, investments will likely be focused on high-growth battery applications in our Lithium business. Third, we will work to return cash to shareholders through some combination of dividend increases and stock repurchases. While you should not expect us to completely finalize plans until sometime after the sale closes, rest assured that we intend to put this cash to work in ways that will generate the highest shareholder returns over time.","In closing, I'm very pleased with our overall execution in the first half of this year. Our core businesses exceeded expectations, and we entered into a contract to sell our Chemetall Surface Treatment business at an attractive valuation. Once the sale closes, we will have a very strong balance sheet and are set up nicely to continue strong performance in the rest of 2016, and to accelerate the execution of our longer-term strategy.","Matthew K. Juneau - Albemarle Corp.","Operator, we are ready to open the lines for Q&A. But before you do so, I would remind everyone to please limit your questions to two per person at one time so that everyone has a chance to ask questions.

Please proceed.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","The first question comes from the line of Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Ryan Berney - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good morning, this is Ryan Berney on for Bob.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Hey, Ryan.","Ryan Berney - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey. Taking into the Lithium margins, can you help me understand the puts and takes on the margin change in Lithium from the first quarter to the second quarter? And could the cadence of the potash sales have any impact there?","John Mitchell - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. Hi, Ryan, John Mitchell here. Yeah. So, in the first quarter, as we said, we benefited, number one, from mainly brine to lithium salt sales, which was driving a much higher one-time benefit in margins. As we see in quarter two, and we expect going forward in quarter three and quarter four, we have some margin dilution as a result of the tolling as tolling volumes ramp up. We also have some impact on the potash pricing headwind. And also, as we ramp up our capabilities from a manufacturing perspective on the new plant in Chile, we have some added costs there. So, those are the main items that are impacting. But as we mentioned in the quarter one call, I mean, we \u2013 our margins are where we expect them to be, around that 40% base.","Ryan Berney - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great, thanks. And then maybe as a follow-up, could you update us on kind of your spending priorities for the cash proceeds from the Chemetall sale?","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. I'll take that one. As I said in my prepared comments, we're going to do exactly what we said since we acquired Rockwood in 2015. First, we're going to deleverage. You can look to us to go to somewhere approximately 2.5 times gross debt to EBITDA. We'll then have cash on the balance sheet that allow us to accelerate growth opportunities in our core business, and you can expect to see that focus on Lithium with some opportunities we have out there to accelerate our strategy. And third, we'll return some cash to shareholders through increased dividends and some stock repurchases.","Ryan Berney - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you, good morning.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Hey, David.","Scott A. Tozier - Albemarle Corp.","Hey, David.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Luke and John, on lithium pricing in the back half of the year, Orocobre has been talking about $14,000 to $15,000 a ton for lithium carbonate. Are those prices anything that you could realize in the back half or even for 2017?","John Mitchell - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. Hi, David. It's John here. As we've said, our approach to pricing in the market, I mean, number one, we want to make sure that we are supporting our customer base in terms of reliable supply of lithium salts, and we're focused on the long-term development of the market and long-term supply agreements. We're making great headway on the long-term supply agreements, where more than 60% of our customer base is under that. We do have pricing flexibility there. But we're not going to comment on other peoples' prices at this point in time, but the environment is favorable; the market is in balance at this point in time.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Understood. And, John, any update on the MOU with the Chilean government?","John Mitchell - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. So, we're very close. We continue to have great conservations with the Chilean government. We expect the definitive agreement to be signed shortly. And we continue \u2013 we've already initiated engineering work on kind of the Phase 3 build-out in La Negra, so everything is moving along nicely there, and hopefully, we'll have some good things to announce shortly.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","David, this is Luke. The thing I'd add to that, I \u2013 remember, this was really the first agreement after the Lithium Commission. And so, we're working through making sure all the I's are dotted and T's crossed down there in Chile, and I fully expect that agreement to be signed, and we are proceeding with the development of that plan for the expansion confidently and are moving forward assuming that's going to get signed in short order, and I believe it will.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Very good. Thank you.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Thanks, man.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks, and good morning, everyone. Could you talk \u2013 sorry, could you talk a bit about what you're seeing in terms of electronics demand, I guess both for Lithium and for Bromine, and how you see that progressing over the next couple of years? So, how is it doing now and what's happening going forward?","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Okay. I'm going to let John take it first around Lithium, and then we'll have Raphael talk a little bit about Bromine second, if that's okay, Vincent?","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah, sure.","John Mitchell - Albemarle Corp.","Okay. Hi, Vincent. It's John. With regard to Lithium, when we look at energy storage, we look at the market in three categories: consumer devices, transportation and grid storage. So, on the consumer device side, that includes not just the computers, tablets, cellphones, but it includes power tools and other wearable devices. And we're still holding to our model of about 8% to 10% annual growth in that segment.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And is that what you're seeing this year?","John Mitchell - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. That's \u2013 I mean, we continue to see that kind of growth in that segment.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And Bromine?","Raphael Crawford - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. So, Vincent, this is Raphael. For the Bromine business, our FR business, our Flame Retardant business goes into various electronic applications. Overall confidence in that market from a market perspective is increasing. So, the various indices which track confidence in the connector industry, as well as overall electronics, are going up. So, the industry is feeling more confident and the outlook year-over-year, as well as sequential, it looks better. That's also reflected, to some extent, in our business, we've had a strong first half in flame retardants into those markets, and we expect over the next year and in the outlook that to be stable to slightly increasing.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And, look, if I could just ask you, with Bromine appears to be stabilizing, you've got the Chemetall sales, so you're going to delever, what would the pros and cons be of keeping Bromine at this point or finding another home for it one way or the other?","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. I think if you look at Bromine, I do believe that business this year has a fighting chance to be down just a few percentages point from last year. So, improved much over the first half, is going to generate \u2013 excuse me, when I said over the first half, I meant improved over 2015, our early expectations.","Also, it's going to generate significant cash that we'll be able to harvest to apply to the Lithium growth opportunities. So, to me, it's still a question of how do we best drop shareholder value, and at least as we look at it today, harvesting that cash to allow us to accelerate the growth opportunities that we see in our Lithium organic growth and potential opportunities in Catalyst today. But that always changes, we'll continue to look at it just as we looked at the Chemetall business. And if \u2013 and we're going to do what is the \u2013 creates the highest value for our shareholders over the long term. But right now, I think that is keep Bromine, continue to watch the great performance that we've seen this year, and harvest that cash.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks very much. Have a nice day.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Jim Sheehan with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please proceed.","James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Good morning. Could you comment on the lithium supply demand environment in 2017, the impact of new capacity that you see possibly having on lithium carbonate prices next year?","John Mitchell - Albemarle Corp.","Hi, Jim. This is John. With regard to the supply demand, again, as I said on multiple calls, when we look at the mid-term, we see the market imbalance. There certainly will be periods of time where new capacity kind of comes on and slugs. For 2017, we see a few resources in Australia coming online to support the growth, as well as continued ramp-up of Orocobre in Argentina, as well as our own capacity ramping up. So we see 2017, again, being in balance.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","And I think fair to say, John, not a significant impact. We don't see demand \u2013 the supply coming on that's going to have a significant impact at all on our ability to price for the value in lithium carbonate.","John Mitchell - Albemarle Corp.","No. That's right.","James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Great. And on FCC pricing, could you just comment on the trends you're seeing there and what you expect in the second half?","Silvio Ghyoot - Albemarle Corp.","Yes. This is Silvio. Like we told earlier in the year, we initiated a process for the \u2013 for increasing our prices. We've been cleared from the get-go that it's a long haul exercise. We feel positive about what we're seeing after first couple of months, we have a couple of first successes, and we will pursue the efforts and will stay on track as we announced before.","James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Aleksey Yefremov with Nomura Securities. Please proceed.","Aleksey Yefremov - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Good morning, thank you. A follow-up question on the use of proceeds. Will you rule out any sizable acquisitions? And does your comment about investments in sort of battery-grade lithium also could potentially involve acquisitions or mostly organic investments?","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","It's always a possibility for an acquisition. And if we see opportunities for acquisition, it would be in the lithium space immediately, but that would be a fulfillment of or an acceleration of the strategy that we've already stated, Aleksey, I'm sorry.","Aleksey Yefremov - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Thank you. And as a follow-up on repurchases, any thoughts on the timing or how quickly can you get to that? And then is that decision dependent on your sort of potential acquisitions as well?","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. I think that we've got to close it. So, it's one thing we got to get the deal closed first. We expect that to happen by the end of the year. We also have to be able to get the cash back to the U.S. in an efficient manner so that we pay down debt and then have that cash on hand to do it.","So I wouldn't expect any repurchases, any at all, in 2016. I would expect that would roll over into 2017, and we're going to look at what the environment is and what the opportunities are to use that cash at that time, and that'll determine how much goes into what bucket, Aleksey, is the best way for me to describe it. But we are making the analysis to ensure that we're driving shareholder value to the greatest extent that we can.","Aleksey Yefremov - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Great. And final question, if I may, on Lithium EBITDA. What is the outlook for the second half versus the first half run rate sort of about \u2013 the good one for second half as well?","Matthew K. Juneau - Albemarle Corp.","John.","John Mitchell - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. I think as we've stated, our expectations on EBITDA for the Lithium business in that 40% range. And so, that's what we expect going forward for the second half.","Aleksey Yefremov - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citigroup. Please proceed.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Yes. Hi, good morning. So, I think...","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Hey.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi. As you get the cash in, you'd look into making acquisitions on Lithium. Would you look at acquiring more reserves you've got in brine or rock? And then, on your Kings Mountain, North Carolina asset, you haven't run that asset in a while. What kind of investment would you need to get that in operations?","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. That's a couple of questions. What I said is I would consider acquisitions, P.J. So, let's be clear what we're saying, okay? We would look from a standpoint of anything that would accelerate our already stated goals. Those goals are to capture 50% of the growth in the lithium market over the next five years to 10 years. So, you can look at \u2013 that will require additional resources that we will need to bring online, to be exploring in the 2022 kind of timeframe. We'll have to find those assets, acquire them, and we've got teams around the world looking at them and talking with people about options, because not only do we need to satisfy the demand of the day, but we've got to decide \u2013 meet them into the next decade, and that will require additional resources, as we've stated. So, we will look at that. We \u2013 as a part of that, you can expect us to look for high-quality rock reserves, as well as high-quality brine reserves. We have today, the low cost position in brine, the low cost position in rock. We have geographic diversity. We've got a diversity of our portfolio of our end products, and we believe that gives us a tremendous competitive advantage, and you will see us take steps to enhance that advantage that we believe we already have.","With regard to Kings Mountain, that is the original, I believe, rock mine in North America, still best of everything that I've seen today. The data would show it's probably the second or third most concentrated rock reserve in the world. And we are in the process of analyzing the cost to bring that back online if it was necessitated. But what it would be, would be a simple mathematical equation for us, what's the cost of bringing it online versus what our other options are around the world, and does it give us a competitive advantage or not. And we will pick the one that is the highest. So, I don't have an answer to your second question, and it would just \u2013 it would be premature for me to throw a number out there, P.J. I'm sorry, I just don't have that number, but we're working on it.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","No. That's great, and thank you for that. And just secondly on your Refining, you saw a nice improvement in EBITDA. How much of that was coming from sort of benefit from spring turnaround versus how much of that is from a cyclical recovery with strong gasoline market, et cetera? Thank you.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","P.J., I'm not sure I understood the question. I think you asked of the EBITDA growth year-over-year, how much of that was refinery turnarounds for hydro treating, and how much of it was the gasoline demand in FCC catalyst. Was that right?","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Yeah. That's right, Luke, thank you.","Silvio Ghyoot - Albemarle Corp.","Hey, P.J. This is Silvio. Both businesses contributed well to that growth because on the FCC, you may recall that year-over-year, last year, we went through a period with a lot of trials, so the volumes were somewhat better this year, together with the strong gasoline demand for the first half. And on the CFT side, as reported earlier, we're expecting 2016 to be better than 2015 as we do not see that same hesitance. And with Refining, we did notice over last year, that is being confirmed, we see more change-outs. We see a better product mix and saw also the CFT contributed to that EBITDA growth.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","If you look year-over-year, I think it's safe to say we had better performance in CFT year-over-year. FCC was solid, but \u2013 and had a nice movement, but the real growth was in CFT year-over-year.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Josh Spector with UBS. Please proceed.","Joshua Spector - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, guys. How are you doing?","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Hey.","Joshua Spector - UBS Securities LLC","Just a follow-up on the Refining side. So, specifically on HPC, I know you had sales strong in the quarter, I know you just talked about it. Just curious, was it getting to the point where customers needed to change out and that drove demand or are you seeing some additional demand as crude was higher in the quarter? What would be the main driver, in your opinion, sequentially?","Silvio Ghyoot - Albemarle Corp.","Okay. Well, let me put it correct. Last year was the exception that we saw all kinds of measures taken because of the economic climate at that time and the oil pricing. Over this year, things came back to what we call normal, we saw regular change-out, we saw the use of fresh catalysts versus regenerated catalysts. So, I dare to say that we are getting back to normal operations and see the regular change-out. Comes to see now what the recent trends in the oil will do, but I may confirm that the first half of the year was back to normal business.","Joshua Spector - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And just on margins as a whole, I mean, I think if I look historically, margins have been more in the higher 20% range. Now, you're on a couple of quarters of above 30%. Is that just mix and as HPC comes back in, that might go down, or is this kind of a new fundamental basis to look as we go forward?","Silvio Ghyoot - Albemarle Corp.","No, I would dare to say that it has to do, on one hand, with the quality of the mix, both the fills and the products that go in there, as well as the use of fresh catalysts versus reused catalysts, that's one element. On the other hand, as we reported, we have some variable cost and \u2013 some favorable variable costs in the beginning of this year, first half year.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","I think the thing that you've got to remember in HPC catalyst particularly, and you focused on HPC, is it's \u2013 what is that mix going to be? So, if you look, we make fine margins on our FCC catalysts as well, but we get \u2013 if we get a use of a really tough, a complex crude, just hard to get the sulfur out, and the amount of hydrogen can have an impact on it. And if we need our specialty hydrotreating catalysts, we can make better margins on that on the mix. So, the HPC mix, that we have more than anything else, can impact those margins. So, I think it's going to, from quarter-to-quarter, fluctuate. I think over time, over a long period of time, you're going to see high 20%, 30% kind of margins, is what I would out \u2013 somewhere between 25% and 32% kind of margins is where it's going to fluctuate. That's what it has and I think that's what you will continue to see.","Joshua Spector - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","You bet.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research. Please proceed.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Yes, a couple of questions, if I may. On the first question on the Bromine side of the business, pricing, I understand, is holding both year-over-year increases and sequential in elemental bromine and some of the derivatives outside of drilling fluids, is that still correct?","Raphael Crawford - Albemarle Corp.","Dmitry, this is Raphael. That is still correct. So we have \u2013 we were fortunate to have a tailwind with China pricing that helped, as well as some of the mix of our business in the first half of the year. So, we are seeing flat to slightly improving pricing in our business.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. And then if you exclude the share gains that you've got in the Middle East, what's your feel for the overall drilling fluid demand in the global market, both in the second quarter and then looking forward to the balance of the year?","Raphael Crawford - Albemarle Corp.","Dmitry, we see overall demand being down. As you've noted correctly, and I'm very proud of our Bromine team, in the first half of the year, we did secure some share in the Middle East, as well as secured business with existing customers. So that was very favorable. And while those customers continued to order into the second half of the year, it is not at the rate that we saw in the first half of the year. So we would say that overall, demand is down, it's down most significantly for us, as well as for the industry in the Gulf of Mexico, but down overall. So it has a bit of a tail going into the second half of the year and perhaps the start of 2017.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Hey, Dmitry. This is Luke. Remember, when we talk about drilling fluids, we're really focused on deepwater drilling. So, it's really, that's our main focus, is deepwater. We don't \u2013 we're not much onshore or not much in frac-ing. So, it's really, you got to focus it on deepwater. And I think what \u2013 there's such a long tail on that. And so I'm \u2013 I think we're going to see the second half is going to be down, that's included within our guidance, and I think you'll see a weak start to 2017 with respect to our completion fluids.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Got you. And then \u2013 excuse me. On lithium pricing, I think you said they were up 2% year-over-year, is that correct, with a 19% volume growth?","John Mitchell - Albemarle Corp.","It's up 3% overall, and that's on the portfolio overall for lithium. Battery grade material, which drove most of that pricing, was up much higher than that.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. So, your price increase on lithium carbonate, was it specific to the battery grade or was it lithium carbonate broadly speaking? Can you remind us?","John Mitchell - Albemarle Corp.","This is John. So again, on the technical grade applications, there tends to be, in some cases, a ceiling on price because the value in use, once you go beyond a certain price, sometimes you can substitute out a product, so you have to be careful on the technical grade side. But certainly, on the battery grade side, we've gotten our fair share of price within battery grade. Also, in terms of the way we define our pricing mix, I mean, as the tolling \u2013 you have to also remember, as the tolling volume's coming on, we're not necessarily counting that in terms of our pricing that \u2013 in terms of the way we've reported out on the pricing percentages.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. I'm just trying to understand of the \u2013 I think you went out with like a 15% or 20% price increase that you expect to get over a couple of years. And I'm just trying to understand if that's...","John Mitchell - Albemarle Corp.","Lisa (41:09).","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","...if the 3% is the first step of that or is the 3% being masked by things like tolling and some of the other things that you mentioned, and you actually are realizing a much higher price increase. The reason I'm asking is your competitor in Lithium reported yesterday, and I think they talked about getting a 10% price increase in the hydroxide side of the business.","John Mitchell - Albemarle Corp.","Right. I mean, I think you might be confusing us with someone else in terms of what we announced, but I mean, what we've said on the call is that for the overall Lithium portfolio, not the Lithium & Advanced Materials, but we expect mid single digits overall. And that in the battery side, we have good double-digit price increases on the battery side. So, I mean, we're getting \u2013 we're in line with where we think the market needs to be.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Dmitry, we're not in any way getting less aligned on the pricing of \u2013 in battery-grade applications. If you look \u2013 if you do the math on our battery-grade applications, you can see they're up double digits and it's not 10%; it's well into the double digits. So, it's right in line what you're hearing from the rest of the industry on pricing, and I would expect to be able to see strength in that going forward.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. Thank you, Luke. Thanks for the color.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Please proceed.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC","Good morning. So, first on the Lithium, the contract extensions, to what extent when \u2013 if and when prices roll over, how fast we think of the flow-through to your business, or how sticky should pricing be because of the contracts you have in place?","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","No. As we've said that \u2013 I mean, each of the contracts are going to be negotiated on an individual basis. In terms of when we decide to adjust prices. I mean, I would say those prices could take effect within the quarter. So, I mean, they can be \u2013 I mean, it can react pretty quick, but it's \u2013 it really depends on when we decide to take action, and again, each agreement is negotiated individually.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC","And then on the Bromine side, is there anything that can be done as you look at the end market mix to reduce the lumpiness in that business going forward? I mean, any further actions you can take?","Raphael Crawford - Albemarle Corp.","Laurence, this is Raphael Crawford. I mean, we continue in the Bromine business not only to make sure we're delivering cash out of the core business, but we do continue to invest in R&D, as well as business development efforts into new markets, whether that be specialty applications or other core uses. We certainly look at that, and that's our best avenue to reducing some of the lumpiness. But this business, it does see headwinds and it sees tailwinds based on various end markets and various geographic considerations. And over the cycle, we continue to focus on cash delivery and making sure that our cash flow delivery is consistent year-over-year to fund the growth in the Catalysts and Lithium businesses.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Mike Sison with KeyBanc. Please proceed.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hey, guys, nice quarter. Luke, congrats on getting really good value for Chemetall there, and I guess, I get to say new Albemarle again this year, but when you think about the portfolio as you look in \u2013 over the next several years, can you maybe just frame up what this portfolio can do in terms of growth, free cash flow, and just maybe give us an update on the long term potential now?","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. I think, it's a \u2013 as I look across it, what I would say is that I think Lithium has got \u2013 is kind of a double-digit growth for the next \u2013 if you look now through the rest of this decade, and as long as we get the additional resources continued. So I see continued strength in Lithium, at least double-digit growth year-over-year for the next four years or five years, and that's about as far as anybody can see, right? So, and that could be accelerated based on energy storage, based on EVs and other items, but I don't see any change coming on that.","On Refining Solutions, demand for transportation fuels is going to drive that. And that's usually going to grow somewhere around 2% to 3% to 4%. And I think we'll grow a little bit better than that because of our capabilities in the complex tough to crack crude slate. So, I feel great about our ability to have year-over-year growth there. It will, I think, moderate then from what we've seen this year's. Remember, this year was a bounce back year. I wouldn't expect to see that type of growth well into the future, but I think that the strength of our innovation in catalysts will allow us to continue to grow that low to mid single digits. And dependent upon how our incumbencies are in clean fuels, we could pop above that from quarter-to-quarter. But I think there's still continued growth in that Catalyst business.","At Bromine, as I've said before, this year, the Bromine is outperforming my expectations. We said they were going to be down; I still think they're going to be down this year year-over-year, but they've got a fighting chance to get close here to what they did in 2015. That business, we're not counting on it for growth, but if we get a little bit of growth from Bromine over the years, that certainly, the free cash flow generation from that is going to accelerate our ability to drive more of our profits in Lithium. So, I think you'll see that \u2013 I don't think the free cash flow will continue very strong. We'll have some capital that we need to invest in Lithium, obviously, but even with that, I expect our maintenance capital, if you will, to probably be around 4% across our base, and you're going to have growth capital in Lithium that will take us up higher than that.","So, continuation of the free cash flow story here, and I think good solid growth and growth opportunities between Lithium leading the way, followed by Refining Solutions, and then counting on Bromine to remain flat. It may go up one year a little bit, down one year a little bit, but overall, I feel great about the ability of these portfolios to drive shareholder value.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Great. And a quick follow-up on Heavy Oil Upgrading. Where are your operating rates now and where do you think you'll end the year as you head into 2017?","Silvio Ghyoot - Albemarle Corp.","The operation \u2013 this is Silvio. The operation rate is in the 90s% as we said \u2013 as we announced before, it's not changed. We have had a strong quarter. The demand for fuel has been \u2013 it's very strong, maybe a little pressure on it for the coming months because the industry is dealing with the inventories, but overall, longer-term picture, we believe that the demand for \u2013 and the gasoline production will come back and will remain strong into the 2017.","Michael J.

But, Silvio, you want to talk a little bit about that and what's built into our guidance?","Silvio Ghyoot - Albemarle Corp.","Okay, well, we have been supplying at different rhythms over the beginning of the year and did supply well into July. For remainder of the year, we do not foresee any additional volumes, and that has been totally built into our guidance for this year.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","All right.

I mean, we're progressing really well in La Negra in terms of qualifying the product with really, a great portfolio of customers. You should expect to see a contribution really in 2017. And we \u2013 as we've said, we're focused on the long-term agreements and we've already started to pre-sell that volume with customers. So, we'll bring on capacity in line with our customers' demand.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","All right. Thanks very much.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Ben Kallo with W. Baird. Please proceed.","Benjamin Joseph Kallo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hey, congratulations, Luke, in all the progress over the past year.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Thank you.","Benjamin Joseph Kallo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","I have two questions. First on the HPC side, could you guys just talk about that? You \u2013 Grace (51:13) was out there today talking about the ARC (51:15) JV and seen some harvests there. And then, I want to change subjects with my second question that's about Lithium. And that was a joke, but maybe just tell us, Luke, what you think, some of the parts of the value chain \u2013 I know you talked about resource and what you guys have there and potential acquisitions, as well, possibly maybe even going deeper into the battery side of it that are interesting to you. And as you get the capital from the sale of Surface Treatment, that you would be interested in looking in what \u2013 either organically or through acquisition? Thanks.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Okay. Silvio, you want to talk about HPC volumes?","Silvio Ghyoot - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. I think I can put some \u2013 shed some light on that one. Year-over-year, the volumes are getting better. Longer haul, there is \u2013 the structure fundamentals that more fuels are going to be consumed, that more fuels need to be cleaned up, so there is a structural growth pattern in there. Looking at the different segments, however, we see that there is a shift, that one segment is growing faster than the other. We see a stronger demand in the individual (52:40) area, where more complex oils are being processed. But to answer your question, we have gone through a dip last year with a lot of uncertainty at the refiner side. We are still cautious, but we still \u2013 we see that coming back this year that, like I said before, we're getting back to the normal patterns. And for the longer haul, we expect the HPC volume to grow because you just need to process more oil going forward.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Thanks, Silvio. And if I look at \u2013 your question really was about what parts of the value chain with \u2013 will we look at in the batteries. And we really like where we are today. What we're good at is resources, taking those resources, converting them into quality lithium carbonate, lithium hydroxide and other byproducts from lithium that drives higher value. So, as I look at that, we're going to stay true to who we are, Ben. I don't think you can expect to see us buying a cathode company or anything like that. What we want to focus on is driving value, which is an acceleration of our strategy, to be able to gain faster growth in lithium carbonate, lithium hydroxide in the catalyst space. So, that's what you'll see us doing. We'll be consistent with who we are.","Benjamin Joseph Kallo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thank you, Luke.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of David Wang with Morningstar. Please proceed.","David Wang - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Morning, everybody. Thank for taking my question.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah.","David Wang - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","I guess my first one's on Bromine. I guess you're interested in managing this business mostly for cash flow generation. I guess, going forward, do you see it mostly as volumes and pricing driving the cash flows of the segment or is there much room left, legroom on the cost side such that you can still improve EBITDA for that segment, even if pricing doesn't necessarily go your way or we don't see much of a rebound in volumes?","Raphael Crawford - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. David, this is Raphael Crawford. I think we see both sides of this. We certainly see a great leverage effect on volume and the drop through to the bottom line. So, we do take efforts on securing additional business when we can, for example, the China opportunity this year with the favorable pricing in China was something that we jumped on in order to pick up some additional volume. And pricing, as we go forward, that's always a lever. There is still room on the cost side. That's something that we continually look at. We saw some cost improvement particularly in raw materials, for example, from favorable buying in the first half of the year. So we look at that continually. And as I said before, we look at all the levers we can pull to continue to deliver consistent or growing year-over-year cash flow into Albemarle. And that includes cost, capital, as well as on the sales side.","David Wang - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Right. Thanks, Raphael. And then, I guess, my second question is on Lithium. You mentioned that going forward, you would be considering acquisitions. And I was wondering how this would be prioritized relative to your other opportunities. For instance, is there \u2013 would you look to expand the Chilean operation even more so than you've already laid out before you would look at an acquisition, or would you look at the spodumene and hydroxide before the acquisition? I was wondering the priorities of these \u2013 the options or the other ones that you're considering.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah, our priorities are going to be right. You should look at them as we look at brine versus rock versus conversion. You ought to look at it on ways that will lead and will accelerate our strategy, and deliver a higher shareholder value, and that's what we would look at as opposed to focusing in any one geographic area or any one particular asset. It's going to be \u2013 if we find one, if it makes sense, if we can get the right type of accretion, it would all be related to driving an already articulated strategy.","David Wang - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Okay. So \u2013 and just to clarify on that, so would you prefer to \u2013 I guess I'm just wondering why you would be looking an acquisition when it seems to me like you could continue to expand the Chilean operation.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Well, I mean, what we'll do is \u2013 what I said we'd do is we'd have cash on the balance sheet to allow to accelerate our strategy. So, accelerating the strategy could be we develop more assets in Chile as well. So, you're reading too much into it, what \u2013 that I'm going to do one or the other. What we're going to do is we'd laid out a strategy, we're going to maximize the resources that we have today as rapidly as we can to meet the market demand.","And then, if an acquisition allows us to accelerate that, we'll do it. But it's going to be \u2013 if you look at our Chile operations today with the MOU, we've already got a plan to build out the derivative capacity to use up 100% of that resource over time. We'll accelerate that. And we're in the process of accelerating that today. And if there are opportunities in Chile where certainly, we're down there, we know those resources, then we'll certainly continue to look to pursue those.","There are other \u2013 in other areas of the world, there could also be some opportunities that we would pursue from a resource standpoint, as well as from an asset that may accelerate or strengthen our position in that area of the world, and that's what we're going to do. So, we're looking at ways to accelerate our strategy and strengthen our overall global leadership position. So, it's not going to be anything that comes out of left field. It's going to be, if we do anything, it's going to be very consistent with the strategy that we've articulated since we bought Rockwood in 2015.","David Wang - Morningstar, Inc.

Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mr. Dave Ryan, Vice President Corporate Strategy, Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","David Ryan","Thank you and welcome to Albemarle's third quarter 2019 earnings conference call. Our earnings were released after the close of the market yesterday and you'll find our press release, earnings presentation and non-GAAP reconciliations posted on our website under the Investors section at www.albemarle.com.","Joining me on the call today are Luke Kissan, Chief Executive Officer; Scott Tozier, Chief Financial Officer; Raphael Crawford, President, Catalysts; Netha Johnson, President, Bromine Specialties; and Eric Norris, President, Lithium.

Please also note that some of our comments today refer to financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with GAAP. A GAAP reconciliation can be found in our earnings release and the appendix of our earnings presentation, both of which are posted on our website.","Now I will turn the call over to Luke.","Luke Kissam","Thanks, Dave. Good morning, everybody. On today's call, I'm going to provide a quick recap on quarterly performance, but want to spend the bulk of my time on the long-term position we're taking and how the recent strategic decisions we've made support that view. Scott will provide more detail into our third quarter and full-year performance. Excluding currency impacts, third quarter revenue grew by 14%, adjusted EBITDA by 12% and adjusted diluted earnings per share by 22% year-over-year, excluding currency impact, each of our GBU delivered year-on-year EBITDA growth. Increased volume across all of our businesses and favorable year-over-year pricing in Lithium and Bromine contributed to that growth. With that, let me take a step back and set the stage for where we are today.","As you know the lithium market is dynamic. It offers a very strong future growth opportunity and the long-term secular growth trends remain fully intact. However, we are - and we will be dealing with the challenging market conditions for the next 12 months to 18 months. Since late July, we have announced several significant strategic actions to successfully position our business for the long term. Last quarter we announced the decision to defer work on a price only 125,000 metric tons of conversion capacity, freeing up about $1.5 billion of our $5 billion five-year capital investment plan. This will enable us to generate free cash in 2021 and is the right path to take, based on current supply-demand dynamics and provides us with the financial flexibility to take advantage of any opportunities we see.","Importantly, this decision does not affect current customer commitments. We are in the position to deliver on all committed contracts and we have the ability to add capacity if current market dynamics improve. As you know we have access to geographically diverse high quality, low cost lithium resources and the financial flexibility to build or buy conversion capacity in the future, if doing so creates value for our stakeholders.","As we will discuss in detail at our upcoming Investor Day in December, battery technology continues to advance. We expect carbonate demand to continue to grow, but expect hydroxide demand to be much stronger. To that end, we're focused on remaining, an agnostic Lithium producer, whether our customers want carbonate or hydroxide or other lithium products, we have access to the world's best bromine and hard rock and the industry leading conversion expertise to deliver on their needs, and we remain committed to investing, to maintain our competitive composition and deliver a truly differentiated customer value proposition.","When we shared our strategy in 2017, we told investors that we would take advantage of opportunities that accelerate and strengthen our long-term growth strategy. To that end, we announced last week, the completion of our joint venture agreement with Mineral Resources. Well, we have a majority interest in a 60%, 40% ownership structure. All in, our investment of $1.3 billion consist of a cash payment of $820 million to MRL for 60% of the Wodgina mine in contribution of a 40% interest in our 50,000 metric ton hydroxide facility currently under construction in Kemerton, Western Australia.","We believe our investment in this new joint venture named MARBL Lithium will produce substantial long-term value. The JV provides access to a high quality hard rock source, further diversifying our global Lithium resource base and strengthens our position in the long-term by giving us the ability to increase capacity, to support future market demand, with the combined operating expertise of Albemarle and MRL, the top tier Wodgina mine, and our market knowledge we are well positioned to benefit from a rapidly growing market, which is increasingly emphasizing hydroxide.","The joint venture supports our long-term view, but in the short term, we made the decision to idle production of the Wodgina mine until market conditions support production economics. The returns for this project will still be very attractive. We anticipate that when the JV is producing lithium hydroxide at a rate of 100,000 met tons annually, the return on invested capital will be a healthy 17% to 19% or roughly two times our cost of capital.","Staying with Lithium, I want to address pricing and contracts. As we commented in our preliminary earnings announcement, current market conditions are challenging and we're experiencing pricing pressures in China and on our technical grade products. Today, our pricing strategy under our long-term battery grade contracts have hailed. As you can see on pages 10 and 11 of our earnings presentation, Albemarle's third quarter Lithium pricing was up slightly year-over-year despite a significant year-over-year decline in market conditions.","Recently reported China carbonate prices appear to have stabilized in the range of $7 a kilo. We expect that this price level is at or near the marginal cost of production and do not expect China carbonate prices to drop further in any material way. However, China carbonate at $7 a kilo puts pressure on pricing across the global lithium portfolio, including the fixed and variable pieces under our long-term agreements.","We know that our long-term agreements are of great interest, concern and focus. So let me broadly address the matter here. As we have been in the past, we are in active discussions with customers on our agreements, those discussions involve price, volume, allocations between carbon and hydroxide, length of the contract and the value that Albemarle offers for quality, security of supply, flexibility between carbonate and hydroxide sheer volume of product needed and the ability to meet the customers' growth expectations. It is obviously not in our best commercial interests to discuss contract negotiations publicly. So we are not going to do it. These are active discussions with many moving pieces. As the dust settles on these negotiations, we'll give you a better look at what this means for our annual outlook, rest assured that we understand the value we bring to the supply chain and we intend to capture our fair share in these discussions.","Now let me switch gears and talk a little bit about 2020. As a part of our strategy, we continue to assess our business portfolio. We have received multiple inquiries about our Fine Chemistry Services and Performance Catalyst Solutions businesses. So, we have initiated two processes to pursue these opportunities. They are both profitable businesses with strong operating teams. So if we can come to agreement on a valuation that we feel is appropriate, we will pursue a divestiture, if we are not able to secure valuation that we believe to be appropriate or in the best interest of our stakeholders, we will continue to operate these businesses. We would expect both of these transactions to be 2020 events.","In terms of how we see our portfolio performing in 2020 versus 2019, our preliminary view today is that we expect Catalysts, Bromine and Fine Chemistry Services to be essentially flat. There are some gives and takes in each, but right now, assuming no overall economic slowdown, these businesses should net to approximately flat. Lithium will be lower year-over-year due to pricing pressure across the portfolio and are not having new conversion capacity to drive any significant volume growth. We have initiated a structured program across the company to capture sustainable cost savings and expect this program to deliver over $100 million in sustainable cost savings over the next two years.","Taking all this into account, our preliminary view is that our full year 2020 EBITDA performance could be lower than full year 2019 results by around 10%. In closing we are taking swift actions to navigate the market challenges that we see in 2020 and emerge even stronger to capture the long-term growth opportunity in a profitable manner. We will continue to build on our strength in manufacturing excellence in Bromine and Catalysts and we will transform processes for lithium, similar to our other businesses to ensure best-in-class operations. We can - we will continue to be conscientious in our asset management and capital plan and seek to be nimble in response to changing and dynamic market conditions.","With that I will turn the call over to Scott.","Scott Tozier","Thanks, Luke, and good morning everyone. For the third quarter, we reported net income of $155 million or $1.46 per diluted share. Adjusted earnings per share were $1.53, an increase of about $0.22 per share compared to third quarter 2018 or 17% growth. Our businesses delivered about $0.23 per share of growth with double-digit earnings growth in both Bromine and lithium and high single-digit growth in catalysts. Our lower effective tax rate contributed about $0.06 and a lower share count as a result of our 2018 share repurchase program contributed about $0.03, those gains were partially offset by $0.04 of higher depreciation and unfavorable foreign exchange, which was a 7% headwind compared to third quarter 2018.","Regarding our business, performance Lithium reported third quarter net sales of $330 million and adjusted EBITDA of $127 million. Excluding the unfavorable impact of currency, lithium sales were up 23% and adjusted EBITDA was up 9% year-over-year. This growth was due to increased volume and favorable pricing, despite the impacts we communicated in our earnings pre-release. And as a reminder, these included, first a volume shortfall, which impacted the third quarter by about $15 million in EBITDA. This was primarily due to Typhoon Tapah, which caused lithium shipments from ports in Shanghai to be delayed into October, and we expect this to be fully recovered in the fourth quarter.","Second, the use of tollers to meet customer commitments and address operating issues in Chile. This resulted in an EBITDA reduction of around $10 million. The technical team in Chile has focused on reliability improvements, which have enabled operating rates to now reach full capacity, given customer commitments, tolling is expected to continue into the fourth quarter. Third impacts also included a $7 million out of period adjustment regarding lithium carbonate inventory values that was identified and corrected during the third quarter close process.","And finally, an overall 1% increase in lithium pricing versus prior year. However, continuing price pressure on lithium sales in China unfavorably impacted EBITDA by about $5 million versus our expectations. Finally, adjusted EBITDA margin was 39% and it would have been 40% if we excluded the $7 million out of period adjustments. Bromine reported third quarter net sales of $256 million and adjusted EBITDA of $89 million, up 11% and 14% year-over-year excluding unfavorable currency impacts.","Adjusted EBITDA margins were strong at 35%, up nearly 90 basis points benefiting from 7% higher pricing, a favorable product mix and high plant utilizations, price and volume were favorable across geographies and most of our products. So, we continue to see weakness in the automotive and construction sectors, flame retardant demand for electronics and drilling fluids in the oilfield market remains strong.","Catalysts, third quarter net sales were $261 million and adjusted EBITDA was $67 million, up 5% and 8% respectively compared to the third quarter of 2018, excluding unfavorable currency impacts. And adjusted EBITDA margins were 26%. Favorable pricing in Fluid Catalytic Cracking or FCC catalysts was offset by lower volumes due to the delays in the startup of two customers new FCC units. We currently expect both of these units to be in operation in 2020. Clean-fuel technology or hydroprocessing catalysts benefited from higher sales volumes and a favorable product mix.","On the innovation front, on October 31, Exxon Mobile and our Albemarle together launched a transformative hydroprocessing suite of Catalysts and service solutions for the refining industry called the Galexia platform. The new platform helps refiners realize the full potential of specialty Catalysts and enhance client performance by analyzing and identifying operational opportunities that extract greater value.","Corporate costs in the third quarter were $39 million, an increase of $16 million over the same period in 2018, primarily driven by unfavorable currency losses of approximately $11 million. Our cash from operations was approximately $346 million for the nine months ended at the end of September and a decrease of $31 million versus the same period in 2018, primarily due to the timing of payables and the collection of certain receivables.","Capital expenditures through September, were $608 million. Expenditures for the La Negra lithium carbonate expansion and the Kemerton lithium hydroxide project remain on track and we now expect full year 2019 CapEx to range between $900 million and $950 million. At the end of the quarter, our net debt to adjusted EBITDA was 1.6 times with the close of the MRL deal, we estimate our gross debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio to move from 1.9 times to around 2.8 times and net debt to EBITDA to be around 2.6 times.","We have funded our payments associated with the new joint venture by borrowing approximately $1 billion under an unsecured credit facility. We expect that this borrowing along with other corporate funding activity may ultimately be converted to long-term debt given attractive economics. As communicated in our pre-release on October 24, we expect 2019 pro forma net sales to be $3.6 billion to $3.7 billion, reflecting 7% to 10% growth. Adjusted EBITDA to be $1.02 billion to $1.06 billion equating to 2% to 6% growth and adjusted EPS of $6 to $6.20 or 10% to 14% growth.","Drilling down into the businesses, we expect that bromine will continue its strong performance and deliver adjusted EBITDA growth in the low double-digit percent for the full year. The Catalyst business has improved since our second-quarter outlook and we now expected to be down low-single digits on a percentage basis, excluding divested businesses.","And finally Lithium is expected to grow EBITDA in the low to mid-single digit percent range and deliver full-year adjusted EBITDA margins of around 40%. You've likely seen reports of civil unrest in Chile and are wondering how this is affecting our operations. And first, I'm happy to report that all of our employees are safe. At this time, our plants are operational and shipments are moving on schedule. We have lost approximately 500 metric tons of production since the unrest started, but it will not materially impact our financial results. We will continue to monitor this fluid situation very closely.","Based on our current geographic sales, production mix year-to-date in our expectations for the rest of 2019. We currently expect our full year effective tax rate to be about 18%, excluding special items, non-operating pension and OPEB items. This rate is in part a reflection of strong operating performance at our bromine plants. To close, we will be prudent in these challenging times, act on cost reduction measures to align our cost structure and maintain our leadership position to deliver value to our stakeholders. We look forward to sharing more details with you at our Investor Day on December 12 in New York City.","And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Dave.","David Ryan","Operator, we are now ready to open the lines for Q&A. But before doing so I would like to remind everyone that please limit questions to two per person to ensure that all participants have a chance to ask questions. Then feel free to get back in the queue for follow-ups if time allows. Please proceed.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Bob Koort from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Dylan Campbell","Good morning. This is Dylan Campbell on for Bob. And when we look at kind of the 10% decline that you're looking at for 2020. Give us a sense of just kind of what moving pieces are embedded in that guidance in terms of the rollover in terms of lithium volume growth, and then, I guess, the growth for the Catalysts and Bromine businesses.","Luke Kissam","Yes, so, this is Luke. Let me try that at a high level, if you look at page 11 on our, on the earnings presentation, you can see that year-over-year lithium prices is down about 30% and Albemarle has been flat to up slightly on our year-over-year comparisons each quarter on lithium pricing. And so the big mover that we're seeing on the down for the profitability from '19 to '20 all comes down to lithium pricing and how much of that we can offset with cost reductions. On catalysts, when we look next year, we'll have probably higher volume in FCC catalysts and it depends on HPC, how those bills - how they time out that we get some in its second half of next year, they roll into 2021. So again Catalysts or be there is some moving bits and pieces there but FCC would probably be stronger from a volume and price standpoint and HPC, probably a little bit weaker, but we're working hard to get some of those additional loads in 2020.","And then on bromine, we don't have any additional volume, I mean we're running flat out right now and allocating every bromine molecule we have. So it all comes down to what do we see from an overall economic condition. What happens in the electronics, what do we see from automotive, we see a little pickup and this pricing hold. And then that's offset by cost actions. So those are the big moving pieces is preliminary right now, we will obviously have more information as we finish this quarter and head into - head into next year. So we'll update that on our - at our year-end earnings call.","Dylan Campbell","Okay, thank you. That's helpful. And then considering the situation, I guess if, assuming that the market tightens once again, how do you preserve, I guess, some type of upside, considering the fact that, and the majority of your volumes are going through your contracting structure?","Luke Kissam","Well, under those contracting structures, we have the ability to raise price on - a certain percentage of that volumes just like we have in the past. So we would, if the conditions tightened, we'll certainly be looking at pricing actions that we can take to raise those prices.","Dylan Campbell","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Stephen Byrne from Bank of America. Your line is open.","Matt DeYoe","So, this is Matt DeYoe on for Steve. I want to talk a little bit about the potential fallout to you in the industry from the EU proposal to ban certain flame retardants and consumer electronics and display applications, kind of broadly what percent of demand goes into that market? Do you - if you think consumer electronics companies, can they adopt to new standard more globally?","Luke Kissam","Yes, I will let Netha start and then I'll to go into the specific and then I'll tell you at a high level where we are.","Netha Johnson","Yes, we've looked and looked at that and we expect it to have minimal impact on our business going forward starting when it goes into effect in 2021, customers will make some alternate substitutions there but we've looked at that and we think we have our alternative past there to replace that business.","David Ryan","So at a high level, we've been dealing with the, if you look at Tosca in the US, if you look at some of the European Regulations globally. All of these flame retirements have been under review for, since I joined Albemarle in 2003 and we've done - we've done a really good job of moving away from some of the products that we're smaller so we getting a larger molecule, so it's harder formed bio-cumulate if at all. And we are constantly evolving our technology to be able to meet the needs that the customers have. So what you see in Europe, it's a small piece today, we believe it's controlled in that sense, and we continue to innovate to bring products to the market to meet what's really needed and is a serious issue related to flame retardants.","And so I think that it's - it won't have an effect in 2020, maybe a small effect if anything around the edges and long-term will continue to innovate to provide the really needed flame retardants, that our customers need.","Matt DeYoe","All right, thank you. And then if I can touch on the contract. So I think past discussions stipulated that the contract terms could be in renegotiated if customers could find [ph] like product and - like both like quality and like quantity. As you're seeing demand slowdown for EVs and the market kind of softened here. Is what's happening more proliferation of technology and such that different producers can now hit the specs? Or are you just seeing more supply to a market from the same four or five incumbent tech savvy producers?","David Ryan","Well, I think all those four, five takes savvy producers you're talking about have sufficient volume. It's - what you're seeing is there is an oversupply in the market today and then I talked about it, carbonates sell in the China right now at $7 a kilo that's probably below some of the cash conversion costs for some of those China converters. So I would - you should not have the impression that there is any technological advance by some of the marginal producers is not, it is where it's been. The specs are getting tighter and ultimately long term, it's going to be for those EV battery grade - you're going to see those big four or five able to meet those specs on a consistent regular basis with the volume. There is other volume out there that is not the EV spec and that's where you're seeing in the technical grade and some other lower specs for other uses, you're seeing those lower producers, lower technology producers being able to come in at a price that they're comfortable with.","Matt DeYoe","All right, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Joel Jackson from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Joel Jackson","Good morning. If I - if I take a $100 million EBITDA guide down in lithium, it looks like you're guiding down to average price decline next year of 15% to 20%. Can you maybe give a little more color, how do we break down the price declines between your contracted and your non-contract base? So this is a very, very massive 30% drop, your non-contracted base and a small decline in your contract base or is it going to be similar. Do you think, across both contracted and non-contracted? Thanks.","Luke Kissam","Yes, so as I said, I'm not going to get into discussions about specific contract because we're in the middle of negotiation and that then do us any good. So, I hope you'll understand that. So let me back up and just say at a high level, there is pricing pressure across the portfolio. The most pressure is coming in carbonate, particularly in technical grade and in China, but that is having a ripple effect across the portfolio. So you're going to see it as you said, different levels of price movement, according to different products and according to that end market, but that's about it - that's about as much as I am comfortable going into, given the fact that we're in the middle of discussions.","Joel Jackson","Appreciate that. Second question on Kemerton. So it looks if - it looks like you have almost enough spodumene at Greenbushes to support the Kemerton in the next wave - for hydroxide in 2021 and beyond there, maybe not quite enough to get the 50,000 tons, I mean 45,000. Does that mean you look for operational improvements at Greenbushes, will you source external carbonate, it doesn't seem like it makes sense to restart Wodgina, that run at very low rates just supply the extra marginal spodumene there.","Luke Kissam","Yes, so I can't see us buying carbonate from other parties to do anything. We'll have sufficient carbonate supply to do whatever we need to do from a - from a spodumene standpoint because of our geographic diversity that we have around the globe, what we'll do is we'll source spodumene from the source that gives us the highest net back to Albemarle and our stakeholders. So we are all in - we'll see where the market shakes out and where we are at that point in time, but you are right that we have flexibility for sourcing that not other producers have.","Joel Jackson","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from John Roberts from UBS. Your line is open.","Matt Skowronski","Hi, this is Matt Skowronski on for John. In your pre-announcement, you mentioned lower prices in China were $5 million hit the EBITDA in the third quarter, where prices move from 3Q average level and if this remain - if prices remained at this level throughout 2020, what would the impact be?","Luke Kissam","Ask that question one more time please. I'm not sure I'm following you.","Matt Skowronski","So you mentioned that Chinese prices were a $5 million hit to EBITDA lower pricing, where prices moved from that level. So are they lower or they higher than 3Q '19? And then...","Luke Kissam","Yes, if you look at page 11, you will see that most of that over in a lot of the price decline that we've seen year-over-year, it accelerated in the third quarter. So you see - you saw an acceleration of price decline overall for the market for lithium products in the third quarter. If they were down 30% and some of those it was 15% of that down was about half of it was - you saw in the third quarter year-over-year. So prices have continued to decelerate going into the fourth quarter. Eric, do you want to talk about some details?","Eric Norris","I would just offer that in looking at price in China, if you were asking that question, but we are talking about price three months ago, we would have talked to - talking about an $8 or $9 price and now we're talking about a $7 price. So that's your difference right there. In China, the small part of our business, but it is a part, and that's the impact it's had on our P&L.","Matt Skowronski","Thanks for that. And then you noted your bromine assets are operating at a higher than expected volumes, just going off of a comment that you just made, are these kind of normalized levels now?","Luke Kissam","Yes, I think we've been able to get some nice get rights in our JBC expansion that we did last year, that's enabled us to run it a little bit higher rates than we expected when we set the plan in place, and that will be the new run rate going forward, but we always do productivity enhancement and utilization increases and we'll continue to do that and we're very confident in our manufacturing capability to, to get out increased volumes from those manufacturing enhancements.","Matt Skowronski","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Arun Viswanathan from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Arun Viswanathan","Good morning. I guess, I just wanted to ask about the lithium environment. Do you think as you look into next year, what are some of the drivers, you're watching to see if things are stabilizing or even potentially turning around, I mean, is it just EV demand or is that macroeconomic growth? Or what else are you kind of looking for us or maybe supply disruptions or anything else?","Eric Norris","Hey, Arun, it's Eric here. I think the big drivers for us are not necessarily about demand. We feel fundamentally that while we've seen a pause in China, that's a pause and our long-term view for the global EV growth remains intact. So our focus is on supply and inventory that's in the channel. And there - we believe on our assessment. There is not a lot, there's not enough new supply or let's put it this way. The new supply coming in will not exceed the demand growth. So the question is how much is still an inventory? There is probably at least six months of product in inventory, maybe more so you're probably two to three times the level inventory, you should have, and that's the drag on price now then we see that having an effect into 2020.","Arun Viswanathan","And on that note, I guess, how long do you think it would take to kind of work through that, especially in the technical rates and I'm just a little bit surprised that there has been such an impact on EV battery grade lithium even with the oversupply in the tech side. So maybe you can just help us understand what the impact is there and why we're seeing that?","Luke Kissam","Yes, hey, this is Luke. We don't - we didn't what Eric was just talking about was overall that included battery grade as well as technical grade. So we think there is - we think there is an overhang of the supply chain for lithium derivatives overall. And what I said in the prepared remarks is we think we're looking at 12 months to 18 months of trying market conditions and we think that's about the time it's going to take for people to work at all, that's our view today.","Arun Viswanathan","And it's - lastly just, is there anything else that the industry can do, I guess to accelerate that process of destocking. Have you been aware of any other potential shutdowns or reductions in production? Thanks.","Luke Kissam","Yes, I can't you comment on what other people are thinking about doing. I can tell you what we're doing is - we're going to take control of what we can control. So you can see when the joint venture deal with MRL close, we made the decision to idle those assets, because we don't need to bring anymore spodumene right to the market in this market conditions. Secondly, we're going to take actions internally from a cost standpoint to ensure that what we can control, we will control.","Arun Viswanathan","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Harrison from Seaport Global Securities. Your line is open.","Michael Harrison","Hi, good morning. Just looking at the and kind of building on the questions around inventory levels. It seems like spodumene is one of the areas where there is too much supply. And I'm just wondering, can you talk about your operations at Talison and maybe how we should think about the contribution from Talison in 2020 relative to 2019?","Luke Kissam","Yes, so Talison contribution in '20 relative to '19, remember that Talison is a raw material supplier to GIC and Albemarle and that's really it both from a technical grade perspective as well as from a battery grade perspective that we take that rock and converted as CNG does into our - in our assets are in total converters. So it's going to be essentially that, that volume or will be similar to up slightly based Tianqi's bring on a new client and so I would expect it to be slightly higher than what we saw in 2019.","Michael Harrison","All right. And then on the - on the catalyst side of the business, I guess, I was a little bit surprised to hear you say that HPC was expected to be a little bit lower in 2020. Can we go back and discuss maybe your updated view on IMO, 2020 and the impact of that could have on HPC Catalyst growth over the next, maybe, what it's doing here in second half of '19 and what your expectations are for '20?","Luke Kissam","Go ahead, Raphael.","Raphael Crawford","Yes, sure. Mike, this is Raphael. So we do think that IMO will have an impact on HPC catalyst demand low to mid-single digits, but I think when you look at, when you step back and you look at the overall picture, more so than IMO for our business, it's really the tightening of sulfur specifications around the world, which will be favorable. As Luke mentioned as the onset of the call and there are things that with the timing of various refills, customers that could push us up or down in any given year not the indication of what weakness in the business more of timing in customer demand, but overall we feel like the tightening at sulfur specific regulations around the world. IMO included is favorable for our business in the industry.","Luke Kissam","Yes, this is Luke, HPC, just simply a lumpy business and what you have to do is the customer mix, the product mix as well as what that - what the fills are going to be in any one period of time. So that's the only reason I say it could be down. It's got nothing to do with overall market demand, not a share issue, not a price issue. It's just simply a matter of the fields that we expect today. Now, if we were sitting here in 2018, we got more fills in 2019 than we expected - we did in '18. So the team is still working, we may be able to move some orders up a little bit or get a little bit better mix, so it's early but yet people ask what an indication is from where we are today. It looks like HPC is going to be a little bit down and FCC is going to be up. Thanks.","Michael Harrison","Got it. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","David Begleiter","Thank you. Good morning. Luke and Eric just on lithium volumes in 2019, what do you think there'll be, and do you expect any growth in your lithium sales volumes in 2020?","Luke Kissam","Hey, there. David, your question is the market or - I'm sorry? outlook.","David Begleiter","On your sales volumes in '19 and potentially '20?","Luke Kissam","So our sales volumes in '19. So you're one about the growth and what it's like year-on - versus prior year, that growth is coming - is coming from - both from Xiniya - the ramp up of Xiniya II, which is now running at full rates, but from the first half of year is ramping, so we'll be three quarters full there for this year, so that, the 20,000 ton plants, so that's a big part of our growth. And the remainder is coming from La Negra though - La Negra we haven't run as well as we wanted to in the third quarter. We expect to show favorable year-on-year growth during the fourth quarter of 1,000, a couple of thousand tonnes or so for the year.","Eric Norris","So, if you look at 2020 David, I would expect that from a volume stand point we'd probably have - maybe 5,000 to 7,500 [ph] metric tons of growth, that assumes we get additional growth in and run La Negra at rates, we don't have another way like we did in the first quarter. The brands is percolating down there, the way it ought to be and they ran at October rates that's the highest rate they've ever run. Now we've got to sustain that all into 2020. And then we'll get a full year of Xinyu II from what we ran this year. So that's how I get to about the 5,000 to the 7,500 or 8,000 met tons. Okay?","David Begleiter","Very helpful. And Luke, just on the cost savings, how much will be realized next year of $100 million and what's the breakdown between those three segments of the $100 million?","Luke Kissam","Yes, I don't - I don't know how much we're going to get in next year, because some of it is - it's going to take a little bit of time. So we will update you in December, we will have more information at the Investor Day, and then we will roll out into our fourth quarter earnings call, we'll give you more update, David.","David Begleiter","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Sheehan from SunTrust. Your line is open.","Jim Sheehan","Thanks, good morning. I think you have repeatedly said that La Negra was on track to produce close to 40,000 metric tons of lithium carbonate in 2019. What is that number now going to be given the shortfall in third quarter. And can you just give some color on what cause these operational issues out La Negra and what gives you the confidence they won't repeat?","Luke Kissam","Yes, so let me do the first one and then Eric and talk about some details on, we're running at about 38,000, is that about right, Eric? Between 38,000 and 39,000 met tons for La Negra this year. And one of the things that we've done is we've taken some of the best process engineers, we have around the company from Catalysts from fine chemistry services from Bromine and they've been down in La Negra over the last couple of months helping with some best in class, some debottlenecks and things like that. So I'm confident next year that we'll be able to build from where we are, not have the hit - not have the rain event - not have the struggles with the Bromine because of the rain and things such as that. So, I feel good about where we are in the progress that we're making.","Eric Norris","So Jim, I'll just add. I'll move beyond Bromine issue in the rain, we've talked about that enough this year, but in terms of reliability and uptime of the plant, we expected more reliability and more uptime during the third quarter than we had. Let me first of all point out, at this point it's sold out. So everything we make, we can sell. So if there is and our time issue is going to have an impact, and that's why we're backfilling where we can - where we're qualified to do so with tollers. Now that being said, as Luke earlier said, we had the best October we've ever had in that or that month we ever had in the month of October. We've got to sustain that, it's been a large measure due to upskilling from people from outside of the Lithium business, but we've also brought a new operational talent and we're building skills within the organization. It's a journey, right, it's an operation, so this plant has to be operationally excellent and we're on our way there, the aim is world class, but we're not there yet.","Jim Sheehan","Very helpful. And Luke could you also explain how the tolling process works in Chile. Do you mean La Negra commitments with told brine based carbonate or spodumene based carbonate and you've explained a lot in the past about how difficult it is to meet product specifications for battery grade products? Our toll volumes coming from the big five producer and thus, they meet those specs and if not, do you have to offer some kind of price concession given the lower quality toll product?","Luke Kissam","That's a lot of questions. So let me try to address them one at a time. Overall, we don't take any brine from anybody else until it and we don't give our brine anybody else to toll for us. So if we have a slowdown at La Negra what we lose a 1,000 metric tons. We take spodumene from our Talison supply and have a third party generally in China totally either to carbonate or hydroxide and we generally if is told to carbonate at least in 2019, previously, it might have been a little bit different, but in 2019 we use that for internal consumption mainly to go downstream into our specialty businesses, and we continue to sell our carbonate directly to third party customers.","Jim Sheehan","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Dmitry Silversteyn from Buckingham Research. Your line is open.","Dmitry Silversteyn","Good morning. Thank you for taking my call. A couple of questions if I may, you talked about the sort of the outlook for incremental volume growth that you're still going to get in 2020 without added capacity just from capacity ramp ups that you've done over 2019, but I just want to understand that the closure of the Wodgina mine, it doesn't impact sort of the progression of capacity additions that you've outlined in the second quarter slide when you took down the $1.5 billion CapEx expectation, right? I mean, in terms of hydroxide and carbonate capacity that's still going to go on line it through 2022 as you've outlined in this slide.","Luke Kissam","That's exactly right, Dmitry.","Dmitry Silversteyn","Okay. And then on the divestitures, I found it interesting that if you're getting sort of inquiries on the Catalyst in the fine chemistry business obviously the fine chemistry business has been around on the market, I guess for a while. On the Catalyst side, you mentioned kind of pro forma Catalyst being the subject of interest. Does that include the curatives and organometallics or would that still be strictly the FCC, HPC Catalyst business?","Luke Kissam","Yes, so let me be clear, Dmitry. It is, it is not the refining Catalysts, it is not FCC and it is not HPC, the inquiries have been for the PCS portion of that business, which you are right, are the organometallics and the curatives.","Dmitry Silversteyn","Okay, okay, you're looking - you basically - you look - you're looking at some of that, what I would call sort of orphan businesses, not necessarily contemplating yet the possibility of bromine or refining catalysts being used as a way to help you with the capital requirements in lithium?","Luke Kissam","Dmitry, just like asking me which one of my children are favorable, I love them all. I wouldn't call an orphan business, but I would say that they are quality businesses with good operating teams that can do much better if they have a focus and additional capital and with the competition for capital. We have, they're just not going to get it. So it's a better value creation for our stakeholders for divestiture. If, and only if, the valuation is where it needs to be. So that's how I look at it, okay.","Dmitry Silversteyn","Makes perfect sense Luke. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from PJ Juvekar from Citi. Your line is open.","Prashant Juvekar","Yes, hi, good morning, Luke. So in light of your Wodgina shutdown. Can you talk about the spodumene cost curve, what's the cost of marginal producer and whereas Wodgina fall there, and what signals are you looking - looking to for the start of Wodgina again?","Luke Kissam","Well, the best cost position in the world from spodumene rock is Talison and if you follow the purity of the rock and lack of foreign substances in there you follow the cost curve, with Talison is the premier in the world. If you take Talison out of the picture then Wodgina is right up there on the cost curve with the low cost producers out there from a quality resource, from the size of the resource, from the linked that we're going to be able to monitor from the cost position that we'll be able to get. So, it is a top tier resource from a cost standpoint and from a quality standpoint. Remember, we weren't planning to sell that spodumene, we we're going to use it to convert it to lithium hydroxide and when we look at the market today, it makes sense for us, we think today to treat Wodgina in the same way we treat Talison as a raw material source for the MARBL limited joint venture between Albemarle in MRL. So we'll get Kemerton online and we'll start that bright mechanical completion sometime in 2021. We have a period of time where we have to have qualification runs and then we'll look to source Wodgina with Kemerton.","To the extent the market conditions makes sense for us to bring whatever amount of capacity it makes for us to bring on for lithium hydroxide. We don't need to operate it wide open on day one, we'll will bring on capacity to meet that demand for lithium hydroxide and that will dictate how we run the Wodgina mine.","Prashant Juvekar","Sure, thank you for that. And then if you were to divest, you're Fine Chemistry and Performance Catalyst business. Is the long-term goal for Albemarle to become a pure lithium company or is it just to keep the dip refining catalyst business and bromine in the portfolio? So that's the cash generative business that can fund the growth of Lithium. Thank you.","Luke Kissam","Yes, I think lithium, we'll be able to fund it, if we start back and look lithium cash flow positive in 2021, '22 kind of time frame inclusive of service and it's debt, if you had to and things, like that, but right now, our goal is to drive shareholder value. When we look at our portfolio today, we see bromine and catalysts good solid business, high EBITDA margins that allows us to harvest cash and use that for the Lithium business. So we will consistently as we always have a look at our portfolio, but for the foreseeable future, we like where we are after these two divestitures.","Prashant Juvekar","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Colin Rusch from Oppenheimer & Company. Your line is open.","Colin Rusch","Thanks so much guys. As you're looking at the landscape of battery manufacturers and considering your strategy. Can you talk about consolidation in the industry, folks that maybe distressed and how you expect to handle that sort of situation?","Eric Norris","So, hey, Colin, this is Eric. So what we are seeing, and I've talked about before and it continues is a shift of power decision-making around Lithium and battery materials used in a battery to the battery manufacturers in sales and in some cases the OEM is getting more engaged. And so when we look at how we do business going forward, that is the group that we speak with as a group or partner with, that's a group, we have a great deal of our contract relationships already. Cathode players form the balance that's where there is more stress in the value chain, there is a lot more fragmentation and I think you will see some consolidation over time there, but it's hard to say at what pace that would occur, but that's the dynamic we see and we're well balanced and prepared with pretty deep relationships across all of those three parties, OEMs, battery producers, cathode producers.","Colin Rusch","Great. And then on the policy side, obviously the situation in China from a sell through perspective on - it has been a major disappointment, particularly in the second half of this year. What are you hearing in terms of potential for stimulus in China for vehicles and for you is at this point, if anything?","Luke Kissam","What we interpret as what - is going on is a pause, right, it's a - it's a shift in policies to intent the development of an industry that is part of the grand plan for China. So we have no doubt about Chinese intent and where they want to go and what we are hearing. Specifically, is that the drive towards higher energy density batteries and full battery electric vehicles is the aim of where they want to go. So we - recognize that, in the past couple of months it's been a pause, it's been a little slow, but we view that as simply a natural pause in the road of what will be significant growth, and we're certainly seeing that in the global EV space in Europe today.","Colin Rusch","Great, thanks so much guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Joseph [ph] from G. Research. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Good morning, everyone. Obviously, both lithium industry has responded to the softening price dynamic with you and others delaying or canceling capacity expansions, but with the amount of lithium carbonate sitting in supply chain, that needs to be consumed. Are you concerned, there's going to be more room for prices to fall going forward as the industry destocks?","Luke Kissam","We, as we said, I think on the call, you got $7 a kilo price kind of in China right now, we think that's about where their - whether cash cost of conversion is, I have seen a hard time them going much, much lower than that.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. And as the shift to high nickel cathodes accelerates and you're seeing the growth in lithium carbonate slow. Do you expect the price spread between the two to widen, it seems like it's tracked fairly steadily, this year, the $150 to $2 kilogram range?","Luke Kissam","Well, a couple of things I'll say. One is that the demand growth for carbonate remains strong, demand outlook for hydroxide is much stronger. Today, the workhorse of the industry is six to two chemistry, that we made with carbonate, four hydroxide which plays to Albemarle's advantages, we're the only producer that has ability to play both. As to the future, we see hydroxide, because of the growth we see in the hydroxide market getting tight, but today, I don't know that we would forecast any major change in spreads between the two.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy from Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open.","Kevin McCarthy","Yes, good morning. Luke, one of your industry peers announced a new contract with LG, earlier this week. As you consider your contract strategy given all that has transpired with lithium prices are you generally disinclined to enter new long-term contracts? Or are there perhaps isolated opportunities that look attractive?","Luke Kissam","Yes, so, Kevin. We're talking to everybody as I said, we're in negotiations under our existing long-term agreements and for new long-term agreements, both in the - both with OEMs, as well as with additional battery producers. So we are in negotiations and in discussions with a lot of moving parts and pieces and what that tells me is that, there is ability - there is a need for a security of supply from companies like Albemarle and everybody knows we're not - we will enter into a contract, long-term today at a $7 a kilo price for carbonate, is it not happen, we're not going to do it, it don't make any sense for us to do a lot of that in, because we think the market is going to move up. So we know the value we bring, I think the customers know the value that we bring as well and we're inclined to enter into agreements that will drive value for our stakeholders. That's the best way I know to describe it.","Kevin McCarthy","Okay, fair enough. And then second, with regard to your potential divestitures, how would you characterize the aggregate level of EBITDA there? And as a point of clarification is that amounts of EBITDA included in your 2020 guidance comments or are you contemplating a decrement or step down related to a midyear divestiture?","Scott Tozier","Kevin, this is Scott. So the combined EBITDA is kind of in the $55 million to $60 million range, we have not assumed that we sell those businesses in our guidance at this point in time. We just started the process as we talked about and we need to see if we're going to get the value for those businesses that we expect and if not, then we'll - if we don't - we'll hold them if, if we do - we'll end up by transacting.","Kevin McCarthy","Okay. Thank you, Scott.","Operator","Thank you. And that does conclude the question-and-answer session for today's conference. I'd now like to turn the conference back over to Dave Ryan for any closing remarks.","David Ryan","I'd like to thank everyone for joining us this morning and for your questions and participation. As always, we appreciate your interest. This concludes Albemarle's third quarter earnings call. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference.

Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mr. Dave Ryan, Vice President Corporate Strategy, Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Dave Ryan","Thank you and welcome to Albemarle's fourth quarter and full year 2019 earnings conference call. Our earnings were released after the close of the market yesterday and you'll find our press release, earnings presentation and non-GAAP reconciliations posted on our website under the Investors section at www.albemarle.com.","Joining me on the call today are Luke Kissam, Chief Executive Officer; Scott Tozier, Chief Financial Officer. We also have Raphael Crawford, President, Catalysts; Netha Johnson, President, Bromine Specialties; and Eric Norris, President, Lithium who will participate in the Q&A portion of the call.","As a reminder, some of the statements made during this conference call about our outlook, expected company performance, production volumes and commitments as well as Lithium demand may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws. Please note the cautionary language about forward-looking statements contained in our press release that same language applies to this call.","Please also note that some of our comments today refer to financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with GAAP. A GAAP reconciliation can be found in our earnings release and the appendix of our earnings presentation, both of which are posted on our website.","Now I will turn the call over to Luke.","Luke Kissam","Thanks, Dave. And good morning, everybody. On today's call, I will provide a recap of our 2019 strategic accomplishments and address the 2020 milestones that will be focused on to ensure we deliver on our vision. Scott will give you an update on the financials, our cost savings program and our full year 2020 guidance.","Despite a challenging back half of 2019, we grew fourth quarter and full year revenues adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share year over year. That reflects our ability to address a dynamic market and to deliver solid results across our businesses.","In addition, we achieved and adjusted EBITDA for the cooperation margin of 29%. 2019 was another strong step toward our long term vision. As you can see, on slide six of our earnings presentation, we made significant process on a number of strategic milestones.","Importantly, we made significant improvements in our safety program. Lithium reduces injury rate by 50% from 2018. Catalyst achieved its lowest recordable injury rate in four years. And Bromine surpassed two years with no lost time injuries. Our OSHA injury rate in 2019 puts us in the top quartile of our peers.","2019 marked our 25th consecutive year of double increases. And we are now included in the select group of companies that comprise the S&P 500 dividend aristocrats index. We demonstrated our commitment to return cash to shareholders through increasing annualized dividend from $0.10 in 1994 to $1.47 in 2019.","That's a 22% CAGR and we will continue that commitment well into the future. In 2019, we also conducted a materiality assessment to identify sustainability topics that support the execution of our strategy and ensure Albemarle maintains a strong financial position in a responsible manner for decades to come.","As you can see from page eight of the investor presentation, we're focusing on four key areas; people, natural resources, community engagement and our sustainable business model. In 2020 you'll see us establish baselines and long term targets for improvement. We look forward to updating you on our progress.","Consistent with our efforts to manage the portfolio and maintain a strong balance sheet. We announced last quarter our intent to divest the Fine Chemistry Services and Performance Catalyst Solutions businesses. The process for both businesses is going well.","Our first priority for the use of proceeds from these transactions will be to reduce debt. Also last quarter, we announced a program to capture sustainable cost savings. This program is well underway, and we expect to deliver $50 million in savings this year and reach a run rate of over $1 million in annual savings by year end 2021.","The new ERP system we implemented last year will enable this program with better real time visibility into all of our operations. Scott will provide more detail about the program in his session. To support our Lithium growth plans. We continue to make progress on major capital expansion projects during 2019.","We successfully commissioned our Xinyu II Lithium hydroxide unit in China, with the startup and operating teams exceeding their 2019 targets and reaching full nameplate operating rates in less than 12 months. We also increased our Lithium carbonate production in La Negra I and II by about 5%.","The La Negra III and IV Lithium carbonate expansion in Chile is on schedule for commissioning by the first quarter of 2021. Finally, the Kemerton Lithium hydroxide unit in Western Australia is targeted for commissioning during the latter half of 2021.","We also continue to develop our best in class Lithium resources. The Talison joint venture completed phase II of the Greenbushes expansion in the fourth quarter, bringing their annual capacity for chemical grades spodumene to approximately 160,000 metric tons on an LCE basis.","Albemarle has rights to half of that production. In addition, Albemarle secured access to world class Wodgina spodumene mine through our MARBL joint venture. This joint venture has the resources and ultimately will have the conversion assets to annually produce 100,000 metric tons on an LCE basis of battery grade Lithium hydroxide.","Keep in mind that we are currently using less than 25% of our available Lithium resources, which gives us the ability to respond quickly to support the Lithium demand growth for at least the next 10 to 15 years. Turning to our long term Lithium contracts. Currently about 90% of our battery grade carbonate and hydroxide volume is under contract.","To-date, we have reached agreement with all but one of our contracted customers on one year price concessions for 2020, which results in a mid-teen percentage price reduction compared to 2019, with technical and battery grade carbonate seen higher reductions and hydroxide being generally lower.","Otherwise, the basic structures of our long term agreements remain unchanged. We will continue to manage these agreements to evolve with the individual needs of our customer. Each customer has unique value drivers that are critical to them.","We remain committed to leveraging our world class resources and low cost conversion processes to meet the growing demand and deliver a differentiated value proposition to each customer. As we outlined at our Investor Day in December, while we are slightly adapting some aspects of our execution, our strategy remains largely the same:","Invest in growth and focus on cash generation in Lithium through smart investments, and our advantage resource position. Maximize the earnings in cash and Bromine and Catalyst through sustainable cost savings and investments in systems, people, processes and operational excellence. Assess our portfolio for opportunities to divest non-core businesses, and acquire or build Lithium conversion assets at a lower capital intensity. And take a thoughtful and disciplined approach to capital allocation while preserving financial flexibility. ","By executing that strategy by 2024 Albemarle should generate revenue in the range $4.7 billion to $5.3 billion. A five year CAGR versus 2019 results of 6% to 9%. Adjusted EBITDA of $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion. A CAGR growth of 8% to 12%, adjusted EBITDA margin between 32% and 36%. A 300 to 700 basis points improvement. And $1 billion of annual sustainable free cash flow.","In December, we also outlined the mini inputs we use to build our Lithium demand forecasts. These inputs include historical and forecasted technology advancements, cost projections, OEM model announcements, and a number of other factors.","We continue to see the advancements of these variables, which further reduce impediments to wide scale consumer adoption; namely range anxiety, infrastructure and cost parity. The global average range of new EV models launch is expected to exceed 200 miles, with some models exceeding 300.","To support mobility there are now almost 1 million public EV charging connections globally, and the number will continue to expand, especially in Europe and China. And cost improvements through technology and scale are also accelerating.","In their most recent surveys, Bloomberg New Energy Finance reported that the average costs for a Lithium ion BEV battery pack was in the range of $150 per kilowatt hour in 2019. The $100 per kilowatt hour milestone is now within reach in the 2022 to 2024 time period, well ahead of estimates just a year or two ago. ","In fact upfront purchase parity predictions are also being pulled forward into the 2022 timeframe. All of these trends are consistent with the projections of our model, leaving us even more confident in our demand expectations.","I remain very confident in the Lithium market demand we will see over the next three -- four to five years and in Albemarle's ability to seize that opportunity. Albemarle has the best Lithium resources in the world. Converting those resources into battery grade carbonate and hydroxide cost effectively will be absolutely critical to support that demand growth. Remember, there is no EV revolution without lithium. ","With that I'll turn the call over to Scott to provide greater detail on fourth quarter performance and full year outlook. ","Scott Tozier","Thanks, Luke. And good morning everyone. Albemarle generated unadjusted US GAAP net income of $90 million during the fourth quarter, bringing full year 2019 net income to $533 million, compared to $694 million in 2018.","Increased charges for the MARBL acquisition during 2019 were a factor. However, 2018 benefited from $170 million gain on the sale of the polyolefins and components business, creating a difficult comparison.","Full year 2019 adjusted earnings were $6.04 per diluted share an increase of $0.63 or 12% over the prior year on a 2018 pro forma basis. Our businesses delivered about $0.58 per share of that growth.","2019 also benefited from a favorable tax rate and from our 2018 share repurchase program. The gains were partially offset by currency impacts, higher depreciation in Lithium and increased corporate expense.","Net cash from operations was $719 million in 2019, an increase of just over 30% versus the prior year, driven by the strength of the businesses, a reduction in Lithium working capital and improved working capital across the rest of the company.","Capital expenditures in total ended 2019 at $852 million after approximately $90 million in expenditures shifted into 2020 based on invoice timing. As Luke mentioned, all our major growth projects remain on track, and we will continue to update you on their progress throughout the year. ","In November 2019, we closed the note offerings on the equivalent of about $1.6 billion which we used to pay the MARBL joint venture cash payment and restructured the short end of our maturity curve.","As a result of the bond offerings, we are able to reduce our annual average interest costs by 70 basis points to 2.7% and get our investment grade ratings reaffirmed by all three agencies. We closed 2019 with a net debt to EBITDA right on track at 2.4.","Now, let me move on to the business performance. During 2019, Bromine delivered sales of just over $1 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $328 million, a year on year growth of 9% and 14%, respectively. Full-year adjusted EBITDA margin was strong at 33%.","Although there is continued weakness in the automotive sector, the other markets for flame retardants and Bromine derivatives remained healthy supporting year-over-year volume growth and elevated prices.","Volume growth was supported by the tetrabrom expansion in Jordan that came online in mid-2018. Placing continued to be void by constraint production of elemental Bromine by Chinese competitors.","Full year Catalyst sales were $1.1 billion and adjusted EBITDA was $271 million, approximately flat compared to 2018 excluding divested businesses. Refining Catalyst provided mid-single digit percent adjusted EBITDA growth, excluding onetime insurance settlements that were received in 2018.","Strong sales volumes in HPC and low single digit price increases in FCC helped to offset lower FCC volumes. During the fourth quarter, lithium volumes were up 27% compared to the fourth quarter of 2018.","Average pricing was flat in the quarter, and customer mix hurt sales by about 5%. Increased tolling to meet customer commitments and the negative customer mix resulted in adjusted EBITDA margins of 34%.","For the full year, Lithium generated net sales of $1.36 billion, and the increase of about 11%. Adjusted EBITDA was $525 million down by about 1% compared to 2018. And then full year adjusted EBITDA margin was 39%. ","During 2019, we grew Lithium LCE volume by 14% versus the prior year. Our average prices remained flat under a backdrop of an overall industry prices being down 28% to 30% year-on-year demonstrating the strength of our customer relationships and contract structure. ","As we mentioned in our Investor Day, the lithium market has been more volatile than we expected. So we're adjusting our approach. We have access to the world's lowest cost resources in both bromine and lithium.","But to succeed in a volatile marketplace, we need to have low cost operations and business processes as well. As Luke mentioned earlier, our sustainable cost savings program is well underway.","We have identified over 70 discrete projects, assigned project ownership and instituted a tracking dashboard. We've included $50 million of anticipated sustainable savings in our 2020 guidance. About 40% of the savings will come from selling and administrative costs.","For example, we have identified savings of more than $10 million that we can achieve through the reduction of outside services. About 40% will also come from reduced factory spending and operational efficiency.","For example, an operational excellence project at one of our production facilities is expected to generate $6 million to $7 million in savings this year. And the last 20% of savings will come from supply chain activities, like procurement and logistics.","For example, one program will consolidate the number of freight forwarders that we use across the globe. We are confident in our ability to achieve this milestone in 2020 and reach our targeted run rate of $100 million by the end of 2021.","And we'll provide periodic updates on our progress throughout the year. Execution of our capital projects continues to be a focus in 2020. Due to the timing of payments that pushed from 2019, capital spending in 2020 will be higher than previously anticipated. ","You can expect total CapEx of between $1 billion and $1.1 billion with over 70% of that dedicated to Lithium growth. We are certain that our businesses will continue to perform at a level that generates the cash needed for this growth plan.","Net cash from operations is expected to range between $700 million and $800 million in 2020, up modestly from 2019 due to lower working capital. Free cash flow is expected to remain about the same as 2019.","Note that on page 18 of our earnings deck, we have provided some additional data points on our forecasts that may be helpful when you're doing your models. Now let me turn to our business unit outlook for 2020.","I'm going to begin with the Coronavirus and the impacts from that. Our thoughts are with the families, who have been impacted by this virus. For Albemarle, we've had zero confirmed cases among our employees.","We are diligently managing the situation to protect our employees and the local communities and are complying with all government and health agency recommendations and requirements. In addition to our Chinese lithium hydroxide conversion facilities in Xinyu and Chengdu, we occupy offices in several cities across China.","Employees in these offices have been working from home and are expected to return next week on a limited basis. In Lithium, we continue to operate safely, but at a reduced capacity at our production sites, and in cooperation with the local government offices are determining the next steps to resume our normal operations.","To date, we've experienced minimal order reductions from our customers and have been able to produce the quantities needed to fulfill orders. However, each businesses is experiencing logistics delays.","The potential impact on deliveries to our customers and deliveries of raw materials to our facilities remains an area of concern. In Lithium, there's a risk that the automotive OEM slowdown in China will have ripple effects.","For example, the potential of inventory building up at the battery manufacturers could impact us later in the year. And our lithium hydroxide conversion plant construction at Kemerton in Western Australia relies in part on equipment sourced from China.","The start-up of the plant could experience delays given the uncertainty for Chinese equipment deliveries. To date, though project construction has been proceeding as expected. In Catalyst, our largest risk is lower FCC sales to customers who export fuel into China, to the degree that transportation within China continues to be restricted.","And a secondary risk is that raw materials that we source from China, but we currently have sufficient inventory to cover our requirements well into the second quarter. In Bromine, the primary risk is related to logistics caused by shortage of drivers, and depends on the duration of restrictions on people movement to manage virus containment.","Overall, we expect a weak first quarter in China. And depending on the continued length and severity of the outbreak, our operations could be further negatively impacted. 2020 will be a pivotal year for Lithium.","EV growth in Europe is expected to accelerate driven by fleet wide CO2 reduction targets. Growth in China is still uncertain. We saw the market begin to stabilize at the end of 2019 and expect growth to return in 2020.","However, the impact from the corona virus adds a measure of uncertainty on how the year will play out. We anticipate the total lithium demand to increase by about 50,000 metric tons and inventories to begin to tighten as we go through the year.","Our volume growth will be about 3% in 2020, and will be limited until we commission the La Negra III I have Lithium covenant expansion in early 2021. As Luke mentioned we have reached agreement with all but one of our contracted customers and are sold out on battery grade materials. ","Although the prior inventory buildup and additional supply availability put pressure on pricing for 2020 versus our prices and 2019, we believe that market pricing has stabilized. Unfavorable pricing will be partially offset by lower costs as a result of reduced tolling volumes, higher operating rates, lower royalties in Chile, and the impact of our cost savings program. ","Consequently, we expect a year over year decline in adjusted EBITDA of about 20%. For Bromine, we expect 2020 adjusted EBITDA performance to be flat to slightly down compared to 2019. Demand for flame retardants and other bromine derivatives is expected to remain stable.","However, slightly increased supply across the industry could put price pressure on the business in the second half. We are operating in a sold out position, meaning we have little to no headroom to make up any price degradation with volume growth.","However, we will continue to optimize our sales into markets that provide us with the highest margins. We expect Catalyst adjusted EBITDA to be flat to slightly up year on year, with the second half somewhat stronger than the first.","FCC Catalysts are expected to benefit from strong demand and an improved product mix. However, our FCC units are also operating at full capacity, limiting our ability to benefit from additional volume upside. ","Clean Fuels Technologies or Hydro Processing Catalysts is expected to be slightly down based on our incumbency mix, and a lower year for disservice turnarounds and change outs. Since we'll be operating Bromine, Lithium and FCC Catalyst at sold out utilization rates, our operational excellence teams will be focused on reliability and productivity improvements to get the most we can from these assets.","Driven by the pricing pressure in Lithium and Bromine, modest low single digit volume growth in all divisions and the high utilization of our manufacturing assets. We expect 2020 net sales to be $3.48 billion to $3.53 billion.","Adjusted EBITDA should range between $880 million and $930 million, with an overall corporate adjusted EBITDA margin of around 26%. In total, this is expected to result in an adjusted diluted earnings per share between $4.80 and $5.10.","With Lithium sales and Catalyst HPC shipments weighted to the second half, we currently expect the cadence of earnings to ramp up through the year. Due in part to the impact from the coronavirus on global logistics on each of our businesses and lower lithium volumes while our customers make inventory adjustments, the first half adjusted EBITDA is estimated to be 15% to 20% below the first half of 2019 and Q1 could be down as much as 20% to 25% year-over-year.","In closing, the actions we've taken give us confidence that we are heading into '20 -- as we head into 2021, we will deliver sustainable savings, actively report on our sustainability goals and support notable volume growth in Lithium and be positioned to achieve positive free cash flow. ","And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Dave. ","Dave Ryan","Operator, we are now ready to open the lines for Q&A. But before doing so I'd like to remind everyone to please limit questions to two per person to ensure that all participants have a chance to ask questions. Then feel free to get back into the queue for follow ups if time allows. Please proceed.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Bob Koort from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. ","Bob Koort","Thanks very much. Luke, I wanted to ask about the contracting approach. I guess you characterized there is a onetime concession in 2020. Can you talk about maybe why you took that avenue as opposed to maybe just repricing every year?","And then secondly, I think you talked about range, which would seem to suggest again a trend towards hydroxide but maybe there's been some more news about LFP and some other cathode types gaining some momentum. Can you just talk about how you see that developing over the next couple of years? Thanks. ","Luke Kissam","Yeah, I'll take the first one. And I'll turn it over to Eric to talk a little bit about the hydroxide versus, call it -- I'm assuming you're talking about the LRP. They talked about with LFP -- I'm sorry. I'm thinking about a long range plan here, the LFP that Tesla announced with CATL.","So I think the idea on the contract is that there's a situation that is occurring today that we want to address. But we believe that that dynamic will change over the next three to four years. That means a long-term contract.","So it doesn't make any sense for us to reset that contract for five or six years when we think we've got a short term disconnect here between supply and demand. So we thought it was in our best interest to address the concerns that the customers had today, yet keep the overall structure of those contracts where they are. ","Now, that's not the say long term. We might not see modifications of our plan of the contracts. But this is why you have a long-term contract. You set those prices. We've got a short term issue. We address it short term.","And then it goes back to the way the contract was and we have to renegotiate in 2021. We'll do the same thing again. So that's why Bob, we took that approach as opposed to just set -- it doesn't do us any good to set the price when the market's low.","I mean, that doesn't make any sense at all. So we were trying to preserve the integrity of those agreements while adjusting to the marketplace for the short time for that short window that we see that there's an issue. ","With that. I'll turn it over to Eric to talk a little bit about your question on the LFP. ","Eric Norris","So hey, Bob, it's Eric. So with regard to LFP or lithium iron phosphate and cathode. As you may know, the China market has used that as a workhorse for a variety of applications for some years now. And that supply chain is well developed in China.","As you I think, also know we've talked about the development of high nickel chemistries, which would shift from carbonate which is using iron phosphate predominantly to hydroxide for high nickel, that tends to be a range driven technology get high energy density to provide higher driving ranges.","And that's a phenomenon that appears to be most prominent outside of China, with large established global automotive OEMs. And also Tesla. What Tesla's announced recently is the adoption it appears from the press releases of working with iron phosphate to provide a compromise of reduced range for a lower costs.","That market we view being a China market today. We still believe in the US and in Europe, and for that matter, other developed countries like Japan that range is an important consideration for the adoption rates we're seeing.","But the reason we've talked about the value we have as a player, both carbonate and hydroxide is that we can play in both opportunities. I think the Chinese subsidy changes or the reduction of substantive changes as maybe strengthen the movement to LFP.","Because it helps. It's not putting a premium -- it's not giving an incentive to move to higher range. And I think the characteristics of a Chinese consumer support, potentially a lower range, lower cost vehicle, and that's the market that I think Tesla sees. ","Luke Kissam","Yes, this is Luke. Just one other thing. If you go back and look to our Investor Day presentation we did in December, we were still talking about carbonate production doubling between now and 2025, going from about 195, to about 14 and hydroxide going from 70 to 525.","So, we believe carbonate is going to continue to grow. We think there's going to be a higher growth in hydroxide. But we do have the flexibility to go either way.","There seems to be some scraping on the phones. I'm not quite sure what that is. But operator can you check on that please? And we'll go to the next question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from PJ Juvekar from Citi. Your line is open. Please check if your line is on mute.","PJ Juvekar","The one year price concessions you talked about is mid-teens. What happens after that? We go back to the old price [technical difficulty] from current levels? Just in terms of timing these negotiations happened before the coronavirus hit or was it after coronavirus? ","Luke Kissam","So, it's a one year amendment. So in 2021, it go back to the original agreements and if we have to negotiate from there in some instances, we will. But you go back to the original agreement. The discussions took place before and during the coronavirus. ","PJ Juvekar","Right. And just one quick question on Bromine. You mentioned that, you're seeing some -- there could be some pricing impact in second half, because of increased supply. Can you just sort of elaborate on that? ","Luke Kissam","Yes, I'm going to let Netha handle that, please.","Netha Johnson","If you look at the import data of people who are importing bromine into China, you can see from the data very clearly that there's more supply going in to China than what we have last year. So, we expect that trend to continue and we'll see that supply increase into that market, which will put some pressure on pricing.","PJ Juvekar","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from John Roberts from UBS. Your line is open.","John Roberts","Thank you and Luke, I know you have at least one more quarterly call coming but good luck with your treatments and thank you for your service. And could I ask, do you have any covenant issues if you don't get the divestments off? Okay.","Luke Kissam","Scott, now will be okay. We're monitoring that carefully, but given our outlook and given even our lower risk or higher risk type of scenario with coronavirus, will be okay. ","John Roberts","Okay. And then there's been a lot of news recently about stationary storage. Are we reaching an inflection point where that could actually start to become material?","Eric Norris","John, this is Eric. So, I would reference the Investor Day presentation. When we talked about the demand that's there. It's still a small part of the demand picture. It's growing rapidly.","That said, I see the same news you see about being continued push towards these sorts of installations. So, we're watching it closely. But we still don't view that as being quite the mover for our strategy and driving the capacity growth that we see and the volume contracts we have with our customers.","It doesn't look -- it's still EVs that really drives that in that equation for us.","John Roberts","Thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Joel Jackson from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. ","Joel Jackson","Hi. Good morning. So for my two questions first one thank you for the update on how corona virus may be impacting your business. When you set your guidance here for 2020, what did you assume were the impacts from corona virus in the first half year, second half year? I understand all the uncertainties are especially around OEMs and auto sales in China. Thanks. ","Luke Kissam","Yeah. So I think Joel, that's the big point is that it is really difficult to know exactly how this is going to play out. Every day there's a new data point out there in terms of, is it getting worse, is it getting better?","China's trying to get back to work and how long that's going to take. So it's difficult to know. I think as you look at our first half, there's certainly a component of corona virus that's built into that.","So particularly in the first quarter with the expectation of EBITDA overall being down between 20% and 25%, part of that's coronavirus, part of that's inventory adjustments happening within the Lithium business. So, as we get out further in the year, we'll just have to continue to adjust and keep you updated. ","Scott Tozier","But suffice it to say that what we're looking at coronavirus is it is a delay. It is causing the first half to be weaker. We were already talking about a weaker fast to begin with. It's making it weaker. But we're not projecting now for it to have an impact on the full year. ","Joel Jackson","Okay. So just my second question was first can be a follow up. So then it sounds like what you're saying is impacting first month of the year and it sounds like you're expecting then to all come back to in the second half of the year.","And then my second question would be, inventory situation right now for feed stock and for the chemicals. How's it looking right now, both for Albemarle and for the industry? And what are you seeing in terms of closures or curtailments for some of the spodumene players, some of the conversion plants in China? Thanks. ","Luke Kissam","Well, you are talking specifically about Lithium or across our portfolio?","Joel Jackson","I'm talking about for both Albemarle and Lithium industry for both feedstock, spodumene also for the technical things. ","Luke Kissam","So to date we have not seen an input on the raw materials for us. We've been able to secure the raw materials that we need to run in the first quarter. As we referenced on our calls, we've had lower run rates in China than we had anticipated for our Lithium.","But it hadn't been an issue to date of getting raw materials in our other businesses. We have seen some in -- if you listen to the calls and I know you have, you seen a number of chemical industries, companies talking about the ability to get raw materials.","But we're pretty well okay for that from a raw material standpoint right now. We don't see that as an issue from where we are in the timeframes they're talking about on the coronavirus. I do think one of the issues that we don't know about is, as -- if you look at the automotive OEM, some of them are not running today, but some of the batteries are running today, both inside and outside of China.","So what remains to be seen is for the full year are the automotive OEMs going to run fast enough to soak up the inventory levels in that Lithium that we would expect over the year or is there going to be a ripple effect later in the year which would put our full year kind of some downward pressure on that.","We've got contracted volumes, so we don't expect it to be a significant risk. But that's one of the things that we're going to really keep our eyes on is what is a real impact, not only on our products but on our supply chains, and particularly in Bromine and in Lithium as these end product OEMs either ramp up or ramp down during the course of the year.","That's the biggest unknown issue that we'll face. And we're not -- we don't sell to the -- we're not a tier one supplier. We're further back in the chain. So that causes a ripple effect to be even more. ","Joel Jackson","What do you think of the inventories for spodumene carbon and hydroxide right now in the industry? Thanks.","Eric Norris","Hey, Joel its Eric. Overall we would say that, we're about six month's inventory across the supply chain. And so as you look at that, it's probably closer to four months for refined lithium. And the additional couple months is excess spodumene.","The excess spodumene that's in inventory now, a great deal of it is not economic at current prices. Meaning it's not at 6%. It's not at the grade to be able to cost effectively be converted at current spot prices.","So, it's -- that is what we'll watch very carefully this year, right? We expect demand growth of 50,000 tons. So, it's going to be an overhang for the year. Supply growth as you referenced in your question has already been curtailed.","We see very little supply growth year over year. It's going to be stocks and the drawdown of those stocks would be important to the stabilization. And we'll look for that over the next 12 months and give you updates as to what that we think that means for pricing later in the year as we approach 2021. ","Joel Jackson","Thank you very much. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. ","David Begleiter","Thank you. Good morning. Luke, you mentioned that one customer had not agreed to the down 15% in Lithium. How large is that customer and what's the expectation for those negotiations? ","Luke Kissam","So Dave, you know the answer to that question. I'm not going to get into a conversation about a specific customer. Our expectation, obviously is we're going to meet and find a resolution that meets that customer needs and meets our expectations. And if not our position is we've got a validity enforceable contract. ","David Begleiter ","Understood. And on the non-tech, non-battery grade, technical grade lithium, what's your expectations for pricing in 2020 versus 2019? ","Luke Kissam","For technical grade lithium? ","David Begleiter","Correct.","Luke Kissam","Yes. So, if you look at both carbonate and as I said on the call the technical grade carbonate will be down more than that mid-teens average that we talked about, as I said in our prepared remarks. It is down more than that. ","David Begleiter ","I actually meant the non-battery grade lithium? ","Luke Kissam","Oh, my apologies. I'll turn it over to Eric.","Eric Norris","Yes. I think Luke said it, but let me summarize it. So, as Luke said, on the battery grade side, carbonate is probably down a little more than hydroxide. And on the technical grade side, all technical grade products are down bit more than battery.","And so in Specialties mixed, very mixed. It's not as price sensitive an area although there are the input lithium -- there is input lithium materials in that business and it does have a mild effect on price. That would be the least affected. ","David Begleiter ","Thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Sheehan from SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Your line is open. ","Jim Sheehan","Thank you. In Catalyst, your outlook for flattish earnings in 2020. Can you describe what impact on IMO 2020 regulation is having? And what is the underlying growth you're seeing in that business, excluding the IMO 2020 and also, what is your outlook for FCC pricing in 2020?","Raphael Crawford","Hey, Jim. This is Raphael. So to give you a view I mean as Scott and Luke have indicated, we're expecting a fairly strong year on FCC Catalyst, and a slightly weaker year on HPC Catalyst. The reason for that, as explained in Investor Day is that our HPC Catalyst is about change outs, and the change outs happened to be smaller in 2020 for distillates than they were in 2019.","And that's an area of strength for our business. Overall, the industry will see IMO 2020 as a tailwind. For our business of higher diesel production to blend to be able to meet the sulfur specs is favorable.","It might not be as favorable as it is for others because our business is weighted more towards distillate than it is towards resid. And resid is the areas that will benefit the most from IMO 2020. Again, it will be positive perhaps not as positive it could be for others.","But we have a very strong business in distillate and in specialty Catalysts for hydro processing and the trends in the industry are favorable overall for the long term in that business. As you -- it's a little bit too early on FCC pricing.","We did have positive pricing in 2019. It's too early to say in 2020. Crack spreads are a little narrower than they have been. So that that could have an impact. But our business is about value creation for our customers. We continue to do that and where we can get value pricing for that value creation we will. ","Jim Sheehan","Thank you. And under $50 million in cost savings for 2020. Could you just discuss how the savings will be realized by segment? ","Scott Tozier","Yes, Jim, this is Scott. So as you look at this kind of a split out, roughly you're going to get about two thirds of that savings in Lithium business; about 10% in Catalyst and Bromine; and the remainder is going to be in the corporate functions is how it will play out in 2020.","Jim Sheehan","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas from JP Morgan. Your line is open.","Jeff Zekauskas","Thank you very much. You said that you thought that global lithium demand would grow about 50,000 tons in 2020. How fast do you think it grew in 2019? And wouldn't 50,000 tons imply about a million incremental electric vehicles for 2020 or how big is the component tied to electric vehicles? And how do you calculate it?","Eric Norris","Hey, Jeff. This is Eric. Yes, the growth of 50,000 tons was a similar growth rate last year. The issue last year was we had a lot of excess supply and a lot of excess inventory. So a lot of our customers didn't buy.","They didn't actually buy a lot of -- a lot of people in the market didn't buy that volume. They actually drew down their inventories instead. But their real consumption was in that same order of magnitude. ","For us looking forward then yeah, we it does imply a growth and a significant growth in electric vehicles. Our view on 2019 was that it was -- production was about 2.6 million electric vehicles. And we're looking for that number to be close to -- go up to 3.5 million to 4 million.","So it's over million electric vehicles in growth. Most of that's going to be driven out of the European producers, automotive producers.","Jeff Zekauskas","Okay. And then in your financials, your equity income in the Lithium business drops sequentially from maybe rough $30 million to $15 million. What's going on in Talison such that the equity income is dropping so sharply? And how do you see that for 2020?","Luke Kissam","Yeah, Jeff. I think you're referring to the fourth quarter. And the equity income for Talison and in the Lithium business is largely driven by the volume that's been taken by both Tianqi or Albemarle either that joint venture.","And so we did see reduced shipments primarily going to Tianqi in the fourth quarter. Expecting that will be roughly flat as we go into -- roughly flat to slightly down as we go into 2020 overall.","Jeff Zekauskas","So that\u2019s flat to down from the fourth quarter or year-over-year versus the previous year?","Luke Kissam ","Year-over-year. ","Jeff Zekauskas","Okay, good. Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Harrison from Seaport Global Securities. Your line is open.","Mike Harrison","Hi, good morning. Moving on Slide 7 the Assess box there. Can you give us an update on the opportunities that you're seeing to acquire Lithium conversion assets, as opposed to building additional conversion capacity?","Maybe how you're thinking about that buy versus build strategy today versus how you might have been looking at it a few quarters ago?","Luke Kissam ","Yeah, it's the matter of pricing. I think the reduced price that we've seen of carbonate in the marketplace and the inability to get some of the spodumene rock as the raw material supply has brought some prices down to a level that it appears to us you could have a lower capital base.","And if you build your own then you would be in the market a lot sooner. So for us, it all comes down to is there a price at which when you look at our all in cost of acquiring, modifying where necessary to meet HSE standpoints and converting from either carbonate hydroxide or what have you?","What's that return on capital? How we lay that out versus what's the return on capital and timing for building? It's a mathematical equation for us. And you got to negotiate it and be able to close it as well.","So that that's how we're looking at it. And there are opportunities out there because of our tolling relationships we're familiar with many. So we are in active evaluations.","Mike Harrison","All right. And then in terms of Lithium customer mix, you mentioned that that was a negative in the fourth quarter. Can you talk about how that plays out during 2020. Is that something -- is mixed something that maybe improves as we get later in the year? Maybe we get some additional hydroxides demand growth.","Eric Norris","Well, hey, Michael, it's Eric, I would say it's, we have -- 2019 had a lot of moving parts to it. In 2020 we're going to have an equal amount of growth in production out of La Negra and out of Xinyu for hydroxide.","And at the same time, a big reduction in toll volumes we sell into the marketplace. As Luke said, Scott said, we've contract out 9% of our business. We endeavor each year to try to keep the mix fairly constants. We don't have swings from period-to-period.","The simple fact of the matter is, is that we tend to produce a lot more carbonate at the end of the year than beginning. So there's sometimes some product mix factors. And some customers factors. I don't know if it will probably be similar throughout the year. But again, we try to manage it. So it doesn't cause these swings as best we can. But I think it'll be fairly similar.","Mike Harrison","Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Colin Rusch from Oppenheimer. Your line is open. ","Colin Rusch","Thanks so much, guys. Can you talk about what's going on with your customers in terms of potential consolidation and how you think about that, not just in 2020, but as you move into 2021 2022, with some of the production schedules that you're getting from the OEMs? ","Luke Kissam","If you're looking at, you're talking I'm assuming about Lithium and the battery producers. What we said is that we've seen the decisions moving from the cathode producers to the battery producers and then some instance all the way to the OEM.","So we've seen that as those big battery producers making the purchasing decisions and the volume decisions. And then allocating some of that volume from in-house production and then some of it to be directed towards certain of the cathode producer.","So we are seeing that, that will in effect, consolidate the decision makers about these purchasing decisions. And then you can try it and we're down to a lower number. I think long term as you look across the spectrum, you're going to see a consolidation even further of battery producers.","You're going to have -- the Koreans and Chinese and the Japanese are going to consolidate into the bigger producers. That's a bit typical of what you seen in other industries and I do not think this is going to be any different.","Colin Rusch ","Okay. And then, we're seeing OEMs with various challenges in terms of getting into production and ramping up production on EVs it's a different manufacturing process. Can you talk a little bit about the CapEx plans in your ability to modulate the spend this year and early next year as you see those schedules adjust, because obviously there's a fair amount of variability there?","Luke Kissam ","Yes. So I think on carbonate, if you look at carbonate, we've got La Negra III and IV. That's going to come online by the first quarter of 2021 and will be commissioned. Most of that spending is already done.","So it's kind of hard to do anything there on La Negra. I'm sorry on further at La Negra, we have the ability, we have the plans where if necessary, we could expand that. But it would be kind of the 2 to 3-year process at La Negra for a carbonate plant.","If you are looking at hydroxide, from a Kemerton standpoint. We believe, we're on track for the second half of 2021. For start-up, it will be difficult to rattle that back much, because of the cost we've got in there.","And if anything else we build is going to be a lower capital intensity. So that's why we're looking a build versus buy in an area like China. You can probably get it done in China from start to finish in about 2 years.","We have teams in our engineering working right now on taking the plans and the designs that we have and building a lower capital intensity and a lower operating costs, looking at what our opportunities are there. ","So the next asset that we build from a hydroxide conversion standpoint. We will build more efficiently, more cost effectively and operate it with lower cost than the ones we have today. We got to continually drive that down.","In addition to that, I know there you can take -- as you know you take carbonate and convert it to lithium hydroxide. We also have teams looking at what is the most cost effective way. If the market goes that way, what is the most cost effective way?","Would we build that in close to our carbonate facilities? Will we convert that -- convert the carbonate somewhere else? What is the best way to do that? And the idea of modularizing that is a concept that we're looking at.","But we need to be prepared to pull the trigger on that if and when the market calls for that. Again, that would take you probably, if you're building it in China is probably 50% of the capital and probably a year of the timing to get it built, to get it permitted and get it up and running. ","Colin Rusch ","Excellent. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. And that does conclude our question-and-answer session for today's conference. And I would now like to turn the call back over to Dave Ryan for any closing remarks.","Dave Ryan","Just like to thank everybody for their participation today and for your questions. And as always, we appreciate your interest. This concludes Albemarle's fourth quarter earnings call. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program you may all disconnect. Everyone have a wonderful day. "],"1424":["Albemarle Corp.

My name is Emma, and I will be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session towards the end of the conference. As a reminder, this call is being recorded for replay purposes.","And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Matt Juneau. Please proceed, sir.","Matthew K. Juneau - Albemarle Corp.","Thank you, and welcome to Albemarle's fourth quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Our earnings were released after the close of the market yesterday, and you'll find our press release, earnings presentation, and non-GAAP reconciliations posted on our website under the Investors section at www.albemarle.com.","Joining me on the call today are Luke Kissam, Chief Executive Officer; Raphael Crawford, President \u2013 Bromine Specialties; Silvio Ghyoot, President \u2013 Refining Solutions; Joris Merckx, President \u2013 Chemetall Surface Treatment; and John Mitchell, President \u2013 Lithium & Advanced Materials.","As a reminder, some of the statements made during this conference call about the future performance of the company may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws.

Finally, all year-over-year financial comparisons are based on pro forma 2014 results as shown in the April 2015 8-K to facilitate a cleaner comparison.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Luke to summarize 2015 performance.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Thanks, Matt. 2015 was a year, in which we began the transformation of Albemarle with the acquisition of Rockwood. It was the year of change, integration and most importantly, execution and performance. We laid out our goals for the year in early 2015: integrate the Rockwood businesses; achieve $50 million of synergies; deliver adjusted EBITDA between $935 million and $1 billion; deliver adjusted free cash flow of $450 million to $550 million; and divest non-core assets. We delivered on all of these objectives and raised our dividend for the 21st consecutive year.","The Lithium and Chemetall Surface Treatment businesses we acquired exceeded our initial 2015 profitability expectations. In total, as forecasted, the company generated $959 million of adjusted EBITDA, and $506 million of free cash flow before one-time items. Excluding negative currency exchange impacts, Lithium, Chemetall Surface Treatment, Heavy Oil Upgrading, and PCS each grew adjusted EBITDA by greater than 10% versus 2014.","We completed the sale of the Metal Sulfides business in January and of our Minerals business at the beginning of February 2016. Neither of these businesses were core for us. And the proceeds from those sales have already been applied against our debt, allowing us to retire a roughly $330 million in debt. As a result, our net debt has been reduced to about $3.3 billion, as of early-February, in line with our expectations. This is an important step toward our goal of reaching our net debt-to-EBITDA target of 2.5 times by the end of 2017.","In 2015, our focused efforts on integrations and synergies allowed us to reduce costs and become more efficient without negatively impacting our businesses in any way. In total, our team achieved $60 million of synergies-related savings in 2015, 20% above our original commitment. On a full year basis, synergies achieved in 2015 will deliver savings of roughly $88 million in 2016, putting us slightly ahead of schedule and leaving only $32 million needed in additional synergies to reach our goal of $120 million in savings in 2016 as compared to 2014. We already have identified projects in place that give us confidence that we will achieve this goal.","Finally, we strengthened our industry-leading Lithium business by reaching three critical milestones. First, we completed and started up our new 20,000 metric ton battery-grade lithium carbonate plant in La Negra, Chile. Second, we received a new permit, which allows us to significantly increase brine pumped at the Salar de Atacama to speed our expansion plans for battery-grade lithium derivatives.","Third, we announced a memorandum of understanding with Corfo which will extend the life and increase the volume of our lithium quota in Chile. Once the definitive agreement on the quota is signed, which we expect in the next few months, we will have significantly increased our permitted annual production capacity of lithium carbonate from the Atacama brine source to more than 70,000 metric tons.","The definitive agreement will increase both the quantity of lithium that we can extract from the Salar de Atacama and the expected lifetime of our secured reserves in Chile to 27 years from the beginning of 2017 based on about 70,000 metric tons of annual production capacity of lithium carbonate. The combination of the permit and the increased quota further cement our leadership position in lithium and better position us to meet our strategic goal to capture 50% of the incremental lithium growth.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Matt.","Matthew K. Juneau - Albemarle Corp.","Thanks, Luke. For the fourth quarter, we reported all-in diluted earnings per share of $1.55, or $1.03 per share, excluding special items. For the full year, we reported all-in diluted earnings per share of $3, or $3.94, excluding special items. There were a number of one-time special gains and losses during the quarter and the year, including the release of a tax reserve, our normal fourth quarter mark-to-market adjustments for pensions, and matters related to the Rockwood acquisition and refinancing. A full reconciliation of these items for both the quarter and the year can be found in both the earning release and in the earnings presentation posted on our website.","Our 2015 effective tax rate, excluding special items, non-operating pension, and OPEB items, ended 2015 at just under 25%, 2 percentage points less than prior guidance. In the fourth quarter, we took actions related to the repatriation of cash to the United States that resulted in a lower full year tax rate for book purposes. This resulted in a non-cash earnings per share benefit of about $0.10 in the fourth quarter.","Capital expenditures ended 2015 at $228 million, just over 6% of sales and in line with previous guidance. At year-end, operating working capital, including assets held for sale, was 26% of sales, unchanged from the end of the third quarter. Similarly, operating working capital in our core businesses remained at 25% of sales at the end of the year, also unchanged from the end of the third quarter.","Combining all of these elements, we generated free cash flow, defined as cash flow from operations, adding back pension and post retirement contributions, and subtracting capital expenditures, of $506 million in 2015, excluding one-time synergy, acquisition and tax-related costs. This number is well in line with our guidance of $475 million to $525 million at the end of the third quarter, as we again generated significant cash from our businesses in the fourth quarter. Free cash flow, including one-time costs, for the full year 2015 was $155 million.","At the end of the year, Albemarle's net debt-to-EBITDA ratio, as measured by our bank covenants, was 3.8 times, an improvement from our original fourth quarter projection of 3.9 times. Finally, as we've discussed all year, unfavorable currency exchange impacts had a notable negative effect on earnings throughout 2015. For the full year, negative currency impacts related to our businesses reduced revenue by $240 million or 6%, and adjusted EBITDA by $55 million, also 6% compared to 2014.","Now, let me turn to business unit performance for both the fourth quarter and the full year. Refining Solutions reported fourth quarter net sales of $200 million and adjusted EBITDA of $53 million with adjusted EBITDA margins of 26%. Sequentially, from the third quarter 2015, sales were up 8% and adjusted EBITDA was down 3%. Both the Clean Fuels Technologies or HPC catalysts, and Heavy Oil Upgrading or FCC catalysts performed in line with expectations. Results were negatively impacted by just over $5 million related to certain reserves taken in the quarter.","For the full year of 2015, adjusted EBITDA for Refining Solutions was down 19%, excluding unfavorable currency exchange impacts. All of the decline was in Clean Fuels Technologies. In contrast, excluding years where rare earth surcharges had a significant impact on our results, Heavy Oil Upgrading profits reached a new high in 2015. Underscoring our confidence in the value that our catalysts delivered to our customers, we recently announced a 10% price increase in Heavy Oil Upgrading catalyst.","Fourth quarter net sales in Performance Chemicals were $386 million, with adjusted EBITDA of $120 million, resulting in adjusted EBITDA margins of 31%. Compared to fourth quarter 2014, net sales were down 1% and adjusted EBITDA was down 3%. For all of 2015, adjusted EBITDA for Performance Chemicals increased by 10% compared to 2014. Excluding negative currency exchange impacts, adjusted EBITDA growth was an even more impressive 14%, driven by strong earnings growth in Lithium and PCS.","Lithium continues to deliver strong results. Fourth quarter net sales were up almost 12% and adjusted EBITDA was up almost 15% compared to fourth quarter 2014. Adjusted EBITDA margins were 41%, the fourth straight quarter of greater than 40% margins. Overall volume growth in the fourth quarter was 14% year-on-year with pricing improving by approximately 3%. Battery-grade price increases and volume growth were again significantly above these averages. For the full year, Lithium delivered adjusted EBITDA growth of almost 19% and adjusted EBITDA margins of 42%.","Adjusted EBITDA for our Bromine-based business was $42 million in the fourth quarter. Results were in line with expectations from the beginning of the quarter, as planned end-of-year inventory management had a significant negative impact on profitability. For the full year, Bromine adjusted EBITDA was essentially flat on an as-reported basis and was up 5%, excluding negative currency exchange impacts with better-than-expected volumes in clear brine fluids and overall pricing improvement versus 2014.","Finally, PCS, our polyolefin catalyst and carriers business, delivered another strong quarter with both net sales and adjusted EBITDA similar to fourth quarter 2014. Fourth quarter results were above initial expectations due to stronger-than-forecasted sales, favorable raw materials and utilities costs, and the impact of synergies. For the year, PCS delivered adjusted EBITDA growth of 22% driven by sales growth and product mix in our specialty single-site catalyst business and cost savings related to asset rationalization at the end of 2014.","Chemetall Surface Treatment net sales in the fourth quarter of 2015 were $208 million with adjusted EBITDA of $54 million, resulting in margins of almost 26%. Excluding unfavorable currency exchange impacts, sales and adjusted EBITDA were up 13% and 26% respectively compared to fourth quarter 2014. For the full year, excluding negative currency exchange impacts, growth was impressive with net sales up by almost 12% and adjusted EBITDA by 14%. Growth was most significant in automotive, aerospace, aluminum finishing, and coil end markets. Regionally, North America and Asia Pacific, where we are benefiting from 100% ownership of the former Shanghai JV, led the way. Western Europe also performed well, especially Germany, Spain and Scandinavia.","Now I'll turn to 2016. First, I'll explain the balance sheet items and foreign exchange. And then Luke will cover the business and overall company forecast. We currently expect our effective tax rate, excluding special items, non-operating pension and OPEB items, to be approximately 27% in 2016. Note that we do not expect the same rate benefits related to repatriation of cash to the United States in 2016 that we saw in 2015. As a result, we expect our effective tax rate to return to the level originally expected for most of last year.","Our capital spending remains firmly under control. And we plan to maintain 2016 spending at a level similar to 2015, or at $230 million to $240 million. Note that this includes growth capital required for Lithium this year as well as maintenance and continuity capital for all of our businesses. Our plan does not foresee working capital improvement, but we do expect to maintain operating working capital in our core businesses at approximately 25% of sales. However, working capital remains a potential source of additional cash for us and we'll continue programs to create incremental improvement over time.","Depreciation and amortization will be in the range of $280 million to $290 million, an increase from $260 million in 2015, driven primarily by the impact of our new battery-grade lithium carbonate plant in La Negra, Chile. Corporate costs are expected to be about $80 million, in line with 2015.","Finally, we do not expect foreign exchange to have the same negative impact on earnings as in 2015, but we do expect another $10 million to $20 million of headwind versus last year related to exchange rates versus the dollar. And that impact will be reflected in the guidance Luke will provide for each of the businesses. The key driver will be the U.S. dollar-to-euro rate. And given the mix changes in our business since the acquisition of Rockwood, we expect every $0.01 move of the dollar against the euro to impact EBITDA by about $1.5 million to $2.5 million on a full-year basis.","Now I'll turn the call back over to Luke.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","2015 ended and 2016 has begun with continued economic uncertainty around the world. The impact of low oil prices on the global economy, worries about economic weakness in China and other emerging economies, questionable growth prospects in the U.S., Europe, and Japan, and currency fluctuations all underscore this uncertainty. Despite this uncertainty, we still expect growth in most of our businesses in 2016.","We expect 2016 net sales in the range of $3.2 billion to $3.4 billion; adjusted EBITDA of between $900 million and $950 million; and adjusted earnings per share to between $3.45 to $3.80. Recognize that the timing of a potential sale of Fine Chemistry Services creates some additional uncertainty in these ranges. We currently expect the cadence of earnings to be roughly equal between the first and second half of 2016, but note that normal fluctuation in our businesses, such as a large catalyst orders moving from one quarter to another, can have a significant impact on quarterly results.","As shown on page 16 of the earnings presentation posted on our website, excluding the impact of the $52 million non-cash foreign exchange gain from the first quarter of 2015 and the operations of the two divested businesses from 2015 adjusted EBITDA, our forecasted 2016 adjusted EBITDA range represents an increase of 3.5% to 9% (sic) [3% to 9%] versus 2015.","Overall, adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to be right around 28%, an increase from 26% in 2015, as we continue to improve the quality of our portfolio and the performance of our core businesses. We were just over the midpoint of our 2015 adjusted free cash flow guidance of $475 million to $525 million, which positions us well to meet 2016 guidance that we first provided in September of last year. Specifically, we expect to generate $550 million to $650 million of free cash flow before one-time items related to the acquisition. And $450 million to $550 million including those costs, or more than triple our 2015 actual free cash flow.","Turning to each of our businesses. We expect a double-digit percentage increase in Lithium earnings. Volume growth in battery-grade applications continues to be strong. Note that global sales of plug-in hybrids and battery electric vehicles in 2015 increased by 70% compared to 2014. We also expect favorable overall pricing versus 2015. And we continue to enjoy a favorable cost position, given the quality of our lithium reserves in Chile and the Talison joint venture. These factors position us to maintain strong margins that we saw in 2015.","PCS is expected to be relatively flat. After a 22% increase in adjusted EBITDA in 2015, we expect 2016 to be a year, where we consolidate and maintain this gain as opposed to seeing much additional growth in earnings. Chemetall Surface Treatment is forecasted to grow adjusted EBITDA by mid-to-high single-digits on a percentage basis. The diversity of our business in various end markets and geographies, combined with the strength of our technologies and our commercial team, will allow this business to continue to grow even in a more uncertain economy.","Refining Solutions should return to earnings growth in 2016, with adjusted EBITDA expected to increase by high-single digits on a percentage basis. Although we do have some customers with planned shutdowns that will dampen results in the first half of the year, the low price of oil should continue to drive strong global gasoline demand, benefiting Heavy Oil Upgrading or FCC catalysts. Additional refinery turnarounds should improve Clean Fuels Technologies' results, although we expect continued mix challenges in the business given the operating environment for integrated refiners. For example, certain national oil companies in South America have postponed all hydroprocessing catalyst purchasers, which was originally planned for 2016.","In Bromine, as we have previously discussed, our methyl bromide supply agreement expired at the end of 2015 and was not replaced. The loss of this business, combined with an expected decline for clear brine fluids in offshore drilling projects throughout 2016, puts downward pressure on year-over-year Bromine results. Despite this pressure on earnings, we expect this business to deliver free cash flow similar to levels in 2015. We will continue to drive pricing in this business and will aggressively seek cost reduction opportunities to address margins and profitability.","With respect to synergies, as previously noted, projects already executed in 2015 would drive calendar year savings of $88 million in 2016 and we have additional identified projects that make us confident in achieving the $120 million in committed savings in 2016 versus 2014. The net productivity number that will flow through the P&L versus 2015 is forecasted to be an additional $40 million to $50 million in 2016. We are currently forecasting to invest in R&D, technology and increased sales coverage in Lithium, Refining Solutions and Chemetall Surface Treatment, given the attractive opportunities we see in those businesses.","In closing, 2015 was a year, in which we delivered on our commitments and began the transformation of Albemarle. In 2016, we will continue that momentum. Our focus is clear. We will continue to drive superior performance in our industry-leading businesses and use the cash generated from those businesses to deleverage, return cash to shareholders via dividends, and invest in the key growth opportunities we see before us.","Matthew K. Juneau - Albemarle Corp.","Operator, we are ready to open the lines for Q&A. But before you do so, I would remind everyone to please limit your questions to two per person at one time, so that everyone has the chance to ask a question. Then feel free to get back in the queue for follow-ups, if time allows. Please proceed.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Okay. So the first question comes from David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning, Luke and team.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Hey, David.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, Luke. Just on Lithium, what was pricing up in Q4? And what do you think it will be up in 2016?","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","I will give that to John Mitchell here. He asked \u2013 the question he has, John, was pricing, what was it up in the first quarter and what do we see for the full year?","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","I'm sorry. What was Lithium pricing up in Q4, Luke, and for 2016?","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Oh. I misunderstood. I'm sorry.","John Mitchell - Albemarle Corp.","Q prices in \u2013 or prices in Q4 were more favorable than beginning of the year. So we're starting to see a pickup in prices that started, say, towards the end of Q3, beginning of Q4, and we'll see more favorable pricing going into 2016 than 2015.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Fair enough.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Hey, David. If you didn't get it, it was a little over, it was about the average, it was about 3% over Europe for the entire Lithium business. Battery-grade was higher than that. And look, we've always said, we got a good pricing environment, but I know we're going to get this question a lot, David. So, let me just address this up front.","We are going to price lithium, so that we get value today and so that we are ensuring that this market continues to grow. We are not going to price lithium in such a way that drives the demand out of the market. It's very critical that we do this, because this is the best growth business in the specialty chemical industry and we're not going to get greedy early. We're going to get the value that we need to get. And we're going to price it so that we can allow this industry to continue to grow and achieve the objectives that we had when we acquired the Rockwood business.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Very clear. And, Luke, just on FCC, I know you announced a price increase recently, can you discuss the competitive dynamics right now in FCC in terms of some market share shifts that might be occurring and the confidence in achieving that FCC price increase?","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. I think from a competitive standpoint, this is a competitive market. And they're good competitors. We compete on technology. We compete on the value that we deliver to the customer. This is not a commodity that you look at and say, well, capacity is tight, so we can pass through a price increase. That's not how it works. When you deliver a technology and you allow that customer to make more money, you can get a piece of that more money that they're making and drive your pricing. And I think that's how the entire industry views it. So, you will see in my comments that we are investing in R&D to drive that technological advantage to give our customers the ability to make more money and then we'll get the price.","Now, as we talked about the last time we raised prices, this is a three-year process, because that's how the contracts flow. So, we've got contracts that fall off this year, some later in the year, some in 2017 and some in 2018. So, you will see a gradual increase in those pricing as long as we're able to deliver that technical superior service that allow them to make more money.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you very much.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yes.","Operator","Okay. The next question comes from the line of Bob Koort of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Ryan Berney - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good morning. This is Ryan Berney on for Bob. Luke, if you could comment or give us a little more detail on the Bromine business implied in your guidance here, can you give us a little more of a sense for what volume and price pieces are there for your 2016 guidance in that business? And then maybe also comment where you see that business in the cycle right now. Are we kind of going to hit the bottom in 2016? Or do you see further downside from there?","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. I think if you really look at the Bromine, what I would say is, remember, we lost that methyl bromide contract. So, it was a profitable business for us and we framed that up last year on what the type of profitability was and we've lost that. So that was a big hurdle to overcome. And then, from a volume standpoint, the big volume play that we're seeing is completion fluids. And what's going to happen to completion fluids during the year, you've got about 25% of the CapEx from the E&Ps are out of the market. They've already announced that. So eventually, that's going to slide out. So those are the two big volumes.","I think prices, we've seen \u2013 in some packets, you've seen price down a little bit, but overall, prices holding up pretty good and we're getting some price increases across. I think how long it's going to last, whether it's the bottom of the cycle or not, really depends upon completion fluids. And it's a big tail on completion fluids that you need to remember. So, if they start \u2013 oil prices pop up and they start putting deepwater rigs back out and the capital budgets come up, completion fluids won't pop right back up for us in deepwater. You will see a lag.","So, we're seeing \u2013 we're on the tail right now. We're on the tail in 2016, we're still good. In 2017, I can't predict that because I don't know what oil is going to be then. But I think that our focus in Bromine will continue to be what it is in 2016. We are going to drive that business for cash to take that cash to allow us to deleverage to allow us to invest in other growth opportunities. And our business position, our cost position and our technology will allow us to do that.","Ryan Berney - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks. And then secondarily, given that you now have this MoU with the Chilean government, do you see incremental CapEx in Lithium today as more favorable for spodumene-based material or for your Chilean production that you should be getting here soon?","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","John?","John Mitchell - Albemarle Corp.","We see it more favorable for the Chilean projects, the brine-based. So we would prioritize those projects over spodumene.","Ryan Berney - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar of Citi. Please proceed.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Yes. Hi. Good morning.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Hey, P.J.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Luke, I agree with you that I think lithium prices should be going up to allow demand growth. Having said that, I would imagine that your Lithium contracts are staggered throughout the year. So how long does it take for your contracts to adjust given what's happening in the marketplace and what should we expect in terms of cadence of pricing?","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. If you look at our contracts, all those contracts historically had been annual contracts, so negotiated generally in the fourth quarter for the next year. One of the things that we are trying to do is longer-term contracts with some of our major customers to ensure security of supply in this time.","So, there is not a lot of spot market for lithium carbonate or lithium hydroxide that we do. So, if you look at the Asian metals pricing and use that as a crutch to figure out what pricing is and the \u2013 it's a bad one. You should not do that. You shouldn't look at that, because there's not enough spot lithium carbonate sold. This is a contractual negotiation that we have in the fourth quarter and they last generally for the full year. We are trying to change that to a longer term and I think we'll have some success in that, but there's not the opportunity. Once they're set, they're pretty well set, P.J.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","And then when you say longer-term contracts, would you have more price escalators along the way?","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah...","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","And then, similarly on spodumene, if I just may ask that, how much of that is toll-converted in China and would you keep more of the benefit versus the tolling guys keeping the benefit?","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. P.J., I had a hard time understanding the question. I think what you said is what about spodumene pricing? How contractually is that done and then is most of the spodumene toll-converted in China \u2013 or converted in China. I'd say, John, the very bulk of the spodumene is converted in China today. Is that correct?","John Mitchell - Albemarle Corp.","Correct.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","And then, I'd also say that those contracts are generally annual contracts as well. But look, we're getting price year-over-year. We're getting good pricing movement. And we're also working with our customers to ensure that we can get the value we need for the investments that we're going to make and the benefits that we're providing and also allow the cost of that lithium ion battery to work down that cost curve, because the lithium ion battery, I think, if you look at 2015, for the last 15 years, it's declined about 14% a year. Lithium is really only about 2% of the cost of a battery, but it's critical into the applications that they have.","So, we're going to work to make sure that we're getting the value to justify the capital investments and the costs that we're going to have to bring these great reserves to the market to continue to be able to power this lithium revolution and grow that market.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thank you. And I just want a clarification of what you just said. You said you're looking for longer-term contracts. Does that mean that you're looking for contracts more than one year and...","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","...price escalators along the way.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Right. But there will be price-ups, just like in other contracts. And they would be \u2013 that's what we're trying to do. We're trying to offer our customer in this tight market, our top customers, security of supply. That's what they want. They want the security of the supply, and they want the quality of the product. So, we are trying to ensure that we can provide that to those, and to those who are entered into, are concerned about that as I would be, that we're seeing good receptiveness to that.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thank you.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yes.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas of JPMorgan.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much. There is an outstanding litigation over the Rockwood transaction where I think there is 882,000 shares that want some kind of cash remuneration. Is that an event that's likely to be resolved in 2016?","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","It was resolved in early January.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","It was resolved in early January. And was there a cash payment that was made?","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yes, there was.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","How much was that?","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","$82 million, right in line with our expectations.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","$82 million. Okay. And then, secondly, in your waterfall forecast, I don't see any change for the All Other segment. Is the All Other segment in 2016 likely to be similar or not similar in terms of EBITDA or operating profit?","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","All right. So, we've got the divested businesses in there, so we divested those two businesses, around $40 million of EBITDA that we would see. So, really if you look at 2015 to 2016, if we had those businesses that we divested, we'd be pushing $1 billion on the high end of our range from an EBITDA standpoint. But those businesses are not in 2016.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Right. So, the EBIT was roughly, I don't know, $36 million this year. So, for modeling purposes, for next year the number should be negligible.","Matthew K. Juneau - Albemarle Corp.","Jeff, this is Matt. Let me take that. If you look at the way to think about that, the one business that remains in All Other is Fine Chemistry Services, right, as we start 2016?","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah.","Matthew K. Juneau - Albemarle Corp.","And if we were to guide you on that, we'd probably guide you to a number similar to the contribution in 2015, which is in that, let's say, in the $10 million to $15 million range. And you ought to think of that as more of front-end-loaded in the way the year is likely to progress. And as Luke noted in the call \u2013 in the script, there is uncertainty in that depending on the timing of the divestiture on FCS.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","So $10 million to $15 million is EBITDA or EBIT?","Matthew K. Juneau - Albemarle Corp.","That's EBITDA.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Good. Thank you so much.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Sorry, I misunderstood the question, Jeff. My bad.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","All right. Not a problem. Thank you.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Tyler Frank of Robert Baird. Please proceed.","Tyler Charles Frank - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Private Wealth Management)","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yes.","Tyler Charles Frank - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Private Wealth Management)","Can you comment on what you're seeing for demand for brominated flame retardants? In your expectations, overall pricing in the market, and potentially give a little more color on how you're being able to pass through price increases, and your thoughts about price increases going forward?","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","I'll give that to Raphael Crawford.","Raphael Crawford - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. This is Raphael Crawford, Tyler. So, from an overall demand standpoint, of course, the electronics market, electronic connectors is a big piece that would drive brominated flame retardants. The outlook for that is relatively flat for 2016, and that's what we're hearing from industry sources as well as from our core customer base.","With regard to pricing, it is within our strategy to continue to look for opportunities to drive price when able. Right now, it's relatively flat on the BFR market. That's our outlook for 2016. But when able, we'll take the opportunity. It's \u2013 as Luke had said on our strategy for Bromine, it's all about driving cash flow, and when market conditions allow, we'll look for price in that market.","Tyler Charles Frank - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Private Wealth Management)","Great. Thank you. And then, just looking ahead to 2017, in terms of cash flow, do you expect the free cash flow to continue to step up in 2017? And are you on track for your long-term deleveraging targets?","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. Tyler, this is Luke. We're on track. And I would expect it to step up.","Matthew K. Juneau - Albemarle Corp.","And just remember, Tyler, the last, the major one-times related to the acquisition will not be in 2017 numbers. So, you still got $100 million to $125 million of synergy costs, tax repatriation costs in our 2016 guidance for reported free cash. We expect that to really finish in 2016. So, you got a benefit naturally just from that.","Tyler Charles Frank - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Private Wealth Management)","Right. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Next question is from Chris Kapsch of BBC Capital Markets (sic) [BB&T Capital Markets].","Christopher J. Kapsch - BB&T Capital Markets","Yeah. Chris Kapsch, BB&T Capital Markets. Just a follow-up on the waterfall on page 16. Looking at the bridge, if you look at the core business growth that you anticipate, I assume that includes synergy capture of $70 million to $100 million, not including that incremental spending on growth initiatives in your growth year businesses. Could you just talk about what you see would maybe push that number to the high-end of that range? And conversely, what are the risks in your businesses that could result in something coming in towards the low end of that range?","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. So, we included the net amount. So, we took the synergies we were going to capture and netted it down from the spend and then included that. So, that's net synergies in there as well as \u2013 no, no. I'm sorry. We netted it out that increased business resources you see there. So, on the high end, if completion fluids stay at 2016 levels, which I don't expect, you could see some increase on the Bromine side.","From a Lithium standpoint, we're pretty well sold out. So, if we were to get some more incremental sales out of our La Negra plant in 2016 toward the end of the year, we can say a little bit of a benefit there. There is a lot of \u2013 there are some of our customers that are looking at their businesses today and trying to understand whether they put all turnarounds or not. So, we always have in the oil, particularly in the integrated businesses, are they going to push out of the year, are they going to push out of the quarter. So, catalyst is always at a time like this when oil is at this rate, what's going to happen to the capital and the turnaround for the integrated refinery.","So, those would be the big numbers that I see pushing back and forth. I think, Surface Treatment feel pretty good about where they are there and the ability for them to come in at the forecast but not a whole lot of upside or downside there, maybe a little bit, but not it's going move the big needle across for the corporate. But those were the top ones that I would say.","Christopher J. Kapsch - BB&T Capital Markets","Okay. That's helpful. And if I could follow up on your comments about the Lithium business, and so your objective to provide your customers security of supply and quality, just if you could comment on the strategy on the toll conversion over in Asia, how does that play into these objectives and does is it also \u2013 and if you could talk about the impact on either margin dollars or margin percentages? And does this strategy allow you to capture a disproportion amount of the growth? Thanks.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. I think the strategy has always been, today, we don't own a conversion facility that allows us to convert that spodumene to hydroxide and carbonate. So, the strategy that we're going to employ as we build up more carbonate, as we build up more hydroxide is use that as swing volume. So, we will do that in a way to meet the market demand with that tolling, allow us to meet the current demand. And then at the appropriate level that we see the market has developed, we'll invest capital and bring that in-house. So, we're using that for swing volume strategy. And I think it's the right strategy for us as we look to be conscious with the capital, the timing, and the amount of capital that we are spending in this business.","It will have an impact on margins, obviously, because we are spending some of those \u2013 we're paying obviously a fee for the conversion. But I still expect, as a pure Lithium stand-alone, we've been over 40% margins for six straight quarters, and I would expect we'd certainly be in that range for 2016 as well.","Operator, I think next question.","Operator","Yes. The next question comes from John Roberts of UBS. Please proceed.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Hey.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Could you comment on the volume trends in the non-battery side of the Lithium business?","John Mitchell - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. The volume trends, I have been consistent \u2013 I mean, many of those markets are growing at GDP rates. That's what we've previously communicated and we see no change in those other markets.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then, is the Lithium MoU conversion to affirm contract that you expect in 2016, is that a relatively routine process or is it more involved in that?","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","We've got to negotiate a full agreement. So, I think anytime you go from an MoU to a full agreement, there are matters that weren't addressed in the MoU that need to be addressed. But we have the framework and we're confident we're going to get to that agreement.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Matt Andrejkovics - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Yes. Good morning. This is actually Matt Andrejkovics calling for Vincent. Thanks for taking the call. Just wanted to focus a little bit on catalysts. You talked about a high number of trials at customers on Heavy Oil Upgrading. What specifically is driving that? Is that their customer turnaround cycle or maybe they've delayed and then you're just getting kind of like a buildup of trials this year or is it maybe specific performance that these customers are trying to seek out?","And then also on Clean Fuels Technologies, what's driving the increase in change-out? Again, is that just customers delaying? And then just collectively, how far can customers delay effectively, if all customers keep delaying, eventually, you're going to get kind of a bottleneck within the industry. I'm just wanted to see how that would work out as you look out the next year or so. Thanks.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. So, I'm going to let Silvio Ghyoot who runs our Refining Solutions to take that second question, and then I'll take the first.","Silvio Ghyoot - Albemarle Corp.","Okay. Matt, this is Silvio. The change-out of the HPC units are, in essence, inherently related to the operations of the unit itself. So like we mentioned before, the business is pretty lumpy. However, if you still have activity on your unit, you could postpone that for a while or you could be processing different oils. So, there is a bit of a stretch on that change-out. But in essence, it's a coincidence that so many units to go inside at a given moment or do not go inside at all.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. And from an FCC standpoint, I think one of the things is that in this time of oil being down, every refiner out there is trying to squeeze as much profit as they can out of every unit that they have. And as a result, they're going to be testing to see if there's another catalyst out there that gives them an advantage over a catalyst they're using. I want to make sure you understand it. If we have a three-year contract to supply an FCC catalyst to a unit, the catalyst that we're supplying at the end of that three-year period can be very different than a catalyst we're supplying at the beginning, because our people in there, with that unit, on a daily basis, making sure they understanding the change in this crude slide, the change in the operating rights, the change in the pressure drop, all of those things and tweaking and changing that FCC catalyst so that we're getting them the best, the best performance they could have so they can make more money.","So, it is \u2013 they are looking for that every time. And they bring in test catalysts from other people because they want to understand if they're really doing that. The only way they know to do it is to work it in that specific unit. So, we welcome that. That's why we invest in technology, that's why it's a great business to be and if you've got a technological advantage and we're excited about it and we were looking forward to a great 2016. And the other thing on HPC, remember HPC was down in 2015 fairly significantly. So, we're planning a big uptake the but not in 2014 levels.","Matt Andrejkovics - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks very much.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah, man.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Aleksey Yefremov of Nomura Securities. Please proceed.","Aleksey Yefremov - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Good morning. Thank you.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Hey.","Aleksey Yefremov - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Going back to your pending Lithium agreement. Could you discuss how it might impact your production cost in Chile, including the fee that you'll be paying to the Chilean Government? And maybe, if you can talk about costs specifically, how should we think about your margins going forward? And maybe in 2017, should we expect a meaningful step-down in margin or should we expect some stability there?","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. What I would say is there'll be no impact in 2016. And we need to get the agreement finalized to make sure we understand all of those positions. And we'll give you an update on what to expect for 2017. You should not expect a meaningful downturn, not significant. This is still going to be a significantly high margin business. And even with any royalty we will pay, we will still be the world's best cost position from a lithium standpoint. And as \u2013 and we will use that to continue our market leadership around the globe.","Aleksey Yefremov - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Thank you, Luke. And on FCC catalysts, the price hike, how much of that is in your guidance? I think your slides mentioned that you don't expect much of a price contribution this year. Is there potentially upside, if you realize more than zero?","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. There is a little bit of an upside, if we were to realize it. Not much is baked in. There's a little bit baked in, a little bit year-over-year price improvement, but not a significant amount. So it possibly could be an upside. But the way the contracts roll, it's \u2013 we're trying to present what we think is a likely case. And a likely case is we're not going to see much in 2016.","Aleksey Yefremov - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","All right. Thank you very much.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah, man.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Mike Harrison of Seaport Global Securities. Please proceed.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Hey.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","On the last call, Luke, you had noted some Bromine weakness related to inventory management. It sounds like that kind of played out during Q4. You also had a competitor in December that was talking about some tightening in Chinese supply and demand driven by increased regulatory pressure. You maybe had some weather-related issues impacting some of the Chinese production of bromine. Can you just help us kind of parse through these issues and get a little better sense of what you are seeing in supply and demand in China right now?","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Sure. Let me \u2013 I'm going to turn it over to Raphael Crawford to go through that and talk specifically about China. But remember, we did talk about the bromine destocking, if you will. We saw that from our customers as we always do in the fourth quarter. And Albemarle, specifically, we operated our assets at a much slower rate that had a negative impact on our earnings to match that. But I'm going to let Raphael talk to you specifically about China.","Raphael Crawford - Albemarle Corp.","Okay. Hey, Mike, thanks for the question. Actually, I was hoping somebody would ask this, having just personally returned from China. So, we do seem \u2013 as you've noted, there has been an increase in the bromine price in China throughout 2015 that was driven by tightness in local supply.","It's our view, and also we had commissioned some external research through (52:18) that corroborated our view, which is really that there's a few different pieces to it. One of them is, depending on the area, bromine production in China was suspended three separate times: weather-related, safety and environmental, some of that was the Tianjin explosion, as well as the military parade in Beijing, as well as the annual winter shutdown.","So, up to 25% of the market \u2013 of the capacity was shut down in China at some point throughout 2015. But on an annualized basis, according to the research that we commissioned, it really amounted to about 10% of total production. A big driver to this, and I think it's also been noted by others, is also the reduction year-over-year in imports in the end of 2015. So the inventory drawdown in China had an impact on price as well. And that was up to a 30% year-over-year reduction in imports in the back half of 2015. And that has somewhat of a lag effect on pricing.","It's our view that as the winter shutdown ends, end of February, beginning of March, we will start to see prices come back down. So, post-winter shutdown, and as imports are resuming, we also think that that will put downward pressure on what's currently a high price for bromine in China. That being said, we are taking the opportunity where we can to capture price on derivatives in China. We haven't seen much of an effect outside of China, but it is our strategy to have a position in China, and we are doing what we can currently to capture additional price opportunity in that market.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Right. And if I could ask a question on Surface Treatment, just curious, you've done the consolidation of the Shanghai business. What other opportunities are you seeing in terms of M&A to bolt on some businesses? I know that's a fairly fragmented market.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. I think we wouldn't speak to any specific opportunity that we would see out there, but suffice it to say that \u2013 and Joris is on the line, but we've got a list of opportunities that are in various stages of review and discussion, because I think part of the small bolt-on acquisitions have been a key to the growth strategy over the years and we'll continue to do that and look at that. Most of them have been small from a dollar standpoint and fairly rapidly accretive. So, we've got a list, there are opportunities out there. And we'll be wise and prudent with our ability to pursue those.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Thanks very much.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Jim Sheehan of SunTrust. Please proceed.","Jim M. Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Good morning. Could you talk about the current price increase in the market for battery-grade lithium? Given your earlier comments on where you see pricing flowing during 2016, do you expect that entire price increase to be implemented or only a portion?","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Well, there's going to be a negotiation with each customer is what it's going to amount to. But I think we've seen good receptiveness, and we believe that pricing will be up year-over-year. And as we said, pricing for battery-grade is probably going to be higher than that overall price for \u2013 if you look at it for the entire Lithium business. So again, it's a negotiation just like it always is with pricing, but the value that we're delivering there is strong. And we feel good about what we've got in our model to push it through.","Jim M. Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","What was the contribution in the fourth quarter from Talison?","Matthew K. Juneau - Albemarle Corp.","You want me to take it?","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. Go ahead, Matt.","Matthew K. Juneau - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. Jim, we never fully break it out, as you know. But if you look in our non-GAAP reconciliations, you can see the equity income contribution from Talison. And it was in line, a little lower as expected in the first three quarters and left us, from an equity income point of view, with an adjusted contribution for the full year of a little under $35 million. We never break out the contribution that comes from our sales of technical-grade spodumene and the tolling. That's within our normal EBITDA, the Albemarle earnings, if you will. Let's just say Talison was up very significantly year-on-year.","Jim M. Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Next question comes from the line Mike Sison of KeyBanc. Please proceed.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hey, guys.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Hey, Mike.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Luke, you gave guidance for 2016 of EPS $3.45 to $3.80, still well below what Albemarle earned in 2011 and 2012. And I just want to kind of \u2013 maybe help us understand what the earnings power you think the new Albemarle, given the portfolio is improved and higher quality, where can EPS go longer term?","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Well, I mean, I certainly think that if you look at it, from an EPS standpoint, we ought to be able to continue to grow. If you look at the businesses that we have, you've got Lithium that I think \u2013 and we've been pretty open about it. We think Lithium, you ought to see high-single to double-digit growth, and our cost position in that will \u2013 we'll work ourselves down the cost chain as we're able to get more efficient and bring more capacity online, because we've already got the fixed cost. So, if I look at catalyst, I think long-term catalyst is growth position where you're going to see growth \u2013 a lot of it depends upon all, but it really is tied to the demand for transportation fuels. That's what drives it. And that's generally raising 1% to 3% a year, and that's why technology is so important in those businesses, so we can out-earn that.","The third piece, if you look at Surface Treatment, they've grown about mid-to-high single digits on a regular basis and I'd expect that to continue. So, when you roll all out that stuff together and we get these synergies baked in and rolled through and get more efficiencies, I don't see any reason we can't get up and see nice year-over-year earnings growth in that kind of range for mid-to-high single digits, which you can extrapolate that out and see what that number will be. But I think the earning power \u2013 the other thing I'd say about 2011 and 2012, Mike, is when you look at those numbers, remember you've got still in the 2011, that false demand from a Bromine where we were allocating bromine on a daily basis because of the demand coming out of the 2009 recession. And you've got a lot of pass-through in there related to that rare earth spike and the pass-throughs from that. So, just be a little mindful of the years you pick, but I would say is from where we are today, you should see continued growth in EPS that'll deliver nice shareholder return for our shareholders.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Got it. And then as quick follow-up, the bridge you gave a $70 million to $100 million in terms of synergies and core business growth, you gave a synergy of $60 million, so that's $10 million to $40 million in core business growth. And that $10 million to $40 million seems a little bit underwhelming, given as you talked about the improved portfolio and so, why is that...","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah, you've got some gives and take, Mike. So, you got to look at it and look at the gives and takes. So, let's take a look at it. We said that Lithium business is going to be up high-single digits. We said PCS is going to be flat. So, we're not going to see any growth out of that. We said Surface Treatment is going to be up mid-to-single digits. Refining Solutions is going to be up high-single digits, and you're going to see Bromine down.","So, if you look at the core businesses, they're all growing mid-to-high single digits. And so, I think that in an economy like we have today, and with the uncertainty that we have today, that's pretty strong. It's anywhere from 3.5% to 9% (sic) [3% to 9%] growth of our businesses on an EBITDA basis. So, we feel good about that and we think if you look at the cash, there's going to be drop into bottom line on that and the yield of our cash.

And now I\u2019d like to turn the presentation over to your host for today to Lorin Crenshaw, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations. You may begin.","Lorin Crenshaw","Thank you, Francis, and welcome, everyone, to Albemarle's First Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. Our earnings were released after the close of the market yesterday and you'll find our press release, earnings presentation and non-GAAP reconciliations posted on our website under the Investors section at albemarle.com.","Joining me on the call today are Luke Kissam, Chief Executive Officer; Scott Tozier, Chief Financial Officer; Matt Juneau, President, Performance Chemicals; and Michael Wilson, President, Catalyst Solutions.","As a reminder, some of the statements made during this conference call about the future performance of the company may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws. Please note the cautionary language about our forward-looking statements contained in our press release. That same language applies to this call.","Please note that our comments today regarding our financial results exclude all nonoperating pension and OPEB or special items, reconciliations related to any non-GAAP financial measures discussed may be found in our press release or earnings presentation, which are posted on our website.","As a reminder, we filed an 8-K in March showing the reorganization from 3GBUs to 2 and from a functional to a GBU organization, all year-over-year and sequential comparisons throughout this call are based on those restatements. ","Before turning the call over to Lu, I would like to remind investors and analysts to continue registering online for our 2014 investor day in Houston, Texas. It will begin at 11 AM with an exhibit hall on May 15 and with an investor briefing to commence at 1:30. There will also be a tour of our refinery catalyst plant and R&D facilities on the morning of May 16. We look forward to seeing you there. ","With that, I will turn the call over to Lu.","Luther Kissam","Thanks, Lorin and good morning everyone. I will start with some high level comments on the quarter, Scott will then review the performance of our business segments and financial results, and I will end by providing some perspective on our current outlook. At the end of our prepared remarks, Matt and Michael will join us to address your questions. ","We began 2014 by delivering first quarter net income of $77 million or $0.96 per share which was in line with the expectations that we shared with you in January. Net sales were $657 million. EBITDA was $137 million, and profitability as measured by EBITDA margin was 21%. ","Scott will discuss our financial results in detail in a moment. However, at a high level, our businesses performed essentially as expected. Refinery catalyst was down sequentially after a very strong fourth quarter of 2013 but still performed well with double-digit FCC catalyst volume and profit growth year-over-year driven by strong demand in heavy oil upgrading and favorable mix in clean fuel technologies. ","Performance chemicals\u2019 profitability while up nice sequentially was down year over year on lower volumes and pricing and higher energy costs. Previously, we discussed with you our strategy to focus on strengthening our core businesses of catalyst and bromine. During the first quarter, we took several actions consistent with that strategy that we expect to lead to stronger results in the future. ","Yesterday, we announced that we've entered into an agreement to divest our antioxidants, ibuprofen, and propofol businesses, including our Orangeburg, South Carolina, and Jinshan, China, manufacturing facilities to the SI Group, a leading global developer and manufacturer of chemical intermediates, specialty resins, and solutions. ","In terms of size, in 2013, these businesses generated aggregate revenue of around $250 million on low-single digit segment margins. As we assessed the competitive landscape in these businesses, it became clear that consolidation and\/or integration and certain other capital investments were needed in order to drive profitability improvements. We believe this transaction represents the optimal choice of maximizing value to our shareholders and giving the business the best opportunity for growth and success in the future. ","While subject to typical regulatory approvals and closing conditions, we would expect the transaction to close midyear, and we would expect to take an after-tax charge of approximately $80 million to $100 million, the bulk of which would be non-cash. We estimate that the transaction will be accretive to overall company\u2019s segment margin rates by 100 to 150 basis points. That translates to a 150 to 200 basis point improvement for catalyst solutions and a 100 to 150 basis points improvement for performance chemicals, all on a full-year basis. ","We also took steps this quarter that should in time lower our costs in our aluminum alkyls and bromine franchises. On the aluminum alkyls side in recent quarters, it has become clear that the industry is in a position of excess capacity. For over a decade, a strategic partner in Europe has [tolled] (ph) manufactured aluminum alkyls for us. We supply a portion of the alkyls back to this partner with the remainder being sold by us on emerging market. ","During the first quarter, we provided notice required by the contract of our intention not to extend the toll agreement past its stated expiration date. This tolling facility represents about 10% to 15% of Albemarle\u2019s global capacity. However, we have ample existing capacity at our lower cost, world scale facility in Texas to absorb this volume. This move should reduce our overall costs and take our highest cost production off line, resulting in an improved alkyls utilization rates and contributing to enhanced profitability within our performance catalyst solutions division at the expiration of the contract currently scheduled for 2016. ","In connection with the providing of our intent not to renew, we triggered certain financial obligations per the contract on our part. While it is too early to determine the exact amount of the obligations at this time as we\u2019re still in discussions with our partner, we have taken a charge this quarter what Scott will discuss in more detail that we believe represents our best guess as to our ultimate obligations. Upon reallocation of the volume to Pasadena, which will likely happen in the 2016 timeframe, we would expect segment margin income in catalyst solutions to increase by between 50 and 75 basis points. ","In addition, in February, Jordan Bromine Company and our partner in that joint venture, Arab Potash Company signed a 15-year agreement to purchase natural gas from reserves extracted from the Tamar natural gas fields off Israel's Mediterranean coast from a consortium of investors led by Houston-based Noble Energy. Today, JVC is already the lowest cost bromine facility in the world but as is the case with most of Jordan, its electricity costs are tied to #6 [fuel oil] (ph). For a minimal investment, we will retrofit our JV facilities over the next 18 to 24 months to make it a multi-fuel facility that is able to run on either natural gas or fuel oil.","The current estimates would have natural gas going to JVC by 2017, I caution you that the timeframe for the completion of the pipeline is out of our control and could be delayed. Once again, this flowing, however, the cost-benefit will make JVC\u2019s cost position even stronger in the global bromine market for the term of that contract and could also provide the opportunity for other capital efficient, cost reduction projects onsite. This makes Albemarle an even stronger, global leader in the bromine market. ","Last year, we successfully brought online expanded capacity for clear completion fluids, HBr, and elemental bromine in Jordan. In the first quarter of this year, the expansion began paying dividends. This quarter, we shipped near record levels of clear completion fluids, facilitating in large part of the new capacity of JVC, which allowed us to meet customer demand in that region in a timely manner and avoid losing orders due to capacity constraints. ","Without the new capacity in Jordan, we simply could not have met the volume demands we saw in March. As growth in these areas of the world continues, we are confident in our ability to continue capturing more than our fair share due to the foundation of our business being stronger and more flexible than ever before.","Scott will go into detail later but our cash generation exceeded our expectations for the quarter largely due to improvements in working capital. As a result we were able to increase our dividends for the 20th consecutive year and also execute and accelerate the share repurchase program under which we will repurchase $50 million of stock by the end of April. That program is proceeding on plan and is in line with our guidance in January. ","As we previously disclosed absent an acquisition, we would expect to continue entering into quarterly accelerated share repurchase agreements in sizes sufficient to maintain our capital structure target of one times net debt to EBITDA. Currently our expectation is that we would enter into another accelerated share repurchase agreement in May of around $100 million, that program would likely be completed by July timeframe. ","And with that I'll turn the call over to Scott. ","Scott Tozier ","Thank you, Luke. First of all, before getting into the numbers this quarter marks the first time reporting under our new organizational structure which became effective January 1. Our businesses are now aligned under two global business units, the performance chemical segment is comprised of fire safety solutions, specialty chemicals and fine chemistry services, consolidating our bromine, mineral and custom manufacturing assets under one business unit. ","The catalyst solutions segment includes refinery catalyst solutions, performance catalyst solutions and antioxidants. We released an 8-K in March detailing four years of restated financial results, including quarterly data for 2013 and 2012. In connection with this realignment certain costs have been reassigned and certain divisions have moved around. One change that\u2019s clear when you compare numbers under the new structure to the old structure is that a higher proportion of people costs, mostly SG&A and R&D are now charged to catalyst solutions than were previously allocated to them, while lesser charge to performance chemicals. This reflects the impact of changing from a functional structure where share costs such as sales, some technical groups and the like were allocated to each business on a ratio basis, to a more fully accountable GBU structure under which such costs are aligned in charge directly to each respective business based on the people in that GBU. ","As a result, catalyst segment income and margins are somewhat lower than under the old structure and performance chemicals segment income and margins are somewhat higher. Fundamentally of course nothing has changed regarding the growth expectations or prospects for either business. ","I'm going to review our two business segments and then turn to the details on our P&L and cash flow. Overall our net sales rose 2% to $657 million year-over-year driven by solid catalyst solutions performance. Segment income was $128 million or 20% of sales, down 5% year-over-year as modestly higher catalyst solution profits were offset by weaker performance chemicals results reflecting a combination of continued sluggish electronics demand and energy costs. ","Catalyst reported first quarter sales of $296 million, up 6% year-over-year and segment income of $57 million, up 4% year over year on segment margins of 19%. Refinery catalyst solutions performed well delivering double-digit volume and profit growth offset by lower pricing and the impact of higher fixed cost within performance catalyst solutions and overcoming higher energy costs. ","Specifically heavy oil upgrading which is primarily comprised of FCC catalysts experienced double-digit volume, revenue and profit growth driven by strong demand and favorable pricing. Clean fuels technologies, which is mainly HPC catalyst, also reported double-digit earnings growth despite lower volumes on favorable mix. ","Within performance catalyst solutions as anticipated, the impact of higher fixed cost and baseloading our new Saudi joint venture plant with volumes previously produced out of our wholly-owned facilities in the US was a drag on profitability on a year on year basis, a dynamic we expect to continue through the balance of the year. ","Volumes were higher year-over-year but pricing remained weak within both polyolefin catalyst and electronic materials. Performance chemicals reported first-quarter net sales of $361 million in line with year ago levels and segment income of $71 million, down 11% year-over-year on segment margins of 20%. A combination of lower fire safety solutions profitability and higher energy costs offset strong fine chemistry services growth and modestly higher specialty chemicals results. ","Specifically profits declined year-over-year within fire safety solutions which consist of our brominated and mineral flame retardants, reflecting weaker enclosures, printed wiring board and construction demand. These dynamics offset strong growth in several non electronics related applications for AdChem [ph], one of our core brominated flame retardant product lines, including wiring cable as well as plastic films into the construction, household appliances and automotive electronics end markets. The breadth of AdChem\u2019s application has become increasingly evident in recent quarters. ","Finally mineral flame retardants also had a solid quarter profit wise benefiting from a better term to the European economy. A soft year-over-year electronics results we experienced masked the tone of several market indicators that tend to correlate with current period results including the IPC book to bill ratio which has improved in recent months remain below 1.0 at 0.99 in February with shipments still well below the 2010 levels. ","In addition, IDC and Gartner reported first-quarter declines in PC shipments of between 2% and 4%. Within specialty chemicals which consist of all bromine derivatives that are not flame retardants plus our curatives and specialty aluminas, volumes and profits rose modestly year-over-year. The primary drivers were combination of exceptional clear completion fluid volumes where strength was evident in the Middle East and the North Sea and outstanding curatives growth which benefited from milder winter weather in Europe and the commencement of a number of infrastructure projects globally, including Europe, North America and China.","Fine chemistry services which consist of our custom synthesis business reported excellent volume and profit growth year-over-year driven by a combination of more normal order patterns within the ag intermediates relative to the year ago period and good momentum in electronic materials with select consumer-electronics experiencing broadening acceptance in the marketplace. ","Overall for the first quarter, we reported all in diluted earnings per share of $0.71 or $0.96 per share excluding special items. Our largest special item related to a pre-tax charge is $70 million, which amounted to a $0.14 loss per share after taxes associated with consolidating high cost aluminum molecules capacity; we expect to start seeing benefits of this consolidation in 2016. ","The second special item of $0.11 per share in non-operating pension and OPEB items reflects the net of our mark-to-market pension actuarial loss of $15 million pre-tax or $0.12 per share after tax and the curtailment gain of approximately $0.8 million or $0.1 per share after-tax. Ordinarily we would not be required to record pension gains or losses more than once a year during the fourth quarter.","However, the workforce reduction plan we commenced during the first quarter reduced our global workforce by approximately 230 employees. This triggered the curtailment gain for one of our U.S. defined benefit plans which required us to re-measure our assets and obligations for these plans.","Negative asset performance and a decline in the discount rate for our domestic pension plans year-to-date resulted in the mark-to-market actuarial loss for the first quarter of 2014. SG&A expenses were $67.6 million during the quarter up 4% year-over-year driven by higher incentive compensation cost and commissions. Our quarter SG&A expenses are expected to remain in the mid $70 million range with the increase from 2013 driven largely by occurring for on target incentive based compensation in 2014 versus an extremely low payout in 2013.","R&D expense ended the quarter at $23 million, up 13% consistent with our realignment goals to redeploy resources to growth areas. Free cash flow defined as cash flow from operations adding back pension contributions and subtracting capital expenditures was strong at $120 million for the first quarter, up 178% year-over-year, driven by working capital reductions and lower CapEx.","As we stated last quarter, we have stepped up our focus on working capital and established our goal to permanently reduce working capital by at least $100 million by 2015. ","Our initiatives are underway and showing early progress as we seek to achieve a meaningful portion of that $100 million goal in 2014. Specifically, net working capital improved by $40 million versus year end levels and sequentially fell 165 basis points as a percentage of sales to 22%, mainly driven by lower receivables and inventory.","CapEx was $24 million, down over 50% year-over-year, a trend we expect to continue throughout 2014 that reflects the fact that our major capacity expansions are now complete. Our current view is that CapEx will likely decline to between $100 million to $125 million this year, about 20% lower than the range we expressed back in January, reflecting changes in the timing of certain projects and investments. ","From a total shareholder return perspective, we returned approximately $70 million to shareholders to this quarter of which $20 million reflected dividends and $50 million related to executing the accelerated share repurchase program that will be completed at the end of April.","Overall, our balance sheet remains a source of strength and flexibility with strong liquidity at $524 million in cash reserves, net debt of $537 million excluding non-guaranteed JV debt. And net debt-to-EBITDA at 0.9 times roughly in line with our targeted capital structure of 1 times. ","Our effective tax rates excluding special items and non-operating pension and OPEB items for the quarter was 23.7%, down 90 basis points year-over-year driven by geographic mix and benefits from a favorable mix of income and lower tax jurisdictions. At this time with the same exclusions we expect our full year rate to remain at that 23.7%. ","From a raw material standpoint, as we indicated in January, we are currently forecasting an increase in energy cost of approximately $10 million to $12 million for the full year primarily driven by the impact of higher natural gas prices. The first quarter profit headwind from higher natural gas prices was approximately $4 million. ","And with that I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Luke to discuss our outlook.","Luther Kissam","Thanks Scott. Looking forward in catalysts, we continue to expect double digit segment income growth for the year. However, in January, we expected the earnings pattern for this business to be more evenly split between the first and second half of the year. Due to the changes in the timing of certain refinery catalysts orders, we now expect growth that is more second half weighted than the first. With the second quarter catalyst segment income being similar to the first, and both the third and fourth quarters showing year-over-year growth. There is always a risk that refiners will change delivery dates on catalysts orders due to startup schedules or myriad of other issues or opportunities they may be facing. ","But this is our best estimate based on the information we have today. We continue to believe that refinery catalysts solutions will be the largest contributor to earnings growth. Specifically, heavy oil upgrading should benefit from continued strong demand globally for FCC catalyst designed to handle heavy resid-based feedstocks, maximize propylene production and address the metal contaminants found in North America shale oil. We have more than enough capacity to meet our growth objectives and the de-bottleneck occurring at our Bayport facility which those of you attending Investor Day will have an opportunity to tour is on track for completion in the second half of the year.","Once online this de-bottleneck, which will increase our FCC capacity in Bayport by approximately 15%. Similarly, we continue to expect improved earnings in clean field technologies in 2014 driven by similar volumes in 2013, but with a better product mix. The outlook for performance chemicals continues to call for modest year-over-year segment income growth. This growth is primarily driven by clear completion fluids and curative performance within specialty chemicals, stabilized brominated flame retardant pricing and mineral flame retardants volume growth within fire safety solutions and a solid electronics materials and polymer pipeline in fine chemistry services. ","Our current view of the market and order book trends lead us to assume that while bromine pricing trends seem to have stabilized, we don\u2019t expect meaningful year-over-year growth in brominated flame retardants. As we roll up all of various factors by business from a total concrete segment income standpoint, we continue to expect growth in the range of 2% to 7%, but again with a greater second half weighting than we would have expected in January.","That assumes catalyst orders, specifically the clean fuels technology division shipped as per our customer\u2019s current expectations. Second quarter segment income should be roughly flat sequentially with the first quarter with the third and fourth quarters showing around an 8% to 10% type year-to-year growth. ","With that I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Lorin for questions-and-answers.","Lorin Crenshaw","Operator, we\u2019re ready to open the lines for Q&A at this time, but before you do so, I would like to remind everyone to please limit your questions to two per person at one time so everyone has a chance, then feel free to get back in the queue for follow-ons if time allows. Please proceed, operator. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from the line of Mr. Robert Koort from Goldman Sachs. You may begin.","Angel Castillo - Goldman Sachs","Hi, good morning, gentlemen. This is actually Angel Castillo on for Bob. Congratulations on the announcement section. I just wanted to actually ask you guys about that, so could you quantify what you have remaining in your portfolio from API and maybe just help size that contribution still there, and then kind of along those lines, with that remaining in the portfolio, what other parts are candidates for further assets sales? ","Luther Kissam","","Yes. I\u2019ll try to take that. If you look at the business, the only thing we divested from our custom services business was ibuprofen and propofol, that was it. So, two really good product lines and we still have the full resources and capabilities and product lines that we offer at our South Haven facility as well as Tyrone, Pennsylvania. ","So, we\u2019ll give more color when we\u2019re able to, and we\u2019ve got some confidential obligations obviously. So you\u2019ll see some things in our queue which (inaudible) more clearly, but we remain committed to the custom services businesses, and in fact believe that this move will strengthen our overall custom services. With respect to candidates for divestiture, I\u2019m obviously not going to speculate it to what may or may not happen in the future. ","Angel Castillo - Goldman Sachs","Got it, thank you. And then just going on to BFRs, you talked about a little bit of improvement there with \u2013 are you seeing stabilization in bromine pricing and also are you seeing some improvements on trailing 12 months for BFRs? Could you talk about what you are seeing in that market specifically in enclosures, just more broadly in the end market there?","Luther Kissam","Yeah. Matt, you want to take that?","Matthew Juneau","Sure. So if you look at BFR, overall volumes continue to trend in line with our expectations in the first quarter. The enclosure segment was not particularly strong in the first quarter as expected, but it was about where we thought it would be. As noted in the call, where we\u2019re really seeing improvement, I\u2019d say are in the areas that go beyond enclosures, so some of the areas that we sell 8010 into that go into broader applications or continue to show volume growth, wire and cable markets showed good volume movement in the first quarter, but enclosure specifically about in line with expectations. ","Operator","","Your next question will come from the line of Mr. Kevin McCarthy from Bank of America.","Alex Iffrema - BofA Merrill Lynch","","Good morning, This is Alex Iffrema for Kevin, just wanted to follow up on the previous question on the weakness in enclosures. Could you maybe talk about the reasons why you see that? Is it the number of units of consumer electronics that is being sold or is it just smaller volume of plastic being used on those units, or maybe its competitive BFR solutions that are being used? What are the main reasons there? ","Luther Kissam","Sure. I\u2019ll take that one. If you really are talking enclosures again specifically, the biggest use, single use for enclosures for flame retardants is in television space, and what we\u2019re seeing in the television space right now is just relatively flat sales particularly in the developed world where most of the televisions are flame retardant, and those flat sales are translating to relatively flat just off demand in the enclosure space. I don\u2019t think the competitive dynamics have changed significantly frankly over the last year or two in terms of whether it\u2019s inter-resin substitution, FR competition, it really reflects the sluggish demand in the TV market. ","Alex Iffrema - BofA Merrill Lynch","Thank you. And again, a follow-up on the same business, could you talk about price trends in brominated flame retardants?","Luther Kissam","","Sure, I\u2019ll do that. We talked in the first quarter call that we were seeing more signs of stabilization and that\u2019s really where we are right now. We\u2019ll continue to be watching and then observing what\u2019s going on in the market for demand and seeing where things are going, but right now we feel we can overall maintain pricing about where it is for the year.","Alex Iffrema - BofA Merrill Lynch","","And just a follow-up, when you talked about stabilization, do you mean basically flat prices on a sequential basis or is it something else?","Luther Kissam","","Our model overall cost for flat pricing sequentially. ","Operator","","Your next question will come from the line of Ben Kallo with Robert Baird. You may begin.","Ben Kallo - Robert Baird","","Hi, thanks for taking my question. I want to stay on the bromine business. Could you just talk about the competitive landscape and any new volume coming online, and how that\u2019s impacting pricing in the context of you guys also bringing on your new volume? Thank you.","Luther Kissam","","Yeah, I\u2019ll take that to start off with, and then I\u2019ll turn it over to Matt. He can talk a little bit more about it, but if you really look at the volume that we\u2019ve brought online, there is lot been written about because of that, that\u2019s pressure and price down. And if we were running those assets flat out, I think there would be credence on that, but the fact of the matter is when you look at the way we are operating our facilities in the first quarter, we were down at 60%, which is not bringing that JVC volume [alone] (ph). So, I don\u2019t think that it is a supply situation that\u2019s causing the price. As Matt has alluded to time-after-time, it\u2019s really the volume. I\u2019m not aware of any other new volume for bromine coming over at all. ","","Matthew Juneau","No new additional volume that\u2019s been brought online over the last year other than the small amounts that we\u2019ve run in JVC when it makes sense as noted in the call.","Ben Kallo - Robert Baird","Great, thanks, because there were some rumors out there of new volume coming online. One follow-up question. Luke, as you look at bringing on all of your new capacity, do you still think this is a ramp-up where we see this running closer to full utilization rates by mid end of next year? Is that how we should think about it? ","Luther Kissam ","Are you talking about Bromine?","Ben Kallo - Robert Baird","No, not just Bromine, but all new capital projects that you go through.","","Luther Kissam ","I think that if you look at Bromine, I don\u2019t know it\u2019s probably a little bit longer window on that. I think that was really designed for the clear completion fluids that were coming online as well as the mercury removal, so I think that there was some good news and Matt can talk about a little bit about from the EPA court ruling that we got yesterday that came out. But I think that\u2019s a little bit longer term. I think that\u2019s over a 3 to 4 year kind of timeframe you\u2019ll see that level in the end is my expectations on Bromine. ","If you look at in the performance chemicals -- in the PCS business and catalyst, I think that we got to see the LED market take off. We want four people in the LED market there. So for that capacity to fill up, it\u2019s going to be \u2013 we\u2019re going to need that LED market with lighting and back lighting can really take off to get that bills, so it\u2019s a matter of when that is going to happen. And then I think you saw take some actions with this facility in Europe where we\u2019re going to try to take some of that capacity to stock, as we\u2019ll take some of that capacity to our text aside. We we\u2019re going to take steps, I think it\u2019s all too early to say it\u2019s going to happen next year. But I think over the course of the next two to three years are going to see those facilities are filling up.","Ben Kallo - Robert Baird","Thank you very much, guys.","Operator","Your next audio question will come from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research, you may begin.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research ","Good morning, guys. Just wanted to get a clarification on the couple of things, first of all, when you talk about the backend loading nature of the catalyst market expectations or catalyst business expectations for this year, was that mainly related about around HBCD capital projects or are there some delays in FCC catalyst sales versus your previous expectations?","Luther Kissam ","","Yeah, I think, versus previous expectations, the second quarter will be weaker from an FCC standpoint than we expected. But we got a contract. It\u2019s matter of there are some refiners doing some commercial trials with some other products that will have the volume down and we expect to get that back in third and fourth part of the contracts. ","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research ","Okay, so it\u2019s an FCC side and not the HBCD side. Okay?","Luther Kissam ","It\u2019s both \u2013 it\u2019s both Dmitry. I\u2019m sorry.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research ","Can you give us a little bit more detail on the performance of the businesses within the performance chemicals, especially on the specialty chemical side? I am still a little bit confused, and forgive me if I'm not as fluent with your new divisional structure, but -- are the curatives now part of the fire solutions or specialty chemicals, or where are they now? "," ","Luther Kissam","I\u2019ll give that to, Matt, and he can take that. But, I think generally, if you look at that you got fire solutions, you got all non-brominated flame retardant plus non-mineral, non-flame retardant minerals and bromine as well as curatives and specialty chemicals and then in custom services you\u2019ve got all the custom services work, where he can take each of those. What I\u2019d say is, specialty chemicals had a very good quarter. And if you look at custom services, remember what\u2019s muted in custom services there as the good work that, that group has done to replace those contracts that expired in the 2013. So, with that I\u2019ll turn it over to Mark, he can give a little more clear.","Matthew Juneau ","Dmitry you\u2019ve got it right. So, specialty chemicals contains all of the bromine derivatives that are not flame so that's our products for oilfield, water treatment, elemental bromine HBr, frag and pharma etc. it also contains curatives and then the alumina products, mineral products that are not flame retardants and so in first quarter specialty chemicals performed basically as we expected in January, as always there's a few ups and downs in there but the overall business performed as expected and we highlighted two areas that really were truly outstanding, great oilfield volumes were then record levels by about 200 tons frankly, so very close to an all-time record quarter in volume driven by the Middle East, the North Sea and then the curatives business had a very good quarter, it was very strong globally and we got some benefit I think from mild winter in Europe. We didn't have that in the US but the US itself was strong as well. ","Specialty, FCS or fine chemical services really unchanged from a business point of view, it\u2019s the same products that were in there before, the one thing that will change now is with the announced sale of the ibuprofen, the propofol business and as well it performed as expected to a little bad [ph] I would say driven by electronic materials and last year we had some ups and downs in ag that were related to timing. We did not have that in the first quarter this year.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Steve Schwartz from First Analysis. ","Steve Schwartz - First Analysis Securities","I think it was on the fourth-quarter earnings call, you noted that the former fine chem segment was facing some expiring contracts, and I'm wondering what portion, if any, of that comment related to the ibuprofen and propofol businesses that you have sold? ","Luther Kissam","Yeah it didn\u2019t, it was none of it. Yeah, there were no expiring contracts in ibuprofen and propofol that\u2026 when we talk about that, those were ones that were tied to our Tyrone facility and our South Haven facility. ","Matthew Juneau","Specific to the customs service is part of that business, where you have one supplier one customer type relationship.","Steve Schwartz - First Analysis Securities","Okay. And with respect to your opportunity for lower energy costs in Jordan, how or to what extent can that benefit some of your other competitors who work on the Dead Sea? Or is it isolated just to Jordan's side? ","Luther Kissam","What\u2019s happening is they are building a pipeline from and there has been a very public about agreements between Jordan \u2013 the shipment of natural gas I don't see that it\u2019s going to, that my competitors on the Dead Sea already there have the natural gas, they are already using it. So I don\u2019t see as an additional advantage to them, whereas our electricity while somewhat subsidized by the government is all Jordan is, based on number six fuel oil. So it\u2019s going to be a cost-efficient, it\u2019s going to be lower cost for us, based on what the contract is today, and what we are paying and in addition, what it does it, it opens us up for some other capital projects that could further reduce our cost there that will make same [ph] based upon natural gas they financial don't make sense today. So it is not going to happen tomorrow, it\u2019s not going to happen next year but over the long term giving natural gas to that facility will make it a much stronger facility than it even is today.","Steve Schwartz - First Analysis Securities","That sounds really good. If I could ask just one question on the reporting segment change, the catalyst solutions business, less the antioxidants business you sold, is it now just the old catalyst segment? ","Luther Kissam","Once the sale goes through that is correct.","Operator","And your next question will come from the line of Mike Ritzenthaler from Piper Jaffray.","Mike Klein - Piper Jaffray","It's actually Mike Klein filling in for Mike Ritzenthaler this morning. One quick question on the divestiture. What are stranded costs expected to be once the sale is complete? ","Luther Kissam","Stranded cost is expected to be minimal, couple million dollars and we will have a plan to manage that. ","Mike Klein - Piper Jaffray","And have the tetrabrome price increases from last year been sticking? Would you stand by your comments from January that pricing has stabilized or have flame retardant prices been showing signs of life? ","Matthew Juneau","I think I have already said I stand by the January comment, rep stabilization overall there's ups and downs in there always but if you look at overall brominated flame retardants pricing we stabilized sequentially. And as we talked in January the tetrabrome price increase has not totally stuck at this point. ","Mike Klein - Piper Jaffray","Okay, great, and if I could just ask one more. We have heard that rates for deep and ultradeep rigs are declining, signaling that demand is waning. Are there industry dynamics that give you conviction that clear bromine supply will remain tight through the rest of 2014? ","Matthew Juneau","I think the way I would answer that is that you have to look at the business beyond just Deepwater drilling. Deep water drilling for us is still holding up okay. The Gulf of Mexico was okay in the first quarter but as we highlighted I mean our benefit was really the Middle East and the North Sea, those were very strong regions. This business has become a lot more global in the last 5 to 10 years and specifically in the last 5 I would say. And so I look at it as more drilling overall is what's driving our growth as opposed to just Deepwater. Deepwater in the Gulf specifically probably I would add.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Mr. Robert Walker from Jefferies. ","Robert Walker - Jefferies & Company","With respect to balance-sheet leverage, you have given a floor target. Do you see a path to move net debt to EBITDA to 1.5 times or higher for buybacks? ","Luther Kissam","I mean at this time I don\u2019t see that, we always have the flexibility to do that going forward but I would like to maintain some dry powder for acquisitions and some other organic growth opportunities. So right at this time I think that's a good level for us to be but we always have that flexibility in the future, if we determine to do that.","Robert Walker - Jefferies & Company","And given the high valuations private equity is placing on free cash flow streams, is Albemarle the best owner of the bromine business or do you think it would make sense to find a way to swap into a more technology-driven business? ","Luther Kissam","I think right now if you look at Albemarle, I think Albemarle is certainly the best owner of the bromine business. I think this quarter what we do there is great growth opportunities out there for that business over the long-term. Our technology that we have in that business and if you look at the cross selling opportunities we have in catalyst and some of our elemental bromine customers and things like that, so I think that Albemarle is the best owner in the world for bromine assets. ","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank.","Unidentified Analyst","This is actually Germaine Brown [ph] filling in for David Begleiter. Can you provide more color on the near- to medium-term trends that you are seeing in catalyst, particularly pricing within FCC and volumes within HBC? ","Michael Wilson","Sure, this is Michael Wilson. First of all in pricing and FCC, I mean as we indicated in the fourth quarter call we expected pricing to be moderately favorable in 2014 relative to 2013, we saw that play out in the first quarter. Again we announced a price increase in the second quarter of 2013 and we continue to work diligently to put that through. ","With regard to the clean fuel business and HPC volume I think on the whole for the year we see those relatively flat although with a improved mix which we certainly saw play out in the first quarter and we would expect that trend to continue. ","Unidentified Analyst","And what areas -- regarding the sale of the antioxidants, ibuprofen, and propofol businesses, you made the comment to answer the question before mine that you'd like to retain some dry powder to make some strategic investments. Within your portfolio, what areas would you consider making these strategic investments in? ","Luther Kissam","As we have said before, we are looking for something that would either drive new usage of bromine or make us a stronger bromine to strengthen and grow our bromine franchise or strengthening to grow our catalyst franchise. So if you look it will be tied in the area that we are looking, in one of those -- in one of those areas. ","Unidentified Analyst","And within BFR inventory levels at the customer levels, what are you seeing there","Matthew Juneau","I will take that one. I don't see that we have any significant inventory overhang from what we can tell from our customer levels, we have talked before as you go down the value chain there's always some risk that we lose track but the messages we\u2019re getting is that there's not an inventory issue out there and we as well are operating our assets very carefully and managing inventories very closely, we don't have an inventory overhang in our sites at all.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Chris Kapsch - Topeka Capital Markets","Chris Kapsch - Topeka Capital Markets","A follow-up on the pricing discussion on FCCs, in particular. I am just wondering the variance that you saw in the first quarter, is that more a function of just the absence of benefit from the rare earth passthrough, which we are cycling now here in the first quarter, or is there net-net positive pricing with your mix of customers? ","Michael Wilson","We don\u2019t see any \u2013 comp comparison issues at all right now. So it\u2019s really all business performance that\u2019s driving that.","Chris Kapsch - Topeka Capital Markets","Okay, and then, so the volume performance of greater than 10% growth year over year, last year you did win some business based on technology, as you put it, and I guess it takes -- once you win a trial, it takes a while to -- for refiners to shift over the FCC unit. I'm just wondering if this volume performance is a function of that more so than the overall market, or maybe you could disaggregate the growth that you are seeing from, say, the overall market versus share gains that are now starting to flow through your topline? ","Luther Kissam","Yeah, I will take a piece of this and then I will turn over to Mike, I think it's hard to determine whether or not you got share gains. So let me give you an example here, where you\u2019ve got a customer in FCC unit that goes out of business or shuts down in the US on the East Coast and new one comes online in the Middle East or new one comes online in Asia that\u2019s bigger and larger and you win that unit I don\u2019t see that as really share gain in the traditional sense. I mean you\u2019ve got volume moving the other areas of the world that are looking for different types of technology because they are handling different types of crude. So I think a lot of the volume shift going on and I think market shares have been relatively stable for the year if you get back and look at FCC volume, we got some movement going on from new refiners coming online handling new crude slate that have really benefited our technology portfolio and we continue to do well there. And I think this year we\u2019re still confident in the growth that we are seeing in spite of some of our customers using some commercial trials for some other suppliers in the second quarter. Michael, do you have anything to add on that?","Michael Wilson","I mean I would just say, there is three components to the growth overall, you talk through the sort of customer wins, some case it\u2019s coming from new refiners, a piece of it clearly market growth and then I would say the third aspect is how turnarounds vary from year to year, we've noted before that in 2013 there was a higher number of customer turnarounds particularly the first half of the year than certainly that we have seen in the first quarter of this year. So I think that's a benefit year-over-year the company contribute to double-digit volume growth which clearly seems out of line with what you would expect from a market growth only standpoint.","Chris Kapsch - Topeka Capital Markets","Can I just follow up on -- so you are calling out that -- in the second quarter, your guidance is for the growth not to look as strong and it's a function of commercial trial. So you're suggesting that some customers are -- a commercial trial, you have to run a FCC unit on a new catalyst for a period of time to determine if the refinery economics still work. So are you suggesting that's disrupting your core business and affecting the comps in the second quarter, but you feel like for the full year, your growth is going to be comparable to what you have seen in the first quarter? ","Luther Kissam","What I would say is, if you look but that always happens. So I am not, I don\u2019t want to use that as a problem, that happens every quarter, so [indiscernible] commercial trial, just happen how much volumes move around in those. So we got a difficult comp in the second quarter, I think you will see sequential volume in FCC down somewhat and rebound in the third and the fourth as we got new units coming online that we won that business and overall I think for the full-year you will see the second half stronger than the first and you see catalysts assuming everything goes as our customers anticipate and we got today [ph].","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of James Sheehan from SunTrust. ","James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Hi, Luke, I recall you speaking in the past about some areas of your business, like antioxidants, being on a short leash and you were looking to address those, focus on raising profitability before you might consider other strategic options. I was just wondering, where is your focus now on similar efforts like this to improve operational performance? ","Luther Kissam","I think it\u2019s across the board, if you look I mean one of the main focuses that we have and we have taken since past this quarter, if you look, two and half years ago at the profitability of our PCS business and you look at it today there has been degradation, there is too much capacity in the marketplace, prices in the electronic materials, year and a half ago two years ago versus what it is today price has fallen almost 75%, 80%. So there is a lot of people and we make solid margins on business and other people see it and try to get into that business and that's what we had and as a market leader we have had to protect our term from some actions of some competitors. So we're got plan over the long-term, it is not going to happen overnight but we've got to focus on PCS, it\u2019s core to our business and we will continue to try to find ways to drive that, as we will on all our businesses, I think every day we wake up trying to figure out how we're going to help our customers make more money and how we\u2019re going to get a piece of that so we can also make more money. So I don\u2019t look at it as we\u2019re going to fix business, a and then turn business b, and turn to business c, it\u2019s every day every business is looking up to see how they can be more profitable by helping their customers be more profitable. ","James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Very good, and in the new segment, performance chemicals, I was just wondering if you could update us on what is the breakdown of bromine derivatives usage by end market, such as electronics or clear completion, and what have you? ","Matthew Juneau","I'll take that, generally if you look at electronics it continues to be an important part of the business, it\u2019s roughly between 15% and 20% of our sales. When you talk electronic there's a lot of pieces there, some that are performing better than others where I think people have been focused on that weakness in PC and televisions, those are frankly becoming less important as other parts of electronics grow. The next biggest base from a volume point of view is the oilfield or clear brine space, the completion fluids and that's on a very strong growth curve which has been on for going on about, almost 2 years now. ","James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","And where do you see the mix of your bromine derivatives going over the next two to three years?","Matthew Juneau","So if you go back and look five years ago it probably would've been in excess of 60% related to FR. Today it is down less than that, FR is still important., it is still the big issues but what we are seeing is some of these other businesses and the specialty chemical space are growing faster and they are helping to balance the portfolio. This is one of the topics we will tackle at investor day if you have someone there at our event In Houston in May and it\u2019s becoming a declining portion of the business right now because \u2013 not that, it\u2019s not really growing that much, it\u2019s that the other businesses are growing faster.

My name is Carissa and I will be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instruction). As a reminder this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Lorin Crenshaw, Director of Investor Relations and Communication. Please proceed.","Lorin Crenshaw","Thank you, Carissa, and welcome everyone to Albemarle's fourth quarter 2012 earnings conference call. Our earnings were released after the close of the market yesterday and you'll find our press release, earnings presentation and non-GAAP reconciliations posted on our website under the Investors section, at albemarle.com. Joining me on the call today are Luke Kissam, Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Tozier, Chief Financial Officer.","As a reminder, some of the statements made during this conference call about the future performance of the company may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Federal Securities Laws. Please note the cautionary language about our forward-looking statements contained in our Press Release. That same language applies to this call. Finally, reconciliations related to any non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call may be found in our press release or earnings presentation, which are posted on our website.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Luke.","Luke Kissam","Thanks Lorin and good morning everyone. We appreciate the opportunity to share our fourth quarter and full year results with you today. I'll begin by commenting on the Company's results and accomplishments for the quarter in the full year. Scott will review select highlights related to business segment performance and financial results and I will end by providing prospective on our outlook for the future. As usual, at the end of our prepared remarks, we'll open it up for your questions.","In 2012, we continue to deliver strong returns for our shareholders and build an even stronger foundation for sustainable long-term growth. And we did so in a manner aligned with our core values of safe operations and sustainability. We invested our cash wisely in capital expansions to advance our competitive position and retain our marker leadership in critical existing and emerging markets, while we enjoy advantages of low cost and close proximity to and intimacy with our customers.","During 2012, our business demonstrated strong earnings power in the face of a weak global economy, negative impact on our catalyst results due to raw material pricing related to certain metals and lower demand than originally anticipated in some of the markets served by our products, resulting in lower operating rates at some of our production units.","We closed out 2012 by delivering fourth quarter net income excluding special items of $105 million, or $1.17 per share, versus $1.13 per share in the fourth quarter of 2011. That resulted in full year earnings of $436 million or $4.85 per share, excluding special items, versus $4.88 per share in 2011.","Net sales for the quarter totaled $688 million and were $2.7 billion for the full year, while EBITDA excluding special item was $160 million and $703 million for the quarter and year respectively. Profitability as measured by EBITDA margin, excluding special items was 23% for the fourth quarter and 26% for the full year. So in a year, in which we saw global economic slowdown, in which our revenue in profit were negatively impacted year-over-year by metals pricing; our business was essentially flat from the earnings perspective and we actually improved our EBITDA margins.","Scott will discuss our financial results in detail in a moment, but from a 20, 000 foot view, strength in fine chemistry and specific cause initiatives undertaken during 2012 overcame weakness in polymer solutions caused by global macroeconomic trends and catalyst volume growth partially offset the impact of lower metals pricing.","In addition we generated $0.5 billion in cash for the second straight year. That allowed us to fund a higher than average level of capital expenditures in support of several strategic expansions, that position as well for future growth.","We also repurchased over 1.1 million shares of stock and increased dividends to shareholders for the 18th straight year. Even with those increased cash expenditures, we ended the year with the strongest balance sheet in our history and the financial flexibility to continue to fund growth opportunities and return cash to shareholders.","Overall the results we delivered, despite numerous challenges based in 2012 are a reflection on the dedication to operating excellence that exist among our 4000 plus Albemarle employees around the world. These people are committed to our strategy and the execution thereof, regardless of the circumstances and are committed to delivering these results in a responsible, safe and sustainable manner. ","From a safety standpoint, I\u2019m extremely proud of the efforts that our employees made to make 2012 the safest year in the history of Albemarle, with injury rates at our sites at an all-time low and likely near to the top quartile of the global specialty chemical industry. We were honored in 2012 to be one of three companies recognized by the American Chemistry Council as a responsible care company of the year, a great recognition for the way our employees go about performing their jobs each and every day.","From a capital expenditure standpoint, each major project is nearing completion own budget. The Bromide, HBR and clear completion fluid phases of our expansion in Jordon are on track to start production in the first half of 2013. As, we disclosed previously, the Tetrabromide expansion in Jordon is on hold at this time."," Our performance catalyst solutions projects, the TEA joint venture in Saudi Arabia, our polyolefin catalyst center in Korea and the organometallics in the U.S. will be on line and scheduled in 2013. Additionally, we recently announced an expansion of our high purity metal organometallics production capabilities in Korea that we would expect to start up by year end 2013.","In short, in 2012 we invested for growth. We'll have a head win in the first half of 2013, as we start all these projects up and get products from those units qualified at customer\u2019s project commercial productions and sales in the second half of the year. Strategically, however these are the right actions to take today.","While we invested for growth in 2012, we also engaged in a strategic review to identify underperforming businesses, where we felt that were disadvantaged from a location, scale or product mix standpoint. As a result of that review, we exceeded the phosphorus business and that action is largely complete.","We will remain vigilant to ensure that businesses we own or own operate meet our profitability and return expectations and allow for sufficient technological differentiation to allow us to price for value.","Finally, we took several actions that move us towards a more sustainable strategy of managing our post retirement obligations by freezing our U.S. defined benefit plan as of the end of 2014 and announcing the plan to migrate all U.S. non-union employees who were in that plan to the fine contribution plan. We followed that action with a fourth quarter announcement of a change in our pension accounting to a mark-to-market methodology.","The combined impact of these actions will reduced the volatility of our earnings related to pension accounting matters and improve the predictability of our future retirement obligations and the transparency of our operating results.","Overall, 2012 was a year that positioned Albemarle well for future. We delivered solid earnings in a tough economic environment by sticking to our strategy and managing our cost; eliminated a business from our portfolio that were struggling from a profitability standpoint, begin a transitional way from our U.S. defined benefit plan and expanded our manufacturing footprint in areas of the world where our customers are located and aimed at serving markets that are forecasted for growth over the next decade; overall, a very solid year.","And with that I\u2019ll turn the call over to Scott.","Scott Tozier","Thanks, Luke. I\u2019m going to start with a review of our business segments and then turn to the details on our P&L and cash flow. Catalyst reported fourth quarter net sales of $294 million, up 2% year-over-year and segment income of $79 million, down 6% year-over-year on segment margins of 27%.","Hydroprocessing catalysts finished 2012 with outstanding performance year-over-year, as fourth quarter net sales growth 61% and profits were up 85%. Fourth quarter HPC volumes were up 71% year-over-year and a good mix of specialty products drove record profit levels for the quarter.","For the full year, catalyst reported net sales of $1.1 billion, down 4% year-over-year and segment income of $292 million, down 11% year-over-year on segment margins of 27%. For the full year, HPC volumes were down 4%, our profits rose 11% on that favorable customer mix.","Fluid cracking catalysts volumes were up 14% in 2012, but this was not enough to overcome the precipitous decline in rare earth prices from an average price of $99\/kg in 2011 for lanthanum to an average price of $26\/kg in 2012 and ending the year at about $10\/kg. Excluding the impact of this rare phenomenon in 2011 and 2012, both FCC revenue and operating profits were up nicely in 2012.","Operating profits at Performance catalyst solutions have grown at a healthy compounded growth rate over the past several years, and the business delivered 7% year-over-year growth in 2012.","During the quarter and for the full year, polymer catalyst continues to benefit from its strong global positioning amid an ongoing market shift of petrochemicals catalyst spending budgets and R&D efforts towards Single Site Catalyst to drive specialized products, innovation and process efficiencies.","Polymer Solutions reported fourth quarter net sales of $200 million, down 4% year-over-year and segment income of $36 million, down 3% year-over-year, on segment margins of 18%. These weaker sequential results which we forecasted in our October analyst call were driven by a weaker electronics market, European construction and automotive trends deteriorating further, and unfavorable manufacturing absorption on the order of $20 million during the quarter.","Year-over-year, quarterly Brominated Flame Retardant sales and volumes were down 4% and profits were up 23%; while Mineral flame retardants volumes weakened sequentially, approaching the historic lows of the fourth quarter of 2011.","Our Stabilizers and Curatives portfolio had a good quarter to complete a year during which it delivered solid growth with fourth quarter sales up 11% and profits up more than double prior year levels, driven by higher infrastructure spending in the U.S. in particular, which boosted Curatives results in our Antioxidants business benefitting from better volumes and manufacturing variances related to new customer wins and growing sales outside of China.","For the full year, net sales were $892 million, down 11% year-over-year and segment income was $203 million, down 16% year-over-year. This business was most impacted in 2012 by the downturn in Europe, overall lack of consumer confidence leading to lower electronics demand and low operating rates in our production units. Nevertheless Polymers delivered annual segment margins of 23%, nice profitability for such conditions.","Fine Chemistry reported fourth quarter net sales of $193 million, down 7% year-over-year, and segment income of $36 million, down 19% year-over-year. This business ended a year of excellent growth with a down sequential quarter profit wise, mainly due to the timing of shipments associated with a few large custom services contracts that simply run their course for 2012.","This weakness offset great results in our industrial Bromides business during the quarter. The global clear brines environment was robust with our business experiencing record volumes up 33% sequentially and up 34% year-over-year and record profits of 55% year over year. Annual net sales of $785 million were up 5% year-over-year and segment income of a $166 million was up 15% year over year.","Annual segment margins of 21% were an all-time high for this segment. Fine Chemistry services drove a majority of the absolute increase in Fine Chemistry\u2019s earnings growth on net sales that were up 11% and operating profits that rose 43% as a growing diverse pipeline of custom services projects continue to support what has now been a three year run of double digit growth.","Several new contracts, went into production or expanded in 2012 with projects in the agriculture, custom pharmaceuticals and renewable chemistry markets having the greatest impact on the year.","There's a lot of activity on the P&L this quarter, so let me try to simplify what's going on. Overall, for the quarter we reported all in diluted earnings per share of $0.42 and a $0.17 per share excluding special items of $0.75 per share that we incurred this quarter.","The special items essentially fell into two buckets, pension and restructuring. The largest special item amounted to $0.60 per share, driven by an $86 million pretax mark-to-market actuarial loss in Q4. This was caused by the change in our discount rate from 5.1% to 4.1%, partially offset by positive performance in our pension portfolio.","The other $0.15 per share in special charges related to an assortment of restructuring, pension and tax related items. Restructuring component was driven by various activities across our businesses to approve our operating efficiencies and the pension component related to a one time contribution made in the fourth quarter to our defined contribution plan as part of the transition for our U.S. employees moving from a defined benefit plan to that defined contribution plan.","Let me also should shed some light on our earnings versus expectations. The $0.17 per share of adjusted earnings includes approximately $0.11 per share related to a low amendment expected tax rate, attributable to our earnings makes simply coming in considerably better this quarter than we discussed with you on our October call and $0.05 per share related to our change in pension accounting to mark-to-market.","So if you back out the $0.11 of tax favorability and nickel of pension accretion, we essentially reported core earnings per share on the order of $1.01. However, I note that the tax savings, albeit different than our previous guidance, is not based on any one time items but merely on a geographic mix of our earnings. This resulted in an overall tax rate for 2012 that is higher than was the case in 2011.","Excluding special items, the quarterly and full year effective tax rates were 18.3% and 24.5%. The ex-special quarterly rate is down 540 basis points compared with the 2011 rate of 23.7%, while the full year rate is up 90 basis points compared to the 2011 rate of 23.6%.","Now to highlight a few other P&L items for the year, R&D expense ended the year at $79 million, up 2% as we continue to invest in a number of organic growth opportunities including several strategic adjacency initiatives. For the full year, R&D costs as a percent of revenue were 2.9%, up roughly 20 basis points year-over-year.","SG&A expenses adjusted for specials ended the year at $270 million down 11% versus 2011, principally driven by lower performance-based incentive compensation levels declining about 70 basis points as a percentage of net sales to 9.8%.","Free cash flow, defined as cash flow from operations, add back pension and post-retirement contributions and subtracting capital expenditures, was $230 million for 2012, down $126 million year-over-year, due to mainly to higher capital expenditures. Cash from operations closed the year at $511 million, down 7%.","Overall, our balance sheet remained strong with net debt of $205 million excluding non-guaranteed JV debt, down $66 million year-over-year while net debt-to-EBITDA ended the period at 0.3 times and net debt-to-cap was 10%.","Net working capital as a percentage of sales ended the year roughly 300 basis points higher at 21%, compared with 18% in 2011 as networking capital rose to $576 million year-over-year. This increase was driven mostly by accounts receivable, although our day sales outstanding remained healthy at around 55 days. Inventory was flat year-over-year, as we were successful at managing our operating rates in the fourth quarter.","Looking forward to 2013 from a financial metrics perspective, we expect CapEx to decline to somewhere between a $150 million to $175 million. While lower than the past two years, these projected CapEx levels are still 50% to 75% higher than average annual spending levels during the five year period of 2005 to 2010, signaling that we still have good growth opportunities.","In 2013 we expect operating cash generation in the range of $500 million to $550 million and net debt to approach negative levels, absent any significant share repurchases or acquisitions.","Finally for 2013 we are targeting working capital in the range of 20% as a percentage of sales and that our tax rate will be in the range of 25% to 26%, excluding specials. With that I will turn the call back over to Luke to talk further about our outlook.","Like Kissam","Thanks Scott. Looking to the future, Albermarle is well positioned for success. The strength of our balance sheet continues to give us financial flexibility. We have invested in capital and businesses that are forecasted to experience above average growth in areas of the world that should give us a competitive advantage. That puts us in a good position once the economy rebounds. While there is much uncertainty for 2013, we expect to grow earnings in 2013, but expect the growth to come in the second half of the year.","Looking at each segment, we remain bullish on the prospects in catalyst. Within Refinery Catalyst we expect to continue experiencing volume growth in geographies where fuel demand and fuel standards are rising the fastest, including the Middle East, India and Latin America where several new units are starting up with our technology.","Crack spreads in general remain healthy, which bodes well for refinery production rates and demand for high-performing catalyst. The organometallics market outlook is also favorable in view of the continued shift among customers toward designing and producing higher value specialty plastics which require our high performing metallocene activators. This dynamic is expected to drive continued volume growth in polymer catalyst.","We also expect demand for LED technology to grow rapidly over the next few years, which bodes well for our pure growth family of high purity products. China has banned the 100 Watt incandescent light bulbs, with the 60 Watt ban scheduled for 2014 and a 15 watt ban in 2016.","LED lighting is forecasted to grow from 4% to 30% of the total Chinese lighting market by 2015 with lighting in general in China expected to grow by 10% to 14% per year. Asia will undoubtedly lead the way in LED technology, which is why our Greenfield side in Korea is so critical to our strategy.","We stated in prior calls that 2013 would be a step out year in catalyst and it will be a solid year, however a number of developments have occurred that will shorten the step just a little. A number of our FCC customers have major turnaround scheduled throughout the first half of 2013 that will cost us between 5000 and 6000 metric tons of volume, about 5% of our 2012 volumes.","Additionally, the large FCC project in the Middle East that awarded us the FCC business is coming online later than originally anticipated in 2013 and could possibly slip to 2014, resulting in lower FCC volumes than we originally thought. However, these are special situations impacting FCC in 2013 and not the future. Once those matters are behind us, we expect volume growth in 2014 to drive this business to new heights.","What we are planning from volume growth in HPC in 2012, the mix is not appear to be as favorable as 2012. As a result, we expect profitability to be relatively flat. We worked hard to improve that mix but that number one priority remains to provide the most effective solution to our customers specific needs.","As you know, we've invested significantly in PCS over the last two years and these projects are coming online in 2013. The highly specialized products produced at these sites require long lead times for qualification runs at our customers. We are experiencing great development interactions with our customers in Asia. ","Our catalyst development unit in Korea doesn\u2019t have an open day schedule until July. As a result, while we currently have operating costs for our sites in Korea as well as Saudi Arabia for startup and qualification runs, we won't see revenue from commercial operations until the third or fourth quarter, resulting in a drag on earnings in the first half of the year.","In addition, the volume from the new TEA joint venture with SABIC in 2013 is largely coming from what has historically been Albemarle volume. It\u2019s the right strategic move to have a TEA joint venture in the Middle East, near the customers in collaboration with the world\u2019s largest consumer of TEA but it is a revenue and profit headwind for Albemarle in 2013.","In Fine Chemistry, demand for industrial bromides is expected to continue to be strong in 2013. International and Gulf of Mexico offshore rig counts are expected to remain at 2012 levels and we should see the benefit in 2013 of the completions of these increased rig counts from 2012.","However, under the joint bromine company government\u2019s documents in 2013 the profit allocation between the partners shift and that shift is a profit headwind of approximately $6 million for our segment in 2013.","Custom services should continue it\u2019s positive trajectory as the impact of capacity expansions to service existing contracts and new contracts in support of electronic materials are put into service. However, the timing of the growth comes mainly in the second half of 2013, based on the timing of when our customers have forecasted the need for product delivery.","Finally polymer solutions enters the year with the widest range of possible outcomes for growth. There is a lot we simply do not know regarding the macro outlook for this business in 2013. However, for planning purposes, our view of third party market indicators and order book trends had let us to assume a flat to slightly higher year-over-year earnings result.","To get more significant growth, we need genuine recovery in construction and electronics demand, not just a temporary inventory re-stocked. At this time, market indicators suggest that weak electronics demand could persist into 2013. Specifically, the most recent rating of the IBC book-to- bill ratio which has historically correlated reasonably well with our tetrabrome volumes trended down to 0.93, versus 1.02 at the time of our last earning\u2019s call and continued a 9-month downward sloping trend.","In the same vein, the most recent Gardner and IBC data on year-over-year fourth quarter global PC shipments indicated decline of 5% to 6%. Our view with third party data related to global TV panel shipments versus retail sales data indicates the global TV panel inventory at retail and its said makers have risen substantially, almost 25% above average inventories in recent quarters. The current levels are approaching those, that would indicate a correction could be coming, which would impact our outlook for our products used in enclosures in particular. ","On a positive note, the December reading of the Bishop Report Connector Conference Survey recently showed a meaningful uptick to 47.3 from 34.8, driven by improved sentiment in North America and Asia, exclusive of Japan. ","This should signal improved volumes for our Brominated polystyrene family of products. However, one data point does not make a trend and we would like to see this survey rise above 50 and remain there for a couple of months before considering it a true positive signal.","Mineral Flame Tolerance should be above flat at 2013 but this business remains dependent on improved demand for wire and cable in automotive, energy, constru8ction and infrastructure products. We expect Curatives and Stabilizers to show the most year-over-year improvement among Polymer Solutions Divisions, as we expect this sector to benefit from the improved cost position and higher customer operating rates.","Given all of those moving parts, we expect our 2013 annual adjusted earnings per share excluding special items and onetime items to be flat to up 6% from 2012. The businesses remain solid, however the ability to grow year-over-year will depend somewhat on macroeconomic trends. ","We will plan to update this annual view on our subsequent quarterly calls. We would also expect a weaker first half of 2013 than compared to either half of 2012, with first quarter results likely to be weaker sequentially and year-over-year for Catalyst and Fine Chemistry while Polymers is likely to be flat to slightly up sequentially, but down year-over-year.","Despite the current global uncertainties, we entered 2013 convinced of our strategy and confident in our ability to execute against our strategic objectives. The investment rationale supporting our major capital projects remain intact. A number of global secular trends will have a long term positive impact on our markets. We continue to demonstrate an ability to leverage our base technologies into new adjacencies that will ultimately become meaningful contributors to our business.","We have the financial flexibility to allow us to fund growth and return capital to shareholders. Most importantly, we have the right people in place to execute our strategy. In short, the foundation to our business is stronger at the beginning of 2013 than it was at the beginning of 2012 and we are well prepared for whatever 2013 brings.","With that I'll turn the call back over to Lorin for questions and answers.","Lorin Crenshaw","Operator, we're ready to open the lines for Q&A, but before you do so, I would remind everyone to please limit your questions to two per person at one time, so that everyone has a chance, then feel free to get back in the queue for follow-ons, if time allows. Please proceed.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions). And your first question comes from the line of PJ Juvekar of Citigroup, please proceed.","PJ Juvekar - Citigroup","Last quarter you talked about utilization rate in Bromine and BFR's to be in the range of 40% to 60%. Can you give us an update on that and are you taking most of the downtime in Arkansas versus Jordan, just sort of elaborate on that?","Lorin Crenshaw ","PJ, the first part of the question on utilization rates, if you look at Bromine for the fourth quarter and then you look at our bromide flame retardants, if you look at Bromine overall we were in that mid-70 range for the fourth quarter, like we said we're going to be and then if you look at the derivatives, we were operating at that low 40% level in the fourth quarter.","We are approaching both of those upticks in the first quarter of 2013 for Bromine to the low to mid 80's and Bromine derivatives in the 50% range, 50% plus range which really put us in the range where we were operating across the whole year of 2012. And then PJ, I'm sorry but I didn't understand the last piece of your question, you faded out.","PJ Juvekar - Citigroup","What I was asking was the downtime that you took, was it more in Arkansas versus Jordan?","Lorin Crenshaw","I think the downtime one way or the other, it was about the same. We ran clear completion fluid hard both places. We had a very strong clear completion fluids quarter and we ran Jordon and Magnolia hard on completion fluids and in fact sold some of the inventory levels into the inventory levels in the fourth quarter. Otherwise, we didn\u2019t run tetrabone very hard and that\u2019s the only really too comparative. So it\u2019s pretty equivalent across those two.","PJ Juvekar - Citigroup","And secondly in BFRs, is there is a structural shift in your business that you are selling less into smartphones and tablets than PCs and is that a structural shift and then how does project Gemini relate to that?","Lorin Crenshaw","It\u2019s not a structural shift into what we are selling. We are still selling into the same products that we were selling before. I think as I interpret your question it\u2019s really, are we in a secular trend away from PCs into tablets and you read as much as I do about that. I think it depends upon what area of the world that you are looking at. It depends upon what price points people are trying to sell but I don\u2019t think if you look at the data on the PC shipments and you look at tablets in the developed world at least, they are moving more to tablets and in the developing world, it\u2019s a still more of a PC type phenomenon as we have discussed before.","We are not in the bulk of tablets, maybe in some printed wiring boards and things like that with the enclosures. We are largely not in that. There could be some modifications to what people are talking about from iPhones and to go into tablets to make them cheaper, at a more cost competitive price point and if they do that, it depends what resin system they are going to go to. If they go to polycarbonate, probably not a whole way probability for growth and Brominated Flame Retardants if they go hips (ph) or ABS, there would be opportunity there and where that ultimately shapes out would depend upon the cost of the entire resin system.","Our product Gemini is getting good response from our customers. We are running some test, all kind of great. Our reports in that may give us opportunities in certain areas with connectors , chargers, wiring boards and things like that at higher ends. So we are really excited about the possibility of that being a real commercial contributor into the future.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Robert Koort of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs","Luke, it looks like you are down to about, as low at a debt to cash ratio as we\u2019d see in the industry and we have seen other companies take advantage of that, you guys did buy some stock back but you seem maybe a little reluctant. Are you getting the ammo ready for a big deal, or what\u2019s holding you back from being a little bit more aggressive, especially if you think 2013 has got a little bit of backend loaded hockey stick. Wouldn\u2019t now be the time to get more aggressive before that ramp up in the second half?","Luke Kissam","Yeah, I think we are constantly monitoring the situations out there in the markets and our cash and as we said, as we are trying to taking the call, we are going to look for ways to both grow the business and return substantial cash to our investors, and I would expect in the first half of the year we will be studying that and looking out at the possible actions we can do to drive that shareholder value even higher.","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs","When you look at acquisitions, does the scope of those acquisitions lean more towards bolt on technologies in regions that grow the business or synergistic deals where you might have a cost advantage or some takeout opportunity to make a deal work? What\u2019s the spectrum look like in terms of deals that you are considering?","Luke Kissam","I think Bob, the way I\u2019d look at it is, it would be more bolt on, the ways that would complement our technology and allow us to grow the business, as opposed to a take out. If we saw an opportunity for a takeout that made sense that we could do that, in certain of our businesses that would be doubling down on some exposures that make us hard enough to model as it is. So I think we are looking at ways to try to grow the business and use that complementary technology to allow us to do so.","Operator","","And your next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley, please proceed","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley","","Could you just talk a little bit more about the inventory levels in Polymer Solutions? I know in one of the slides you talked about bringing the operating rate up but how should we think about that trend, given it sort of flattish year-over-year in the quarter but down sequentially. How should we think about that as we move through \u201813?","Luke Kissam","","Yes so Vince, I think, we worked hard in the second half of the year to bring our inventory levels back into line with, kind of historical averages and we were successful doing that; not just in Polymer Solutions but in all three of our businesses. As we go into 2013 we are expecting to build demands tighter this year and have a smoother operating rate.","As Luke mentioned in the Bromine and the Brominated Flame Retardants, we are expecting that to be in the low to mid-50 ranges, going up maybe to the upper 50 range from an operating rate perspective. We will see something, traditional levels in our HPC and FCC catalyst factors as well in kind of that mid-70 to upper 80 ranges depending on what the timing of shipments are. So we're expecting to have a better profile there for inventory next year.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley","Okay and this is a follow up, did you say what the comparable tax rate was going to be 2013?","Luke Kissam","Yes, we were expecting between 25% and 26% again, a lot of uncertainty out there with what's happening in the U.S. government but based on the big driver for our tax rate has almost always been certainly less several years the mix of our earnings depending on which country they're coming from. And our current outlook would point us to that 25% to 26% range.","Operator","","And your next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy of Bank of America. Please proceed.","Kevin McCarthy \u2013 Bank of America","Question on polymer solutions. Your volume number there at plus seven looks like it was the best since the third quarter at 2010. On the other hand though pricing at minus six was the lowest since the first quarter of 2010. So maybe you can help us understand the economy there a bit. Has anything changed from a pricing or U.S. to city perspective, as far as Albermarle is concerned or is that simply a function of what you're seeing in the end use markets or at the market level.","Luke Kissam","Yes, Kevin I think one of the things that you got to be real careful about that is the mix between mineral flame retardants Bromine and flame retardants and curatives and stabilizers as you look overall at polymer. So let me just talk generically as you look at that. On curatives and stabilizers not a whole lot of price change, maybe a little bit around the edges, not much and we had some good volume growth there but on a lower base.","If you look overall at mineral flame retardants, that\u2019s an area we talked about in the past where if you remember the end of 2011 was historical low from a volume perspective there both in our fine percept and in our ground. So really when you look at those two together 11 was the lowest volume we had and we had to give up some price in minerals in order to get some of that volume back up to some operating rates at our German facility. So that's the way it worked. We did that and Europe still been very weak and a lot of that is the European market.","So we had to give up some price in mineral flame retardants in that market to be competitive with what\u2019s going out there, given the overall macroeconomic demand in minerals. In Brominated flame retardants, we've had pricing up's and we've had pricing down's in that we\u2019ve seen you remember when Evonik had the explosion in CDT, which was a key raw material for brominated flame retardant was tight that everybody was able to raise prices.","Now, because Evonik\u2019s back up running, the CDT prices are come back down and you\u2019ve seen people have to adjust back to historical levels fir HBCD (ph) pricing. So I think there has been some movements in specific areas on brominated flame retardants and some around the edges but the philosophy hasn\u2019t changed in the overall price structure and market dynamics are still the same as they have been for the last couple of years.","Kevin McCarthy \u2013 Bank of America","Has Tetrabrom stabilized, Luke?","Luke Kissam","Tetrabrom always get some nibbling around the edges. That\u2019s the first to go and when you say has there been some nibbling around the edges, yes, but it has been you know a couple of pennies on a kilogram here versus $0.50 or something like that. So, it stabilizes as much as Tetrabrom are always stabilized.","Kevin McCarthy \u2013 Bank of America","Okay and then the second question if I may on catalysts. It sounds like some timing issues in FCC, I think I heard you say HPC profit was perhaps looking flat for the year. What is your outlook for profit in polyolefin catalyst for 2013 versus 2012?","Luke Kissam","Overall for the year, I would expect that profit to be up and I think that the fact they are up is going to mask, they are going to be able to overcome some of these additional headwinds costs that they had in the beginning of the year for startups from transition from Albemarle volume to our joint venture volumes.","So I expect big things out of PCS this year, I think it will be a good growth trend and a piece of that is going to really focus on the LED markets and our pure growth family products and if you listen to the other calls and listen to their LED markets and then the market data, that looks to be a back half of the year, that\u2019s how people view it is. It is going to be start slower and build during the course of the year, the transition to LED. So that\u2019s a part the big growth that we are looking forward to in PCS in 2013.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Mike Ritzenthaler of Piper Jaffray. Please proceed.","Mike Ritzenthaler \u2013 Piper Jaffray","On the clear brines, we are wondering why the volumes didn\u2019t benefit the margins a bit more in Fine Chemistry. Is it a function of the relative size of clear brine into Fine Chemistry or is there a some sort of read through on pricing there?","","Luke Kissam","I think the big driver on fourth quarter being down for Fine Chemistry is just coming out of the custom services and some high profit projects that really just didn\u2019t have shipments there, and that really overcame that big growth in clear brine that we talked about. So I don\u2019t think there is any read through there. It\u2019s really just a mix between those products that caused the drop.","Mike Ritzenthaler \u2013 Piper Jaffray","","Okay that makes sense, and on the volume gains in the mineral flame retardants, can you give us a little bit more color on which end markets in 4Q kind of drove those results and the relatively robust outlook that you were talking about in your prepared comments?","Scott Tozier","I think for the fourth quarter, as Luke mentioned, we were approaching what we had in 2011 fourth quarter. In fact if you just do, we are about 10% up in volume but that\u2019s still only 90% of what we were in the first half of 2009. So very-very low volumes there, even though that year-over-year trend was favorable.","Product line there, construction, wire and cable is the big driver here and construction, automotive, particularly in Europe, little bit here in the U.S.; so the drivers for that market. We are seeing a little bit of early quarter uptake right now. We think that\u2019s mostly just inventory recovery out of customers as they burned off inventory in the fourth quarter of last year. So, but more to come, we are watching that area very carefully. As Luke mentioned, a highly competitive segment for us, and one that we will make sure we drive good profit.","","Luke Kissam","","And I think in the fourth quarter, what we saw mainly was a lot of driving down inventory levels in the fourth quarter. So I think you have seen this order pattern. It remains to be same whether it\u2019s restocking or whether it\u2019s actually through demand build across the chain.","Operator","","And your next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander of Jefferies & Co, Please proceed.","Rob Walker \u2013 Florence ","This is Rob Walker on Florence. I guess at first, have your inventory cost in Catalyst on the FCC side normalize now with current market prices for rare earth, and what was the full profit impact in 2012 from the rare earth price decline?","Luke Kissam","Yeah, we had given out the number for the full profit declines. We have only stated that it was significant, but if you look at the inventory levels, I\u2019ll ask Scott to address that. The only thing I will say is, you say has it normalized and I guess normalized to what? It was $4 before at end of the year, $4 before all the escalation came up per kilo. If you look at, at the end of the year 2012 it was roughly 10. So it was still twice as high as it was in 2010, but it's probably 10% of what it was it points in time in 2011 or 2012 but Scott may have more specific color on that.","Scott Tozier","Yes, just to add to that, from an inventory levels we have been able to tighten up that inventory level a little bit. So going into 13, we shouldn't see it, we shouldn't clearly seek nearly the impact that we saw in 2012. It will be a small amount in the first half as the price of lanthanum has continued to drop. At the end of the year it was around $10 to $12. We\u2019re forecasting it\u2019s going to get down close to the $4\/kg at the end of the year right now. So there's still some continued drop there. We'll see how that plays out. A lot of the dynamic between China, Mali Corp, Lynas in Malaysia, all those are playing out here and we will see what happens.","Rob Walker \u2013 Florence ","And then finally how much do you anticipate mark-to-market adding in 2013, versus your adjusted 485 number? It looks like it would have been $0.35 in 2012 but only about this quarter $0.05 was in your adjusted 2012 number. ","Scott Tozier","Well let me state it this way; on a year over year basis, on an adjusted EPS perspective mark-to-market will not have any impact next year; it'll be very-very small. Obviously there would be a mark-to-market actuarial adjustment based on gains and losses that we would recognize but that would be in our U.S. GAAP or fully reported numbers.","Now if you compare our results versus how we traditionally accounted for pensions, it's roughly a $0.20, $0.19 to $0.20 improvement in that adjusted EPS number. So, if you look at 2012, it was a $0.19 improvement and we would expect something similar in 2013 and that's driven by removing or having previously recognized, restated out the amortization of deferred gains and losses and so that effect will slowly go down overtime as that amortization effect goes away.","Rob Walker \u2013 Florence ","Just to clarify to make sure I understood that, so next year you anticipate about almost $0.20 improvement, which could be about 4% earnings growth.","Scott Tozier"," Now versus the 45. So the 45 already has mark-to-market pension accounting in that. So the year over year impact in 2013 is flat, so there's no impact.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Mike Sison at Keybanc Capital, please proceed.","Mike Sison - Keybanc Capital","Just curious, when you think about how the quarter\u2019s role, you sort of commented the first half would be challenging, maybe flat. Then you also noted in the fourth quarter 2012 you got the taxes and the help there. So that\u2019s a tough quarter to be up. So does the most of the earnings growth, if you get it come in the third, is that sort of the way to look at the year?","","Luke Kissam","Yes, I think you have got to look at it by division. The way the catalyst is shaping up right now, they have got cost in the first half of the year and they have got some increased volumes built in over the second half. So catalyst I think you will see a study build, with some pretty big in third and fourth quarters if those volumes come out the way you expect.","You would expect a backend year for Fine Chemistry services. So I would see that being kind of, higher progressively into the second, the third and then the fourth and then most of the time for polymers, as we will come back from Chinese New Year and see what happens although with the last half of the first quarter, usually a stronger second and third quarter with a weaker fourth but I think that weaker fourth in polymers will not totally offset the strength that we expect in catalyst if that volume comes through.","Mike Sison \u2013 KeyBanc Capital","Okay and then just trying to gauge your sentiment Luke. You sort of noted as you did today a lot of positives and headwinds coming in. Do you feel better as you head into 2013 than you did maybe two to three months ago?","Luke Kissam","I feel better. Yeah I feel better about the strategy, I feel better about, we have more information a day. So with more information, you are able to plan better. I feel good about the sites. We have always said these projects could online, on time and on budget and we have always expected them to and they were always tracking but I was able to go to Korea and see that start up with that Greenfield site.","The biggest development I see is the work in the catalyst development unit that we have over there is filled up. So that bodes well for filling up that site quickly in the second half of the year and we are seeing some pickup in our pure growth family of products in catalyst; so that feels good.","I just don\u2019t know what is going to happen in electronics longer term; it feels better today than it did three or four months ago. There is some good data and bad data but there is more clarity. So you can plan for when you have more clarity and we pretty well feel good about the clear completion fluids. So, overall I would say today, I feel better than I did four months ago.","Operator","And we have time for two more questions. Our next question will come from the line of David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank","Luke in Bromide, as far as getting a very low utilization rates, are you thinking about closing or probably shuttering some capacity gains, some additional pricing power?","Luke Kissam","","No, because I don\u2019t feel the need to operate those sites wide open. It\u2019s a no win situation if you go out and try to chase that volume and to shutter it down, if you remember, in 2009 and 2010 whenever it\u2019s crying backup, if you remember back, we will run in as hard as we could run and still could not meet the customer demand out there for that build.","So to take it out puts me at risk of not being able to meet a customer\u2019s need when the market rebounds there. So we will operate them efficiently as possible from a cost standpoint. We will cross train employees, we will ensure that we are operating them as efficiently as possible but to take them out of service, all that does is I got to write off for the asset that that\u2019s no longer in service. So it\u2019s really, I don\u2019t see where that does us a whole lot of good from an industry standpoint.","David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank","Okay, and just on the JBC agreement and the change in the structure for leading to reduce earnings, a little more color on that, any other structures in agreement that could result in your having reduced profitability from that, that data?","Luke Kissam","","What I would tell you is and this is public data, that our potash coal pricing is put there before. So originally the bulk and there are some gradations of this but originally what\u2019s been disclosed publically is that the original profit share was 70% - 30%. 70% Albermarle 30% and it\u2019s being reduced to 60% - 40% in 2013.","Operator","And our final question will come from the line of Steven Schwartz of First Analysis. Please proceed.","Steven Schwartz - First Analysis","In Fine Chemistry, this fourth quarter lull due to campaign timing, I presume that is related to you just meeting your volume requirements for your customer, and if you could so just confirm that for me and then, as we start 2013 I presume that you then resume producing volume for those customers plus you have these new awards. So can you frame up what the bump might be in volume and\/or profit in this first quarter versus first quarter of 12?","Luke Kissam","Yes, so the lull that occurred in 2012 in the fourth quarter 2012, related to existing time price where they had produced all that they have requested for us to produce for the year and there was a lull in their demand in the fourth quarter or from the timing of the campaign. If you look at the first quarter, some of those contracts are still not up to previous levels and are expected to be for the later in 2013. So you will not see a pickup in 2013, first quarter versus fourth quarter 2012 in those specific businesses.","Steven Schwartz - First Analysis","Okay so but then some of the newer contracts might kick in and help offset some of that.","Luke Kissam","It might offset some of it but I would still say that, as I said it\u2019s more second half. So they will likely be sequentially down in the first quarter, Steve.","Steven Schwartz \u2013 First Analysis","And then as my follow up, hopefully just a quick answer for you, Luke you gave the volume impact in FCC due to the turnarounds of that 5000 to 6000 tons or 5%. With respect to the Middle East refinery project, can you give us a reference around that 5,000 to 6000, what\u2019s that worth for you?","Luke Kissam","Yes, it's hard to give the reference around that because we don't know when they're going to start up and it wasn't volume that was in 2012. So other than that, I can't really get into the details of what it is other than say it's a very large unit that's coming on line that we\u2019re excited that our technology was slated and awarded that contract and we're looking forward to servicing, whether it comes online at the end of 2013 which we hope, which would give us a little kick that I've already figured in when I told you what I thought that volumes would be year-over-year and if it does a role in 2014 and we'll have the volumes in it.","Steven Schwartz \u2013 First Analysis Corp.","Okay, but relative to your prior thinking, it sounds like it was more than 6000 tons, your prior thinking was.","","Luke Kissam","Yes, so whenever we talked about it I\u2019ll you this project, whenever we originally got it, it was going to be first half of 2013 and now it\u2019s third quarter and now it could slip into 2014. So it\u2019s relative to our thinking at a point in time Steve and I'm not trying to be evasive in the answer but depending upon whatever we've talked in the second quarter or third quarter or fourth quarter, there was a different volume expectation that we have for 2013. And what I'm saying is, the most we're going to get on that is maybe a quarter, a volume and it could slide in 2014. So at a point of time, it was pretty significant, whenever we talked about step out but from where it is today, whether it's in the fourth quarter or whether it's in the first quarter, it's sizeable but it's still significant volume.","Operator","","At this time I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Crenshaw for closing remarks.","Lorin Crenshaw ","","I would just say thanks for your time and your interest in our results, and invite investors and analysts to call with any further questions. Thank you.","Operator","","Thank you very much. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation, you may now disconnect. Have a wonderful day."],"1564":["Albemarle Corp.

My name is Kathy, and I will be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session towards the end of this conference. As a reminder, this call is being recorded for replay purposes.","I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Dave Ryan, Vice President, Corporate Strategy and Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.","David Ryan - Albemarle Corp.","Thank you, and welcome to the Albemarle's second quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Our earnings were released after the close of the market yesterday. And you'll find our press release, earnings presentation and non-GAAP reconciliations posted on our website under the Investors section at www.albemarle.com.","Joining me on the call today are Luke Kissam, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Scott Tozier, Chief Financial Officer; Raphael Crawford, President, Catalysts; Netha Johnson, President, Bromine Specialties; and Eric Norris, President, Lithium.","As a reminder, some of the statements made during this conference call about our outlook, expected company performance, as well as lithium and electric vehicle demand may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws. Please note the cautionary language about forward-looking statements contained in our press release that some language applies to this call.","Please also note that our comments today regarding our financial results exclude non-operating, non-recurring and other unusual items. GAAP financial measures and reconciliations from those to the adjusted numbers discussed today may be found in our press release and in the appendix of our earnings presentation, both of which are posted on our website.","Now, I will turn the call over to Luke.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Thanks, Dave. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us on the call today. First, I want to welcome Netha Johnson to the team as President of Bromine Specialties, and congratulate Raphael Crawford, Eric Norris, and David Ryan for their new roles. I'm very excited about the leadership experience each of them bring to the team and I'm very confident in the team's ability to execute our strategy and deliver significant shareholder value today and well into the future.","Now, turning to the quarter results. I'm very pleased with our strong second quarter performance. Excluding the divested businesses, second quarter revenue grew by 20%, adjusted EBITDA grew by 24% and adjusted diluted earnings per share grew by 28% compared to the second quarter of 2017. All three of our businesses delivered double-digit adjusted EBITDA growth. That performance further strengthens our confidence and potential of our portfolio for the short, medium and long-term.","Lithium growth continues to be driven by accelerating demand for electric vehicles. The 2017 sales of plug-in and pure electric automobiles were up about 56% over the prior year, and sales through the first half of 2018 are up almost 90% versus the first half of 2017. Our customers are experiencing growth consistent with that data. Recently, major cathode and battery manufacturers have reported year-on-year sales growth, ranging from 21% to 75% for the first half of 2018.","Our customers and our customers' customers continue to invest for future growth in a manner that is consistent with the Albemarle demand model. And the global environment for EV adoption continues to build momentum.","Since the beginning of 2018, another six countries have either proposed bans on the sale of gas-powered vehicles or introduced new consumer incentives to encourage EV adoption. In the United States, four states have proposed or enacted legislation related to EV infrastructure or incentives, with California placing $2.5 billion toward their Zero-Emission Vehicle program in the form of rebates and charging infrastructure.","All of our Lithium capital projects are on track. During the second quarter, we commissioned the front-end of the Xinyu II lithium hydroxide expansion and we anticipate mechanical completion and commissioning of the backend during the fourth quarter. The tie-ins at La Negra II that we told you about last quarter remain on schedule for this quarter. Lastly, the design stage and pre-project work for the Kemerton lithium hydroxide conversion plant are well under way.","In Bromine Specialties, demand for flame retardants and other bromine derivatives remains solid. And that is despite of what I would characterize as continued softness in the market for clear completion fluids used in deepwater drilling. Overall market pricing continues to be supported by constrained construction and higher than normal local elemental bromine pricing in China. Based on the market conditions and our excellent resource and cost position, we anticipate steady cash flow from Bromine for the long-term.","And in Catalysts, the IMO 2020 marine fuel and other low-sulfur regulations should drive hydroprocessing or HPC catalyst demand. In addition, a more complex global crude slate, a continued demand for propylene and the focus at certain refineries on producing chemicals from crude should benefit in already tight FCC market.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Scott.","Scott A. Tozier - Albemarle Corp.","Thanks, Luke. For the second quarter, we reported net income of $302 million or $2.73 per diluted share, including the gain on the sale of polyolefin catalysts and components that closed on April 3. Excluding the year-on-year impact of that gain and other one-time items, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.36, an increase of about $0.30 per share compared to second quarter 2017 or 28% growth. Growth in our core segments resulted in an increase of about $0.34. Business results were boosted by our share repurchase program and offset by a net cost increase in other areas, primarily due to a higher effective tax rate compared to second quarter of 2017.","We have almost completed the $250 million accelerated share repurchase program initiated in May. Based on the strong performance of the company and our long-term growth potential, we continue to believe that Albemarle stock is currently undervalued. Hence, subject to market conditions, we intend to initiate a second buyback of $250 million of stock via another accelerated share repurchase program. In total, that will result in a $0.5 billion of buybacks in 2018, equating to about 5 million shares. This will leave approximately 7.5 million shares remaining under our current authorization. We expect our average share count for all of 2018 to be about 109 million shares and our share count for the second half is expected to be about 108 million.","For the first half of the year, net cash from operations was $224 million and we are on track to end the year between $660 million and $730 million. Adjusted free cash flow for the first half was $30 million. Capital expenditures during the first half were $281 million and will continue to ramp during 2018, reflecting growth capital deployment in our Lithium business. We continue to expect full year CapEx to range between $800 million and $900 million. We ended the quarter with operating working capital at 25% of sales, a decrease from the first quarter of 2018 on a percent of sales basis.","As we work through the details of U.S. tax reform, we currently expect our 2018 effective tax rate, excluding special items, non-operating pension and OPEB items, to trend toward the middle of the previously provided range of 23% to 24%. Depreciation and amortization is expected to range from $195 million to $205 million in 2018. And interest expense is currently expected to range between $45 million and $50 million after capitalization of the interest related to the CapEx and our guidance.","Now, moving on to our business performance. In the second quarter, Lithium net sales grew by 30% year-over-year and adjusted EBITDA increased by 23%, with adjusted EBITDA margins of 45%. The growth in adjusted EBITDA was driven by a 15% increase in volume and a 12% increase in price. All of our conversion facilities are operating at maximum rates and we continue work to maximize production. We also expect to see an increase in tolling volumes during the second half.","In Bromine, second quarter net sales were $221 million, up 8% year-on-year. Adjusted EBITDA was $69 million, up 12%, and adjusted EBITDA margins were strong at 31%. The results were driven by increased volumes, higher pricing and some favorable foreign exchange, partially offset by higher input costs. Of our three businesses, Bromine is the most exposed products in the crude oil chain. The flame retardants demand across electronics and construction continue to be healthy.","Catalysts reported second quarter net sales of $285 million, up 23% compared to the second quarter of 2017, excluding divested businesses. Adjusted EBITDA was $75 million, up 30%, with adjusted EBITDA margins of 26%. The polyolefins business sold this quarter contributed approximately $10 million to 2017 second quarter results.","Catalysts' performance was driven by increased volume in refinery catalysts and pricing in FCC catalysts. Adjusted EBITDA was unfavorably impacted by the raw material force majeure in curatives, partially offset by insurance collections of about $2 million related to Hurricane Harvey last year.","We have been able to partially mitigate the impact related to the force majeure and now expect a full year unfavorable impact of approximately $5 million, down from our previous estimate of $10 million. We also anticipate a full year favorable benefit of approximately $5 million from insurance settlements related to Hurricane Harvey.","Now, I'll turn the call back over to Luke.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Hey, thanks, Scott. Our strong first half has positioned 2018 as another outstanding year for Albemarle. In Lithium, we now expect full year adjusted EBITDA growth in the low- to mid-20% range year-over-year. The tie-ins at La Negra II are currently on schedule for the third quarter. Therefore, the second half of 2018 is anticipated to look a lot like the first half for Lithium, with 3Q earnings similar to first quarter and 4Q earnings similar to the second.","Bromine continues to benefit from favorable market conditions. We now expect full year adjusted EBITDA growth in the high single-digits on a percentage basis. Finally, with reduced impact from the force majeure in curatives and the favorable impact of the insurance settlements related to Harvey, we now expect full year adjusted EBITDA growth for the Catalysts segment to reach high single-digits, excluding divested businesses.","Similar to 2017, the fourth quarter is forecasted to be stronger than the third due to the timing of the CFT orders. As always with CFT, there is some risk related to orders slipping from one quarter or one year to the next. As a result of all that, we are increasing our guidance for 2018. We now expect 2018 net sales of between $3.3 billion to $3.5 billion, adjusted EBITDA of between $990 million and $1.02 billion and adjusted EPS of between $5.30 and $5.50 per share.","As Scott mentioned earlier, we believe the stock is currently undervalued and expect to initiate a second stock buyback. As was the case with the buyback we initiated in May, the growth potential of our businesses, the strength of our balance sheet and our operating cash flow give us the confidence that we can take this action, execute our capital projects, maintain our long-term EBITDA ratios and still have plenty of firepower leftover for opportunities that are consistent with our strategy. We remain committed to and confident in our strategy, and in our ability to execute that strategy in a way that should drive significant shareholder value into the foreseeable future.","With that, we'll open it up to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Bob Koort, Goldman Sachs Please go ahead, sir.","Dylan Campbell - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning. This is Dylan Campbell on for Bob. So, we're seeing some weakness in Chinese spot lithium prices recently, but the year-over-year pricing remains strong for Albemarle. So I guess, when you look forward to the second half of 2018 and 2019, how are your contractor pricing discussions going with customers? And then, also, could we expect some further incremental pricing growth from just the laddering structure of your contracts?","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. If you look at \u2013 as we've always said, because of our long-term contract strategy, China spot pricing has no impact on our pricing and you shouldn't see a correlation. I think this quarter, really, you're beginning to see that as the China spot pricing is down and our pricing is up year-over-year. So, we think that that's a validation and we will continue to see that.","As you look at pricing, I think we've said pricing would be in a similar range for the full year, year-over-year, and we don't see any change to that. It's a little too early to talk about 2019, but we're having good conversations about contracts from a volume standpoint, from a commitment standpoint, from an extension standpoint, and from a price standpoint going forward. So, more on that as we start talking about 2019, but everything looks good today.","Dylan Campbell - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. Thank you. And for Lithium EBITDA, you said that 3Q is going to be similar to 1Q, calling out some one-time items with the tie-in, but I'm a little bit more curious on the flat EBITDA between 2Q and 4Q. Can you provide kind of what this implies for your volume and pricing trends through the end of the year in terms of sequential movements?","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. You'll see \u2013 I mean, third quarter will be down sequentially for the reasons we talked about and then they'll be up from third to fourth quarter from a volumetric standpoint.","Eric W. Norris - Albemarle Corp.","This is Eric. And just to add, a part of that, remember, is we do tie-ins in the third quarter, which then allows us to bring the rates of La Negra up to the full potential. And so, in the fourth quarter, we'll start having the benefit of those high production rates.","Dylan Campbell - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","All right. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from P.J. Juvekar, Citi.","Scott Goldstein - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi. This is Scott Goldstein on for P.J. Thanks for taking my question. So, I guess, in Lithium, when we're thinking about your longer term contracts, I think in the past, you've mentioned the durations can range between three to five years with some going as long as 10 years. I was just wondering, is there a particularly grade of lithium, like whether it'd be hydroxide or carbonate, where you're seeing more demand for longer-term terms than the other grades?","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Go ahead, Eric.","Eric W. Norris - Albemarle Corp.","Great. So, Scott, yes, it's Eric here. So, we are seeing \u2013 when we enter these contracts, they are specific to the product and they're split between carbonate and hydroxide roughly, which just certainly mirrors our production planning and our capital expansion planning. And beyond that, they're specific to a grade of carbonate and hydroxide. We have 20 different specs across the range of products we supply to these customers and some of them are unique to certain customers.","So, they're very specific and allows us to plan accordingly. As we've said a couple of times, hydroxide is coming off a lower base. So, on a CAGR basis, yes, hydroxides are growing faster, but the demand is roughly split between the two.","Scott Goldstein - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thank you. Another question on Catalysts. I think at your Investor Day in early 2017, you talked about expected growth at around 3% per year over the next five years. With the rollout of IMO 2020, maybe could you talk about how, I guess \u2013 does that change your expectation for the long-term growth in Catalysts going forward?","Raphael Crawford - Albemarle Corp.","Scott, this is Raphael. No, I think the IMO standard, that'll be a contributor to the growth. Overall, as part of a larger trend, which is really about contaminant sulfur removal from transportation fuel, that contributes to growth. The overall crude slate becoming more heavy and sour, that's favorable for our Catalysts business, both for FCC and HPC, as well as the trends toward chemicals output from refineries. And we have specific technology, Max Propylene, other technologies, which support that trend. So, when you combine all of that together, we believe that offsets whatever downside there might be from increased fuel efficiency or EV trends. So, overall, net positive.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. And the other thing I'd say is, in our 2017, IMO 2020 was already on the rise. And so I wouldn't treat that as something that's a new revelation that we didn't have in that model. And so, it will help us along the edge, but it won't make a step change.","Scott Goldstein - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Got it. Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question comes from John Roberts of UBS.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Can you tell us what the sequential price change was in Lithium? And I believe you include mix in your average selling price changes. So, how do we think about mix in that business currently and as we go forward?","Scott A. Tozier - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. This is Scott. So, sequentially, we're up around 2%. There is a bit of customer mix in there. That's hard to strip that out of the analytics, but generally, product mix and other types of mix are not included in that number. So, it's about as pure as a price number as you're going to be able to get from our results. But, overall, good traction from pricing on a year-over-year basis as well as sequentially reflecting that trend towards the longer term contracts and the support that's behind us.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And back on Catalysts, do you envision any investment to be able to either on the IMO 2020 because that might go beyond maybe next year? And then secondly, on the crude-to-chemicals kind of investment refiners have made, do you see any investment going into Catalysts? And would you even put more capital or investment into that business or would you just maybe not grow as fast as the market?","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. So, let's break it down. So from a IMO, that would impact the HPC catalysts. And we would have investments, but they would be more debottlenecks, more than anything else or changing our technology around a little bit to best fit that. That'll be, as I look at it, encompassed within our continuity capital that we would spend on a regular basis that we've always talked about in the range of 4% to 6% per year.","If you look at the crude-to-chemicals, you're really talking about FCC catalysts. And the fact of the matter is today \u2013 at the prices we see today, I don't see reinvestment economics in the price we're seeing to FCC catalysts today. So, unless we see those type \u2013 an improvement in price to get to those reinvestment economics, we would find another way to meet demand, but it wouldn't be a significant capital. It would be debottlenecking. It would be ways to increase our yield. It would be ways for us to be able to do that as part of our continuity capital, but a significant investment in other plant. We need to see higher FCC pricing and the team's working on that. So we're seeing good traction on FCC pricing. So we may get there, but we got to ways to go to justify reinvestment economics there.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas of JPMorgan. Jeff, your line is now live.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Sorry about that. When you look at the lithium market today, do you think the supply demand balance is becoming looser or tighter or staying the same, say, over the next 12 months?","Eric W. Norris - Albemarle Corp.","Hey, Jeff. Eric here. So, our view is it's pretty balanced and about the same. It hasn't changed much. It continues to be challenging to produce where the growth is, which is in the battery grade area. You have the majors, ourselves included, expanding to meet that. But the time to bring that on, as it corresponds to demand, we see that being about the same, pretty balanced.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","And if you look at it over the next 12 months, Jeff, I don't see a whole lot change. If you look at our forecasted growth, what our customers are saying, and you look at what we're bringing online, we're going to be about where we are today from a sold out position and still relying on some tolling.","So, it's about where it is now. In buckets, you can look at carbonate versus hydroxide and see a little bit different story there where one being tighter and one being a little alone. But from a pricing standpoint, from a demand standpoint, we're not seeing \u2013 I don't anticipate anything in the next 12 months that would have a material impact.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And so, as a base case, when you model the financial returns of your Lithium business, do you assume that the benefit to Albemarle over a longer period of time are really going to come from volume growth, and that as a base case, prices neutral from where we...","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Absolutely. When we model it, the way we model it, to look at the investments, our returns, what we ought to do, we had \u2013 it is now for the next few years a volume story for us. Where we are able to achieve price in these long-term contracts, we will do so. But we've taken the philosophy on those long-term contracts, we want to have a minimum price guarantee and a minimum volume. But it will be a volume growth story more so than a massive price, which Jeff is consistent with what we've been saying for a couple years. But, yeah, you got it right on that.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Good. Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning. Luke and Scott, just on Lithium pricing in 2018, is your guidance still up high single-digits for the full year, year-on-year?","Scott A. Tozier - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. That's correct, David. We're right on track of with where we actually entered the year and are tracking right on what we thought. So if you remember, we came into the year expecting high single-digit pricing in Lithium, it would be higher on a year-over-year basis in the first half and declining as we go into the second half as those comps get more difficult.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Very good. And just also on Lithium volumes, are you still on track for 10,000 ton increase year-over-year in Lithium?","Scott A. Tozier - Albemarle Corp.","Yes.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you for your question. The next question comes from Colin Rusch of Oppenheimer.","Colin Rusch - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thanks so much. Given the rapid pace of battery chemistry evolution, particularly for vehicles, how quickly are you seeing the need to tweak formulations on the concentrates to really meet customer specs?","Eric W. Norris - Albemarle Corp.","Colin, this is Eric. I would say it's an ongoing evolution, right? If Glen Merfeld, our Chief Technology Officer, were here, he would tell you that what's happening is a continual effort by battery producers or cathode manufacturers that serve them to get more lithium out of the \u2013 or get more energy density out of the cell. There's a certain amount of lithium that's not used in the cell and there's opportunity to get 5%, 10%, 20% greater density per cell.","And so, there are incremental innovations looking at changes to potentially the anode that are \u2013 slight doping of the anode that are going on. Some of this often will happen on the cellphone side before it happens on the EV side, but those are ongoing. In terms of what it means from a cathode standpoint, in some cases, some of the innovations may use the same cathode chemistry. In other cases, you'll see evolution towards higher energy density cathodes.","NMC 622 is definitely the trend that we see in the market today for high nickel cathodes. NMC 811 is often talked about, but still has a lot of engineering to go around safety and therefore, cost effectiveness and its application. So, it is an ongoing effort that requires us to be responsive, both in terms of ideas we have, but also in terms of formulation with cathode chemistry.","Colin Rusch - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Okay. That's very helpful. And then, just given the lifespan of most vehicle programs being five to seven years, how much fluidity are you expecting within those vehicle programs? And I understand that this is really trying to get some insight into your customers' customers, but as vehicle OEMs try to extend life and lower weight requirements \u2013 or extend vehicle range and lower weight requirements, how much fluidity are you seeing in terms of that evolution in terms of the chemistry as you were just talking about?","Eric W. Norris - Albemarle Corp.","Well, it's kind of hard for me to separate your first question from your second because they're interrelated. Maybe that was your intent. So, I would say that, I think in a lot of cases, it's with \u2013 as you said, five year vehicle \u2013 the five year plan is locked down and there are certain targets in terms of energy that are expected out of the cell for a certain model. There is some \u2013 based on a number of vendors that OEM manufacturer go to, there is some flexibility for the battery producer to manipulate materials, manipulate chemistries to hit that target. And so, I guess there's some fluidity there in how they get there, but the targets in terms of the range per vehicle tend to be much more locked down over a long period of time.","Colin Rusch - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thanks so much, guys.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Ian Bennett, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Ian Bennett - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. And perhaps I'm reading too much into it, but I noticed on the key messages in the beginning of the slide deck this quarter, Wave 1 expansions on track is no longer there. So, maybe I'm reading too much into it, given you are still on track for La Negra.","And then, perhaps related to that question, I was wondering if you could comment, in two of the regions where you're expanding capacity. First, in Australia, the dispute with Global Advanced Metals and that trial date, if that's having any impact at all on your ability to increase production in that region and what potential financial damage they're claiming?","And then, in Chile, news articles about being slow to respond to CORFO, if that's having any effect at all? And I know that they're changing the way \u2013 the oversight of the mineral in that country. Comments on that would be helpful. Thank you.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. Hey, this is Luke. You're reading way too much into the \u2013 what the key message. We're right on track. And that's what we said in the script. We're on track to deliver everything that we've said to the Street and everything that we said we'll deliver to our customers. So, you ought not assume any change to that. We're rolling right along.","As it relates to Australia, the dispute with GAM is against Talison. That has been a dispute that we've talked about in the past and we don't see it having any impact. And our partner, Tianqi, in that would \u2013 I think their public comments would be similar. We don't see it having an impact. It's a dispute that if it needs to get resolved, it will. If not, we're very confident in our legal position.","From Chile, what I would say about Chile is we are in compliance with every term of every agreement that we signed related to Lithium. And I don't see any issue with our ability to get the brine to run our facilities in La Negra today, tomorrow and throughout the term of that agreement.","Ian Bennett - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. And as a follow-up, you've accelerated another share repurchase. You made comments about Albemarle stock being undervalued. It looks like also, during the last couple of months, many of the junior companies have experienced greater declines in their equity value. I was wondering if you could update on how you think about consolidation in this industry and the relative importance between relationships with customers and low cost assets. Thanks.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. I think that the low-cost assets, first of all, drive your cost position. And then, your relationships with your customers drive what your price is going to be and how you're going to move that supply once you have it. So, I think you got to have both. And if you have one and not the other, you may have a decent business, but you're subject to whim. So, what we have is low-cost resources that are geographic diverse with long-term agreements, with the major cathode producers around the globe. So, we feel like we're in the best \u2013 in the catbird seat really as we look to that.","As I look other juniors and what the valuations may be, there's still a difference \u2013 what we have to look at is what do we have in front of us that we can execute on, what's the cost of that and what's the return on that for the capital that we're going to invest, and what's the time that it takes us to do that. Any acquisition needs to be one that accelerates, de-risk and provides a better return of our capital than what we see in front of us. If we see that in front of us, we have the capability with our balance sheet and our ability to execute to be able to seize upon those opportunities, but we're going to be disciplined in doing so.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Joel Jackson, BMO Capital Markets.","Joel Jackson - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)","Hi. Good morning. One of your larger bromine competitors spoke about bromine for them over earned in Q2. They're expecting lower earnings the second half of the year. You seem to be modeling more to flat to up Bromine earnings in the second half of the year. Can you give a little more color on that? Anything happening in Q2 a little bit stronger. It doesn't seem like for your business.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. If you look at it \u2013 I don't know what happened with one of our competitors, but what we're looking at now is relatively flat second half versus first half in Bromine from a bottom-line standpoint. I don't see anything. If we had \u2013 it all comes down, honestly, to the amount of product we're able to get out because we're sold out and it's how our assets run.","And if our assets run better, that may move us a little bit to the upside of our range. If they don't operate as well, that may move us to the lower side of the range. But to us, it's all in the second half, if the market conditions remain similar, which what it appears to do, it's all about our ability to execute and run those sites.","Joel Jackson - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)","And I apologize if this question was asked earlier, but, Luke, Eric, we all see the daily, the weekly, the monthly spot Chinese carbonate prices falling. There's a question about how good the information content is in that data. Can you maybe comment on that? Is there any connection between those data points and what you would see in your contract pricing in the next \u2013 you've answered some of this, but is there any informational content really in that data?","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","I don't look at it. I mean the only time I bring it up is whenever you guys ask me about it and I have to go ask somebody what the Chinese spot price has done because it's really irrelevant. What's relevant to us is what's the cost that makes our customers \u2013 gives them the value that they're willing to pay for and gives us the return that we need to invest the capital. So, I'm the wrong guy to talk about spot pricing in China and, well, it's relative or anything else because I just \u2013 I never look at it.","Joel Jackson - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)","Thanks.","Operator","The next question from Kevin McCarthy, Vertical Research Partners.","Kevin W. McCarthy - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Yes. Good morning. I was wondering if you could provide an update with the progress on your contract negotiations with cathode manufacturers. I think in the past, you had expressed the goal of converting about 80% of the contracts by the first quarter of 2019. Is that still the case? And perhaps you could elaborate on the various contract features that you're seeking and how that's been received by your customer base?","Eric W. Norris - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. Kevin, this is Eric. I think just to repeat to what I recall us saying. We indicated that this was an important year because we had some contract naturally maturing, and others where we \u2013 either ourselves or the customers, proactively approaching us for contracts that weren't maturing, that wanted to be, for one party or other, extended longer term. And for us, that's beneficial obviously so we can plan production.","So, how that's going? We have a few more contracts that we've closed. Those terms are moving out to the middle of the next decade, by and large. It depends by the contract, but that's \u2013 we're moving beyond five years, whereas in the past, I think, we've indicated three to five years. Yet, we still have more to go, right. I think we indicated that this will be an important year and we're making great progress thus far. And we, clearly from what we're seeing, (00:38:22) continue to expect to see similar progress going forward.","The terms of these aren't different than what we described before, right. There's a components of a floor price, minimum volume and right of first refusal on additional volumes based upon the customers' growth, openers that are bidding, not the customers, and a return that gives a price that results in a return, that's 2x our cost of capital on an after-tax basis.","So, all those elements are still in play. What's really changing is the length of that term and obviously, the volumes are getting larger for those customers as well. And we'll, by the end of the year, likely, therefore, in our fourth quarter call in the beginning of 2019 going to give a more thorough update on all of those matters.","Kevin W. McCarthy - Vertical Research Partners LLC","And then as a follow-up, how would you compare and contrast demand for hydroxide versus carbonate? One of your peers seems to be seeing a mix shift toward hydroxide. Is that something that you observe as well? And if so, what might be driving that and how sustainable might it be in your judgment?","Eric W. Norris - Albemarle Corp.","Well, given our size and our position in carbonate, we have, I'll say, the opportunity to serve both markets, right. So that's maybe where we differ by some of our peers. We have a significant carbonate and we're building a \u2013 and have and are building an even more significant hydroxide capacity. As you know, Kevin, the plan for building capacity has us building more hydroxide capacity going forward than carbonate and that's because we're starting from a smaller base. And that is also true of the market. The market for hydroxide overall outside of Albemarle is smaller and the demand growth therefore is growing off a smaller base.","In terms of what's happening at the customer, as I indicated in an earlier question, we're seeing demand for both. Now, what we are certainly \u2013 and this is \u2013 we even had a question about Chinese EV policy, but in China, we're seeing a clear move to nickel chemistry. And we \u2013 it's very likely that we'll see an uptick in hydroxide needs for what's going on in China where they're putting their EV infrastructure and vehicles in place.","But all that being said, the contract commitments we have that go out into the next decade are pretty balanced between carbonate and hydroxide. And it really does depend on the cathode or battery manufacturers' infrastructure, the know-how they have in place to process and therefore the preference they have for one or the other.","Kevin W. McCarthy - Vertical Research Partners LLC","It's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Aleksey Yefremov of Nomura Instinet.","Aleksey Yefremov - Nomura Instinet","Good morning. Thank you. Sorry to come back to the China question. I recognize that they don't have exposure to China spot lithium market, but can you offer us your view of what is going on in that whole lithium-to-EV value chain? Is there anything that you see that has implications for EV sales in China and therefore global demand for Lithium?","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. Really, the only thing that I could hypothesize is that there are some lower grade carbonate that's in China that when you look at the Chinese regulations moving to a longer storage and a longer battery is having a tough time finding a place in the marketplace for EV because it won't meet that standard for that longer drive time under the new regulations in China. So it's of less value and somebody's trying to find a spot for. That's the best I can offer you. I don't think it's going to have any impact at all in our business.","Aleksey Yefremov - Nomura Instinet","Got It. Thank you, Luke. And then, staying in China on Xinyu II, what could be the benefit in terms of volume next year? Should we think of the ramp of Xinyu II as just offsetting some of the tolling volume that you have next year or will this be incremental to the tolling level that you have this year?","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","It's going to be incremental. And so, at full rates, it would be 20,000 metric tons on an annual basis. I don't think we can expect it to start up and sell out 20,000 met tons and run that way. So, is it going to be \u2013 we'll have a better handle around the second \u2013 the next call, but my expectations would be to get something around 15,000 or something like that out of that plant next year, that would be good operations assuming that they get commissioned and started on the back end of that during the fourth quarter, I would hope. That may be a stretch, but I would hope we'd be able to do that.","Aleksey Yefremov - Nomura Instinet","Understood. Thank you.","Operator","Okay. The next question comes from Sebastian Bray of Berenberg.","Sebastian Bray - Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG (United Kingdom)","Good morning and thank you for taking my questions. I would have three, please. The first is on the extent of coverage of your volumes with longer-term contracts. Could you please give an idea of what percentage of your volumes are booked out for the next two to three years with longer-term contracts? I think the target, from memory, was about 50% by the end of this year.","The second one is more on the development of Lithium demand this year. Do you have enough visibility now to say you would expect the market to grow by, let's say, 20% or potentially even more percent in absolute terms? Would this be about 260 kilotons to 270 kilotons? And lastly, a question on Catalysts. This business is, I think, has been mentioned in the previous question. People were typically thinking of low single-digit growth for. Suddenly, it has grown by over 10% volumes. Is this a catch-up effect? Is it some pre-stocking ahead of IMO legislation? Could you elaborate a bit please on why this business has grown as pleasingly as it has in Q2?","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Okay. Let me let me take the first one. On the coverage on our long-term agreements over the next two to three years, that's probably going to be 95%-plus from what we can produce. Next year, as we said, we're going to have to rely on tolling as well. So we're selling more than we can produce internally because we're still relying on tolling. Our goal long-term is to be right around 80%, but we won't get there until sometime early the next decade, if you look, I would assume.","On the demand, Eric, do you want to solve (00:45:09) a little bit about that, please?","Eric W. Norris - Albemarle Corp.","Yes. So, I mean, I think \u2013 I'm trying to remember what we said in the past, so what industry prognosticators often say, but it's a growth that's sort of in that neighborhood of 20% year-on-year is sort of the expectation maybe going forward. Now, I can tell you that this year the demand growth, from what we see, looks stronger than that on a percentage basis. And it's coming \u2013 Luke in his script referenced a near doubling of EV demand. There's demand that's coming from other places like e-buses. There's demand coming from even industrial applications with a strong global economy.","So, we're seeing demand that could approach close to 50,000 metric tons year-over-year on a market that, last year, we indicated, by our estimates, was 220,000 metric tons. So that's a stronger growth than we would have thought at the beginning of the year.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","And then, if you look at Catalysts, I would view it \u2013 when you're looking at this year-over-year growth, you got to get it back to 2017. And if you go back 2017 and look at Catalysts from a full year basis, we would have been down year-over-year. So, 2017 was weaker than 2016. So, 2018, if we're high single-digits, we catch back up, or we maybe a little bit ahead or a little bit down.","So, overall, as we've talked about, this is a lumpy business. FCC is more consistent. The CFT market in hydroprocessing catalysts, based on customer mix and product mix, and whenever they turn around, you have different costs based on where you are in that turnaround cycle. So, it happens to be this year that we're up after a down year last year. Overall, when you look at it over the course of five to 10 years, I would still expect that kind of 3% growth is where we'd end up on a CAGR basis.","Sebastian Bray - Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG (United Kingdom)","All right. Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question comes from Arun Viswanathan, RBC Capital Markets.","Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to ask about the costs you're experiencing in Lithium. How would you characterize the cost curve over the last year and what's your outlook over the next year? I mean, have you seen any material changes to cash cost for yourself and do you see those rising over the next year?","Scott A. Tozier - Albemarle Corp.","If you look at cash cost at plants, I mean, there are always year-on-year inflationary impacts, but if you look at that and productivity and then look more broadly at the competitive set, the combination of cost curves \u2013 our cost position in the cost curve and our position relative to competitors doesn't change. We're still on the left-hand side of the cost curve for carbonate, with brine and similarly with rock for hydroxide.","Now, you have to also consider, what you're going to see in our results is the royalties \u2013 royalty structure, which also affects our cost structure. So, now we're \u2013 at current volume prices, we're at the high end \u2013 at the very high end of that royalty curve or tier. So, you will see times \u2013 on a comparison basis, where our costs are high because of that component, but all other components are largely as expected or similar to previous.","Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And just two more quick ones. So, first on pricing, when you see the high single-digit price increase for this year kind of go through, does that bring your average pricing kind of more in line where it should be or do you still have more rollovers that would drive further price gains next year?","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. We've still got a few rollovers, but I mean \u2013 the only thing I would characterize is \u2013 I wouldn't characterize this is not in line. It's fine in line with where we are, but when you see these contracts renew, there is some opportunity for some adjustments in price, but it'll be \u2013 as we've talked about with \u2013 I think it was Zekauskas' question, what we'll see next year is more of a volume story than a price story. And that's what you see as we bring this new capital line, still some opportunity in price, but really, really it's more a volume story.","Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thanks. And last one is just Tianqi recently announced that they're investing a little bit more to increase some spodumene production in Australia. I think it's like 1.8 million tons or so by 2021. Would you get any offtake from that, or is that something that we could look for you to grow further in, or is that not a market for you guys?","Scott A. Tozier - Albemarle Corp.","No. So, it was actually Talison, not Tianqi. Tianqi is our partner. Talison made the announcement. And this is part of what's enabling the growth plan that we have that we've described. It's not in the current earnings deck, but it's certainly in our website. The expanding Lithium conversion capacity chart we have in Wave 1 and Wave 2. And under the bylaws and the relationship we have, any increase in offtake, we get half of and Tianqi get the other half. So, it doesn't go to market. It goes to us and enables that Wave 1 and there'll be a continued plan towards Wave 2 capacity expansions as well.","Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","The next question we have is from Mike Sison of KeyBanc.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hey, guys. Nice quarter. Luke, you kind of opened up and talked a little bit more positively again on EVs. Can you maybe just update us on your outlook for Lithium? Has it increased since the beginning of the year and to what degree? And you had a lot of nice highlights on what you think demand should be at the beginning of the call.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. No, if you look, our demand model remains fairly consistent with what we talked about earlier. And if you remember at one of our \u2013 at our previous calls and in some of our decks that we've got online and we've used that, some of the seminars that we've been to, in 2025, we're saying a total demand of around 800,000 metric tons. Transportation would amount to 550,000 metric tons of that, consumer electronics, 110,000 metric tons, and all other industrial uses about 140,000 metric tons.","So, we haven't changed in that, although what I was trying to point out is the data that we've seen, the demand from our customers, the steps taken by our customers' customers committing to capital is all consistent with that demand model that we laid out early this year. So, during the course of this year, we've gotten even more confident in our demand model and even more confident in the growth that we anticipate between now and 2025.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Great. Then, as a quick follow-up, there still seems to be some concern that Lithium pricing could significantly fall over time. Do you see a scenario where your contract pricing can fall significantly over the next couple of years?","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","No.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Just a couple of quick ones. Scott, the cash flow from operations guidance stayed flat, even though, EBITDA, you took the bottom end and the high end up. I did see some comments in the release and such about raw materials. Is this just a working capital build or what's the story there?","Scott A. Tozier - Albemarle Corp.","Yes. Vincent, this is primarily driven by \u2013 given our earnings up, our revenues up as well, so we have a bit more working capital. Obviously, that's going to be a bit of a drag on our cash flow. So, that's really all it reflects.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then just \u2013 I've been reading some things about workers' strikes in Chile, maybe more for BHP and others, but is that something that you're concerned about at all?","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","We're not concerned at all. In fact, we recently just negotiated all of our union contracts for another three years. So, we feel like we're in great shape. Have a wonderful working relationship with our employees, both in the Salar, in Santiago and La Negra. There's a lot of activity down there right now. So, working with them together to get those contracts renewed, took a lot of great leadership from both the employees' side on the unions and ours. So, kudos to all those guys.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Good to hear. Thanks very much, guys.","Operator","The next question comes from Mike Harrison of Seaport Global Securities.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. You mentioned in Catalysts that the FCC prices had moved a little bit higher. Can you just give us a little bit more detail on what you're seeing in the FCC pricing environment and your utilization rates in FCC right now?","Raphael Crawford - Albemarle Corp.","Sure, Mike. This is Raphael. FCC utilization rates are fairly high right now. They're actually for \u2013 for the major players, it's very high. In China, utilization is lowered by Chinese FCC producers. But overall, it's a good market for FCC, given where utilization is. That's been favorable for pricing. We've seen pricing trending upward in most of our established markets. And I think that's a good sign.","Pricing is a function not just of utilization rates, but it's also in the value you can deliver to your customers. And we're fortunate to have good technical products and technical people to help sell those solutions to our customers.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","I was also hoping, Raphael, that you could break out the 16% volume growth that you saw year-on-year in Catalysts. What were the separate volume growth rates for FCC versus HPC? Thank you.","Scott A. Tozier - Albemarle Corp.","It's Scott. Yeah. So, Mike, we don't normally split those out, but we saw volume growth in both businesses.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Jim Sheehan of SunTrust.","James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Could you talk about Lithium margins over the next \u2013 say, in 2019? You have shifting and moving parts throughout the year. How should we think about the seasonality or cadence of margins quarter-by-quarter?","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. This is Luke. We look at it normally on an annual basis because if we got a \u2013 you got a plant that's running 40,000 metric tons and you shut it down for a week or two \u2013 or two weeks for something, you can see a change. So, what I would say is what we've always said. We expect these margins to be north of 40% and we believe we'll be able to hold that well into the future.","If we look last year, I think our overall Lithium margins on an EBITDA basis were roughly 43% to 44% on a round. And if I look at it this year, first quarter, it was kind of 44%, second quarter was 45%. So, we're kind of right on where we've said we're going to be. I think, overall, for the full year, you'll see similar margins that we saw in the first quarter. And I'll expect, as we get out in 2019, we would see similar type margins.","James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Great. And on the IMO fuel standards for marine fuels, are you seeing any impact in your business this early, any impact on demand or pricing, or is that something that is going to ramp slowly over time as the regulation is implemented?","Raphael Crawford - Albemarle Corp.","Jim, we haven't seen \u2013 this is Raphael, we haven't seen any impact of that yet. And to your point, I think it'll ramp slowly over time. It's an overall trend in the industry towards lower sulfur transportation fuel, not just in marine, but around the world, but it's a slow ramp.","James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Chris Kapsch of Loop Capital Markets.","Chris Kapsch - Loop Capital Markets LLC","Yeah. Good morning. My questions are follow-ups around the increased activity with tollers. I guess, tolling has always been part of the mix and I think, indeed, it was a tolling relationship with Jiangxi Jiangli, which ultimately led to the acquisition at the time what was probably one of the best converters in China. So the questions are, a couple of things, one, are these tollers that you're working with now, are they totally focused on battery-grade lithium products and you're comfortable with them hitting those specs?","And then, given that these tolling pounds are part of the mix, is it having any sort of dampening effect on margins currently? And if that's the case, as you expand your in-house conversion capacity and shift more of that volume back in house, will that have an influence on the margin outlook?","Eric W. Norris - Albemarle Corp.","Hey, Chris. This is Eric. So with regard to tolling, as you know, we qualify and spend a lot of time working in getting the right tollers. We make sure we're working with folks we know and believe they have the right quality. All that being said, it is not used in battery-grade products, right? We use this largely for technical-grade product lines or our customer relationships that we have.","As we've said often on over the past couple of quarters and years, we'll continue to use that as swing capacity as we bring on plants and bring off to support ourselves because it is a lower-margin business, right. It does have a margin-dampening effect. And you're seeing a little \u2013 and we expect a little bit of that in the coming quarter, right? We will have tolling volumes that's offsetting some of the lack of volume we otherwise would have had coming out of La Negra because we're having a tie-in at La Negra. So, yeah, our expectation is you'll probably see more of a margin impact from the \u2013 from what goes on than a sales impact with La Negra because of that tolling phenomenon, being that swing capacity we bring on to buffer the situation.","Chris Kapsch - Loop Capital Markets LLC","That's helpful. And then just as a follow-up. I mean, given that most of these relationships are not focused on the battery grades, is it fair to assume then that the strategy will be to build out organic in-house conversion capacity as opposed to considering maybe another converter acquisition?","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","We will look at that as it comes. And it depends upon what the timing is, it depends upon what the capabilities of that toller is, and it depends upon what the return on invested capital would be, and what we would have to invest in there. So, we look at that, obviously, but the return's got to be right for us to do an acquisition, given where we are from an organic.","And as we look at it as well, we've talked about the importance of having assets within China and outside of China because within China any export of lithium hydroxide has a 17% non-recoverable VAT. And we just want to be sure we can service our customers efficiently and effectively outside of China and inside of China.","Chris Kapsch - Loop Capital Markets LLC","That's helpful.

Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everybody. Before commenting on the third quarter results, I want to start the call by thanking our employees and their families for their outstanding dedication and resilience during Hurricane Harvey and its aftermath. Our employees were able to minimize downtime at both our Bayport and Pasadena plants and quickly resume production to meet the needs of our customers and minimize the financial impact on Albemarle.","Making this even more impressive is the fact that they accomplished all of this while many dealt with flooded homes and power outages. I'd also like to thank the Albemarle employees around the world who stepped up to support their colleagues in need in Houston during this trying time.","Turning to the third quarter. Excluding divested businesses, revenue grew just over $100 million, or 15%, and adjusted EBITDA grew by $22 million, or 12%, compared to the third quarter of 2016. This marks our seventh consecutive quarter of revenue growth on this basis and our fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit adjusted EBITDA growth.","These results were driven primarily by continued strong growth in Lithium and solid performance in Bromine Specialties. Excluding the negative impacts from Hurricane Harvey, Refining Solutions and PCS performed about as anticipated.","Looking to the future, our Wave 1 Lithium capital projects remained on track as do our exploration efforts to define Wave 2 new Lithium resource projects targeted to provide growth beyond 2021. In the third quarter, we announced the development of a yield improvement technology that could allow us to increase our annual production capacity in Chile from 80,000 metric tons to about 125,000 metric tons on an LCE basis without the need for any increased brine extraction from the Salar. In connection with this announcement, we requested that CORFO increase our lithium quota, and that request is still pending.","Just this week, we filed a Permit Application in Western Australia for the development of a Greenfield site to build a world-scale plant to convert Talison spodumene to lithium hydroxide. We continue our exploration of additional resource opportunities, including the Antofalla region in Argentina and our Kings Mountain spodumene resource.","Additionally, in addition to organic growth, we remain very active in assessing a variety of M&A opportunities in lithium and are focused on those that could accelerate growth, bring us new technology of resources, or otherwise de-risk our strategy.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott.","Scott A. Tozier - Albemarle Corp.","Thanks, Luke. For the third quarter, we reported adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.08, an increase of about $0.19 per share, or 20% compared to third quarter 2016, excluding divested businesses. Our businesses delivered about $0.23 per share of that growth, with most of that coming from Lithium. A lower effective tax rate contributed about $0.02. Those gains were partially offset by the impact of Hurricane Harvey of about $0.07 per share. Note that most of the negative impact from Harvey was in Refining Solutions and PCS, both of which have operations and multiple customers and suppliers in the Houston area.","There was no significant plant damage at our sites. However, there were increased costs caused primarily by factory downtime, equipment replacement and repair, and logistics and supplier outages that forced us to use more expensive alternatives.","With respect to tax, we now expect our full-year 2017 effective tax rate, excluding special items, non-operating pension, and OPEB items, to be about 19.5%, down from our prior guidance of 21%. The reduction is based on our current outlook of sales and production mix by country so far in 2017 and our expectations for the fourth quarter. Strong operations at our bromine joint venture in Jordan have been an especially important factor in the reduced tax outlook.","Corporate costs were $28.2 million during the third quarter. Given our updated view of the rest of the year, 2017 corporate costs are now likely to be about $110 million to $115 million. Total operating working capital was 28% of revenue, up 1% from the second quarter. We expect to return to our guidance level of about 27% of revenue by the end of the year.","Capital spending year-to-date through September was $188 million. Our Wave 1 lithium projects continue to ramp, with spending during the third quarter almost equal to the first six months of 2017. Spending will increase further in the fourth quarter of 2017 and into 2018. Based on payment terms and timing of equipment delivery, we now expect total 2017 spending to be about $310 million to $350 million.","Through the end of the third quarter, our adjusted free cash flow was $236 million. This number represents cash flow from operations, adding back pension and post-retirement contributions and subtracting capital expenditures, but excluding one-time synergy, acquisition, and tax-related costs. For the full year, we now anticipate adjusted free cash flow of between $275 million and $325 million.","Before I report on our businesses, I would like to inform you that, effective the beginning of 2018, management of the PCS business will move from Lithium & Advanced Materials into Refining Solutions. The combined Refining Solutions and PCS businesses will form a new GBU called Catalyst. This will enable the Lithium leadership team to be even more focused on its customers, markets, and excellence in operations.","There'll be no change to the Bromine Specialties GBU. The change will be a straightforward move of PCS revenue and adjusted EBITDA from Lithium to Catalyst, and there should be no impact on your ability to model our performance.","Moving on to our business performance, Lithium & Advanced Materials had another very strong quarter, with net sales of $344 million and adjusted EBITDA of $130 million, resulting in adjusted EBITDA margins of 38%. Compared to the third quarter of 2016, net sales were up 43% and adjusted EBITDA was up 42%.","In Lithium, third quarter net sales were up 62% and adjusted EBITDA up 65% compared to the third quarter of 2016. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 42%, the 11th consecutive quarter with adjusted EBIDA margins over 40%. Year-on-year, volume grew in the quarter by 29%, and pricing improved by approximately 32%. Battery-grade products drove essentially all of the volume growth and most of the pricing improvement.","PCS performed in line with expectations, excluding negative impacts from Hurricane Harvey of about $4 million. Net sales were flat compared to the third quarter of 2016, and adjusted EBITDA was down 25% year-on-year. Mostly as a result of Harvey, the full-year PCS adjusted EBITDA is now expected to be down mid to high-single digits on a percentage basis versus 2016.","Third quarter net sales for Refining Solutions were $170 million, down 11% year-on-year. Adjusted EBITDA was $43 million, down 34% year-on-year, impacted by about $5 million due to Hurricane Harvey, and by product mix, volume, and higher input costs.","Net sales of Fluid Catalytic Cracking, or FCC catalysts, were approximately flat compared to third quarter 2016 with product mix driven by continued strength of VGO products in North America, partially offset by lower volumes of higher-margin max polypropylene products.","Net sales of Clean Fuels Technologies, or HPC catalysts, were down as expected compared to the third quarter of 2016 as a result of product mix and volume. Bromine Specialties reported net sales of $213 million and adjusted EBITDA of $64 million, up 9% and 23%, respectively, compared to third quarter 2016. Results were driven by solid demand for flame retardants and lower year-on-year production from Chinese bromine companies.","Now I'll turn the call back to Luke to update our view of the year.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Thanks, Scott. Albemarle continued to deliver on its commitments to our stakeholders with another quarter of year-over-year growth. In addition, we made significant progress on our Lithium capital and exploration projects.","As a result of strong year-to-date performance and our expectations for the fourth quarter, we're increasing our full-year 2017 guidance despite some continued expected negative impacts in the fourth quarter from Hurricane Harvey in PCS and Refining Solutions. We now expect our 2017 net sales to range from $3 billion to $3.05 billion. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $860 million and $875 million, with adjusted diluted EPS now estimated at $4.40 to $4.50 per share.","The increased guidance is driven largely by performance in Lithium and Bromine, with Lithium now forecasting full-year adjusted EBITDA growth of more than 50% versus 2016 and Bromine now forecasting adjusted EBITDA growth of around 10% versus 2016. While Refining Solutions is forecasting the highest EBITDA levels for the year in the fourth quarter and while the order book looks solid, there's always a risk that HPC orders could slip into 2018.","As we look toward 2018, we believe we have positioned the company for another outstanding year. Our budgeting process is well underway, and while it is too early to provide specific guidance, we're very confident in another strong year. Early indications suggest the potential for greater than 20% growth in our Lithium Business supported by continued stability in Bromine Specialties and Catalyst.","Matthew K. Juneau - Albemarle Corp.","Operator, we are ready to open the lines for Q&A. But before you do so, I would remind everyone to please limit your questions to two per person at one time so that everyone has a chance to ask questions. Then feel free to get back in the queue for follow-ups, if time allows. Please proceed.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. This comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan at RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thanks. Good morning.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Hey.","Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Just a question on Q4. So, if I were to assume a little bit of lingering hurricane impact in PCS and Refining Solutions and then take the midpoint of your guidance, it does imply slightly better results sequentially in Lithium. What's driving that? Is that just the timing of the order book? And maybe you can potentially give us your confidence in the size of that impact. Thanks.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","You jumped in and out of us being able to hear you on that. I think you said that, given everything, it looks like we're sequentially flat in Lithium from third to the fourth quarter. Is that right?","Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","No. Actually, I said it looks like you're sequentially up in Lithium from third quarter to fourth quarter.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","I still can't hear you. I'm sorry.","Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","I'm sorry. Are you sequentially up from 3Q to 4Q in Lithium?","Scott A. Tozier - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. This is Scott. So, we're effectively flat to maybe slightly up in the fourth quarter. As we think sequentially, we see a bit better performance on the revenue line, but we do have increased spending in our resources, as we talked about last quarter, that will offset that a little bit. So, I think we're in good shape for another great quarter.","Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And then just as a quick follow-up for 2018. You just noted potential for 20% or more growth in Lithium. Maybe just bucket that out into your expectations for price and volume. Thanks.","John Mitchell - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah, hi. This is John. So, as we've guided in the past from a volume perspective, we continue to expect to add about 10,000 metric tons minimum per year. So that's within our growth plan for next year. So, an incremental 10,000 metric tons of additional capacity. And from a pricing perspective, we're guiding to mid-single digits on pricing for 2018.","Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from the line of Joel Jackson at BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Joel Jackson - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)","Hi. Good morning. Maybe you can talk a little bit more about your ability to extract more lithium from your new technology or new innovation at Salar de Atacama. Can you maybe give a little more color on what the process is, is some CapEx investment in the plant, is it the pond? Anything you can give will be appreciated. Thanks.","John Mitchell - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. Hi. This is John. First off, it's important to understand that this technology does not require us to pump any more brine. So, from a Chilean government perspective, we're not consuming any more natural resource, which is a big plus for the Chilean government.","It does require a change in operation and it does require capital investment. And really from a proprietary perspective, that's probably as much details I'm willing to talk about. But it's really exciting technology. It allows us to grow substantially in the Atacama up to at least 125,000 metric tons. And we've piloted the technology, so we know it works. And it's going to be very exciting for us and also for the Chilean government.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","And just to add, John, the capital will be focused in the Salar, not in the operating plant. So, it will be focused in the ponds, correct?","John Mitchell - Albemarle Corp.","That's correct, Luke. It'll be focused in the mining operation.","Joel Jackson - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)","That's helpful. Thank you. And a final question on Bromine. Bromine levels are better. It looks like it was more in volume than pricing. You've talked about some Chinese restarts in Q4. Would we expect a bit of a pullback in the Bromine earnings in Q4? And I think you suggested stability (18:40) for Bromine. So is it possible to step back as well?","Raphael Crawford - Albemarle Corp.","This is Raphael. I would expect that Q4 is relatively consistent with Q3 at this point. I think the trends that had been favorable for the Bromine business this year, both on the demand side in the Flame Retardant business as well as the shutdowns in Chinese production which has led to better pricing, generally support what we're seeing in Q3. And we expect some of that to continue into Q4.","On an annual basis, usually Q4 is slightly weaker than the rest of the quarter. So, it just depends on order of timing where that would fall for Q4. But I think the underlying trends we expect to continue.","Joel Jackson - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from the line of David Begleiter at Deutsche Bank. Go ahead, please.","David Huang - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. This is David Huang here for David Begleiter. I guess first question on Lithium. Can you discuss what drove the strong operating efficiency out of the Chinese assets and what the operating rates are for those two assets? And also, what kind of volume growth should we assume for Lithium in Q4?","John Mitchell - Albemarle Corp.","This is John. First off, the China assets, they've performed excellent in 2017. We expect them to continue to perform extremely well going into 2018. They're operating at almost full capacity right now and they've been operating at very high capacities for most of 2017.","With regard to volume expectations, as Scott said earlier, from an EBITDA perspective you can expect Q4 to look a lot like Q3, maybe a little bit extra volume in Q4.","David Huang - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. And Refining, what drove down the performance in Refining besides hurricane? Do you think the issues in Q3 and year-to-date are all transitory? And how do you get this business back to your growth trajectory?","Silvio Ghyoot - Albemarle Corp.","David, good morning. This is Silvio. As you mentioned, you're correct that the hurricane had an unforeseen effect on the results. But if I take the macro picture, Refining business is in good shape and demand is strong for both HPC and Fluid Cracking.","However, as we guided already before, we were expecting a lower quarter volume and then primarily for the HPC, followed by large order book for the last quarter. We're holding on strong to that, but you know there's still a risk that things may be slipping out.","So from a macro perspective, I feel comfortable that refining industry and that the Catalyst demands remains strong for the longer haul and this is based on the fact of the strong demand for fuels and petrochemicals. And our business in this particular market is a bit extraordinary this year in that quarter three shows lower and we show a big lump into quarter four.","David Huang - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from the line of P.J. Juvekar at Citi. Go ahead, please.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Yes. Hi. Good morning. Thank you. As you explained Talison, do you know what the new (22:21) would be on the new terms? And as you are building the mines and the conversion plant, what would be the total CapEx? Thank you.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","So, if you look at Talison, Talison is a joint venture. So, the joint venture will fund the expansion of Talison without any additional capital call to the shareholders. They will be able to fund that capital from their own operating cash flow and borrowing. There will be no additional capital call expected from either of the partners.","Then, we will fund our own conversion capacity, where we take the spodumene concentrate and convert it to lithium hydroxide. And that's already in the 165,000 met tons that we talked about bringing online by 2021.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thank you. And then secondly, as you increase your production in Chile and Australia, are you still looking for M&A? And would you want to have a controlling stake, or would you be happy with a minority stake?","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah, we are certainly looking at M&A. We've got a great balance sheet, and we believe we can flex that as necessary for anything that would de-risk our strategy or accelerate our strategy. We are very active in looking at M&A opportunities today that have come through. They've got to satisfy one of those criteria, and we've also got to be able to get a return on that invested capital.","Whether or not we have a minority stake or a majority stake or any of that is just speculation. And until you see what the deal looks like, until you see what the financials look like, and until you see how it accelerates the strategy, it really doesn't (24:14) talk about what our criteria would be in that sense. So, it doesn't make a lot of sense to talk about it. So, we are very active and feel like we have the balance sheet and have the track record of incorporating those acquisitions that make us a good candidate to be out there finding the right opportunity.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from the line of Jim Sheehan at SunTrust. Please go ahead.","James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you. Quick clarification on Refining Solutions. Are all of your facilities up and running after the hurricane? And I'm just curious about why there's still a little uncertainty regarding your Catalyst orders, that some of them might possibly slip into 2018. Do you not have enough visibility now, as of today, to be able to say whether those orders will occur in this quarter?","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. Hey, this is Luke. Let me take the second one, and then I'll let Silvio have the one about the plants. If you look at orders, we've got the orders, but the orders can always slip. You can have refineries decide they want to take it in January as opposed to taking it in December, or you can have a \u2013 if you've got a late schedule, you could have a logistics issue that it slides over to the next quarter. So, it's not a matter of if we get the order, it's a matter of when you recognize the revenue.","Silvio, you want to talk about our operations for a second? (25:43)","Silvio Ghyoot - Albemarle Corp.","Sure, Luke. Thanks. Well, as Luke mentioned before, we are extremely satisfied on how we have gone through the storm. Our people at the plants have done an extraordinary job to keep the plants safe during the event. And then, at the end, they made an extraordinary job in bringing the plants on after being down for about one week. We started with our HPC plants at the beginning of the week and then, the next 48 hours, we got our FCC running.","We got some damage on the plants. Nobody got hurt. And obviously, we have had to deal with the aftermath, which was not getting material out because the roads were flooded, did not get material into the ports at time, et cetera, et cetera. So, the financial impact from Harvey primarily comes from the issues around not getting orders out in time, customers being at a standstill and not operating their refineries. But all is solved right now. We're having the first effect on the third quarter. As Scott mentioned, we are expecting also an effect on the fourth quarter, and maybe little remnants still in quarter one.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","But everybody's operational today, Jim.","James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. Thank you. And then, regarding your filing for a higher lithium quota with CORFO. Do you expect your royalty rates to change as a result of that filing? Do you think CORFO will increase the royalty that they take on the lithium?","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","So, Jim, I'm not going to negotiate with CORFO over the telephone. We're having discussions with CORFO. We told you what we expect our margin is going to be going forward. There's nothing that's going to happen with regard to that Application that's going to change our margin profile in any way.","James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question is from the line of Robert Koort at Goldman Sachs. Go ahead, please.","Dylan Campbell - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi. This is Dylan Campbell on for Bob. Thanks for taking my question. I'm curious of what your expectations are for carbonate versus hydroxide demand growth and how that will play out based on different cathode chemistries, like 622 or 811.","John Mitchell - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah, hi. This is John. Albemarle is a little bit different than others in this industry, where we're only investing based on long-term agreements that we negotiate with our customers. The customers that we've selected are really the best battery producers and cathode producers in the world. And each one of those battery producers and cathodes producers has a different view on where they want to take battery chemistry and whether they would like to utilize carbonate and hydroxide.","Right now, when you look at our Wave 1 investments, it's fairly balanced between carbonate and hydroxide. However, if our customers are willing to sign long-term agreements and it's more heavily weighted to hydroxide, we have the full capability and the resources to be able to increase hydroxide. If they want carbonate, we have the ability to do that. So, our approach to the market is to really team with our customers and get into a long-term planning process and a long-term commitment to each other to make sure they have the right molecule.","Dylan Campbell - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. And across your pricing mix, do you make more money on hydroxide or carbonate, or is it fairly equal across your contract base?","John Mitchell - Albemarle Corp.","So since this is not a commodities market, each customer is a little bit different. Their requirements are a little bit different. And you really need to get into what the individual contract requirements are and how we define prices based on what the customer is asking for and the value that we're adding.","And so, there are certain cases where we make more in hydroxide and other cases where we make more in carbonate. It's just not a commodities market. And you can rest assured that we understand the value that we're bringing to the customer and we're pricing appropriately.","Dylan Campbell - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from the line of Aleksey Yefremov at Nomura Instinet. Please go ahead.","Matthew Skowronski - Nomura Instinet","Morning. This is Matt Skowronski on for Aleksey. Regarding the new Greenfield spodumene conversion site, can you remind us how many converters you're currently using? And what drove this decision? Was it logistics cost, lack of available conversion capacity or something else? And then how much capacity will this site have?","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. Hey. I'll let John get into the details. But this was always part of the plan. If you go back and look at our Investor Day Presentation earlier this year, we said that there was additional 40,000 met tons, I think, of conversion to be determined. And this is all consistent with the strategy. In a matter of we're going to bring the Talison spodumene to Western Australia so it is easier from a trucking standpoint; you don't have to move around as much, but we'll be moving finished product.","So, we need to be the low-cost producer in the marketplace. We feel like we've got the engineering capability to be able to do that. And it also gives us some flexibility from a China standpoint with the acquisition and the capital project we have going on over there to expand that site and have something else outside of China in Western Australia as well.","So, this is not a change at all. It's totally consistent with what we had said at our Investor Day Presentation. And you'll continue to see expanding the ability to convert Talison spodumene into lithium hydroxide for Lithium customers in servicing that area of the world.","Matthew Skowronski - Nomura Instinet","Thank you. And then on Bromine, can you just talk about if you are able to capture any market share with the Chinese producers being out and if you expect pricing to continue maybe beyond 2018? Thank you.","Raphael Crawford - Albemarle Corp.","This is Raphael. So, our Chinese business is relatively small compared to the other major suppliers. That being said, I think the share that we have captured has been relative to the global market. So as Chinese production was down, we were able to take advantage of that opportunity, sell more into the Chinese market at higher prices, which contributes favorably to our results.","That being said, we're cautiously optimistic about Chinese prices going forward. So far, it looks like a positive trend of higher prices. And as long as that holds true, we'll continue to look for opportunity for price or volume.","Our fundamental strategy is to maintain the cash flow of this business for the long term throughout cycles. So, while we're taking advantage of opportunities on price and volume related to China, we continue to work on productivity and efficiency projects at our plants. And that should have a meaningful long-term impact on our cash flow.","Matthew Skowronski - Nomura Instinet","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from the line of Vincent Andrews at Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Neel Kumar - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning. This is Neel Kumar calling in for Vincent. On Lithium, can you discuss what type of impact the increased exploration costs have had on 3Q margin levels?","Scott A. Tozier - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. This is Scott. So, we had a couple of basis points \u2013 about 200 basis points to 250 basis points of impact due to combination of the resource costs as well as the royalties and community costs that we paid down in Chile.","Neel Kumar - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And do you expect that to continue over the next several quarters? Would this be kind of the new margin level, in the low 40%s?","Scott A. Tozier - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah, our expectation is that the Lithium business delivers margins that are north of 40%. It's going to vary depending on both product mix and the amount of spending that we're doing in terms of explorations. Our expectation is that the second half of this year is kind of the normal. And we'll see how that develops over time.","Neel Kumar - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from the line of Colin Rusch at Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.","Colin Rusch - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thanks so much. Can you guys give us a bit of insight on the new brine processing technology and the downstream efficiencies for the carbonate production and any configuration changes you might be seeing in that processing facility?","John Mitchell - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. Hi. This is John. I just answered a question a couple moments ago regarding the technology in the mine in the Atacama. It is a process change and it does require capital investment in the mine.","Because of the proprietary nature of the technology and the fact that it gives us a good advantage, we're not really going to disclose publicly exactly what we're going to be doing in the Atacama, but it is certainly world-class in terms of efficiencies as we push north of 80%. And it's also great for the people of Chile because it is more sustainable and it allows them to create more value by utilizing the same brine that we're pumping today. So, it's great for the country. It adds a tremendous amount of value to the region and it's good for us and it's good for the customers.","With regard to the refineries, we're always improving our processing at the refineries and getting more efficient there as well. As Luke mentioned, we are laser-focused on maintaining the lowest-cost position in the industry. And part of that is to make sure that we are taking care of the molecule in a way that we're being as efficient with it as possible. And so, part of what has gone on and on in La Negra is technology improvements to allow us to improve efficiencies in the refinery operation as well. And that's going extremely well for us.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah, if I could add, this is the way I look at this is this is very similar to bringing on a new resource. So, if we could get another 40,000 metric tons over there, if you look around the world that the announcements that are coming online about potential new entrants, when you're talking about bringing 40,000 metric tons, we understand what a Brownfield brand-new resource would cost and we understand what the technology and the cost of this would be to bring it on with this yield enhancement.","Suffice it to say that it is a much less capital-intensive to bring on this with yield enhancement in the Salar than it is to bring on a new Brownfield resource. And the returns on invested capital will be much better than if we were bringing on another resource somewhere else in the world.","Colin Rusch - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thanks, guys. And then just looking at a lot of the activity around cathode material adjustments. And we're seeing a fair amount of activity around your customers changing what they're working with from a cathode perspective. Can you talk a little bit about the dynamics and rate of change in terms of the specs that you're seeing from those customers and how diverse that's getting at this point?","John Mitchell - Albemarle Corp.","This is John. First off, most of this battery material is going into electric cars, right? And so, the warranty issues around batteries that need to last 10 years or more than 10 years are significant. And so, the quality standards continue to increase really each year, and not just the quality of the material, but the whole quality management system and the way we actually have to produce the product. So that's one big area.","We continue to partner with our customers that sign long-term agreements to understand how that molecule is going to evolve. And it could be a molecule change. It could be a molecule modification. It can have physical property \u2013 physical characteristics. It could have chemical characteristics.","So, again, we're working with individual market leaders in cathode and batteries to make sure that we can tailor our molecule so that their battery can have a better performance than others in the market. And that's what we're focused on.","Colin Rusch - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","All right. Great. I'll take the rest of it offline. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn at Longbow Research. Please go ahead.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to poke around a little bit around the refining catalyst part of the business. First of all, on the HPC downdraft this quarter and then, pretty significant shipments looks like expected either for the fourth quarter or the first quarter. How should we think about the timing of these shipments and how they're going to impact your quarters in 2018? In other words, was this an abnormally low cycle in terms of change-outs for your business and you will get back to a more typical growth in HPC in 2018? Or are we dealing with something else here?","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Silvio?","Silvio Ghyoot - Albemarle Corp.","Hi. Good morning. This is Silvio. As I tried to explain earlier, and I tried to go back to the fundamentals of the market, 2017 shows a strong demand. And our expectations for 2018 are not any different.","If you look at Albemarle's business and which deals we are picking up and which change-outs we are having with certain refiners, there is already something extraordinary in this year's picture that, as I explained before, that some larger change-out and some industrial trials were sitting in the middle of the year, which were causing that \u2013 the demand was expected to be somewhat lower.","And coincidentally, some of our secured orders, as Luke was saying, are lumping up at the end of the year. The risk of those orders not occurring has more to do with hiccups in shipping lines or last-minute changes for deliveries with the customer. It's not so much to do with, do I get the order or not.","Going forward for 2018, I'm expecting a more regular pattern. There is no indication on why it would show a similar extraordinary pattern as this year. But this being said, it's all the discretion of the refiners to figure out when they will accept orders and when they will make change-outs, and when they need deliveries. So, to wrap it up and to answer your question, the fundamentals for the market do not change, and expect ongoing solid demand for both HPC and FCC for next year. And I also do not foresee any event that would cause a skewed order of delivery patterns.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. Silvio, that's helpful. And then just as my follow-up question, as my second question, just looking at raw material costs. Lithium obviously is going up in price pretty significantly, but so is cobalt and so is nickel and so is molly (42:00) and so are rare earths. So how is your Refining Catalyst business, both on the FCC side and the HPC side, dealing with the escalating input costs? Are you getting pass-throughs in time? Are you starting to put in surcharges? So, what's going on in your pricing response to these raw material pressures?","Silvio Ghyoot - Albemarle Corp.","Okay. Thanks. Let me take a step back and recall that, somewhere in the middle of 2016, we have started with price increases. And at the basis of those price increases were already the uptick we were seeing in all or most of the metals at that time, and in general, an increase also in all the other raw materials that I said. (42:32)","Going forward, looking at that situation today, nothing has changed, other than it's becoming a bit worse. All raw materials are going up. Metals are going up. And that reinforces the fact that we are continuing or ramping up our efforts for adjusting the prices.","In terms of passing those metal prices on, most of the cases are typically, we have escalated in our HPC pricing. Which means that, with some delay, you're passing on the metal prices to the customer. I'm saying typically, because in some deals, you have some fixed prices.","The same with the FCC, the rare earth pricing is gradually going up, and also the formula to pass on that part of the cost to the customers. But overall, beyond the pricing, we see this inflationary pressure which is at the basis of the price corrections we are trying to make on an individual basis with each customer.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from the line of John Roberts at UBS. Please go ahead.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Hi there. Could you talk a little bit about the non-battery markets for Lithium? Are those customers getting all the volume they want? And how is price trending in some of those products?","John Mitchell - Albemarle Corp.","Hi. This is John. Yes, for any long-term customer, contracted customer, we're going to make sure that our customers get supplies and materials, in whatever lithium form they need it. Certainly, pricing in the battery space, as Scott mentioned I guess in the overall comments, that's where we're seeing largest pricing appreciation, in the battery space.","So, other areas in the synthesis, in the ag chem, where we have different types of molecules, as we've discussed before, they're already priced to value. So, you're not seeing much appreciation in terms of price in other types of molecules, because you could run up against, in some cases, substitution risk, et cetera. So, we price those molecules based on the value that they're creating. In a lot of cases, those are GDP or GDP-plus markets, but not the exciting growth and high-growth segments, like energy storage. But for any kind of customer that is willing to sign up to a long-term contract, we're going to make sure that they have the right product.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thanks. The next question is from the line of Chris Kapsch at Loop Capital. Please go ahead.","Chris Kapsch - Loop Capital Markets LLC","Yeah. Good morning. I had a follow-up on this discussion around Catalyst and margins. If you look, it looks like the year-over-year margin comparisons have gotten progressively more negative for each of the first three quarters of 2017. And I understand there's some mix and timing issues and I understand there's increasing raw materials. But, at least in FCC, you and some of your competitors have talked about the entitlement to get more pricing based on the value for performance that your products deliver.","But it looks like it's been more talking about pricing than actual pricing.","And I'm just wondering if you could comment on that. One of your key competitors just announced a very explicit additional price increase. Do you have intentions to follow that? And can you just handicap the prospects of actually getting some more positive traction on the industry's narrative of getting some pricing, at least in FCCs? Thanks.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. So, I assume you are talking about our FCC plants running at high utilization rates and at the same time we're facing some inflationary pressure. As we've communicated in the past, we continue to push for higher prices for the added value that we deliver to the customer. This is on a customer-by-customer unit-by-unit effort. And we're always going to extract the value we can. So, we're certainly going look to extract that value anywhere we can.","I think you've got to be careful to look at what's going on overall at our business in 2017 as compared to 2016. Because of some of the octane standards, from an FCC standpoint, we're seeing more sales into the VGO market, which will be down, and we have some trials going on in our max propylene market. Our highest margin products in max propylene, because that brings the highest value to the refineries. So, when you see that volume decline a little bit because of these tests, you see us replace it with VGO, that's going to be lower-margin product for us. Still excellent margins, but it's going to give us lower-margin product.","If you look on the HPC side, our highest-margin product is distillates because that is the cut where we have the most experience and we have traditionally held the strongest product offering. If you've seen some of the builds that we've had this year, they've been in that resid market because you're seeing more and more resid markets coming online. So, I think what you're seeing for that overall comparison is a combination of that mix more so than anybody losing anything on price.","Chris Kapsch - Loop Capital Markets LLC","Okay. That's fair. Appreciate the mix comments. But just as a follow-up, could you talk about the handicap, the ability, for you and maybe the industry to get more affirmative pricing in FCCs just on an apples-to-apples basis on your base FCC customer sales? Thank you.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. So, I think this is consistent with what we've always said. Where we provide value to the refinery, we can get increased value. So, it is a value proposition. So, in areas where we're able to provide value to that customer and show that increased value that we're bringing them by using our catalysts so that they can increase their yields, we're able to get more of a price because it's a win-win for both of us.","In the areas where they don't need that yield enhancement or areas where they can use a less expensive catalyst to get by because they don't need the yield, then you can't get the price passed through. It's all about the value that we're contributing to the customer.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from the line of Jeff Zekauskas at JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much. I think for the nine months, your equity income was about $55 million. Is, I don't know, 75% of that Talison?","Scott A. Tozier - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah, Jeff. That's about right.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And your cash flow for the nine months was $75 million. And I guess maybe there's a $200 million drawdown because of tax payments.","Scott A. Tozier - Albemarle Corp.","That's correct.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Your working capital overall was negative $400 million. So, like normally I would expect Albemarle to throw off, I don't know, $600 million, $700 million, in cash per year. What's the normal level? And is this a really unusual year? Or because of your expansionary plans, there's a drain on working capital over a multi-year period? Can you talk about operating cash flow?","Scott A. Tozier - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah, I think there's two components to look at as you look at our operating cash flow trends. One \u2013 and you touched on both of them. The tax payment that we made on the sale of Chemetall hit in the first half of this year. That was $255 million. So that's a drag on our operating cash flow.","The second one is, with the growth in our revenue, particularly with Lithium, we're seeing an increase in working capital in the third quarter. Specifically, we also saw an increase in working capital in Refining Solutions as they're getting ready for this big fourth quarter that we've talked about. We are expecting to see working capital come down in the fourth quarter as those shipments go out. But as we continue to grow and our working capital is going to range in that 27% range, we're going to see a continued cash drag from working capital.","We do have efforts in place to start to work on reducing that rate. I do not think we'll ever be able to offset the growth that we're seeing until that starts to slow down. But, certainly, in the next several years we're going to see a drag coming from working capital.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And the dividends received from unconsolidated investments were $12 million versus $35 million in the year-ago period for the nine months. Is that reflective of the increased investment within the Talison joint venture and so there are fewer dividends that come back to you?","Scott A. Tozier - Albemarle Corp.","You got it. That's exactly right. So, as they're investing in the expansions, you're going to see that their dividend will not go up proportionately with their equity income.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your questions and participation in today's conference. This concludes the presentation, so you may now disconnect. Thanks for joining. Have a very good day."],"1428":["Albemarle Corp.

My name is Sandra, and I'm your event manager. [Operator Instruction] I'd like to advise all parties this call is being recorded for replay purposes. And now I'd like to hand over to Matt Juneau. Please go ahead.","Matthew K. Juneau - Albemarle Corp.","Thank you, and welcome to Albemarle's fourth quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Our earnings were released after the close of the market yesterday, and you'll find our press release, earnings presentation, and non-GAAP reconciliations posted on our website under the Investors section at albemarle.com.","Joining me on the call today are Luke Kissam, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Scott Tozier, Chief Financial Officer; Raphael Crawford, President, Bromine Specialties; Silvio Ghyoot, President, Refining Solutions; and John Mitchell, President, Lithium and Advanced Materials.","As a reminder, some of the statements made during this conference call about the future performance of the company may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws. Please note the cautionary language about forward-looking statements contained in our press release. That same language applies to this call.","Please also note that our comments today regarding our financial results exclude non-operating, non-recurring, and other unusual items. GAAP financial measures and reconciliations from those to the adjusted numbers discussed today may be found in our press release and page 4 in the appendix of our earnings presentation, all of which are posted on our website. Note that our GAAP numbers in both the fourth quarter and the full year were significantly impacted by the sale of the Chemetall business.","Now I'll turn the call over to Luke to summarize 2016 performance.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Thanks, Matt. In 2016, Albemarle continued its journey to becoming a high-growth specialty chemicals company focused on driving increased global energy efficiency through our leading positions in lithium and refining catalysts.","First of all, from an operations standpoint, 2016 was the safest year in company history. We had record low workdays missed due to injury, and our lowest-ever severity rating for lost-time injuries. In addition, environmental incidents at our plants were also at an all-time low. The focus on safe operations in spite of the amount of change that occurred in 2016 is a tribute to the quality and focus of our employees.","Our three core business units performed well in 2016, with each exceeding initial expectations. Adjusted EBITDA from our three GBUs increased by $96 million or 13% compared to 2015. Lithium and Refining Solutions both delivered strong double-digit adjusted EBITDA growth, 34% and 21%, respectively. Bromine adjusted EBITDA increased by 2% despite the loss of a key contract that delivered more than $15 million of adjusted EBITDA in 2015. Importantly, this marks the third consecutive year of consistent, stable results in Bromine. Full-year combined adjusted EBITDA margin for our three GBUs was 33%, up 190 basis points from 2015.","Not only did our businesses generate strong earnings; those earnings translated into strong free cash flow. Our adjusted free cash flow for 2016 was $672 million, an increase of $166 million from 2015. We also continued to focus our strategy by successfully divesting minerals and metal sulfides in early 2016 and the Chemetall Surface Treatment business in mid-December. Total net proceeds from these three transactions exceeded $3.4 billion, an aggregate multiple of 13.7 times trailing-12-month EBITDA. Our team structured these transactions to be highly tax-efficient, leading to significant cash generation for Albemarle. As a result of the strong cash generation from both operations and divestitures, we were able to reduce debt and significantly strengthen our balance sheet.","Our gross debt to EBITDA after completion of the debt tender in February stands at about 2.2 times based on full-year 2016 adjusted EBITDA. Cash on hand as of mid-February was approximately $1.4 billion. We have regained balance sheet strength and flexibility, which positions us to more quickly take advantage of opportunities to accelerate our business strategies.","We announced a dividend increase of 5% just recently in February. This marks our 23rd consecutive year of dividend increases. Our stock price increased by 54% in 2016, compared to increases of 9% and 10% for the Dow Jones Chemicals Index and the S&P 500, respectively, placing us in the top decile of performance against our industry peers. We also expect to buy back $250 million of stock in a program that will be launched in the next several days and conclude by the end of June. Finally, in 2016, we strengthened and extended our leadership position in lithium.","First, we finalized two agreements in Chile, which position us to expand our lithium carbonate production capacity there from the roughly 24,000 metric tons produced in 2016 to over 80,000 tons by 2020. In January of 2016, we secured an environmental permit that allows us to pump brine at an annual rate of over 80,000 tons of lithium carbonate equivalent annually. Then in December we reached a definitive agreement with CORFO that expands our total Lithium quota to a level that allows production at that same annual rate through the end of 2043.","Secondly, we acquired the spodumene conversion assets of Jiangxi Jiangli New Materials technology company in China and announced plans to expand these assets to a conversion capacity of 35,000 to 40,000 metric tons. These moves, along with a planned greenfield spodumene conversion plant, will increase our overall capacity of lithium salts to over 160,000 metric tons on an LCE basis by early in the next decade.","Third, on the demand side, we have now secured about 80% of both our technical and battery-grade lithium salts business under three- to five-year long-term contracts. We remain confident in both the demand growth for lithium salts and our ability to meet that growing demand. I'll discuss 2017 at the end of our prepared remarks, but clearly our 2016 financial and operational performance, combined with our portfolio actions and steps to strengthen our Lithium franchise, leave Albemarle well-positioned for another strong year in 2017.","Now I'll turn the call over to Scott.","Scott A. Tozier - Albemarle Corp.","Thanks, Luke. We ended 2016 with strong performance and great momentum for 2017. Let me give you some of the details.","In the fourth quarter, we reported adjusted net income from continuing operations of $0.78 per diluted share, a decrease of 12% compared to fourth quarter 2015, excluding the year-over-year net impact of the divested minerals and metal sulfides businesses. The decrease was driven primarily by a negative tax impact of $0.17 per share, lower Fine Chemistry Services business performance equivalent to $0.13 per share, and increased D&A and interest charges of $0.11 per share. Note that our three global business units delivered $34 million of increased adjusted EBITDA in the quarter, roughly a $0.27 per share increase compared to fourth quarter 2015.","For the full year 2016, we reported adjusted net income from continuing operations of $3.57 per diluted share. Excluding the impact of the divested businesses and a large one-time non-cash foreign exchange gain from 2015 results, earnings per diluted share increased by 20% compared to 2015, with the increase driven entirely by increased business unit performance and productivity from our synergy program. Corporate costs ended the year at just under $86 million, in line with our third quarter guidance. Our effective tax rate, excluding special items, non-operating pension, and OPEB items, ended 2016 at 20.8%, an increase from our prior guidance. The catch-up to adjust the full-year rate to 20.8% explains the increase in the fourth quarter tax rate. The increased tax rate was related to the sale of the Chemetall Surface Treatment business and currency volatility, which created taxable FX gains in certain countries.","Capital expenditures for continuing operations ended 2016 at $177 million, in line with our third quarter guidance. Note that reported capital spending in our year-end financial statements is $197 million. The delta between the two numbers represents capital spent on the divested Chemetall business. Depreciation and amortization was $191 million in 2016, also in line with third quarter guidance. At year-end, operating working capital improved to 27% compared to 29% at the end of the third quarter. All three GBUs saw strong year-end collections against receivables and effectively managed inventory in the quarter. In addition, our net payables increased as capital spending began ramping up to support our Lithium growth. Luke has already noted that our adjusted free cash flow increased by $166 million in 2016. Even more impressive was the increase in net cash from operations from $361 million in 2015 to a record $733 million in 2016, driven by the performance of our businesses and a meaningful reduction in working capital.","Now let me turn to business unit performance for both the fourth quarter and the full year. Lithium and Advanced Materials had another strong quarter, led by the Lithium business. Fourth quarter net sales of $278 million increased by 30% compared to fourth quarter 2015. Similarly, adjusted EBITDA of $102 million was 32% higher than fourth quarter 2015. Adjusted EBITDA margins were a strong 37%. For the full year, sales of $968 million and adjusted EBITDA of $363 million both increased by 16% compared to 2015.","The Lithium portfolio continued to drive GB results in the fourth quarter, just as it did in the previous three. Fourth quarter net sales were up 50%, and adjusted EBITDA was up 56% compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. Adjusted EBITDA margins were 43%, marking eight consecutive quarters with margins above 40%. For all of 2016, Lithium sales increased by 31%, and adjusted EBITDA by 34%, with adjusted EBITDA margins of 43%. Volume growth for 2016 was an impressive 18%, with pricing improving by 14%. Essentially all the volume growth and most of the pricing improvement was driven by battery-grade products.","Compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, PCS sales were down just under $5 million, and adjusted EBITDA was down $7 million. Full-year adjusted EBITDA ended 2016 down $22 million. Continued competitive challenges that impacted both our organometallics and catalyst businesses and an operational issue at one of our catalyst manufacturing sites led to weaker-than-expected results in the fourth quarter. Full-year results compared to 2016 were impacted by the fourth quarter issues, the SunEdison bankruptcy, and increased competition in our Curatives business as a competitor returned to full production after an extended outage in 2015.","Bromine Specialties' fourth quarter sales of $195 million and adjusted EBITDA of $47 million were up by 13% and 11% respectively, compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. For the full year, sales of $792 million and adjusted EBITDA of $227 million were both up by 2% compared to 2015. Full-year adjusted EBITDA margins of 29% were the same as in 2015. We saw incremental improvement in our flame retardants business and better-than-expected demand in our clear brine fluids business in 2016. Strong cost management and productivity improvements were also important contributors to full-year performance.","Refining Solutions reported fourth quarter net sales of $193 million and adjusted EBITDA of $57 million, resulting in adjusted EBITDA margins of 30%. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2015, sales were down 4% and adjusted EBITDA was up 9%. Full-year Refining Solutions sales of $732 million were essentially flat compared to 2015. Adjusted EBITDA was $239 million, an increase of 21% from 2015.","Heavy Oil Upgrading or FCC catalysts performed as expected in 2016, with adjusted EBITDA essentially flat compared to the record year seen in 2015. Clean Fuels Technologies or HPC catalyst significantly exceeded our initial 2016 expectations and drove overall business unit adjusted EBITDA improvement throughout the year. The Clean Fuels business benefited from both improved volumes and product mix, as we saw more typical buying patterns at refiners after a difficult 2015.","Now I'll turn to 2017. I'll frame the balance sheet items and foreign exchange, and then Luke will cover the business and overall company forecast. We currently expect our effective tax rate, excluding special items, non-operating pension, and OPEB items, to be approximately 22% in 2017. As always, the rate can be impacted by changes in tax regulations around the world and by the regional mix of both sales and production, which almost never plays out exactly as budgeted.","You should expect capital spending to increase significantly in 2017 compared to 2016. We will ramp up spending from La Negra 3, our third lithium carbonate plant in Chile planned for early 2020 startup, and begin the 20,000 to 25,000 metric ton expansion of the Jiangxi Jiangli conversion assets in China. As a result, you can expect capital to increase to $350 million to $400 million in 2017, with Lithium growth capital driving most of the increase. Our maintenance and continuity capital spend continues to be well-controlled and is again expected to be within our guidance range of 4% to 6% of revenues for all businesses.","Depreciation and amortization is expected to range from $175 million to $195 million in 2017. Corporate costs are expected to be between $85 million and $95 million. And note that the Lithium business will see additional costs in 2017 to position us for sustained growth over the next decade. The royalties for the expanded and extended quota in Chile, additional personnel costs, and expenses related to the evaluation and development of potential new lithium resources will result in $60 million to $70 million of new costs in 2017 in that GBU.","Given the margin profile and growth expectations of our businesses, we expect to continue our history of strong cash flow generation from operations in 2017. However, working capital, which was a source of cash flow in 2016, is expected to use cash in 2017. Operating working capital should remain at about 27% of revenue, but business growth, production timing, and the impact of certain strategic projects should lead to an increase in absolute dollars of working capital in 2017. The major increase in capital expenditures to capture growth in Lithium will also impact free cash flow. Adjusted free cash flow is forecasted to be $200 million to $300 million in 2017. But reported free cash flow will be negatively impacted by a few one-time expenses. The largest of these are tax payments of approximately $275 million related to the divestiture of the Chemetall business.","Finally, estimating the risk of foreign exchange movements is always challenging and seems even more so in the current global environment. Our 2017 guidance is based on an average U.S. dollar to euro exchange rate of $1.06 and an average Japanese yen to U.S. dollar exchange rate of \u00a5115. We estimate that every $0.01 move of the U.S. dollar against the euro and every \u00a51 move against the U.S. dollar will impact adjusted EBITDA by $1.5 million to $2.5 million for the euro and $0.5 million to $1 million for the yen, respectively, on an annual basis.","Now I'll turn the call back over to Luke to discuss overall expectations for 2017.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Thanks, Scott. In 2016, Albemarle met or exceeded our financial, strategic, and operational targets. The 2016 performance has positioned Albemarle for another outstanding year in 2017. Based on the assumptions outlined by Scott, we expect 2017 net sales to be in the range of $2.8 billion to $2.95 billion, adjusted EBITDA of $800 million to $840 million, and adjusted earnings per share between $4 and $4.25. We currently forecast earnings to be somewhat strong in the second half of the year compared to the first, primarily due to expected timing of volumes in Refining Solutions. Even with the $60 million to $70 million of additional expenses in Lithium, our forecasted 2017 adjusted EBITDA range represents an increase of 6% to 11% versus 2016. The forecast results in adjusted EBITDA margins of 28% to 29%, an increase of about 20 basis points from 2016 at the midpoint of this range.","Turning to each of our businesses. We expect another very strong year of earnings growth in Lithium, with adjusted EBITDA increase of greater than 20%. Adjusted EBITDA margins are again expected to average greater than 40%. Volumes are forecasted to grow by about 10,000 metric tons, driven by an expected increase of about 40% in battery-grade salts. We also continue to see favorable pricing trends with overall pricings in Lithium forecasted to increase by 10% to 15% relative to 2016. We expect to stabilize the PCS business at adjusted EBITDA levels similar to 2016. We have additional headwinds related to the SunEdison bankruptcy, but are countering those with actions to improve productivity of our asset and reduce our operating costs. While the overall market outlook is for 3% to 4% volume growth, the competitive environment in certain product areas remains challenging.","Refining Solutions should deliver adjusted EBITDA growth of a few percent compared to 2016. Heavy Oil Upgrading demand continues to be strong, but the combination of turnarounds at our customers and competitive trials will have some negative volume impact, especially in the first half of 2017. We also expect the improved demand and mix in Clean Fuels Technologies that we saw in 2016 to continue into 2017. However, the magnitude of that improvement will be significantly less than we saw in 2016. As already noted, we currently forecast a stronger second half of the year in Refining Solutions, but as always, timing of change-out in Clean Fuels Technologies could impact those actual results.","After a better-than-expected 2016, we expect Bromine to perform at similar levels in 2017. Modest demand growth in flame retardants and cost management should allow us to counter uncertain demand for clear brine fluids, cost pressures in certain raw materials, and weakness in products sold into the ag markets.","In closing, we delivered on all of our key commitments in 2016 and continued the transformation of Albemarle into a highly focused, high-margin company with strong growth prospects. In 2017, we expect to deliver strong earnings growth, led by Lithium business, and to position the company for continued outsized growth in the years to come.","Matthew K. Juneau - Albemarle Corp.","Operator, we are ready to open the lines for Q&A. But before you do so, I would remind everyone to please limit your questions to two per person at one time so that everyone has a chance to ask questions. Then feel free to get back in the queue for follow-ups if time allows. Please proceed.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, your question and answer session will now begin. Okay, we have some questions for you. Apologies for pronunciation. First name is David Begleiter, and from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. You're live in the call.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning. Luke, on 2017, on lithium pricing, could you give a little bit more detail on just the battery grade pricing, how it ended in Q4, and what you're expecting for battery grade only in 2017?","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. I'm going to turn that over to John.","John Mitchell - Albemarle Corp.","Hi, David. This is John. When we look at Q4 2016 versus 2015, the growth has come from about 50% volume, 50% price. As Luke mentioned earlier, going into 2017, we're looking across the portfolio, not just battery grade, of increase in pricing from about 10% to 15% in price. However, when you look at the volume, most of the volume growth, that 10,000 metric tons that Luke mentioned, is going to be skewed towards the battery grade side as well. So a lot of the pricing is coming on the battery grade side.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And, John, can you just comment on what you're seeing demand-wise early in 2017, especially in China for battery-grade lithium?","John Mitchell - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. So we've historically said that the demand for battery grade is driven by automotive penetration rates for battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids. Our model shows that to get to a 2% penetration rate by 2021, the overall global demand is about 20,000 metric tons per year. We've seen the market tracking to that. We know that there have been some recent announcements in China about updating of policies; that was expected. We see continued strong demand out of China. And we don't see the demand profile changing much based on our expectations for 2017, and see about that 20,000 metric ton growth overall for global demand. We do see acceleration in terms of new models of cars, as well as areas like electric buses also driving growth.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question \u2013 apologies again for pronunciation \u2013 this one's from Alex Yefremov. He's from Nomura Instinet. Please go ahead. You're live in the call.","Aleksey Yefremov - Nomura Instinet","Hi. Good morning. Thank you. Could you provide us your expectations for the ramp of volumes at La Negra this year? At what point should we see some additional tonnage? And also what has been your operational experience so far with this expansion?","John Mitchell - Albemarle Corp.","So we're planning for approximately 10,000 metric tons of overall volume growth coming basically from the lithium salts. It'll come from a combination of the La Negra ramp-up, as well as hard rock to salt conversion in our new assets in China. We have two assets that came with that China acquisition. One is in Xinyu city and the other in Chengdu. The Xinyu city operation can be ramped up more than it operated in the past. So it'll be about a 60\/40 or 70\/30 split, more heavily weighted toward La Negra, and we're ramping up capacity to meet the needs of our customer agreement. So we want to make sure that we're living up to our commitments, and that's that customers that have signed long-term agreements with us have the products that they need to grow. So we'll be able to meet their demands.","Aleksey Yefremov - Nomura Instinet","Great, thank you. And question on CapEx, a little bit longer term, would you expect your CapEx to continue to increase in 2018 from 2017 level as you kind of ramp your Lithium expansion activity?","Scott A. Tozier - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah, Alex. This is Scott. So we expect a slight increase going into 2018, and probably right now, in the five-year view, you'll peak in the 2019 perspective from timing, really driven by the new greenfield spodumene conversion plant that we're looking at and the timing of exactly when that spend is. And that's still in the design phase, so it's kind of hard to know. But that's what we're expecting right now.","Aleksey Yefremov - Nomura Instinet","All right. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. We have another question for you; again, apologies for pronunciation. This one is from Robert Koort, and he's from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. You're live in the call.","Robert A. Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. John, I was hoping you might be able to answer a question about the challenges of bringing this capacity on. It seems like I remember Rockwood years ago talking about La Negra, too, and maybe there was a delay and some other issues. But can you talk about the actual physical process or unit operations to get it into production? I read one of the start-up competitors has been having problems. What is it that makes it so challenging? As an incumbent producer, should this give you an advantage, or is there something unique about each plant that makes its own challenges?","John Mitchell - Albemarle Corp.","Bob, this is John. First off, you have to look at both the resource side and then the conversion side, and the plants do have to be designed in a way to be able to handle the incoming \u2013 whether it's a brine concentrate or ore concentrate. And the characteristics of that brine concentrate or ore concentrate can change. So there is some design consideration to be given to where the resource is coming from. Second, you have to design a plant to be able to meet a customer's specification. So we look at the cross-section of customers that will be supplied from a derivative plant, and we have to make sure that that plant can actually meet a tailored specification. And these are not commodity-based plants; these are performance product plants. And then these plants have to actually go through a fairly rigorous qualification process.","And so it is challenging. It's challenging even for a company like Albemarle that has hundreds of scientists and hundreds of engineers to be able to meet an evolving product specification that has to withstand the test of 10 years of battery performance. And so getting it right, making sure that those products are consistent, not just from a chemical and purity perspective, but there are a lot of physical characteristics around crystal structure and particle size distribution. So it's a complex product, it's a complex molecule, and it's evolving. And it's evolving every year as battery companies are looking to improve the performance of the batteries.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah, Bob. This is Luke. What I would say is that gives companies like Albemarle, like SQM, I think an advantage over the others that you may read about coming into the marketplace, because we have a long history with that, we've got experience with it, and we also have the relationships with the customers to understand what that spec is going to be, not just when we bring the plant online but over the next decade. So we design for that. We're going to be patient, and we're going to work to bring it online in the proper way for the sustainability long term of this Lithium business.","Robert A. Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And for my follow-up, if I could, Jiangli, you mentioned there's some head space to increasing production. I'm curious, as you got into the assets and took a look around, is there a need for a boost in CapEx to improve maintenance? Or was their inability to meet full capacity, a raw material issue? Give us some assessment of what you've seen at Jiangli.","John Mitchell - Albemarle Corp.","So, Bob, this is John. First off, we had a longstanding relationship with those sites. So we had good insight in terms of the quality of the assets, the quality of the people. Certainly, Albemarle has a very high standard in terms of safety, in terms of process design. So we are investing in those assets. But that was always part of the business case in terms of that acquisition. We understood the fact that those assets did have headroom, and we're doing a couple things. We are in the process of ramping up. We're making sure that that product is qualified with our customers that are under long-term agreement, and we're improving the safety standards and the reliability of the facility. At the same time, as we've already previously announced, we're adding another train that will expand our Xinyu facility from 10,000 metric tons to 35,000 metric tons.","So there's a lot of work going on there. That work actually started many months ago. So we're really excited about that operation. It's going to have great quality product, battery-grade product. Our customers are going to be excited about it. And everything's going really well. Thanks.","Robert A. Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We have another question for you. This one's from Vincent Andrews, Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. You're live in the call.","Vincent S. Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks and good morning, everyone. Just wondering if you can give us a bit of an update on your volumetric mix in Lithium between battery grade and standard grade. And just sort of maybe some modeling guidance on how that's going to evolve through 2017.","John Mitchell - Albemarle Corp.","Okay. So this is John again. As I said earlier, the growth is mainly being driven by energy storage, particularly in the transportation space. And as we look at 2017, we're crossing the 40% threshold, where 40% of our LC demand is going to be going into the battery space.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Vincent, as you look \u2013 going forward the bulk, if not all \u2013 but I hate to say all because that's so definitive. But the bulk of all the growth is in the battery space, okay?","Vincent S. Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you. And then just as follow-up, there's a lot of conversion about China in regards to production reform in a variety of different industries within and outside of chemicals. Are you hearing any conversations about their bromine assets and any changes from a policy perspective there?","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. I'm going to turn that over to Raphael Crawford.","Raphael Crawford - Albemarle Corp.","Vincent, this is Raphael. So, from a China perspective, we keep a close watch on the China market. There certainly are regulatory changes which have affected production among Chinese producers over the last 18 months. Most notably, there's been some regulations that came out that restricted production around the G20 summit. There's a new resource tax that's affected Chinese production. So there's been a series of regulatory pieces, but I think that in China the bigger driver of change within bromine availability in the local market is coming from the degradation of the bromine resources, which we think over the last 18 months has started to decline again after a period of stability for several years prior. So we believe that's probably a bigger impact, Vincent, going forward than the regulatory impact in China.","Vincent S. Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Very helpful. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Next question \u2013 apologies again for pronunciation \u2013 P.J. Juvekar, and he's from Citigroup. Please go ahead. You're live in the call.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Yes. Hi. Good morning.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Hey, P.J.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","So lithium is a small part of the battery cost; I think it's less than 5%. If that's true, then why not take some more pricing on lithium if it's not going to impact the battery demand, or are you concerned about attracting more supply to the market?","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. So from a standpoint of what we're trying to do in Lithium \u2013 we've talked about this before. We're trying very hard to balance volume and price. We're doing that in a way \u2013 and I think your numbers are accurate on the cost of lithium carbonate in a battery. But we also understand that this is a long-term sustainable play. Our customers are being asked to reduce prices every day to drive down the costs of batteries, and we are also \u2013 we're at 40% margins with great growth, both from a volume standpoint and from a price standpoint. Our shareholders are getting an excellent return on that business. We're working with our customers, and we're at the infancy of an industry that we're really trying to be a leader in, and we believe that the approach that we are taking is the most sustainable and thoughtful approach, both for today and in the long term. We've clearly articulated that with our shareholders as well as our customers, and we plan to stick to that path.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you for that. And then let's talk about supply in lithium. There are two new mines coming online in Australia. You've talked about the challenges of bringing on new capacity, and then, on your Talison also, you talked about expanding that in the future. So just talk about supply a little bit.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","I'm going to let John talk to you about that, P.J.","John Mitchell - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. Hi. P.J., it's John. As we look at 2017, there are a couple sources aside from Albemarle bringing on capacity. You have the continued ramp-up of the Argentinian brine source and Orocobre; that will continue to contribute some incremental tons into the market. You have two Australian hard rock mines that are really exporting ore concentrate of different quality and standards into the Chinese market for conversion into various tech grade and maybe low-grade battery salt products for the Chinese market. The combination of the Australian mines and the conversion capacity in China, the Argentinian source kind of ramping up, and Albemarle will certainly be able to cover the demand for 2017. And our view through 2020-2021 is that the market will continue to remain in balance. There are certainly projects in addition to the ones that Albemarle are bringing on that will come on. We have a good view of those, and we think that the market will remain in balance through the midterm.","With regard to our Talison mine in Greenbushes, Australia, that mine is really extraordinary in terms of ore quality and scale. It is the best ore quality in the world. It is the largest resource in the world. And we have the ability to double the capacity of that mine. We're in dialogue with our joint venture partner, and we'll make the final decision on the timing of the mine expansion. But just to give you an idea of the scale of that operation, it has the potential to be able to provide 160,000 metric tons of LCEs into the marketplace -just one mine in a global market that today is about 190,000 metric tons. And it has the best ore quality in the world and the lowest cost structure. So we're really excited about Greenbushes, and you should be hearing some good stuff from us and our joint venture partner shortly about the expansion.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you for your detailed answer.","Operator","Thank you. We have another question for you. This one's from Kevin McCarthy from Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead. You're live in the call.","Kevin McCarthy - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Yes. Good morning. I think you had indicated new costs in the Lithium business in a range of $60 million to $70 million. Is that meant to represent your expected royalty payment, or are there other new costs embedded in there? And if so would you comment on what the likely split might be?","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. We've said previously when we did the royalty that the royalty would be less than $50 million in 2017. That's still accurate. We have additional costs related to personnel, as well as expenses that'll hit our P&L as it relates to testing and development of new resources to bring on into the future. So it's the same split as what we've always said, Kevin.","Kevin McCarthy - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Excellent. And then as a follow-up, you've been busy signing your Lithium customers up to three- to five-year contracts, now 80% I think for the combination of technical and battery grade. Would you comment on pricing, risk, and opportunity as it relates to those contracts? For example, if we were to see a downturn in pricing at some point over the life of these contracts, do your customers typically have MFN provisions that would allow them to ask Albemarle to meet or release a lower price? What is the price risk or lack thereof that you foresee over that period?","John Mitchell - Albemarle Corp.","Hi. This is John. So each individual contract is negotiated separately. But in broad strokes, our agreements have a pricing provision that essentially provides us a floor for pricing. So, in the event someone were to knock on our customer's door and say, hey, we have a great bargain basement price for a lithium salt, the customers cannot come back to us with a meet comp where we would have to reduce our prices. There are, in some cases, fixed and variable portions of pricing, and it does give us some flexibility to adjust prices with market. But, as Luke said, we're taking a long-term view. We really value the partnerships with the customers. We feel that there's an opportunity to collaborate on the next-generation advanced materials and performance materials that are going to go into this space and working together to bring energy storage to the transportation segment and making the grid more efficient. But we do have good protection in terms of the downside and some good opportunities to move prices up if we feel the market warrants it and it's appropriate.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. Kevin, we get a lot of questions about the specifics of the contracts, and I'd caution everyone on the call not to get too caught up on the specifics of what we may be able to do with one contract or another contract. What this does give us, though, is confidence in filling the assets for the capital that we are spending over the next three to five years. It gives us the confidence that we will have volume to be able to run through those facilities. We feel like we picked the right customers. We also feel as though the pricing is such that we'll be able to maintain that 40% margin, which has been a target that we've talked about, and at the same time will allow us to get a significant and continuing improving return on the capital that we're going to invest. So it's all a part of the capital plan to grow our overall market and meet that customer demand.","Kevin McCarthy - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Thanks. I appreciate the color.","Operator","Thank you. We have another question for you. This one's from Jim Sheehan at SunTrust. Please go ahead. You're live in the call.","James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Good morning. You mentioned for uses of cash a possible share buyback, so just wondering if you could discuss maybe what your intentions are for reducing the share count in 2017 and any cadence of any share buyback activity?","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Sure. Scott?","Scott A. Tozier - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. Thanks, Jim. Right now, in our guidance, we've assumed a $250 million share buyback. And depending on what the stock price would be on that, obviously that would drive the share count. But in our guidance, we've assumed that we have a 2 million share reduction in our average shares in that EPS guidance. So you'll see an announcement here shortly, in the next day or so, around that share buyback, as we've done in the past, but we'll be using accelerated share repurchase in order to do that and should be completed by the end of the second quarter or so.","James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Great. And in Refining Solutions, you mentioned some headwinds in raw material costs. Could you give some more color on what exactly you're experiencing there and how long you expect that headwind to persist?","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. I'm going to ask Silvio Ghyoot to take that question.","Silvio Ghyoot - Albemarle Corp.","Thank you. Well, in general we're coming out of period where we have maybe had favorable tailwinds with the raw materials. So utilities, some of the basic raw materials, seem to be trending up these days, and obviously that makes a small difference so far versus last year. Also there have been some action by the Chinese authorities to get somewhat better organized with the output of the rivers (48:02) out of China, so that may cause an additional headwind. These are the major ones I was referring to.","James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We have another question for you. Apologies again for pronunciation. This one's from Dmitry Silversteyn from Longbow Research. Please go ahead. You're live on the call.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the call. I'll make this really quick. A couple of things. First of all, on the strength in bromine in the fourth quarter, you talked about sort of a little bit flattish expectations for 2017, but obviously 2016 was a better year than perhaps we could have expected. Was the fourth quarter strong performance, was that just driven by the electronic markets, or was it better drilling fluids, perhaps not going down as much? Can you talk a little bit about the bromine market in the fourth quarter and also your kind of outlook for 2017?","Raphael Crawford - Albemarle Corp.","Sure, Dmitry. This is Raphael. So in the fourth quarter the strength that we saw relative to what we had guided to for the fourth quarter was really driven by, as you had mentioned, some strength in the electronics market as it relates to flame retardants. I think what we've seen over the last year is really the diversification of the end of markets for flame retardant is now providing some stability to a market that was once more volatile because of the rise and fall of TVs and laptops. And now with more flame retardant usage in automotive and servers, we're starting to see a regain of strength within flame retardants, which give us confidence that we'll have a market that is flat to growing slightly going forward, and we saw some of that resurgence of strength within flame retardants in the fourth quarter. Also in the fourth quarter, we had additional sales of hydrogen bromide and some of our amines into China. So that was some additional strength versus what we had expected. And overall been working very hard over the past year, as we always have, in bromine on cost management. So that's really what contributed to the beat in the fourth quarter.","Going forward, I think we continue that outlook on stable to slightly growing flame retardant market. We think that the completion fluids market \u2013 that's the drilling end market \u2013 that flattened \u2013 that sort of bottomed out. We should see stability generally flat in 2017. And overall we'll continue to work on our cost-out and efficiency programs within bromine, which leads us to believe that will continue to be a good cash generator year over year for the company.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Got it. Thank you for that level of detail. And then as a follow-up, when you look at your input costs, the one metal that seems to have gone up about 25% here in the first quarter year over year is molybdenum. Is that a concern for you yet, or you'll be able to get those pricing through very quickly, or is it just sort of a normal volatility in the metals that you kind of got to ignore until it gets out of hand?","Silvio Ghyoot - Albemarle Corp.","Well, the moly price has been locked in. You may remember this; last year we had a floor of moly, $10 throughout the industry. But what we do see is that the moly price is ramping up gradually as we go forward and it starts to meet (51:53) that level of $10 per pound.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","So I think, at the end of the day, we'll see an increase in moly, not all of which will be passed through in 2017. And that is included within the estimates that we provided, Dmitry.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Okay, okay. So you're expecting a little bit of a headwind, but that's part of your guidance and hopefully it'll get the price momentum going for you guys?","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","That's exactly right. Now, if it goes higher than what's in our forecast, we're going to have to adjust and deal with that, but the way you described it is accurate.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. Thanks a lot. That's all I have.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Thanks, man.","Operator","Thank you. We have another question. And this one's from Mike Sison, KeyBanc. Please go ahead. You're live in the call.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hey, guys. Nice end to the year there. Hey, when you think about the 160,000 metric tons of LCE capacity by 2020, in total, how much is it going to cost you to get there? And I guess the returns would be pretty impressive. Can you share any thoughts there?","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","I mean, what we've said is it's going to be around $1 billion for us to spend between now and 2021, that kind of range, to get to that LCE, both with respect to the conversion assets, as well as what we have to do in the Salar. And as we've always stated, we look to get 2x our cost of capital, and this will be significantly higher. So these will be great return projects \u2013 if the demand holds, and we have no reason to believe that that demand is not going to hold.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Great. And then just a quick follow-up. Clearly, when you think about the end market exposure by 2021, if you do the math, it looks like you'll be, whatever, 80%, 90% battery grade. What's the EV penetration that you think needs to occur to sort of support the demand out that far?","John Mitchell - Albemarle Corp.","This is John. So, in order to be able to support the 160,000 metric tons of supply that we're bringing on by 2020-2021 timeframe, we only have modeled 2% penetration of battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. We have another question. Again, apologies for pronunciation. Arun Viswanathan from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. You're live in the call.","Daniel DiCicco - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi. This is Dan DiCicco on for Arun. Thank you for taking my question. Just looking beyond 2017, if we see that 20,000 metric tons of annual demand growth in lithium continue to play out, is that 10% to 15% pricing growth number you guys mentioned for 2017 a reasonable assumption going forward, or would we need to see accelerated demand growth to sustain those increases?","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. I think it's too early for us to talk about what price is going to be in 2018. We focused on 2017 today. What I will say is if you look, as we fill up these assets, our per-unit cost will continue to drive down, drive to a lower per-unit cost. And as a result, we're very confident, based on the price and our cost improvement, that we'll be able to maintain those kind of 40%-plus margins for the foreseeable future in Lithium.","Daniel DiCicco - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great, thanks. And then just for a follow-up, you mentioned underlying volume growth in the PCS business for 2017. Just what's driving that?","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Polyethylene and polypropylene demand.","Daniel DiCicco - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Is that the new capacity coming on? Or is that just -","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yes.","Daniel DiCicco - RBC Capital Markets LLC","\u2013 demand in general?","Daniel DiCicco - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Great, thank you.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah, if you look at the demand coming on around the U.S. Gulf Coast or these ethylene crackers they're bringing on and what's happening in Asia and other areas of the world, the Middle East, we expect that you're going to see that type of demand growth, and that's really from third parties that are estimating that growth. And we see it consistent when we talk to our customers.","Daniel DiCicco - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We have another question and this one's from Mike Harrison at Seaport Global Securities. Please go ahead. You're live in the call.","Michael J. Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Hey.","Michael J. Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Luke, I was hoping you could give maybe a post-mortem on the new lithium agreement in Chile. Obviously, the overarching goal down there was to extend and expand your extraction rights there, which you were successful on. But can you talk about how that royalty structure and maybe some other components of the deal played out relative to your expectations?","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. I mean, we had a long discussion and an approval process that we had to go through, and the thing I'd say is that none of the material terms changed from January, February of 2016 till December of 2016, when it was just finally signed. So we had a long runway to get over the finish line. But the material terms were always consistent. They never changed. Dollars may have moved around a little bit, but the total dollars stayed the same in the commitment. So, look, it took a while to go through that process. We were the first ones to go through it, but couldn't be happier with the deal that we got down there, and the ability to ensure the long-term sustainability of the greatest lithium resource in the world for Albemarle.","Michael J. Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","And then just looking over at the Catalyst business, you noted the mix improvement that happened in the fourth quarter. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing there and also comment on what you're seeing in terms of the pricing environment on the FCC side of the business?","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. I'll turn that over to Silvio.","Silvio Ghyoot - Albemarle Corp.","Thank you. First question, the mix improvement is always hard to predict at the end, so which changes will occur in a specific quarter. So there is no structural or no seasonal trends in there, so it's just a fact that some orders may have larger volumes, less profitable products, and another quarter may have much smaller volumes and more profitable products. And the fourth quarter has been one where we have a reasonable size of hydrotreating business, though less favorable than we have had in other quarters, combined with still a strong HOU or FCC business, which gives that resultant average margin over the four quarters.","With regards to the pricing on the FCC, you know this is an overhaul design. It will take a while before we get this fully implemented. 2017 will be a year where we will be \u2013 keep on working on the implementation of this price increase. However, we think that we will see some of the trial effects through our pricing that ultimately the 2017 pricing will show more the effect of the blending of businesses rather than the effect of the pure price increase.","Operator","Thank you.

I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Lorin Crenshaw, Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed.","Lorin Crenshaw","Thank you, Lacey, and welcome, everyone, to Albemarle's Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. Our earnings were released after the close of the market yesterday and you'll find our press release, earnings presentation and non-GAAP reconciliations posted on our website under the Investors section at albemarle.com.","Joining me on the call today are Luke Kissam, Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Tozier, Chief Financial Officer.","As a reminder, some of the statements made during this conference call about the future performance of the company may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws.

Kissam","Thanks, Lorin, and good morning, everyone. Scott and I appreciate the opportunity to share Albemarle's third quarter results with you today. As usual, at the end of our prepared remarks, we'll open it up for your questions.","Throughout the year, we've expressed the view that the second half profitability would be stronger than the first half of 2013. In line with our expectations, third quarter earnings were sequentially higher and the highest we've reported year-to-date. We ended the period with net income of $89 million, or $1.09 per share, and net sales of $649 million. EBITDA was $153 million and profitability, as measured by EBITDA margins, was 24%. Our operations continue to generate excellent cash flow with $318 million of cash from operations being generated through the end of the third quarter. Scott will go into more detail shortly about each segment. But at a high level, Catalysts showed sequential improvement and is poised to finish the year strong. Fine Chemistry results were also up sequentially with custom services strengthening sequentially and clear brine volumes staying strong. In Polymers, while results were in line with expectations, they remain below the inherent earnings potential of this business as we continue to see weak demand in European construction and global electronics, particularly television enclosures. Stabilizers and Curatives was a bright spot, reflecting successful efforts to drive geographic expansion of that business.","During the third quarter, we announced a business restructuring that is designed to reduce management layers to speed decision-making, increase customer focus and enhance innovation, all designed to accelerate growth. The new structure will be effective January 1, 2014, and I'd like to take a moment to provide the context behind why we're making these changes.","Albemarle has, and continues today, to focus on creating sustainable long-term value for its shareholders. The value of our company, including dividends, has risen 425% over the past decade compared with 216% for the S&P Chemicals and 100% for the S&P 500.","The core competencies that have driven the success in our core businesses are chemical process innovation and strategic product management. By chemical process innovation, we mean the ability to bring complex products to market faster and at lower costs than our competitors. This capability is most clearly embodied in our Fine Chemicals Services division but is actually an essential part of the DNA of the entire company with many examples across our bromine and catalysts franchises.","Strategic product management relates to the fact that, over time, we have been successful in understanding customer performance requirements, delivering products that meet those requirements and pricing for the value of the products we provide the customer.","Refocusing on these core competencies and applying it to our core businesses will fuel our future growth and enable us to increase value to all our stakeholders.","Since 2005, bromine and catalysts results have accounted for, on average, 70% to 80% of our annual gross profit. It is logical that our organizational structure, strategy and resources be focused on protecting and growing these 2 core businesses. The new structure positions us to do that by aligning our assets under 2 Global Business Units with a stronger customer and market focus in the divisions within each GBU.","The Performance Chemicals GBU will include Fire Safety Solutions, Specialty Chemicals and Fine Chemistry Services, consolidating the company's bromine, mineral and custom manufacturing assets. The Catalyst Solutions GBU will include Refinery Catalysts Solutions, Performance Catalyst Solutions and Antioxidants, consolidating our assets focused on the refining and petrochemical industry and combining antioxidants and polymer catalysts under 1 GBU with the goal of increasing sales synergies of these products into the polyolefin marketplace.","As we look to the future, our growth strategy will be focused on developing and commercializing new applications for bromine, protecting and growing our flame retardants business and protecting and expanding our Catalysts business into new markets. This business reorganization is consistent with that strategy.","To grow our bromine franchise substantially over time, we must grow the pie by developing new applications. I don't mean incremental innovations like the next new bromine and flame retardant or biocide, although we are working on those as well. I mean breakthrough innovations that create new uses for bromine and solve new challenges for existing or new customers.","As we shared on the last quarterly earnings call, our bromine task force is at the core of this effort. Additional resources to be directed to this effort as part of our restructuring should accelerate the achievement of key milestones on the journey to commercialization of these new bromine applications. Of course, the stepped up focus on investments in R&D will take time to pay off. In the short run, we will continue to maximize the value of our existing bromine derivatives portfolio through line extensions and to new end markets and continued incremental innovations. In the long run, we expect our focus on developing breakthrough innovations to drive meaningful new sources of growth.","Our strategy for growing our Catalysts business over time is by defending, protecting and building upon our strong existing positions in Refinery Catalysts and organometallics and pushing into adjacent areas that leverage our existing capabilities. A number of megatrends bode well for the long-term demand for refinery and polyolefin catalysts.","In polyolefin catalysts, we intend to drive growth by leveraging our new facilities in Saudi Arabia and Korea to capture growth in the Middle East and Asia and free up U.S. production capacity to capture more than our fair share of sales to the Gulf Coast ethylene and derivative production capacity projected to come online over the next 5 to 6 years. We also plan to move downstream in finished catalysts and establish a meaningful position in the electronic materials market with our PureGrowth line of high purity metal organic products.","With regard to our PureGrowth family of products. During the quarter, we closed on a small but strategic acquisition of Cambridge Chemical Company. Based in the United Kingdom, Cambridge developed a proprietary technology for the production of certain high purity metal organic chemicals used in the laser market. Adding Cambridge's technology and products to Albemarle's current product offering now gives Albemarle the total product portfolio necessary to service electronic materials market, including the LED, semiconductor, OLED and laser segments. We also expect to benefit from R&D collaborations as we integrate this asset.","To maintain the competitive advantage in the Refinery Catalyst business, it is essential to have an intimate understanding of the refiner's needs and introduce new products on a timely basis that help them maintain or increase their profitability. This is particularly true amidst changes in the crude slates and overall refinery operating environment.","As North America's oil production has been reenergized with the advent of tight oil, our R&D and technical service teams have successfully utilized our high throughput experimentation processes to deliver highly tailored solutions to customers seeking to integrate tight oil into their refineries and FCC units. Specifically, our UPGRADER T and AMBER T catalyst solutions for tight oil were launched earlier this year and are establishing themselves as among the most effective solutions to deal with the unique contaminants prevalent in the tight oil being processed by our customers. In addition, we continue to focus on technical improvements to our FCC catalysts to address the needs of refineries refining heavy resid crude slates across the globe. We are the preferred supplier of catalysts for heavy resid feeds and our technical innovations should allow us to remain so.","Within our Clean Fuels Technologies division for ultra-low sulfur diesel application where refiners are looking to lower their fill costs without losing activity levels, we have recently launched a new product, KF 758, with lower density and higher metals activity to meet that need. In addition, within cat feed hydrotreating application, which is the hydrotreating unit before the FCC unit, we are launching 2 new products in view of the introduction of the tighter gasoline specifications to be implemented in the U.S. in 2017. These products provide for improved denitrification and desulfurization, both of which allow refiners to meet these increasingly stringent regulatory requirements and maintain their profitability. While neither will result in a step change for volume or profitability, it does demonstrate our capability to meet the need for constant innovation in this business.","Finally, as you know, in order to capture our fair share of the market for nonhalogenated flame retardants, Albemarle developed a unique phosphorus-based product, Gemini, that delivers superior electrical properties and heat resistance in printed wiring boards used in mobile and cloud computing applications. In the third quarter, we had some limited commercial sales into high-end printed wiring board applications. In addition to printed wiring boards, we believe Gemini can be used in specialty films, fibers and wire and cable applications and we are optimistic about the long-term potential of these exciting new products.","These are the types of innovations that are necessary to meet the ever-changing needs of our customers. As we restructure our business and organization, we are looking to both increase the number of these types of innovations and shorten the time to market. We will do this by increasing customer focus, enhancing resources dedicated to innovation and capitalizing on operational efficiencies. These actions should accelerate our growth and ultimately increase shareholder value.","Here's why we think this is achievable: as previously discussed, the restructuring aligns our assets, business and resources with our strategy. Second, it provides clear accountability to the GBU to grow their businesses. Different from the functional matrix under which we currently operate, most functions will now report directly to the GBU leader from R&D, process development and sales to manufacturing and strategic sourcing. Third, it provides for a leaner management structure, which should drive 2 primary results: quicker decision-making and lower G&A spending. However, this is not a cost-savings exercise but rather one to allow us to redeploy resources into areas such as R&D, sales and business development, which will accelerate growth. Fourth, this change will serve as the catalyst to better our operations and supply chain.","Operational excellence is at the essence of the strategy we launched back in 2009 that we call One Albemarle. Step one was the establishment of shared service centers in Budapest, Hungary; Dalian, China; and Baton Rouge, Louisiana where we now conduct the vast majority of the company's transactional activities such as payables, customer service, accounting and collections. The next phase of One Albemarle will be driving supply chain efficiencies and standardizing business processes across the company. With our current net working capital as a percentage of revenue of approximately 24%, we need focus here and have established an initial target of reducing working capital by at least $100 million by 2015.","Finally, the combined resources freed up by management delayering and our supply chain and business process efficiency initiatives will allow us to boost our R&D spending as a percentage of sales to around 4%, providing financial support behind our goals of delivering breakthrough innovations that drive growth in both bromine and catalysts. We won't get to that level in 2014, or maybe even 2015, but that's where we're headed in the long term. We also must execute on all of this while maintaining our focus on safety and environmental performance.","There's never a good time for change such as this, but waiting is not a viable alternative either. The restructuring will have us better aligned to implement our stated strategies and will allow us to redeploy resources to regain an intimacy with our customers and markets and drive future growth.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Scott.","Scott A. Tozier","Thanks, Luke. I'm going to start with a review of our business segments and then turn to the details on our P&L and cash flow. Overall, our net sales were $649 million, down 2% year-over-year, but up 2% from the second quarter. Segment income was $136 million, or 21% of sales, down 10% year-over-year and up 6% from the second quarter.","Catalysts reported third quarter net sales of $226 million, down 10% year-over-year; and segment income of $57 million, down 7% year-over-year on segment margins of 25%. Sequentially, from the second quarter, segment income was up 13%. 5% or 1\/2 of the year-over-year revenue decline was due to the impact of lower metal surcharges within Refinery Catalyst Solutions, but this had no impact on segment income.","Operating profits at heavy oil upgrading, which is mostly fluid-cracking catalysts, were up 23% year-over-year, driven by higher volumes from new and existing units, a number of new trials, fewer FCC customer turnarounds and favorable production leverage.","Within Clean Fuel Technologies, which is mostly hydroprocessing catalysts, volumes and profits were down year-over-year, driven by unfavorable mix, lower specialty sales and the timing of several orders slipping into the fourth quarter. Combined, Refinery Catalyst segment income was up 24% from the second quarter, driven by the heavy oil upgrading results.","Performance Catalyst Solutions revenue declined 5% and segment income was down 26% year-over-year, driven by the impact of our new factory start-up costs. Overall, polyolefin catalysts and co-catalysts volume growth was offset by lower MAO and custom catalysts sales. PCS pricing was down due to competitive pressure, but seems to have stabilized.","Our third quarter traction in electronic materials is lower than expected even though revenues associated with our PureGrowth products has nearly doubled year-over-year. We are also starting to see the effects of TEA production shifting to our joint venture with SABIC, which reduces Albemarle's revenue and increases joint venture income. We expect to -- we continue to expect the unfavorable impact of factory start-up costs, including Korea, to amount to a full year drag on the order of $20 million to $25 million.","Fine Chemistry reported third quarter net sales of $198 million, up 3% year-over-year and segment income of $37 million, down 15% year-over-year on segment margins of 19%. Revenue was up on higher custom services, specialty bromides and ag volumes while profitability fell principally due to the mix of custom and pharmaceutical contracts, higher clear completion sales out of Jordan, which led to a higher minority income to our partner and favorable -- unfavorable manufacturing variances.","Within Performance Chemicals, clear brine fluids remained strong with volumes up double digits and specialty bromides led by food-safety also reporting strong results. This was offset primarily by lower amines pricing and lower elemental bromine volumes, reflecting a more sluggish tone to the global radial tire end market.","Throughout the year, we have forecasted a stronger second half for Fine Chemistry Services. Third quarter results were in line with those expectations, driven by stronger ag volumes and select new product launches driving electronic materials-related growth, particularly offset by weak ibuprofen profitability and overall contract mix. Sequentially, overall, Fine Chemistry Services segment income was up 21% from second quarter levels.","Polymer Solutions reported third quarter net sales of $224 million, up 3% year-over-year. Excluding the impact of exiting our phosphorus flame retardants business in 2012, sales were up 7%. Segment income of $41 million was down 8% year-over-year on segment margins of 18%. Brominated flame retardant revenue was up 3% and segment income was down 12% year-over-year. Higher year-over-year volumes in enclosures, connectors and printed wiring boards were offset by connectors mix and enclosures price. From a brominated flame retardants demand standpoint, we continue to see sluggish trends within the electronics and insulation end markets. HBCD volume and pricing benefits from a prior year supply disruption amounted to an approximately $6 million negative impact on current quarter earnings as pricing has come full circle, declining significantly back to levels prior to our announced price increases a year ago.","European residential construction remains weak, impacting our volumes in the quarter. Mineral flame retardant revenue rose year-over-year by about 10%, mostly driven by China wire and cable, North America auto and specialty cable applications and a more stable European end market. Segment income was up only slightly due to the mix of product and pricing as the cost of sales to China are higher for our Bergheim, Germany plant. We continue to prepare to build a new fine precipitated ATH plant with our partner, Senze Meilu Company, aimed at wire and cable applications within the energy sector, which is benefiting from a rising energy consumption in China and throughout the Asia Pacific region.","Finally, Stabilizers and Curatives revenue and segment income rose 13% and 58%, respectively, year-over-year, driven by solid demand in polymer, fuel and lube antioxidants, which continue to benefit from new customer wins, growing sales outside of China and an improved cost position in a key raw material.","Now to highlight a few other P&L items for the quarter. SG&A expenses were $63 million during the quarter, flat sequentially, but up 17% year-over-year and higher as a percentage of sales at 10%. Excluding nonoperating items, SG&A is up 14%, mainly due to an increase in personnel and some third-party costs.","R&D expenses were $19 million for the quarter, down 2% year-over-year and flat as a percentage of revenue at 3.0%.","Third quarter free cash flow, defined as cash flow from operations adding back pension and postretirement contributions and subtracting capital expenditures, was $112 million, up $76 million year-over-year driven by lower working capital usage and CapEx levels. Our year-to-date free cash flow is up 80%, driven mainly by the lower capital spending.","CapEx was $32 million in the third quarter, and at $135 million for the year-to-date period, is down $83 million year-over-year. For the full year, we still expect to spend approximately $175 million.","Net debt, excluding the nonguaranteed debt of Jordan Bromine Company, dropped to $673 million, driving a corresponding decline in net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA to 1.1x, which is just above our targeted leverage ratio of 1.0x. Adjusted EBITDA excludes restructuring charges and nonoperating-related pension adjustments.","Net working capital of $624 million ended the quarter 8% higher than the end of 2012. At 24% as a percentage of sales, it is above our 20% target for the full year. The principal driver of the increase has been higher inventory levels, which we expect to decline as we approach the end of the year, particularly driven by shipments in Refinery Catalysts.","Excluding nonoperating items, we expect our effective tax rate for the full year to be 22.6%. This is no change from our expected full year rate at the end of the second quarter. As a result, our effective rate for this quarter, Q3, excluding nonoperating items, was 22.6%. And our rate continues to be influenced by the favorable mix of income and lower tax jurisdictions.","As we look forward to Q4, we expect to take a special charge in the fourth quarter in connection with the organization restructuring we are implementing. We're still in the design phase, so it is too early to give a detailed estimate, but we'd expect the charge to be less than $20 million.","In addition, we expect that our fourth quarter 2013 mark-to-market adjustment related to our pension and postretirement plans will likely be material. Based on asset returns and interest rate levels as of September 30, the mark-to-market adjustment would result in an actual gain of approximately $100 million.","Finally, the accelerated share repurchase program that we entered in Q2 continues until the end of December as we originally stated. We expect the diluted share count to be approximately 80.5 million shares starting in January 2014.","And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Luke.","Luther C. Kissam","Thanks, Scott. I want to take a minute to update you on the market conditions we're seeing for each business segment. We continue to forecast demand for clear brine fluids to remain strong, following an excellent third quarter. Gulf of Mexico average rig counts increased sequentially again from 51 in the second quarter to 59 in the third quarter while the average international offshore rig count of 321 is up 6% year-to-date versus the full year average for 2012.","In Polymer Solutions, there have been no developments in terms of our order book or the external indicators we monitor that would lead us to a more optimistic view than we shared on our last call. The most positive trend across our order book remains the continued relative strength of our brominated polystyrene family of products for connectors, which corresponds with the pattern of the Bishop Report Connector Confidence Index. That index, which was at 75.6 in September, has stayed in positive territory all year and is up from its 2-year low of 35.1 of a year ago.","In contrast to the positive connectors trend, the IPC book-to-bill ratio slipped to 1.01 in August, down from the 1.12 at the time of our last earnings call. Historically, ahead of the holiday season, we've usually seen a meaningful third quarter uptick for tetrabrom. However, this year's third quarter pickup was weaker than prior years.","In terms of the global TV market, the most recent full year shipment forecast from GfK called for a 5% rise that is 100 basis points lower than the prior forecast with all of the growth coming from developing markets where flame retardant usage is usually low. The number of weeks of TV panel inventory declined sequentially during the quarter. However, at roughly 2.5 weeks, it remains well above historical averages in terms of inventory.","Gartner and IDC both reported declines of 8% to 9% in global PC shipments in the third quarter of 2013 compared to the third quarter of 2012. While this was less severe than recent quarters, PC replacement cycles continue to lengthen and smartphones and tablets continue to partially displace PCs and notebooks.","Finally, with respect to Europe, we're observing mixed signals. On the one hand, trends have not improved with regard to residential construction, which suggest continued subdued demand for HBCD, a brominated flame retardant used in insulation. On the other hand, we have seen signs of stabilization in the wire and cable market, particularly for automobiles, which should stabilize mineral flame retardant demand.","Within Catalysts, we expect FCC volume and pricing to remain strong for the foreseeable future. We are also expecting the fourth quarter to be our best HPC volume quarter for the year, but there are a number of orders scheduled for December and there is always a risk that some could slip into 2014.","All in all, we expect fourth quarter results to be higher than third quarter and continue to expect full year EPS to be in the range we outlined in July. The critical factor comes down to the timing of HPC shipments currently scheduled for December.","In closing, there is some uncertainty regarding the path and pace of global economic growth for the foreseeable future. It seems clear that developing economies, in particular, are not likely to grow as fast as they have on average in prior years with downward revisions to GDP continuing to occur for Brazil, China, India and many others that we expected to be a key source of demand for our products. No matter the conditions, our job is to manage through any number of headwinds and our past record indicates that we can do so. We remain confident in the long-term fundamental trends driving our businesses and convinced that our business restructuring will accelerate the implementation of our strategy and the creation of shareholder value. The businesses continue to exhibit substantial earnings and cash generation power, and we look forward to sharing with you our views on 2014 in our January call.","With that, I'll turn the call back over to Lorin for questions and answers.","Lorin Crenshaw","Operator, at this time, we're ready to open the lines for Q&A. [Operator Instructions]","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Robert Koort with Goldman Sachs.","Angel Castillo Malpica - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","This is actually Angel Castillo...","[Technical Difficulty]","Lorin Crenshaw","Angel, are you still there? Operator, I think we've lost Angel.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Luke, for Catalysts in Q4, could you just walk through a bridge of earnings from Q3 to Q4, the main drivers of the improvements and quantify those -- quantify those items?","Luther C. Kissam","Yes, I don't know that I'll get a whole lot of quantification. But essentially, the story is FCC is going to remain strong. HPC is going to have a fairly significant uptick in volume, similar to what they had in fourth quarter and we'll have -- PCS will be a little weaker.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Understood. And just on the bromine side, you've announced bromine price increases on elementals, as well as derivatives. Talk about the timing of those price increases? What gives you the confidence it'll go through, and what's the initial feedback from customers?","Luther C. Kissam","Yes. It's different in different pockets. If you look across the bromine channel, we've seen some success in some specialty bromides. If you look at bromine and HBr, not as successful. If you look at tetrabrom, it's pretty -- it's stabilized but not seeing a whole lot of movement. A lot of tetrabrom is for bid so it really depends upon how the Chinese and the other competitors react. So we felt it's important to put the price increase out there. We're still out there pushing for it, but we've not seen the success that in some areas that we've seen in the past, although we are seeing some stabilization in most areas, David.","Operator","And our next question, once again, will come from the line of Robert Koort with Goldman Sachs.","Angel Castillo Malpica - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Luke, can you talk about continued focus on developing new applications for bromine? And I just was wondering about the additional resources that you discussed as part of the restructuring, if you could give us more color on these efforts and just on some of the adjacencies you are pursuing?","Luther C. Kissam","Yes, I don't want to go into a whole lot of detail specifically about what they are because it's a competitive landscape. And if you look at the other bromine producers, I'm sure they're looking for additional uses of bromine as well. So I don't want to get into too much on the call. But we will take resources and reallocate them to these uses. The thing I would caution you is it's always exciting to put a time line on when these things are going to commercialize. And the fact of the matter is you're not -- you ought to not expect anything in 2014 and nothing in 2015 except additional R&D costs going into this area and us hitting internal milestones. For instance, there was 1 project that we had that we were excited about. We couldn't hit the milestones. We couldn't make it work technically so we've killed the project. That's -- you never want to kill a project, but that's good because while working we found out we couldn't do it. Now, we've moved onto the next. So what I would tell you is this is just like any R&D pipeline that you see where you have metrics and milestones and accountabilities and we're going to stick to that process to try to grab those new uses.","Angel Castillo Malpica - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then just a follow-up regarding the bromine pricing announcements that you've had recently and that your competitors have announced. I was wondering if you could give us an update on that? If you're seeing good reception to that or just in general perception?","Luther C. Kissam","Yes, as I've just explained to David Begleiter's question there, pretty same -- similar question, we're seeing some success in pockets, some stabilization and some where it's not going through as well it has in the past. But I would believe it is the right approach to take, committed to it and we're going to work to ensure that we're getting the value for the performance enhancement that these products bring.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citi.","P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","One of your competitors in Catalysts had lost share and was planning to get it back. Did you see any relative changes in share or any changes in pricing as a result of competitive dynamics?","Luther C. Kissam","None out of the ordinary in the quarter is what I would say. You always have an FCC unit here, an FCC unit there doing a trial, ensuring the refineries. They're not stupid. They use that to keep everybody in line, as well as to see if there's other performance requirements, P.J. So I didn't see anything out of the ordinary. There's one thing, I'd like -- I've gotten a lot of questions about this both on the call and then some follow-up calls when we're out with analysts. And I'd like to talk just for a little bit about our view on valuation in FCC Catalysts. In 2004, before -- when we went to buy the Akzo Nobel refinery catalyst businesses, there was an article written by McKinsey that said FCC was a commodity and should be priced as such. And at that point in time, in 2004, when we bought the business, there was about -- we were selling, or Akzo was, about 125,000 metric tons roughly of FCC catalysts at about $1,000 a met ton and it was breaking even. Subsequent to that, after we paid the multiple we paid for that business, we looked at the value that, that product was delivering, we looked at the performance, we looked at our technological advantage and we started pricing for the value that the product brought. Now when we led that price increase, our volume went down to 85,000 metric tons. So we were down 25% to 30% on the volume. Today, however, the base price is well north of $3,000 and we're still not back to the volume we were in 2004, but it is a better business because we're delivering value to the refiners on the technological performance that we deliver. That's what this business is all about. Customers are going to have trials. And if the crude slate's working your way like it happens to be working our way on FCC catalysts right now and you're delivering value to those refineries and making them more profitable, they're going to switch. They're not going to switch on price unless the performance is equal. So I really -- this is not something as easy where a competitor or Albemarle or anybody else can go out there and try to buy share. It's a performance sale. It has been since we started this thing in 2006 to 2007.","P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Great. There are 2 businesses that you mentioned, it is the Gemini business and then there's organometallics going into lighting applications. Can you size the revenues of those 2 businesses and how big they could become?","Luther C. Kissam","I mean, Gemini, in -- and I'll put it out in 5 years or so. I mean, Gemini is kind of in the range of maybe, under certain applications, probably $100 million-type revenue business, profitable business, but in nice applications. And the LED market on what that is, that could be larger. It simply depends upon where our share ends up being in that market over the long term and the adoption of LEDs and OLEDs.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of Mike Ritzenthaler with Piper Jaffray.","Michael J. Ritzenthaler - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","From your commentary, it seems as though Catalysts is largely shouldering the burden of hitting the midpoint of guidance that you'd outlined in the last call of down 10% to 15%. So with year-to-date EPS down something like 20% and a little under 2.5 months to go in the year, would you characterize the risk of order slippage into '14 as materially less than it was 3 months ago given the order book in December, Luke, from your comments? Or is the uncertainty about the same as to when customers will instruct shipment?","Luther C. Kissam","It's about the same.","Michael J. Ritzenthaler - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And then onto bromine, I'm curious about the potential implications of either the Arab Potash announcing in September that they're curbing production substantially or the rather dismal production economics for potash production that could sustain longer term. Does that materially impact Albemarle's ability to source bromine salts or the impact of raw material costs at JBC?","Luther C. Kissam","No, it doesn't impact us at all because of the -- I mean, the volume that we're taking out of there is so small, it doesn't impact us at all.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies & Company.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Two quick questions. Your corporate expense line is, right now, running well below where it was a couple of years ago. How do you think it will normalize over the next couple of years? And secondly, with the working capital targets you outlined and your balance sheet target, should we be expecting a steadier pace of buybacks going forward? Or is it going to be a case of looking for M&A and then doing a sporadic buyback periodically to fix the balance sheet?","Luther C. Kissam","The first one on the corporate expense, I'm going to let Scott address that one and then I'll address the buybacks.","Scott A. Tozier","Yes. So Laurence, in the quarter, corporate -- as you stated, corporate expenses were lower than expected, driven mostly by reduction in our overall personnel expenses incentive pay. We've had a similar effect there in 2012. We're still going through the reorganization process so it's hard to put a specific number on how that corporate expense line would normalize out. But I would expect that fourth quarter and going -- it will be around a $16 million, $17 million level and be -- right now, there's nothing that would point to normalization back to the $19 million to $20 million that we've -- normally would plan for in 2014.","Luther C. Kissam","And with regard to the buyback, I think, as you can tell from the way we've approached it this year with accelerated buyback in that program, I don't think that we're in the business of being opportunistic in buying back stock. I think you'll see a steady buyback next year. And at the call in January, once we get through the AOP and see where we think we can get enough from a cash position, we'll outline the type of range of the buyback that you can expect during the course of 2014.","Scott A. Tozier","We continue to like the net-debt-to-EBITDA target of 1.0x and you can expect us to try to hold to that level.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Luke, in your prepared remarks, I think you highlighted that bromine and catalysts were, on average, 70% to 80% of your profits over the years. In connection with your reorganization, do you foresee any divestitures of product lines that are unrelated to either bromine or catalysis?","Luther C. Kissam","That's a good question. What I would say is, right now I don't foresee any divestitures. But there are some businesses that we need to work to improve some profitability and we've got plans to do that. And some of them are in a shorter leash than others.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then second, on Catalysts, I guess a couple of questions related to the Middle East. I thought I heard you say that the Saudi joint venture's a drag of $20 million to $25 million. Pretty good sized number there. Can you talk about when that will cease to be a drag? Maybe what the pattern looks like over the next several quarters? And then you may have mentioned it, apologies if I missed it, but what's the latest update on the TAKREER order timing in FCC?","Luther C. Kissam","Well, on the order timing, I think it's still mid-year 2014 now is the latest information, public information, that I've heard. And the SOCC is not a full $20 million to $25 million, but I'll turn it over to Scott to get more details on that, Kevin, okay?","Scott A. Tozier","Yes, Kevin, the combination of the Korea new plant, as well as SOCC, is going to affect us by $20 million to $25 million this year from a cost overhang perspective. We'd start to see -- related to SOCC, you'll start to see more shift of profitability into our joint venture line out of our core operating profit starting in the fourth quarter and that will continue going into next year. And then obviously, Korea, we're expecting to start to pick up as we go into next year as we start to fill those plants.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of Mike Sison with KeyBanc.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","In terms of the reorganization, my understanding it's not a cost savings sort of goal here, but you're going to certainly generate some. Can you quantify that and how much you're going to -- how much -- how big of a number is that, that you're going to redeploy into R&D and SG&A over time to sort of keep the businesses on the growth path?","Luther C. Kissam","I want to redeploy $20 million to $30 million.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. So that's the savings that you can redeploy?","Luther C. Kissam","That's right.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then you talked about, in the past, debottlenecking in FCC and can you give us an update how that's going?","Luther C. Kissam","Yes. It's going fine. We've approved a project in Bayport facility. That will give us about, over there, roughly, forget what we said publicly before, it's roughly in the range of around 10% or so. And so that's moving along nicely. And we've got plans for other small debottlenecks at both Amsterdam and Bayport to ensure that we're able to meet -- timely meet the demands of our customers and continue to grow this business.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of James Sheehan with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.","James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Luke, you mentioned that acquisition of Cambridge before. Could you just give us a sense for the size of that business? What are the sales and EBITDA numbers and where can they get to in the next couple of years?","Luther C. Kissam","Yes, I think that the Cambridge acquisition, it's a very, very small number from a revenue standpoint. It is -- or from an EBITDA standpoint. It won't move the needle at all. What it is, is it was an acquisition of technology. In our PureGrowth family of organometallics, there's 4 basic fundamental products you need to have in your portfolio to be able to service that electronic materials market. We had 3. We weren't able -- we're having difficulty developing the fourth one to the purity scale that it needed to be. Cambridge had a technology that allowed us to do that, as well as improve some of the product performance that we have in our existing portfolio. So this is really a technological -- a technology acquisition. And it also -- it'll give us -- in addition to having those 4 products to give us a full portfolio, what I'm the most excited about is any time you have R&D and technical resources coming together and have sharing new ideas, you usually always get 1 plus 1 equals 3. So I'm excited, finally, to get these R&D guys together so that they can collaborate because I believe we're going to see some more real breakthroughs in our electronic materials. But you ought not -- it won't move -- it's not going to move the needle meaningful from -- in and of itself, but more in the long term how we grow that electronic materials business.","James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","And on organometallics, I was just wondering, have your reassessed the growth potential of that business in light of some of the competitive intensity that you're seeing and initial growing pains?","Luther C. Kissam","Yes. I think we're in we're a middle of our AOP process for 2014 right now. And the roll-up, I think, is scheduled for later this month. So that is going to be one of the key assessments, I think, we do just like we do in every other business: what's the potential, what's the risk, what's the upside, what's the downside and do we have the skill set to do what we need to do? So it is -- continues to be a profitable business. As I said on the last call, we invested capital probably 18 to 24 months too early and we've got to deal with those costs and we've got to have a plan to fill those assets up and that's what we're working on right now.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.","Ian Bennett - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","This is Ian in the line for Vincent. So in Polymer Solutions, volume was up 10% year-over-year against kind of easy comp on a 2-year stock, but pricing is still fading. So could you kind of help us think about where volumes need to go from here in order to achieve pricing power either within the context of Albemarle's own operating rates or the operating rates of your competitors?","Luther C. Kissam","Yes, I think when you look at -- the big issues have really been television enclosures and European construction. Those are the 2 big movers on price. We're still getting some pricing pressure in our 8010 family of products and TV enclosures. And HBCD, you're working on a really tough comparison year-over-year because we had some price increases related to a plant shutdown for a key raw material that we didn't have this year. So you're looking at a tough comp. So I think it's a matter of what happens with the end markets, particularly the enclosures and the television sets, as well as we need some help on construction. And those are the 2 really ones that are moving it, to be honest with you.","Ian Bennett - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. So just so I understand, the -- it's not an issue that there's more capacity at this point in time relative to 2012 and 2011, it's really just we're moving lower because of lower volumes that are being shipped?","Luther C. Kissam","Yes, it's lower demand as opposed to lower -- to more capacity. What's happening is because -- I think what's happening, you're seeing, is in electronics in China, you're seeing lower demand overall for electronics so the bromine producers are looking for somewhere to put that bromine. They're putting it in 8010, they're putting it in HBCD and they're selling out against it and they're moving it at lower prices. In some instances, our competitors are trying to adapt to that and we are as well. So it really, really more is a demand than a supply change. There's been no change in -- that I'm aware of. And particularly for us, I can just say for us and then what I'm publicly were of, a change in capacity for 8010 for enclosures, HBCD or any of our brominated polystyrene family of products.","Ian Bennett - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Got it. And then shifting into Catalysts. Revenue was down 10% year-over-year, but net operating profit was essentially flat. So margins expanded nicely. Can you talk about what costs are -- have been taken out and kind of the outlook for that going forward?","Luther C. Kissam","Yes, I'll turn it over to Scott.","Scott A. Tozier","Yes, I would say that the biggest driver for that dynamic are twofold: one, we've got the start-up costs that are drying on us. However, FCC performance, or fluid cracking performance, has been very good and we've been getting some good cost performance out of that business given the factory's performance. And then also the pricing there has been favorable for us as well. So overall, that's what's pushing that profitability to be roughly flat.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","During the call, you said that the drag from your new products -- your new capacity expansions was roughly $25 million. Is there a lower drag next year or the same drag? Or if you look at the new projects, what should be the difference in operating profit performance be next year? And secondly, next year, do your capital expenditures go up or down relative to this year and by how much?","Luther C. Kissam","Yes. It's -- I'll take -- let me take the second question first. We're finalizing the AOP now, Jeff. But I think you should assume a good number for our capital for next year is going to be in the range of $125 million, plus or minus 10%, in that kind of range, which would be closer to our level of depreciation. We've got the assets built, so absent something that I don't know about today, that's the range that you can expect for 2014. We'll give you a better number in January but that's kind of the range right now. For the drag, I'll turn it over to Scott to talk about that for a second.","Scott A. Tozier","Yes, and Jeff, the costs that we're talking about both with Korea, as well as SOCC are the cost of operating those plants. So those costs will be there. Our challenge is to fill those plants. Now we're in the process of transferring products from our plant from the U.S -- TEA from our plants in the U.S. over to SOCC right now, as I mentioned on the call. So we'll start to see that shift happening into that plant even now in the fourth quarter. There's a little bit in the third quarter. Korea is all about trying to fill that plant as we've talked about and drive the revenue up in those areas.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Right. So what's the difference? Is it bigger or smaller?","Luther C. Kissam","The costs are going to be exactly the same. The difference is going to be we're going to have commercial sales in 2014. They're going to offset those costs whereas today we don't have that. We only have qualification trials. So we don't have any revenue to offset the costs. Costs will be exactly the same. Next year, we should have the revenue and certainly would hope that the revenue would overcome the costs next year.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then for my second question, when you look at your bromine prices sequentially in the third quarter, did they go up or down versus the second and by how much? And in Catalysts, your revenues went down $7 million sequentially and your operating profits were up $10 million. How did you do that?","Luther C. Kissam","Okay. I think, Scott, you take the catalyst one because I think you just answered that a second ago, but go ahead one more time.","Scott A. Tozier","Sure. So real quick on the Catalysts revenue. As you say, overall, our revenue was down but segment income was about the same, really driven by the performance of fluid cracking catalysts on both the volume that we're producing, it's giving us some favorable factory performance. We've got some raw material performance there as well and that's offsetting these -- more than offsetting the start-up costs that we just talked about. And so that favorability coming out of Refinery Catalysts is really helping us.","Luther C. Kissam","And then I'd say on pricing -- Scott, you can talk a little bit, but the big pricing pressure has come in, in the brominated flame retardants and polymers. It's really -- there's pricing pressure on the 2 major areas we've seen: 8010 in television enclosures continues to be under pricing pressure and it's lower year-over-year. And HBCD, the brominated flame retardant that goes into residential construction mainly in Europe, has been under continued pricing pressure and we had a volume issue there as well. I don't see that really changing in the fourth quarter. We haven't seen that -- I don't know whether or not that pricing pressure will continue. But that tetrabrom seems to have bottomed out a little bit of positive movement there. Brominated polystyrene seems to have been hanging in there fine. So it really comes down to what goes into enclosures and what goes into construction. If you're overall also looking at polymers and you're looking at mineral flame retardants, the mineral flame retardants, as we -- the pricing seems to have stabilized. I'd caution you, though, as we sell more into China to baseload our plant for when our JV comes online in 2015, there is -- that is a less profitable sale because of the cost of transportation that we have from Europe, so the pricing seems to have stabilized in mineral flame retardants.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So you're saying that pricing is down sequentially? Did you say that? Or did you just discuss year-over-year in bromine?","Luther C. Kissam","In bromine, when we talked -- yes, it's down sequentially. It's down sequentially.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, due to time constraints, our final question will come from the line of Steve Schwartz with First Analysis.","Steven Schwartz - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","In FCC, most of your comments, I believe, have referenced those volumes sequentially. But can you give us an idea on the year-over-year where it stood in the third quarter and then what you think in the fourth quarter because I think in the second half of the year here now, you've got some very difficult comps in FCC?","Luther C. Kissam","Yes. If you look, in the third quarter, FCC was up by mid-single digits from a volume standpoint. That's what you're asking, right, Steve?","Steven Schwartz - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","Yes, that's right, Luke.","Luther C. Kissam","And was also up sequentially over -- like double digits. Then if you look to the fourth quarter, will probably be roughly flat sequentially, I would say, kind of in that range, too hard to tell which would be a favorable -- we'd be up, gosh...","Scott A. Tozier","Double digits.","Luther C. Kissam","Double digits year-over-year.","Steven Schwartz - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","Sure. Yes -- no. Because you were up double digits last year as a comp, so you're right, flat in the fourth quarter, which should still be pretty good. And then just as my second question, in your slides, you mentioned, for Catalysts, lower-than-expected electronic materials market penetration. Can you -- you addressed kind of the planning for that business. But can you talk a little bit about what's behind that comment?","Luther C. Kissam","Well, yes. I mean, if you look, our electronic materials business that we sell into electronic materials was double what it was in the second quarter, I think, sequentially. I think sequentially, we doubled it. But we expected to do much better. We expected a quicker uptake on the LEDs and we just hadn't seen that to date, Steve.","Steven Schwartz - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","Okay. So it comes down to LEDs.","Luther C. Kissam","Thanks a lot. Thanks, everybody, for the time.","Operator","Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes your presentation.

A reconciliation of these measures to GAAP financial measures can be found in our earnings release and in the appendix of our earnings presentation, both of which are posted on our website.","Now, I will turn the call over to Luke.","Luke Kissam","Hi. Thanks Dave and good morning everybody. In the first quarter, Albemarle delivered adjusted diluted EPS of $1.23. Lithium volume in the first quarter was negatively impacted primarily by the rain event in Chile and delayed customer qualifications. Importantly, however, lithium pricing in the quarter was up 3% versus prior year. Catalyst and bromine specialties grew adjusted EBITDA by 5% and 12%, respectively, excluding divested businesses. Both businesses benefited from increases in volume and price.","Turning to our strategic projects. We continue to make progress on our lithium hydroxide joint venture with Mineral Resources Limited. We have made the necessary regulatory filings and based on the current feedback, continue to expect the transaction to close in the second half of 2019. During April, we signed an interim market agreement with MRL that allows Albemarle to market any spodumene concentrate that is produced at the site prior to the closing of the joint venture.","Our new 20,000 met ton Xinyu II lithium hydroxide facility continues to ramp production according to our original schedule. We are shifting from this expansion to customers who have completed their qualification process and have additional qualifications underway. We are on track for full qualification of Xinyu II material, all targeted accounts by the end of the third quarter of this year and expect to achieve a nameplate capacity run rate by year-end.","In Chile, we expect to produce close to 40,000 metric tons of lithium carbonate from our two existing operating units in La Negra in 2019 despite the impact on production from the rain event in the Salar de Atacama, which occurred in the first quarter. Due to delays in the delivery of certain equipment, we now expect to commission the 40,000 metric ton lithium carbonate plant, La Negra III and IV, late in the fourth quarter of 2020 or in the first quarter of 2021. This will be followed by typical four to six month customer qualification process that would put the first meaningful sales volume around midyear 2021. In spite of this slight delay, we are confident in being able to meet our volume commitments under our long term agreements for lithium carbonate.","In the Salar de Atacama, we have commenced a capital investment project, which is expected to improve our lithium yields in the Salar. Major equipment has been ordered. Earthwork should commence during the second quarter. And we are on track commission the project in the second half of 2021. This project will allow us to increase our lithium yields by as much as 30% without increasing the amount of brine being used, further ensuring the sustainability of the Salar de Atacama and increasing the flexibility of our operations.","In Kemerton, Western Australia, work has started on our lithium hydroxide complex. Earthworks are well underway and contracts have been awarded for the major and long lead time equipment as well as for the engineering procurement and construction management for the project. The first phase will encompass three trains of 20,000 to 25,000 metric tons capacity a piece and expected to be commissioned in stages during the second half of 2021 and continuing into 2022.","Finally, the expansion of Talison, our spodumene joint venture in Greenbushes, Australia, remains on schedule start up in June of this year. This expansion will result in the capability to produce about 160,000 metric tons on an LCE full year run rate basis with Albemarle's annual share being up to 80,000 metric tons. This spodumene will be our China and Australia conversion plants. Talison will tailor operations to meet the raw material demands of its two partners.","Turning to demand for lithium for a minute. During the first quarter, global sales of electric vehicles were up almost 60% compared to 2018. Full battery electric vehicles contributed outsized growth increasing 75% year-over-year. All of this is against the backdrop where year-on-year global automotive sales declined by 6.5% during the same quarter. Regionally, Europe set a record for EV sales in March ending the quarter up 23% versus prior year, with most of that growth coming from the full electric segment. U.S. sales were up 11%. First quarter EV sales in China were more than double what they were during the same period of 2018.","In addition, battery production remained strong. The Chinese National Bureau of Statistics reported that full year 2018 and first quarter 2019 lithium-ion battery production increased 13% and 8%, respectively, compared to the prior year. Year-on-year, the production of NMC cathode batteries was up more than 25% during the month of March alone. Overall, these demand signals were in line with what we see from our customers under our long term agreements, which support the continued secular growth in electric mobility and electric storage and the underlying strength of our businesses.","With that, I will turn the call over to Scott.","Scott Tozier","Thanks Luke and good morning everyone. In the first quarter, Albemarle generated unadjusted U.S. GAAP net income of $134 million. Net sales grew 6% and adjusted diluted EPS by 4%, excluding foreign exchange and divested businesses, compared to 2018. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was a $1.23 for the quarter, which is up $0.01 compared to 2018 pro forma results including the currency impact.","Earnings growth in bromine and catalysts segments contributed about $0.10 and a lower share count contributed about $0.06. The gains were mostly offset by lithium, which was about $0.09 unfavorable and foreign exchange, which was about $0.04 unfavorable, driven primarily by the strength of the U.S. dollar.","Corporate costs in the first quarter were $36 million, driven in part by negative currency expense and planned increases in professional services. We do not expect the first quarter spending rate to continue. Given first quarter costs and our updated view on the rest of the year, 2019 corporate costs are now expected to range from $120 million to $130 million.","Net cash from operations was about $55 million, down from last year impacted by lower EBITDA, lower dividend payments from our joint ventures and higher cash taxes compared to the first quarter. Operating working capital ended the quarter just under 28% of sales, an increase from the fourth quarter of 2018, primarily due to increased inventory of spodumene in the lithium segment in preparation for the ramp of the Xinyu II expansion in China and increased inventory in catalysts in preparation for orders in the second half of the year.","Capital expenditures during the first quarter were $216 million, on track with expectations. With the ramp of spending on Kemerton, continued buildout of La Negra and the early stages of the Salar yield improvement project, we continue to expect full year CapEx to range between $800 million and $900 million.","Now let me move on to the business performance. Lithium ended the first quarter with sales of $292 million and adjusted EBITDA of $116 million. On a year-over-year basis, pricing was up 3%, benefiting from our long term agreement structure. Volume, however was down 3% versus prior year, primarily due to the impact of the rain events in the Salar. The adjusted EBITDA margin was solid at 40% and reflects the higher mix of carbonate sourced from toll manufacturers.","Bromine specialties generated sales of almost $250 million and adjusted EBITDA of $79 million, up 10% and 12%, respectively, compared to the first quarter 2018. Adjusted EBITDA margin improved slightly year-on-year to about 32% as a result of higher sales prices and operating rates, partially offset by increased raw material prices. The increased volume was primarily driven by sales of clear brine fluids used for completion of offshore oil wells and sales of certain brominate derivatives used in the production of polymer resins. The market for flame retardants remained solid, particularly in electronics.","First quarter catalyst sales of about $252 million increased by 8% compared to 2018, excluding divested businesses. Adjusted EBITDA was $60 million, up 5% from 2018. Growth was driven by our refining catalyst products, due to order timing of hydroprocessing catalysts and low single-digit price increases in fluid catalytic cracking or FCC catalysts, partially offset by a slight volume decline in FCC.","Looking forward to the rest of the year. Lithium remains a volume story. Global demand remains in line with our expectations. As we discussed last quarter, we are starting to see some excess lithium carbonate in China coming from the nonintegrated spodumene converters. This is pulling short term carbonate pricing down. And for now, we have decided to forgo some opportunistic sales of total lithium carbonate in China until pricing improves. Our strategic customers in general continue to reflect healthy demand based on their current order pattern and continue to meet volume and pricing commitments under the terms of our long term agreements.","Adding all this together, we now expect year-over-year volume growth of 15,000 to 20,000 metric tons and an adjusted EBITDA growth rate in the high teens. Note that we expect the second half to be notably stronger than the first due to the Xinyu production ramp and the brine improvements in Chile. Bromine had a strong start to the year and the current backlog of orders is healthy. With our improving outlook for the second half, we now expect full year bromine adjusted EBITDA growth in the mid to high single digits on a percentage basis. Our full year flat outlook on catalysts is unchanged. Shipments continue to be weighted to the second half with third quarter expected to be the strongest of the year.","In rounding our commentary on our businesses, the fine chemistry services business, which is reported under the other segment, is beginning to show signs of recovery. We remain cautious. However, we believe this business now has the potential to deliver full-year adjusted EBITDA of around $25 million. For the total company, we are reaffirming the full year guidance. We expect pro forma net sales growth in the range of 9% to 15%. We expect overall corporate adjusted EBITDA margins of around 30%. And this would result in adjusted diluted earnings per share of between $6.10 and $6.50, a pro forma growth rate of 16% over 2018 at the midpoint. We expect the second quarter of 2018 to be about equal to the second quarter 2018 and the second half to be stronger than the first. As always, normal fluctuations in our business could have an impact on those quarterly results.","I am excited about our progress in growing lithium capacity and earnings and the efforts of bromine and catalyst to generate increasing cash flow to fund that growth. These efforts, which are consistent with our strategy, continue to position us to benefit from the tremendous growth in the lithium market for decades to come.","Now I will turn it back to back over to Dave.","Dave Ryan","Operator, we are now ready to open the lines for Q&A. But before doing so, I would like to remind everyone to please limit questions to two per person to ensure that all participants have a chance to ask questions. Then feel free to get back in the queue for follow-ups, if time allows. Please proceed.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from the line of Robert Koort from Goldman Sachs. You may begin.","Robert Koort","Thanks. Luke, I was wondering if you could talk, there has been I guess some angst around what's going on in pricing in China. You guys alluded to maybe doing some less tolling and opportunistic sales. Can you talk about your contract integrity of sales in China and then outside of China and maybe just review for us once again the balance and approach on that contracting in lithium? Thanks.","Luke Kissam","Yes. I will let Eric talk a little bit about what he has seen specifically in China and then as a high level I will talk a little bit about the contracts.","Eric Norris","So Bob, this is Eric. In China, we are seeing pricing falling to what we would consider the cash cost of the high cost nonintegrated spodumene converters. So that price is one which, when we take Talison rock and convert it through a toller to carbonate, the economics just don't make sense. And so, as Scott alluded to in his prepared remarks, that's the volume we are pulling out of, let's say, opportunistic volume.","That volume was either one of two kinds. It was either a variable price piece to an existing customer where we have a fixed price contract already in China and we have several of those. Or it was to a new prospective account that we would be developing for future growth, who we do not have a contract with that is of course anchoring their expectations on that price.","So if you look at it long term, okay, I think this quarter has been a quarter that shows the strength of our long term agreements. We have had the fixed pricing and the minimum volumes that we have had in the contracts. All of our customers have held to those. They have taken their minimum commitments. And they have held to that minimum pricing for that we had. As you can see, our pricing was up 3% year-over-year when a number of other lithium companies were talking about price being down year-over-year.","So again, this strategy is one that we thought through to shave off the highs and the lows and to get a quality return on what we invested. So we feel good about that strategy and they are long enough now that we have these contracts. The bulk of our carbonate spoken for under these long term contracts through the end of 2021. And we have the bulk of our carbonate spoken all away through -- sorry and the bulk of hydroxide, I apologize Bob, spoken through the end of 2025 at prices.","So we feel very good about where we are in our ability and the respect and the legal significance that are given these contracts.","Robert Koort","And then Luke, if I might ask, you mentioned or Eric you mentioned that you thought maybe a nonintegrated producer in China is at breakeven. You pulled some of your own tons out of that market through the tollers using Talison which is, I believe, far and away the lowest cost. So does that mean we should start to see, would you expect to see some of these nonintegrated independent companies pulling back production? And is what they are selling in that market different than what you are selling from a quality standpoint? Or is it fungible? Thanks.","Eric Norris","Let me answer the last question first. It's kind of all over the board. It depends on the converter and their track record. So some is higher quality carbonate, some is lower. But to your point around cost structure, yes. Once you remove toller margin, right, because obviously the tollers we work with are earning a profit, the Talison converted product is going to be the lowest cost product in the marketplace, no doubt.","With the toller margin though, that's what gets us close to being not profitable at current market prices and why we have pulled out. It is possible, certainly, that this could have a constraint on high cash cost producers. We will have to wait and see.","Luke Kissam","And Bob, I would tell you one thing. Remember, our margins, what we committed, it was going to have overall 40% margins. And there are plenty of people, there are some people out there in China who are willing to operate at cash cost and making cash. We are not. And the people that we committed to and that have committed to us, worked through the high pricing, through the low pricing of whatever the market may bring, we are going to be consistent with those prices. We are going to meet our commitments and they are meeting their commitments as well. So we feel good about it.","Robert Koort","Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of John Roberts from UBS. You may begin.","Josh Spector","Hi guys. This is Josh Spector, on for John. Just a question, if you could provide some additional information around the delay in qualification of Xinyu II, I guess, particularly impacted the first quarter? Just trying to mesh together what you guys saw relative to competitors and some of that cathode producers in terms of timing and longer term versus near term impacts?","Eric Norris","Hi Josh. This is Eric Norris. I am going to refer to the comment Luke made. Qualification times for a company like ourselves that has using an existing plant or expanding a new brownfield next to it has an established track record with a cathode producers, that's a four to six months qualification process. We brought Xinyu II up in November, December timeframe. So we are always bucking up against that timeframe, right. And we were able to get certain customers qualified in time to get the product out by the end of March and make that buying in the quarter and now we didn't. So it's really just playing at the clock.","Luke Kissam","And I think that also speaks to the confidence that those long term customers have in the relationship we have with them. As they cut actually in the first quarter, cut some of their, at least one or two of them did cut that qualification time a little short. So we got that volume in for a piece of their work, but not for all of it. So I think we were trying to be a little more aggressive thinking they could shorten the qualification time across the board. And just at the higher end, quality for those long EV batteries, they weren't able to do that or weren't willing to do that. But we have done, it continues on schedule for qualifications and there are no issues. It was just a matter of, we thought we could get it tighter than what the traditional qualification would have been.","Josh Spector","So this, in your view, in terms of what you are seeing for the higher quality hydroxide product, are you seeing any customers pushback some of the order timing? Or any indications of different demand patterns? It seems like what you saw at Xinyu, you expect to be at full rates later this year, which seems to be, I think, a bit different from what we hear from others.","Luke Kissam","Yes. So, nobody is pushing back on their order pattern from what we had expected for this year for our major customers. And what we said that we will ramp in toward full capacity on a run rate basis. So in other words, we won't produce 20,000 metric tons out of Xinyu II this year, but by the end of the year, we will be operating at a run rate basis that would equal 20,000 tons if we ramp of the full year. There is a little bit of difference there. So you understand what I am saying?","Josh Spector","Yes. Got it. Makes sense. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy from Vertical Research. You may begin.","Kevin McCarthy","Yes. Good morning. Luke, nice to see the positive 3% on lithium pricing. Can you talk to what you are seeing with regard to mix? And what is your level of confidence that you can sustain the positive pricing throughout the course of 2019?","Eric Norris","Kevin, so this is Eric again. Our volumes are, as you know, under long term contracts. So the vast majority of our carbonate volumes and even almost all of our hydroxide volumes under long term contracts with fixed prices and the have a floor associated with them. So our mix is going to be representative of the production mix we talked about. It is going to be close to 30,000 tons roughly of hydroxide and 40,000 tons of carbonate that we are putting into the market on a rounded basis and are confident to being able to sell that at current prices that we are seeing in the first quarter. It is very high going forward.","Luke Kissam","And then Kevin, if you remember, on the last call, we said that we thought pricing will be, for lithium for the full year, will be flat to inflationary. That's still what we expect. What you are seeing at three quarter and the first quarter that 3% in the first quarter, some of it is that some of the price increases in 2018 didn't hit all the way in the first quarter. It was staggered through the year. So you are seeing a little bit of that also in the first quarter 2019. But we still expect it is going to be flat to inflationary for the year.","Kevin McCarthy","Great. And then secondly, I was wondering if you could discuss or elaborate in terms of what you are seeing on the evolution of cathode technology. There has been some discussion that the move to high nickel systems is taking a little bit longer than anticipated. Are you observing that? And if so, does it have any appreciable impact on your business, either positive or negative?","Luke Kissam","So Kevin, we can't account for what other folks' projection would be about demand and mix of demand. Things aren't falling as we thought they were. We discussed in our last conference call where we are seeing 2019 unfolding largely as we predicted a couple of months ago and we are seeing no pullback from the forecasted high nickel demand that we anticipated to see. Now it's fair to say that that's largely an NCA market and secondarily on the NMC side, a 622 market, which has a partial amount of hydroxide in it. But NCA, as you know, is all hydroxide. We have never put a big bet on near term on 811. We think it is an attractive chemistry long term. But there is quite a few processing technologies that you can put in place to improve the economics of manufacturing 811, which we anticipate will take a number of years to put in place.","Kevin McCarthy","That's helpful. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander from Jefferies. You may begin.","Adam Bubes","Hi. Adam Bubes, on here for Laurence. As you talk with your partners in the value chain, I was wondering how DO you see stationary storage evolving? Are the specs any less rigorous than electrical vehicles? And how do potential volume commitments differ?","Eric Norris","Well, so you mean, for grid storage, energy storage systems? This is Eric speaking.","Adam Bubes","Yes. Just to clarify.","Eric Norris","Yes. So, we see a market that and we forecasted this a couple of months ago there is maybe 60,000 ton market going forward and it is not a big part of what is sold today. It is included in and part of the long term contracts we do. The Koreans and the Japanese and I believe the Chinese as well, although I can speak more directly to the first two, have volumes of our products that are sold and used in grid storage applications. And so, we monitor it carefully. It's an intriguing market. But we don't see it being the driver that EV market will be.","Adam Bubes","Okay. Thanks. And my second question, I was wondering what your view on bromide derivatives was? And if demand stabilizes in Asia, should margins expand?","Luke Kissam","Yes. I will turn that to Netha.","Netha Johnson","Good morning Adam. This is Netha. What we are seeing is basically a stable demand for flame retardants through the second half of the year. There is really an increased opportunity for our clear brine fluids in the oil and gas market based on offshore rig count increasing. So what we have done when we projected in our guidance forward is we basically removed the risk we had in the second half and projected that going forward to the mid single digit for the full year.","Adam Bubes","Okay. Thanks. Very helpful.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Joel Jackson from BMO Capital Markets. You may begin.","Robin Fiedler","Hi. This is Robin, on for Joel. Thanks for taking my questions. So my first is, so we have seen publicly available export data out of Chile. It's showing sequential carbonate price reductions in the past couple of months. I know you mentioned in your prepared remarks that there is some carbonate price weakness from spodumene supply pressures. But can you talk a little bit about the Chilean export price dynamic and how that might impact Q2 lithium EBITDA specifically?","Eric Norris","Yes. So I am not sure what data you are looking at out of Chile. But what I would say is, the way we go to market, that's a transfer price from Chile, from our Chile entity to a U.S. entity that then turns and sells to the products. So you did not view the Albemarle export data as the final product that we sell to the customer at that price, okay.","So then if we look at carbonate longer term, what we said is, in Asia, there has been some pressure on carbonate pricing in the first quarter, largely due to some excess spodumene that the converters have over there. If they are able to convert and they are willing to sell at a lower price than what we have seen over the last couple years, that will over time dry up. The market will continue, as we always have said, the market will relatively balanced through here to 2025, but there will be pockets where you have oversupply, pockets where you have undersupply.","And what we are seeing right now is a pocket, where particularly for carbonate in many of the non-EV uses we are seeing some downward pressure because of this excess carbonate. But I think long term, the market is going to remain in balance. And in fact, some of that carbonate is going to have to convert to hydroxide demand or we will not have enough hydroxide capacity to meet the demand for these battery makers on that chemistry over the long term.","Robin Fiedler","That's helpful. Thanks. And then just a quick follow-up in that. Are you able to provide Q2 lithium EBITDA guidance on a year-over-year basis?","Eric Norris","No. Not more than what Scott said in his prepared remarks.","Robin Fiedler","Okay. No problem. And just one last question for me. Can you give us an update on the construction timeline at Wodgina? It seems like the first line is on schedule and commissioning now. Are the second and third line is still expected sometime this summer? And can you elaborate on the market agreement that's now in place and how that might impact LPs received volumes from Wodgina for this year? Thank you.","Luke Kissam","Well, that's lot of questions for one follow-up. So let me try to address the marketing agreement. What will the market agreements says is that we have the right to sell spodumene that's produced out of that site during the full year. We are getting MRL was on schedule on train one. We will get qualification samples out. We are in the middle of marketing some of that spodumene. And we will sell that spodumene at attractive prices. But we are certainly not in a position or thinking about operating that wide open and then sell it. We are going to sell it to meet the demand and that's it.","Robin Fiedler","Thanks very much.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Aleksey Yefremov from Nomura Instinet. You may begin.","Matt Skowronski","Hi. Good morning. This is Matt Skowronski, on for Aleksey. If you were to see a downturn in demand for hydroxide, would you consider slowing down your investment?","Luke Kissam","Yes.","Matt Skowronski","Thank you. And you mentioned that your outlook for bromine is driven by improving demand in second half conditions. How good are your visibility into the orders? And what kind of gives you confidence that this pickup will occur? Is it flame retardants? Is it anything else?","Luke Kissam","Netha?","Netha Johnson","Hi. This is Netha. We have pretty good visibility into the orders. We analyze our backlog extensively. And we are essentially sold out. So we are in a good position to feel good about the orders we have and our ability to produce and deliver those orders. What we had in there was just a slight risk based on economics in the second half that we removed which improved our outlook for the year.","Matt Skowronski","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar from Citi. You may begin.","Dan Jester","Yes. Hi. Dan Jester, on for P.J. Just another one on bromine, if we could dive in a little bit deeper. It sounds like ht mix of sales is going to change a little bit as the year progresses. How does that affect margin and the margin outlook? Thanks.","Netha Johnson","This is Netha again. I don't know if you mix is going to change, per se. We had risk built into the second half based on economic conditions we were seeing. Those are looking a little bit better now. So we removed that risk. But our fundamental sales mix shouldn't change throughout the year. Margins should be as we forecasted.","Dan Jester","Got you. Thank you. And then on catalysts, you had a little bit of margin pressure over the last couple of quarters. Can you just comment what's driving that and how you think 2019 evolves? Thank you.","Raphael Crawford","So this is Raphael. So we are looking at 2019 to be essentially flat year-over-year on an adjusted EBITDA basis. There certainly are mix effects that occur from year-to-year, depending on how much hydroprocessing versus FCC business. But I would say, on the whole, the business is strong. It continues to follow the macro trends of need for chemicals fuels and clean chemicals in fuel. So we feel confident in the future outlook for the business.","Dan Jester","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. You may begin.","David Begleiter","Thank you. Good morning. Luke, just on the carbonate excess in China. How long do you think this will last? Is it a matter of months or quarters or something like that?","Luke Kissam","Yes. It's hard to say, David, because it depends so much about how many third people eye it. But I would expect that you are going to see it through the year. I think you are going to see it through the year. My bet is, this is going to start, you are going to see pricing start picking up toward year-end. But it's very, very difficult to say. It depends upon so many third parties and what they may be doing and you can't control all that. So that's what I will say.","Eric?","Eric Norris","Yes. I would just add, David, that we haven't talked a lot about supply. Supply, our expectations as compared to where we were three months ago on supply are very different. South America production is going to be nearly flat year-on-year once you consider the broad impacts of rains that impacted all producers, we believe. Some have probably talked about it, including ourselves and SQM's outlook for production this year.","You then turn and look at the other side of the world in spodumene production, it's taking longer for some to get to market and we would expect that the economic values being achieved by the time it's converted to a carbonate salt, is not sufficient to drive a lot more interest in putting more capacity to market. So will it last the year? I am not going to contradict Luke's comment at all. But I think we need to look at, on a long term on multiyear basis, the impact of the supply and what we are seeing. And therefore we see supply going out beyond this year being a lot more balanced with demand.","David Begleiter","Very good. And just on looking at the Wodgina spodumene. How should we be thinking about that being marketed in relation to perhaps some of your additional Talison volumes as well being marketed in China?","Luke Kissam","Yes. So remember, Talison, we do not market that rock in Talison, except for the technical grade. And so that would go into things like glasses and ceramics and thing such as that. And Tianqi markets within China and we market outside of China for that technical grade. But our battery grade has to be converted by the partners. So we don't, Talison does not sell spodumene rock to be converted into battery grade by either one of the parties, anyone in the world. It is simply a raw material source for Tianqi and Albemarle.","David Begleiter","Thank you very much.","Luke Kissam","And we are going to market the Wodgina rock to meet the demand. If the demand is not there, we won't run the plant. So if demand is there, we will run it to meet that demand that we can sell and get a profit on it.","David Begleiter","Very good. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of Ben Kallo from Baird. You may begin.","Ben Kallo","Hi Thanks and good morning. So first, can you talk about maybe just conversations in out years and how that looks particularly in carbonate for new contracts? And then I want to talk about capital allocation. First of all, maybe if you could talk about where you stand on your buyback and what your thoughts are there? And then second, just with the agreement with MRL, how you are viewing valuations out there in the private market? It looks like public markets hate lithium right now. But I am wondering what the implications are on the private market for either new project startups that need capital or any type of M&A activity out there from a private market perspective and what that does to supply and demand? Thanks.","Luke Kissam","Okay. First of all, from a buyback standpoint, our buyback is already closed out. We closed that last one that we did. We closed out last year. Right, Scott?","Scott Tozier","Yes. That's correct. The end of December we finished that buyback. So we are complete.","Luke Kissam","Okay. And then I am going to ask, if you talk about carbonate to his question for the year and the contract?","Eric Norris","So Ben, help me clarify, what was your specific question? How does carbonate look versus start-up?","Ben Kallo","Yes. As you look out to 2022 and beyond, how are those discussions going? Are they active or are people pausing to look how the market is? And how do you look at pricing there too?","Eric Norris","Okay. So let me first point out you didn't ask, which is through 2021 and we have got charts we have put out over the past few quarters, we are 80% contracted out through that period of time on carbonate, which hits our target exactly. I will be candid, there are not a lot of discussions in the current market about contracts. We don't have any contracts that need to renew that are going to renew this year or next of any material size. And as a result, given where pricing is and given the expectation of how we think the supply and demand relationship will play out, we are engaging in those discussions in due course, but not imminently.","Luke Kissam","And Ben, you asked about valuations. What I would say is, if it's a resource, the valuations even in the private side, the ask is still pretty steep from a resource standpoint, where there may be some opportunities are in a conversion asset. And then you look at that as, obviously we have got some capital projects as a build your own versus buy. But from a resource standpoint, some of the valuations, some of the better valuations -- I am sorry, some of the better resources, I apologize, are still have pretty high valuations.","Ben Kallo","Got it. Thanks.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Chris Kapsch from Loop Capital Markets. You may begin.","Chris Kapsch","Yes. Good morning. So if you look at lithium pricing, there has been, maybe not historically, but more recently, there has been a premium for hydroxide pricing vis-\u00e0-vis carbonate pricing. And that premium has been compressing. I am just wondering if you could comment on where do you think the endpoints is there? How do you see that playing out? And does that affect your business and outlook?","Eric Norris","Okay. So this is Eric. So let me start with the last question first. From our standpoint, you know and I indicated earlier, we are largely completely, nearly sold out for hydroxide. So it is not going to affect our pricing this year or for years to come, we believe. Our pricing is fixed at prices that are just a bit higher as witnessed in the first quarter than last year this time. And we expect to be largely flat for the balance of the year. And if the market improves, there might be an opportunity for us to increase some of these contracts. but we have the floor in all of these contracts.","So as to your question about what's going on in the broader market. Well, there are different kinds of quality of hydroxide, right. The hydroxide is sold broadly for the grease applications or even for certain lower energy dense applications LFP, may not be at the same standard of quality that's used in high nickel chemistries and we see that as a result, if you look at some the relationships with the large battery producers, that's where only a few people can play in these high nickel chemistries including Albemarle. So there is a tow-tier market. The compression though of the spread, back to what we consider more normal spread of about $1.50 to $2, which has happened between carbonate and hydroxide has been largely about of there being some excess hydroxide from other producers that aren't under long term contracts. That's largely in China that's driven back in line.","Chris Kapsch","Okay. That color is helpful. And then my follow-up is, one of the things that's contributed to the angst, if you will, has been the unexpected magnitude of the Chinese subsidy change for EVs. And obviously that subsidy has been known to be going to zero in the relatively near term. But nonetheless, that seems to inform some patterns. I am just wondering, how you see that influencing your business? There is some discussion that this change gives a longer tail to LFP. I am not sure that was ever going away given the relevance in e-buses for LFP and so forth. But maybe you could just comment on effects from that the changing Chinese EV subsidies? Thanks.","Eric Norris","Right. So again, I would agree with you that it might favor longer some of the chemistries other than high nickel chemistries. With the more rapid drop in subsidizing some of the longer range vehicles, when I see more movement in cost to LFP to getting range with larger, less dense energy batteries. So that's a possibility. In our case, if you look at our product mix, that's neither good nor bad news, right, as long as the growth is there. And the first quarter illustrates that the growth is still there. We play in carbonate and hydroxide. And then finally, for us, we have always noted that our mix of business is more buyers outside than inside China. So while it does impact our business, this growth in EVs in China certainly, we are more tied to what happens globally with electric vehicles.","Chris Kapsch","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Colin Rusch from Oppenheimer. You may begin.","Colin Rusch","Thanks so much guys. As you look at the rapid evolution of battery chemistries, what are seeing in terms of need for incremental R&D spend for your internal efforts to keep up with the chemistries that folks need?","Luke Kissam","Yes. This is Luke Kissam. I think where we are in our spending today is about where we need to be. We are not going to invent the next battery. What is important for us is to understand where our customers are going, so that we can take whatever they are doing, be sure that we have either the lithium metal, the lithium carbonate, the lithium hydroxide or whatever other derivative lithium might be to apply to their situation. So it's less of a development and more of an application. And we have, over the last three or four years built up that expertise so that we are able meet those demands. And I don't see our need to increase R&D any further than the kind of levels that we have it today in order to successfully meet the changing and evolving demands of the markets.","Colin Rusch","Great. And then just on the contracting. Has anyone come back and tried to renegotiate prices lower and had to put off or refused to take volumes at this point?","Luke Kissam","We are constantly having conversations with our customers. So I am not aware of anything where a customer has come back and said we need to sit down and have a discussion about price right now. I am just not aware that in this quarter. Maybe a small customer on edge is, certainly the major customers know. Certainly the major customers know.","Colin Rusch","Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mike Sison from KeyBanc. You may begin.","Mike Sison","Hi guys. In terms of 2Q, I think you noted earnings to be flat year-over-year. Can you maybe give us directional feel for the segments? And then what do you think needs to happen to get that better second half?","Luke Kissam","Yes. This is Luke. Let me take the second question first. The better second half is EV. From a lithium standpoint, it is Xinyu full qualification and ramping that production up. And it's the Chile brine, having the better brine, getting through that rain event, having enough brine to feed the plants to operate it at high capacity. It's operating. Can we operate Xinyu a little better than we have in the forecast? And then it comes down to continued strength of bromine. We have got another well coming online in bromine. And then we got big orders, you know the hydrotreating catalyst business is very little bit lumpy business. And if you look right now, the third and fourth quarter are big quarters for hydrotreating catalyst. Right now, we believe it is going to be a really big third quarter because of that. But those HPC orders always have a tendency to slight a little bit. So it's the second half. But that's what gives us confidence in the big second half. It's not a lot of price built-in across our portfolio for those. It's really all about the additional volume, the additional qualifications and the way the order patterns are set in HPC catalysts.","Mike Sison","Great. And then on 2Q, just by segment?","Luke Kissam","Scott?","Scott Tozier","Yes. Mike, this is Scott. So as you look at Q2, we are expecting that bromine catalysts, even fine chemistry will be sequentially similar to Q1. And the growth that we see sequentially is really all coming from lithium. And so that's kind of how you look at it. And the big driver there, if you look on a year-over-year basis, while catalyst is going to have this big Q3, on a year-over-year basis it's actually going to be down in the second quarter. So you will see you growth. That's the dynamic that you have got to take into account as well.","Mike Sison","Got it. And then just as a follow-up. You rattled off some pretty strong growth outlook for early first quarter for global sales for EV. Can you maybe give us your thoughts for the full year and what you see or what you are hearing in terms of global EV sales for 2019 versus 2018?","Luke Kissam","Yes. I would expect the EV sales to continue on the trajectory that you have seen from 2016 to 2017 and 2017 to 2018 and 2018 to 2019 is what I would say. We don't see any evidence from the order pattern of our big customers or from what we are seeing in the models that are being rolled out by the EV makers or by the automotive OEMs that are going to change that direction. You still are going to see continued growth in the EV sector in 2019. I don't know what that number is going to be. But I think you will see a continuing trend of what we have seen in the past.","Mike Sison","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jim Sheehan from SunTrust. You may begin.","Jim Sheehan","Thank you. Good morning. In terms of the earnings shortfall that you announced, I think on March 28, you listed three buckets of classes for that. Could you give us the size of each of the buckets please?","Scott Tozier","Yes. This is Scott, Jim. So as look at, I am going to put them into two buckets. The first one is the rain event in Chile and it's about 50% of the shortfall that's coming from that and 50% was coming from the qualifications. The qualification delays. If you remember, we actually had qualification delays on Xinyu II as well as on the toll carbonate that we talked about and you can split those about 50-50 as well. So that's kind of 25% from toll carbonate delays, 25% from Xinyu II, 50% from the carbonate out of Chile.","Jim Sheehan","Great. And on CapEx, you talked about your expectations for this year. What do you expect CapEx to look like in 2020 and 2021?","Luke Kissam","Yes. It's going to be roughly the same. We will give you an update on that. But if I was modeling that right now, it would be roughly the same, assuming that we still have the good demand that we are seeing. If we don't have that demand from the customers, if we got issues with customers, we will certainly pull it back. But as of right now, the demand we are seeing from our customers would necessitate those investments and would give us the return on those investments as well.","Jim Sheehan","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mike Harrison from Seaport Global. You may begin.","Mike Harrison","Hi. Good morning. I was wondering if you can give a little bit more detail on the lithium yield increase project in Chile. It sounds like you are moving forward on that. I believe last we heard, you have had some success, kind of at the lab or pilot scale, but maybe there were some concerns in scaling up to the commercial level. So what's changed there? And are you confident that that technology is going to be ready for prime time?","Luke Kissam","Yes. This is Luke. We are very confident. It worked at the lab quite well. It also worked in pilot scale from brines in the Salar that we ran it through. It's not new equipment. It's known equipment. There's not any specially made pieces of equipment or things like that. So we feel confident in our ability to execute this project. It allows for us to achieve about a 30% increase in the yield of the lithium from the same amount of brine being pumped in the Salar. So it's good for the Salar. It gives us a lot of unit flexibility and preservation of capital going forward. So that's the best place in the world to make lithium derivatives. So we are excited about that ability and we are moving forward. We expect to commission that sometime in 2021, I believe.","Mike Harrison","All right. And then I was also wondering, well, if you can talk a little bit about what you are seeing in HPC demand ahead of the IMO 2020 regulations kicking in? Are you starting to see some ability to capture additional hydrotreating capacity? Is that really what's driving the Q3, Q4? Or can you maybe just talk about what the ramp looks like during this year?","Raphael Crawford","Sure, Mike. That's a piece of it. We generally see a tightening of sulfur specs around the world beyond the efforts of the IMO. But there is a part of Q3, which is really our customers gearing up for the increase in demand for low-sulfur diesel fuel for blending, low-sulfur fuels in general. So to that end, we are starting to see a positive impact for HPC because of IMO 2020. As Luke had mentioned, it is a lumpy business. So some of what we are seeing in growth in Q3 is a function of just timing of rebids from existing customers and the opportunities that we have.","Mike Harrison","Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan from RBC Capital Markets. You may begin.","Arun Viswanathan","Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to ask about the MRL investment. Could you characterize the kind of the return profile there? And if it has changed at all given some of the pricing action that you have seen? And if you [indiscernible] there, I guess.","Scott Tozier","Yes. Arun, this is Scott. So as you look at one of the impacts around the returns is going to be the spodumene sales that we have in the short term. And obviously with the pullback in spodumene pricing, we will see a little bit of an impact there. Fortunately, hydroxide is the big driver of returns. I mean, that dynamic hasn't changed. That's going to be all marketed under our long-term contracts. So we still feel very good about the returns.","Luke Kissam","Yes. This is Luke. From an MRL standpoint, this is a great partnership to combine the mining expertise they have with the lithium hydroxide expertise that we have. And we are not buying this for this quarter or for the next quarter, but for the next 20 years to be able to drive the returns. And we are still confident in those returns over that period of time and we feel good about the deal.","Arun Viswanathan","Okay. Thanks. And just as a quick follow-up. If you think about what's going on in China, has there been any impact on demand, I guess, shorter term from destocking or any kind of macro concerns or pressures?","Eric Norris","Arun, hi, it's Eric. That's a good question. And as you know, China is a very opaque market and hard to tell. My theory and we discussed it, I discussed with my business team, is there's probably a level of destocking only because we can look at prior years and see that there was a high level of buying above demand, we believe, for feedstocks. In a market like this, if you are cash based, if you are running your business for cash, you have all that working capital on hand, you may exhaust it. It's just a theory. Hard to know, for sure. And maybe part of the aggravating factor as to why prices are where they are. But that's just a theory at the time being and hard to prove.","Arun Viswanathan","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And at this time, I would like to turn the call back to Dave Ryan for closing remarks.","Dave Ryan","Okay. I would like to thank everyone for your questions and participation in today's conference.

I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today\u2019s call, Mr. Lorin Crenshaw, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations. Please proceed.","Lorin Crenshaw","Thank you, Frances, and welcome, everyone, to Albemarle's Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. Our earnings released after the close of the market yesterday, and you'll find our press release, earnings presentation and non-GAAP reconciliations posted on our website under the Investors section at albemarle.com.","Joining me on the call today are Luke Kissam, Chief Executive Officer; Scott Tozier, Chief Financial Officer; Matt Juneau, President, Performance Chemicals; and Michael Wilson, President, Catalyst Solutions.","As an initial matter, I would like to note that our discussion today will include statements regarding the proposed merger between Albemarle Corporation and Rockwood Holdings. Certain statements regarding this transaction as well as certain statements related to Albemarle's plans, strategy and expectations regarding the future performance of the company may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws. Please note the cautionary language about our forward-looking statements contained in our filings with the SEC, including those related to the transaction. That same language applies to the statements today.","Please note that our comments today regarding our financial results exclude discontinued operations, special and non-operating items. Reconciliations related to any non-GAAP financial measures discussed may be found in our press release or earnings presentation, which are posted on our website. You should also know that this discussion does not constitute an offer to sell or solicitation of an offer to buy any securities or solicitation of any vote or approval.","Our filings with the SEC related to the transaction contain important information the proposed transaction. Stockholders and investors should review those filings carefully. They can be obtained free of charge from the SEC\u2019s website, from our Investor Relations website or by calling our Investor Relations Department at 225-388-7322. ","With that, I'll turn the call over to Luke.","Luther C. Kissam","Thanks, Lorin, and good morning, everybody. I\u2019ll start with some comments on the quarter, Scott will review the performance of our business segments and financial results, before providing perspective on our outlook for the rest of the year. I\u2019ll end by providing an update on the Rockwood transaction. At the end of our prepared remarks, Matt and Michael would join us to address your questions. ","Third quarter results exceeded our expectations heading into the quarter, with earnings per share $1.14, up 5% year-over-year and up 4% sequentially. Net sales of $642 million also showed solid growth, 9% year-over-year and up 6% sequentially. EBITDA was $145 million and EBITDA margins were 23%. ","All in all, this was a very good quarter. Scott will go into the details, but our performance was primarily driven by Catalyst Solutions, which has a great year so far with 27% segment income growth through the first nine months versus the comparable period of 2013. ","Third quarter Catalyst results reflected solid refinery and polyolefin catalysts volume growth year-over-year and positive refinery catalyst pricing. Our catalysts team delivered these results while safely and successfully brining on line additional capacity at our Bayport FCC plant which is a credit to the focus of each of the employees involved as they executed plant turnaround without missing a beat. To date, this expansion which was necessary to meet the projected demand of our existing customers is reducing own spec TOPAZ catalysts at expected operational rates. ","Catalyst performance offset weaker-than-expected results within Performance Chemicals. Performance Chemicals\u2019 profits declined year-over-year on lower Fire Safety Solutions pricing and operational issues at some of our bromine units which led to higher manufacturing costs. These headwinds were partially offset by better pricing in specialty chemicals and higher volumes across the GBU. ","Heading into November, these operational issues appear to be behind us. As we announced during the quarter Albemarle and Israel Chemicals agreed to establish a manufacturing joint venture for a bromine based polymeric flame retardant to replace HBCD in the construction end markets. HBCD is being phased out in the European Union and other countries. ","The joint venture will own two plants, one in the Netherlands which is already in operation and producing commercial volumes and one in Israel which is scheduled to come on line within the next few months. The transaction is subject to certain closing conditions, including regulatory approval, but is expected to close in 2015. This venture represents the most cost effective and timely means for us to bring our GreenCrest product to the market. ","We were also pleased to close the previously announced sale of our antioxidant, ibuprofen and propofol businesses to SI Group in the third quarter and received the associated cash proceeds from the sale. The divestiture improves our overall company margins, tightens our focus and places these assets into the hands of a company with a more strategic focus in those end markets. ","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Scott, to discuss our business results and outlook. ","Scott A. Tozier","Thanks, Luke. I\u2019m pleased to report that the third quarter came in better than we expected. Those results increase our confidence that we will deliver annual earnings growth well in that (7:40) 2% to 7% range that we shared in January. Overall, third quarter net sales rose 9% year-over-year to $642 million and we delivered segment income of $140 million, up 3% and segment margins of 22%. ","Three special items impacted our results this quarter. First, we had acquisition and financial costs related to the Rockwood transaction of approximately $11 million after tax or $0.14 per share. We also had a $0.01 per share expense related to non-operating pension and OPEB items, offset by a $0.02 per share tax-related gain. ","In addition, we reported $6.7 million after tax or $0.08 per share in losses related to discontinued operations. These items led to a loss of approximately $0.21 per share, which added back to our reported EPS of $0.93 gets you to our adjusted EPS of $1.14 for the period. ","Now, let me turn to the business details. Catalyst delivered an outstanding quarter with net sales of $278 million, up 23% year-over-year. Segment income was $60 million, up 18%, and segment margins of 22%. ","As we discussed in July, margins were negatively impacted year-over-year and sequentially by lower production rates in Bayport during our previously announced turnaround and initial sales of AlkyClean, a solid asset, alkylation catalyst designed to increase the refineries octane yield. If I adjust for these two items, segment margin would have been around 25%. ","With Refinery Catalyst Solutions, higher FCC and CFT pricing and higher CFT volumes year-over-year have a favorable impact on the quarter. CFT volumes were up double digits even without the benefit of the AlkyClean orders. As a result, Refinery Catalyst Solutions achieved another quarter of double-digit sales and profit growth year-over-year. ","Performance Catalysts Solutions delivered a second consecutive quarter of solid growth. Volumes and profits were up double digits year-over-year on growth and demand for polyolefin catalyst components and good traction within finished catalysts from both the volume and new product standpoint.","Performance Chemicals reported third quarter net sales of $365 million, flat year-over-year and segment income of $80 million, down 7% and segment margins of 22%. These results reflected Fine Chemistry Services and Specialty Chemical profit growth offset by lower Fire Safety Solutions profits. ","Fine Chemistry Services reported its highest profit quarter of the year largely driven by exceptional volumes within the pharmaceutical end market in particular where we able to move quickly accommodate a particularly large order and several other small orders this quarter. We were able to respond to these opportunities due to the flexibility and quality of our manufacturing assets and our ability to quickly move products to market. ","It is noteworthy that this division delivered excellent quarterly profit margins despite the headwind of not being able to recognize approximately $3 million of profit on the shipment to SIGA Technologies, a custom pharmaceuticals customer that filed for bankruptcy during the quarter. ","These orders helped in filling the gap we had from the contract loss that we discussed in the second quarter. Specialty Chemicals reported strong volume and profit growth year-over-year. Results were driven by strong methobromide volumes and continued strong curatives results.","Clear Completion Fluids demand improved where the customer specific inventory management issues reflect last quarter subsided, resulting in a sharp improvement in sequential volume and profit levels. ","Within First Safety Solutions, revenue was lower and profits were down double digits year-over-year, reflecting weaker pricing across the bulk of our brominated flame-retardant portfolio, less favorable mix and operational issues at some of our units which led to higher manufacturing costs. As Luke noted earlier, the operational issues are now behind us. ","Brominated flame-retardant volumes in the quarter were up year-over-year and we expect full year volumes to rise in the low-to-mid single digit range. In addition, as we have said all year, our order book trends continue to indicate a gradual mix shift in our electronics portfolio toward servers, automotive electronics and other growing digital applications with a corresponding decline in exposure to the slower growing PC and TV enclosure end markets. ","If we look at our total bromine portfolio across the Fire Safety Solutions and Specialty Chemicals division, we actually saw volume growth of 8% year-over-year, revenue growth of 3% and margins north of 30%. We would also expect to see a continuation of the trend toward less bromine being used in flame-retardant applications as other applications continue to grow faster. Moving on to a few P&L items, SG&A expenses were $66 million during the quarter and R&D expense ended the quarter at $22 million, both in line with expectations. ","Year-to-date free cash flow, defined as cash flow from operations adding that pension contributions and subtracting capital expenditures was a $112 million for the quarter and has risen over 80% versus the year-ago period driven by the continued in working capital and lower CapEx spend. ","As previously announced, our goal is to permanently reduce working capital by at least $100 million by the end of 2015 as part of a broader supply chain transformation initiative. We continue to make excellent progress and we actually hit our goal this quarter, net working capital was down to 23.7% of revenue which represents $105 million of cash savings from year-end 2013. ","With our major bromine and catalyst related growth projects behind us, we continue to benefit from lower CapEx this year and are tracking toward $100 million to $120 million, in line with our prior full-year guidance. For the third quarter 2014, CapEx was $30 million and totaled $77 million year to date. This represents over a 40% decline versus the comparable period of 2013. ","We saw a 27% sequential increase in our cash balances to $653 million, reflecting the combination of the receipt of the proceeds from the sale of our antioxidant, ibuprofen and propofol businesses and lower working capital. As a result, net debt, excluding non-guaranteed JV debt, ended the period at $393 million, or just 0.7 times EBTIDA as we continue to position ourselves to fund the upcoming Rockwood acquisition. ","Our effective tax rate, excluding special items, non-operating pension and OPEB items, for the quarter was 18.9%, down 360 basis points year-over-year. At this time, with the same exclusions, we expect our full-year rate to be 21.7% driven by the favorable mix of income in lower tax jurisdictions. ","I\u2019d like to close my remarks with our outlook for the balance of the year. Catalyst Solutions is tracking nicely toward our target of year-over-year double digit segment income growth with a good balance in both volume and pricing gains contributing to that growth. Performance Catalyst Solutions is performing in line with expectations with top line volume growth, offset by higher costs and tough market dynamics. ","The Refinery Catalyst Solutions division has been the largest contributor to growth. Heavy oil upgrading is benefitting from continued strong demand globally for our FCC catalysts designed to handle heavy resin-based feedstocks and maximize propylene yield. We are also benefitting from our previously announced price increase. ","Similarly, Clean Fuel Technologies is on track to deliver strong double digit profit growth for the year, despite relatively flat annual volumes driven by favorable mix. Overall, our outlook for Catalyst Solutions still calls for fourth quarter segment income near second quarter levels which would result in double digit earnings growth for the full year. ","Turning to Performance Chemicals, in terms of brominated flame-retardants our assessment of the market and our order book trends continue to lead us to assume as we have all year that while volume trends continue to stabilize in most applications, pricing remains relatively soft and we don\u2019t expect absolute growth in earnings or volumes year-over-year. ","The Fine Chemistry Services division is working hard to replace the major contract that was lost during the second quarter in time to impact 2015 and made progress toward that goal during the third quarter. ","Overall, we continue to expect segment income from Performance Chemicals to come in below 2013 levels as we indicated on our July earnings call. Given the moving parts and normally weaker fourth quarter in flame retardants, we expect Q4 income to be flat for this business versus 2013. ","As we enroll all of the various factors up by business and account for the excellent third quarter results, we are confident in our ability to deliver earnings growth for the full year, that is well within the range that we share in January. ","And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Luke. ","Luther C. Kissam","Thanks, Scott. Let me take a few minutes to update you on the Rockwood transaction. First of all, with each interaction with the leadership teams of the two Rockwood businesses, I grow increasingly excited about the growth opportunities ahead for our combined company. ","As you know, Albemarle has been pursuing an entry into the lithium market for some time. It is clear from the S-4 disclosures that both the Rockwood and Albemarle boards have recognized the strategic fit of our two companies and the value of a possible combination for over two years. ","Let me give you a little more color as to why. From an operational standpoint, Albemarle starts with brine produces bromine and derivatizes that bromine into higher value bromine salts and organic bromine derivatives like flame retardants. Similarly, Rockwood with the ore or brine to produce lithium salts, including lithium carbonate and lithium hydroxide. We expect cost savings and efficiencies by sharing technology and knowhow related to these processes. ","In addition, both companies have expertise in handling metal alkyls which are highly flammable pyrophoric materials. Albemarle is a leader in aluminum alkylage used in polyolefin production and Rockwood is a leader in lithium alkyls used in among markets synthetic rubber production. There is a tremendous amount of knowhow and expertise in the production, packaging, shipping and container fleet management of alkyls. And we are confident that sharing that knowhow will present opportunities for significant supply chain and manufacturing efficiencies. ","From a customer standpoint, lithium and bromine derivatives overlap in serving a number of global end markets, including consumer electronics, automotive, polymers, Ag and pharmaceuticals, and the combination will provide increased customer reach and access. ","Likewise, Albemarle\u2019s aluminum alkyls and Rockwood lithium alkyls serve both the polyolefin and synthetic rubber markets. Having one company, they can provide both lithium and aluminum alkyls for production of different polymer types, should result in increased selling opportunities for the combined entity. ","Ultimately, by bringing these businesses together, we will be able to provide customers with a broader set of value added solutions in a more efficient manner. That should drive revenue and profit growth as well as margin expansion. None of these types of synergies are included within our previously announced synergy target. Obviously, these benefits cannot be achieved without first successfully integrating our two organizations. ","Since we announced the acquisition, our integration team has been hard at work preparing to combine our two companies and developing detailed plans to capture the $100 million in cost synergies we identified. Overall, I am more confident today in our ability to deliver these synergies within that two year time horizon. ","I am also more confident that we can obtain these synergies without negatively impacting how Rockwood goes to market and serves its customers. Our integration team which includes members from both companies has been meeting regularly with a focus on being ready for day one opportunities and planning for realization of synergies. They have identified concrete plans that give us a clear path to achievement of the $100 million in synergies within the first two years. ","We expect about half of the synergies to result from the elimination of duplicate overhead and back office costs, the remainder will come from leveraging our increased scale to lower sourcing costs, asset and site consolidations, implementing the best practices of both companies across the whole and a more streamlined organizational structure with fewer layers of management. We expect to realize at least $30 million of synergies on day one and at least, $50 million in the first year. ","Let me give you a bit more detail on the sources of above and beyond duplicative costs. The first opportunity will come from improving the manufacturing operations, primarily by applying best practices and our increased purchasing power to reduce spending in areas such as maintenance, storage and other services. The second opportunity includes several major initiatives to realize significant savings through better supply chain management, leveraging the new scale of the business to our advantage. ","We believe the largest savings will come from redesigning our distribution network, leveraging the same suppler contracts for different materials, warehouses, transportation and services and expanding centralized purchasing of raw materials and services.","The third opportunity comes from site consolidations around the world where we have duplicative sales offices and facilities. While we are still working through the diligence process of all facilities, Rockwood and Albemarle have a number of sites within a very close proximity of each other. And we have a team reviewing possible opportunities within the plant manufacturing units as well. ","The fourth major opportunity includes IT rationalization of wide and local area networks, applications and infrastructure which will provide for further savings. An additional medium term opportunity is using shared services to consolidate back office activities into Albemarle\u2019s existing low cost, shared service centers and common platforms.","As you can see, we\u2019re focused on lower value, high cost activities that will not affect Rockwood\u2019s customer service or market strategies. From a regulatory perspective, things are moving forward as expected. ","In the United States, the Hartt-Scott-Rodino waiting period expired on September 8. We also recently received clearance from Turkey, Taiwan and Russia and clearance is currently expected from Korea before the shareholder meeting. We expect unconditional clearance from the European Commission at the end of the phase one period on November 13.","Finally, we are currently in pre-acceptance review with the Ministry of Commerce of the Peoples Republic of China. We have had good engagement with the China regulatory authorities and do not anticipate any substantive antitrust problems to arise during the review. We expect to receive China clearance during the first quarter of 2015. ","In August, we successfully syndicated each component of the financing required to fund this transaction across our bank group. In addition, although we were prepared with committed financing to close the deal without cash proceeds from the sale of Rockwood\u2019s pigment business to Huntsman, we were pleased to see the October 1 close of that deal and receipt by Rockwood of the associated $950 million in cash proceeds.","With these milestones behind us and continued strong cash generation, we are well positioned financially to close this transaction as soon as shareholder and regulatory approvals are in hand. In summation, the Albemarle businesses delivered strong third quarter results despite certain obstacles and we are right on track to achieve the full year 2014 earnings growth well within the 2% to 7% range that the forecasted in January. ","Integration planning is on track and I am seeing promising early results. I am confident in our ability to achieve the $100 million of synergies within the first two years. I am excited about the long-term growth potential for the combined company and our potential to deliver more consistent and predictable earnings growth for our shareholders.","This combination creates a platform of businesses which will generate tremendous cash flow. We will use that cash to rapidly deleverage while continuing to invest in the businesses and return capital to shareholders to drive future returns.","The bottom line is that the combination of Albemarle and Rockwood is a tremendously compelling both from a strategic and financial perspective. We have great confidence in our ability to deliver significant value to shareholders over the long term, bringing these two companies together and I am looking forward to closing the deal as soon as possible.","With that, at this time, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Lorin for question and answers.","Lorin Crenshaw","Operator, we\u2019re ready to open the lines for Q&A. And I would just remind everyone to please limit your questions to two per person at one time, so everyone have the chance, then feel free to get back in the queue for follow-ons if time allows. Please proceed, operator.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Bob Koort representing Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Robert Koort \u2013 Goldman Sachs ","Thanks. Good morning.","Luther C. Kissam ","Hey, Bob.","Scott A. Tozier","Hey, Bob.","Robert Koort \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Luke, I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about what you seen on oil price, in fact, on both your catalyst business and clear brine fluids business?","Luther C. Kissam","Yes. I appreciate the question. From an oil standpoint, oil price standpoint, we really don\u2019t see a impact on the catalyst business. The oil price, that catalyst demand is really driven more by transportation fuel demand and demand for plastics. In the oil price, we haven\u2019t seen and don\u2019t expect it to have any significant impact on our catalyst business. From a clear completion fluids business, I think you have to break it down whether it\u2019s a \u2013 you\u2019re just drilling a well in a new field, in an existing field, whether you are using a \u2013 extending an existing field or whether it\u2019s a new brownfield project, there has been a lot of conversations, but, if you look at Halliburton, Baker Hughes, Schlumberger and the oil companies on the impact, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re expecting to see any short-term impact, but if oil stays down at that $80 or less barrel, I think you are going to see some of those projects longer term, start pulling back. So we could see an impact not in the short term, but in the longer term, you need to see oil stay down this way for an extended period of time to have that impact, Bob.","Robert Koort \u2013 Goldman Sachs","And then my follow-up in the bromine flame retardant business, you talked about some volume improvement, and I guess our expectation is in a relatively narrow market as a competitive dynamic, maybe that should lead to some better pricing, but you continue to see weak price, and can you explain why that\u2019s happening and if there is any opportunity maybe to see some stabilization there?","Luther C. Kissam","Yes. I think year over year, we\u2019re talking about price degradation. So we\u2019ve seen price degradation year over year as we thought we would. Sequentially, I think we\u2019ve seen some more price stabilization. One of the big things that you\u2019ve seen is in the transition from HBCD to the polymeric flame retardant that is underway and we\u2019ve seen some real pricing pressure there both in the new product as well as in HBCD which makes up a lot of the year over year decline. And so, that\u2019s what I\u2019d say about that on a year-over-year basis. But sequentially, it\u2019s not as down as much. And Matt, you want to add any further color to that? ","Matthew K. Juneau","I think Luke has got it right, that\u2019s the right message, Bob. If you look at the HBCD situation, just expanding on that a little bit, remember that\u2019s a construction organic product, it\u2019s very dependent on Europe and as we are in this transition, there has been increasing pressure on HBCD as companies move to the polymeric, plus the weakening economy that we saw in the latter part of the quarters in Europe especially, had some additional impact. On the other spaces in FR, honestly, we continue to see signs of stabilization and less sequential issues, we\u2019re really comparing a year-over-year problem.","Luther C. Kissam","But, Bob, we are always looking for ways to drive value. So, we certainly look for opportunities on a product by product basis where we can move those prices.","Robert Koort \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Got it. Thank you very much.","Luther C. Kissam","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Begleiter representing Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","David Begleiter \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Thank you. Good morning. ","Luther C. Kissam","Hey, Dave.","Scott A. Tozier","Hey, Dave.","David Begleiter \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Luke, very strong results in catalysts. First, on the pricing and really on the FCC pricing, what types of realizations have you seen here and what\u2019s potential for further FCC price increases going forward?","Luther C. Kissam","I\u2019ll turn it over to Michael to address those. But, you remember we announced over a year ago that we were looking at a 10% price increase in FCC catalysts and we would \u2013 that would take about two to three years to implement given the way that the contracts roll and I think we\u2019re right on track where we thought we would be with regard to pricing overall. I mean, there is some pockets here and pockets there, but overall, we are right on track where we ought to be. Michael?","D. Michael Wilson","Yes. I think not to get too granular, as I look across the entire GBU and look at the price impact on revenue, prices have contributed sort of low single digit percentages to overall revenue growth for the year and so \u2013 ","David Begleiter \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay. ","D. Michael Wilson","Refinery catalyst, I mean, we\u2019ve said all along there has been price pressure on the Performance Catalysts Solutions side particularly in polyolefin. or the products going into polyolefin. So, most of the benefit has been refinery catalyst.","David Begleiter \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Understood. And on the volume growth in the quarter, which is a high water mark, how should that trend in Q4? And how much of that was initial \u2013 can you break down the 20% a little bit more granularly in terms of sustainability and one-off items?","Luther C. Kissam","Yes. When you look at that, I mean, it\u2019s really across both of our refinery and catalyst businesses, so both the Heavy Oil Upgrading or FCC business and Clean Fuels. The biggest volume gain that we saw in the third quarter in terms of year-over-year comparisons was in the Clean Fuels Technologies and we did have a significant sale of a new product that we\u2019ve talked about both on prior calls and in our opening comments here that benefited us. But I think the better way to look at is to sort of take the whole year and I think about the forecast for the whole year on a volume basis and we\u2019re going to see sort of across refinery and catalyst high-single digits of volume growth and that\u2019ll be a little bit higher on the FCC side than the CFT side.","David Begleiter \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews representing Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Vincent Andrews \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Thank you, and good morning everyone. Could you just give us a sense on margins as we trend through 4Q and into 1Q, and I guess into the full your next year, what should the year-over-year progression in margins be? Have we seen the bottoming out, and we should start to see improvement, or what's the cadence going to look like? ","Luther C. Kissam","We\u2019re just rolling up our annual operating plan. We are in the middle of that right now and it always rolls up, always get it back a little bit and get some cost out from the wish list and all that, but \u2013 so I don\u2019t really have a feel for next year. I don\u2019t see anything dropping off the fact of the earth. I think you would kind of see similar types of margins on a full year run rate basis that we would see in the second half at a very, very high level for the Albemarle businesses. But, with regard to the quarters, there\u2019s always some lumpiness in the quarter, but I wouldn\u2019t see a whole lot of change from third to fourth, it\u2019s about where I would see it. ","Vincent Andrews \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay. And just on foreign exchange, if we hold the existing rates constant, can you just give us a sense of the, with the pretty big move coming out of the third quarter, how should we be thinking about transactional and translational heading into 4Q and into next year?","Luther C. Kissam","Yes. I\u2019ll turn it over to Scott.","Scott A. Tozier","Yes. So, the two big foreign exchange exposures that we have are in the Euro and the Japanese Yen as we previously talked about. So \u2013 and both have had relatively high moves in the last month. So, if I look at the fourth quarter, there is about \u2013 if I look at the Euro, there is probably about $1.5million of pressure on Op profit from the Euro and about $10 million in revenue, and from the Yen, it is probably about the same amount, $1.5 million of our profit and the same in revenue. Normally, on a full year basis, the Euro is a bit more balanced and it just depends on the mix of what we\u2019re shipping. So, the Euro will generally run about $1 million a year for a 1% move and the Yen is about the same. So, 1% move in the Yen rate will generate about $1 million. So depending what\u2019s going on an annual basis.","Vincent Andrews \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay. Thanks so much. I\u2019ll pass it along.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy, representing Bank of America. Please proceed.","Kevin McCarthy \u2013 Bank of America","Yes. Good morning.","Luther C. Kissam","Hey","Kevin McCarthy \u2013 Bank of America"," Luke, if we rewind to your last call in late July, I think you had sent somewhat more cautious signals referencing the customer order that you lost in Asia in Performance Chemicals and so forth and I know the results are coming in quite a bit better than expected. So, at a very high level, can you just kind of walk us through maybe the two or three most important variances and which particular businesses trended better than you might have expected a few months ago?","Luther C. Kissam","Yes. So, if we look back as we said on the call, catalysts outperformed a little bit, better than we expected particularly in Performance Catalysts Solutions where we saw higher profitability than we expected. The big \u2013 the other two big changes what I would say was, in July, we did not have a feel for the \u2013 that big order that we lost in the custom services business, and we said it was about $15 million over the second half of the year. So we were looking at that as a gap.","Kevin McCarthy \u2013 Bank of America","Right.","Luther C. Kissam","I think it\u2019s in Scott\u2019s comments we were able \u2013 had some \u2013 do a lot of hard work, there was some sales that we were able to fill our assets with and that\u2019s a real tribute to those employees and the flexibility of those assets, but they were opportunistic and they are one time, so they got to do it again. And so we feel that that was a big mover and then we had some methyl bromide that we talked about that was hard than we expected that we didn\u2019t expect in July that came through. So, those are the big buckets right there. Big month of bromide sales and good working custom services and then tax helped us as well.","Kevin McCarthy \u2013 Bank of America","That\u2019s helpful. As a second question, your tax rate is coming down appreciably this year, you referenced 21.7%, what are your thoughts on how that might trend in 2015 for legacy Albemarle and if you were to layer in the Rockwood business, how might that affect 2015 rate as well?","Luther C. Kissam","Yes. I\u2019m going to give that to Scott. What I think though I \u2013 we\u2019re going to really work really hard, not to say legacy Albemarle and the new Rockwood businesses, it\u2019s grow \u2013 when we close the sucker we\u2019re going to all be one company. So, we\u2019re going to \u2013 he\u2019ll talk to you about what it will be as standalone and together. Okay, Kevin, is that fair?","Luther C. Kissam","Yes, I\u2019ll buy that. Yes.","Scott A. Tozier","On the former Albemarle company, the big driver as we always talk about is really where the income is being generated, and in the third quarter, really driven by the strong results out of our hydro processing catalyst business; we had great results coming out of Europe which is a lower tax jurisdiction for us. And so that\u2019s what drives our tax rates down as you look at the full year basis. And so, we generally are \u2013 we\u2019re trying to watch and plan out where those incomes are and so, as you go into 2015 as Luke said, the AOP is till stock coming together, we really don\u2019t have a good sense of how that mix will come in, I would guide people to that 24% to 25% range because that\u2019s the balanced view of performance across our various regions. ","Kevin McCarthy \u2013 Bank of America","Okay.","Scott A. Tozier","As you look at the combination of the companies, we\u2019ve been planning \u2013 the Rockwood tax rate is a little bit higher and so we\u2019ve been guiding people to the 25% to 26% range from of effective tax rate. ","Kevin McCarthy \u2013 Bank of America","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And I guess at the risk of overstaying my welcome here, I was wondering if I might ask a clarifying question related to your adjusted EPS, you\u2019ve got quite a few different special items as you enumerated, one of the line items was amortization of financing fees of $7 million pretax or about $0.06 per share.","Scott A. Tozier","Yes.","Kevin McCarthy \u2013 Bank of America","Are you backing that out or leaving it in the number of a $1.14 adjusted EPS?","Scott A. Tozier","No that has been backed out of the $1.14. So that is not \u2013 ","Kevin McCarthy \u2013 Bank of America","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn representing Longbow Research. Please proceed.","Dmitry Silversteyn \u2013 Longbow Research","Good morning and congratulations on a stronger quarter. A couple of questions if I may, first of all, revisiting the first question on the catalyst business and sustainability of the 20% growth in volume, you sounded like most of that was or a large extent was driven by HBC catalysts, that tempts to be a fairly lumpy business, so as we are looking today into the fourth quarter, was there any sort of one-time shipments that we should not project into the fourth quarter and is the overall volume, given the year-ago comps likely to be higher or lower of next year? Or not comparing, not next year, in the fourth quarter?","Scott A. Tozier","Well, for the fourth quarter, they really talk about refinery catalyst in two pieces, if I look at the FCC or heavy oil upgrading, we\u2018ll definitely be up in volume quarter over quarter since prior year and CFT, just from a timing of order standpoint, I expect that CFT volumes will be down just \u2013 if you remember we had a blockbuster quarter in CFT in the fourth quarter of the last year with some really large orders that went through, so \u2013 ","Dmitry Silversteyn \u2013 Longbow Research","Okay. So, if I look at it net-net, that volume number for the fourth quarter should be closer to zero?"," Scott A. Tozier","Across all of refinery catalysts?","Dmitry Silversteyn \u2013 Longbow Research","Correct. ","Scott A. Tozier","Yes. I\u2019m not sure. I don\u2019t really look at it that way. Again, I\u2019d go back to the comment I made earlier that if I look at the full year, year over year, we\u2019re going to have sort of high-single digit volume growth across refinery catalysts. The FCC or HOU piece is likely to be closer to double digits. ","Dmitry Silversteyn \u2013 Longbow Research","Got it, okay. And then second question on or is a follow-up on the catalyst question, you mentioned metals pricing and rare earth surcharges, if you look at the third quarter results on year-over-year basis, were they surcharges for FCC, or rare earth high or lower, also, has there been move quarterly from the second quarter to the third quarter, and as you look out to your sort of raw material the molybdenum, the nickel, the cobalt, the rare pricing for 2015, would you expect there to be a little bit of an inflation or a little bit of a deflation going into 2015?","Scott A. Tozier","The metal surcharges that were in the third quarter are really very minor. And in fact, I wouldn\u2019t characterize those as surcharges, I would characterize those as the pass-through of metal costs that are in our basic formulas in our CFT business. So, it\u2019s predominantly to mole, but to your broader question, as I look at the prices of the those metals across the year, they\u2019ve been trading in fairly tight range, I mean they move up a quarter and move down a quarter. We don\u2019t see anything that\u2019s going to have sort of a long-term significant impact on metals prices now or as we look into 2015. It\u2019s really been a fairly stable market. ","Luther C. Kissam","So, Dmitry, this is Luke. We are not anticipating anything on rare earth like we saw a few years ago, that significant spike in the rare earth pricing. And we are also not expecting the decline in the mole pricing that we saw at the end of 2008 where we got stuck with all that inventory. We watch it consistently. We don\u2019t see any big wild swings approaching us right now, but we remain ever vigilant. ","Dmitry Silversteyn \u2013 Longbow Research","Okay. So if I can finish off the question, the thought, if you look at the FCC pricing where you talk about pricing being up, that would be up exclusive of rare earth surcharges or maybe even overcoming the rare earth surcharges if they are coming.","Scott A. Tozier","I mean you ought to look at rare earth surcharges year-over-year as essentially flat. ","Dmitry Silversteyn \u2013 Longbow Research","Okay. So pricing was real pricing there?","Scott A. Tozier","Is real pricing, that\u2019s exactly, that\u2019s the point, that\u2019s right. ","Dmitry Silversteyn \u2013 Longbow Research","That\u2019s great. Thank you. That\u2019s all I have. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Sison representing KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Mike Sison \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","Hey, guys. How are you doing? A nice quarter. You noted increased confidence in integration synergy for the transaction which is great, can you talk a little bit about your confidence about, regarding long-term growth prospects of lithium and surface treatment, have you spent any more time on that front over the last couple of months?","Luther C. Kissam","Yes, we have, we look at it and had some more time with that leadership and I\u2019m more \u2013 I am just as confident, not wavering at all on the growth aspects long term for lithium as well as for that surface treatment business. They\u2019ve got great plants in place, good team in place to be able to drive that growth and we are excited about closing that deal and getting altogether and pushing it forward. ","Mike Sison \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets"," Great. And then just a follow-up question on bromine pricing, was that \u2013 is the weakness global or is it sort of isolated still China and India? And when you think about what could \u2013 what you need to happen to see price increases improve in 2015? And maybe comment on those tax increases from the Israelis here that could probably help as well. Just maybe your thoughts on what\u2019s going to help pricing as we head into over the 12 to 24 months?","Luther C. Kissam","Yes. There has been a lot of press about the tax in Israel. So, let me start with that. It is so new, I know there has been some analyst reports out on it, we obviously look at that, it is very difficult right now to tell exactly the impact that will have, but I caution everybody that that tax goes into play in 2017, not 2015. So there may be a longer-term impact, but for the short term, so there\u2019ll be no tax impact there. So it\u2019s something we\u2019re keeping our eye on, but a lot can change between now and 2017. So with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Matt. ","Matthew K. Juneau","So, Mike, as we talked before, the pricing issues have been much more around India and China than the rest of the world and that probably still continues. So, I would say you are right in your analysis that that\u2019s places to watch it out for. And then, if it goes global, it gets back more to like we talked about HBCD where it\u2019s a specific product in issue because of specific circumstances like we\u2019re seeing going on with the HBCD, HBCD transition to the polymeric flame retardant. ","Mike Sison \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","Great, thank you.","Luther C. Kissam","Amen.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander representing Jefferies. ","Laurence Alexander \u2013 Jefferies","Good morning.","Scott A. Tozier","Hey. ","Luther C. Kissam","Hey, Laurence. ","Laurence Alexander \u2013 Jefferies","So two simple ones, on the working capital improvement, was there an associated earnings headwind from that and what are your new working capital targets? And secondly, just to clarify on the ramp up at TAKREER, what\u2019s your current thinking about potential Tier 1s into next year, I mean any way to quantify the range?","Scott A. Tozier"," Yes. So, on the working capital \u2013 let me take the working capital and then Michael can handle the TAKREER question. So working capital, like we said, was below our target, so below 24%, really five quarters are early than we expected, so our challenge right now is to make sure that those reductions are permanent where there is a lot of work to go into making sure that the processes are going to deliver that kind of result on a ongoing basis. So, that\u2019s really the focus. So, at least for right now, our focus on making those process changes permanent and not just a one-time result. From an earnings perspective, certainly, as we planned for at the beginning of the year, with those working capital targets, as you look at the first nine months, there\u2019s probably about a $15 million to $20 million cost headwind from our manufacturing variances as a result of that. So we wanted to \u2013 let me say that differently, in order to maintain the inventory levels that we have at the end of last year through this nine-month period, there have been another roughly, call it, $20 million of manufacturing absorption in our numbers. And so, we think this is the right answer for the company, the right balance between both the earnings as well as the cash generation that we have to perform, deliver to you on an ongoing basis. Michael, you want to talk about the TAKREER situation? ","D. Michael Wilson","Yes. In terms of the TAKREER refinery, I mean the latest information we have is that the refinery is slated or start-up in the end of the fourth quarter, so December time frame, however, this is a massive project. So, commissioning on the unit has already begun as we indicated at our end of second quarter call. We\u2019ve begun supplying initial shipments of catalyst to the refinery in anticipation of a start-up. It\u2019s very hard to predict on a refinery this size and complexity. How quickly it will get up to sort of steady state run rates, I mean that could take a quarter, could take two quarters etcetera. So, there is no question that TAKREER will benefit us in terms of our heavy oil upgrading, FCC catalyst volumes in 2015, but we\u2019ll probably be cautious about how quickly that will ramp up in terms of impact as we go through each quarter of the year. ","Laurence Alexander \u2013 Jefferies","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Sheehan representing \u2013 SunTrust. Please proceed.","James Sheehan \u2013 SunTrust","Good morning. Just a follow-up on the Israeli tax increase, if that goes through in 2017, how would that affect your JV plans in Israel, how do you see the economics playing out there and what is your view on the influence that this tax should have on industry dynamics?","Luther C. Kissam","Yes. I want to be clear, I mean, first of all, let\u2019s be absolutely positive to everybody out there what joint venture we\u2019re talking about, joint bromine company which is located in Jordan where we can produce derivatives as well as our largest bromine production unit, has no impact at all, is not affected at all by this Israeli tax increase. We do have entered into a joint venture, an agreement to form a joint venture with the Israeli chemical company related to the GreenCrest product and we knew there was a possibility of this tax when we were going in and it will have some impact on costs, but it\u2019ll be minimal for our overall brominated portfolio, it\u2019s how I would say it. If you look at industry overall, it\u2019s too early to tell, I mean if it\u2019s going to \u2013 I don\u2019t know how it\u2019s going to be viewed, are they going to increase cost, always get nervous any time there\u2019s a tier taxing structure, because somebody is going to do the math to understand what the pricing ought to be to maximize their profitability and lower their taxes. So until we have a chance to study at more, I think \u2013 I don\u2019t know how it\u2019s going impact to us, but it\u2019s going to \u2013 if it increases cost, that means if ICL is going to need to do something to maintain their level of profitability and that could be a good thing long term. But again, this doesn\u2019t happen until 2017 and there\u2019s a lot of time between now and 2017 to see what happens. ","D. Michael Wilson","Maybe add one thing, remember this does have to go through the Israeli Knesset to \u2013 but at this point, it\u2019s still in committee recommendation.","James Sheehan representing \u2013 SunTrust","Thank you. And also on the lithium business with Rockwood, just wondering your views on the drop in oil prices and the possible impact that could have on the electric vehicle market, has the decline in oil changed your long term assumptions at all?","Luther C. Kissam","Well. First of all, I haven\u2019t changed my assumptions at all, because what I think what\u2019s driving the electronic vehicle adoption one, is not so much what the gas price is, it\u2019s more from an environmental standpoint, are we using less of the oil and can we develop a cost effective electronic vehicle and they are in the process of doing that. We also have excellent growth in lithium with or without that environment, with or without the electronic vehicles and this is, oil has got to be down for a long, long time in order for it to have an impact. So, overall, I don\u2019t really see the link as much, I think electronic vehicles, there is going to be a niche in the market, it\u2019s going to have a demand for that and it will continue to grow and I haven\u2019t backed off any way what I think our growth opportunities are for that lithum business.","James Sheehan representing \u2013 SunTrust","And just on the operational issues you had in Performance Chemicals, about how much business did you lose from that and do you expect to regain any in the fourth quarter?","Luther C. Kissam","Yes. I think, whenever you talk about operational issues, we know for a fact it added costs whether or not it actually cost this business and we missed some sales, it\u2019s hard to say, probably missed some, but those were third quarter sales, those people buy from us and buy from other people at the same time. So I don\u2019t see that\u2019s going to impact us going forward from a loss of business standpoint. I don\u2019t see a catch-up in the fourth quarter either. So I think it\u2019s business we could add, we lost and it cost us some extra money, it\u2019s behind us, and now we focus on going forward and delivering quality product to our customers on time and on spec.","James Sheehan representing \u2013 SunTrust","Thanks a lot. Luke.","Luther C. Kissam","Amen.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Kapsch representing Topeka Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Chris Kapsch \u2013 Topeka Capital Markets ","Good morning. Luke, you sound like you have increased confidence in the synergy target and appreciate the details surrounding the roadmap in order to drive and achieve those synergies, just wondering in the context of your comments about the combined company generating tremendous cash flow, wondering if, a couple of things, one, maybe quantify that. Also, what sort of cost are you going to incur in order to get after these synergies to accomplish the $100 million in run rate synergies and over what time? And are you contemplating any throttling back in CapEx for either company over the near term in order to help drive tremendous cash flow? Thanks.","Luther C. Kissam","Yes. If you look at \u2013 let me be short and get all those. I think the cash flow that we outlined in the S-4 is still our most up-to-date view on what that cash flow would be. So, nothing\u2019s changed on that. From a cost perspective, it is going to cost us somewhere to get a $100 million, it is going to cost us somewhere between a $150 million to $175 million to get that kind of cost as best we can look at it today. So a pretty good return on that investment. And from a CapEx standpoint, I think what we say consistently is we\u2019re in the 4% to 6% range of revenue for the combined company and we would expect that that would be consistent still from what we see going forward. I don\u2019t see a need to leverage back in the investments of these businesses in order to deleverage. That was all within our forecast within the S-4 and I still where we believe we are today. We generate sufficient cash to deleverage rapidly and invest in the business that we need to do to maintain those assets and grow the business.","Chris Kapsch \u2013 Topeka Capital Markets","Okay. Thanks. And then a follow-up, just parsing the commentary more near term about the pricing dynamic in brominated flame retardants, just want to understand if obviously with HBCD being phased out, I understand \u2013 I would expect the pricing pressure to intensify as that product line sunsets, just wondering if you could just \u2013 if you excluded the impact in pricing, overall pricing from that product line sequentially or brominated flame retardant \u2013 brominated flame retardant pricing, is it flat, is it up or is it still down a little bit sequentially, excluding the HBCD mix effect.","Luther C. Kissam","Yes. It\u2019s hard to \u2013 that\u2019s hard to say a broad statement about brominated flame retardant so rough because they are in such different applications. But what I would say broadly is they are flat sequentially.","Chris Kapsch \u2013 Topeka Capital Markets","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tyler Frank representing Robert Baird. Please proceed.","Tyler Frank \u2013 Robert Baird"," Hi, guys. A great third quarter. A quick question on sort of the Q4 guidance, obviously on the second quarter call, a little bit more cautious and now you maintain through sort of that, the same Q4 guidance that you did then, albeit you had a very, very strong third quarter and said that the operational issues that occurred during the quarter would now be over. So, I am just trying to get a sense for what you are seeing so far in the fourth quarter and what makes you still sort of have that cautious outlook?","Luther C. Kissam","Yes. Here is what I\u2019d would say, is I am confident in the fourth quarter. If you look at 2% to 7%, I am very confident in being at or above mid-point of that and if we get some things that break the right way, we got a chance to beat the upper end of that 2% to 7%. We got currency that\u2019s flowing through that, we\u2019ve got HBC with some sales that it forwards the very back end, it could slide one way or another. So, I\u2019m confident at mid point. I think as you look across the businesses though, we got to get some breaks to get to the upper end of that. So we feel really good about, that\u2019s why we said well within the range and we feel very confident about being able to deliver that.","Tyler Frank \u2013 Robert Baird","Great. And then, just as a follow-up, for the Rockwood transaction, seems like everything is growing as clean, what should we look for as sort of the next upcoming milestones and what are the biggest risks to the transaction that you see at this point?","Luther C.

I am confident on our ability that the shareholders will give you the vote that we need, we remain confident in talking to shareholders, we are excited about the possibility of getting this behind us, closing this deal, and all coming together to integrate these businesses and what I think is going to be the premier specialty chemical company in this space.","Tyler Frank \u2013 Robert Baird","Great.

Tozier - Albemarle Corp.","Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. In the third quarter, we again delivered on both key financial and operational commitments just as we have all year. Financially, our three core GBUs again performed very well, demonstrating the superior quality of our business portfolio. Excluding unfavorable currency impacts, these GBUs delivered adjusted EBITDA growth of 8% versus third quarter of 2014. Adjusted EBITDA margins for the three core GBUs were 31%, up from 29% in the third quarter last year, and 30% in the second quarter of this year, reflecting improved pricing and the increasing impact from synergies.","Performance Chemicals adjusted EBITDA increased by over 6% compared to the third quarter of 2014, an 11% excluding the impact of foreign exchange with the Lithium and PCS businesses driving the increase. Chemetall Surface Treatment adjusted EBITDA increased by 5%, and by 16% excluding the impact of foreign exchange.","For Refining Solutions, adjusted EBITDA was down just under 12% compared to the third quarter of 2014. It increased by 13% sequentially. Heavy Oil Upgrading or FCC catalysts had another very strong quarter while Clean Fuels Technologies or HPC catalyst results were again impacted by the current operating and competitive environment in refining. Including corporate and the three businesses targeted for divestiture, total company sales in the quarter totaled $905 million, down 9% from third quarter of 2014, with adjusted EBITDA of $235 million essentially flat. Adjusted EBITDA margins increased to 26% from 24% in third quarter of 2014. And excluding unfavorable currency exchange impacts, sales declined by 3%, but adjusted EBITDA increased by 6%.","There were several operational highlights in the quarter. Given the success of our integration efforts, we increased our 2016 synergy target by 20% from $100 million to $120 million. We generated $187 million of adjusted free cash flow in the third quarter, bringing year-to-date free cash flow of four onetime items to $405 million.","Finally, we completed the refinancing of the $1.25 billion and 4.625% 2020 senior notes assumed in the Rockwood acquisition and has since called those notes in mid-October. At current LIBOR rates, interest savings from the refinancing will approach $40 million on an annualized basis.","Before getting into the business details, I'll cover some of the detailed P&L and balance sheet items. Overall, for the third quarter, we reported all-in diluted earnings per share of $0.58 or $0.90 per share, excluding special items. There are a number of onetime special items during the quarter, the largest of these related to the Rockwood acquisition. The inventory step-up resulted in a $0.12 loss per share. Onetime acquisition and integration costs resulted in a $0.24 loss per share. Various land sales resulted in a gain of $0.04 per share. A full reconciliation of these items is in the press release.","The projection of our 2015 effective tax rate, excluding special items, non-operating pension and OPEB items remains at about 27% in line with second quarter guidance. We continue to expect capital expenditures of just over 6% of 2015 revenue, unchanged from our guidance at the end of the second quarter.","Operating working capital ended the third quarter at 26% of sales, unchanged from the level at the end of June. We expect to end the year at about the same level with a potential for slight improvement.","Our core businesses actually made good progress in the quarter. Working capital improved from 26% to 25% of sales, working capital dollars improved by $36 million, and we reduced average days of working capital by two. The issues in Fine Chemistry Services offset the core business gains as we built inventory in advance of expected fourth quarter sales.","Putting all of these pieces together, free cash flow, defined as cash flow from operations, adding back pension and post-retirement contributions and subtracting capital expenditures was at $405 million through September, excluding onetime synergy, acquisition and tax-related costs.","Based on the strong free cash flow in the third quarter and our forecast for the fourth, we are narrowing our full year free cash flow guidance before onetime costs to between $475 million and $525 million. Similarly, we are also narrowing guidance for the full year free cash flow including those onetime costs to $175 million to $225 million.","At the end of the third quarter, Albemarle's net debt-to-EBITDA ratio, as measured by our bank covenants, was 3.6 times. Our year-end projection is about 3.9 times prior to any impact from the divestitures with the increase from the end of the third quarter, driven by the timing of joint venture dividend payments.","Finally, as you can tell from my earlier comments, exchange rates continue to significantly impact our comparisons to 2014. Based on year-to-date results and an updated ranges of $1.08 to $1.12 per euro and \u00a5118 to \u00a5123 to the U.S. dollar, we expect negative year-over-year adjusted EBITDA impact of $55 million to $60 million with approximately $45 million of that impact already felt in our first three quarters of the year.","Our expected full year impact remains within our previous guidance of $50 million to $60 million with the currency declines against the dollar in emerging markets pushing guidance to the higher end of the range.","Now let me turn to business unit performance in the quarter. Before I address our three core GBUs, note that of our three businesses planned for divestiture, Minerals and Metal Sulfides performed in line with expectations in the third quarter and we expect that to continue for the full year.","Fine Chemistry Services continues to underperform versus expectations as well as against 2014, with third quarter adjusted EBITDA down by over $20 million versus third quarter 2014. And our forecasted full year adjusted EBITDA is now down by just over $40 million versus 2014 in that business.","Refining Solutions reported third quarter net sales of $185 million and adjusted EBITDA of $55 million with margins of 29%. Excluding unfavorable currency impacts, sales and adjusted EBITDA were down 11% and 6%, respectively, versus third quarter 2014. However, sequentially from the second quarter this year, adjusted EBITDA increased by 13%. While Clean Fuels Technologies volumes stabilized and were roughly flat with the third quarter 2014, profitability continues to be impacted by refinery cost-cutting initiatives in the current low oil price environment, weaker product mix and increased competition from euro-based competitors in markets where sales are made in U.S. dollars.","Heavy Oil Upgrading, or FCC catalyst, had an outstanding quarter, with sales and adjusted EBITDA both increasing by double-digit percentages compared to third quarter 2014. In fact, excluding quarters where rare earth surcharges had positive profitability impacts, the third quarter set a profitability record for HOU.","Our forecast for the refining solutions GBU is unchanged from the end of the second quarter, with full year EBITDA expected to be down roughly 20% versus 2014, with all of the decline in Clean Fuels Technologies. While we saw some volume stabilization in Clean Fuels Technologies, revenue and adjusted EBITDA comparisons continued to be negative compared to 2014. Heavy Oil Upgrading continues to perform at a very high level, exceeding our initial 2015 expectations.","Third quarter net sales in Performance Chemicals were $400 million, with adjusted EBITDA of $136 million, resulting in margins of 34%. Compared to last year, net sales were down 4% and adjusted EBITDA was up 6%. Excluding currency, net sales were flat and adjusted EBITDA was up 11%. Results in Bromine and Lithium were in line with our guidance at the beginning of the third quarter, while Performance Catalyst results were stronger than initially forecasted. Lithium sales were up almost 10% with adjusted EBITDA up almost 14% compared to last year.","Adjusted EBITDA margins were 41%. The primary performance drivers were the same as in the second quarter, volume growth in battery grade products, increased pricing in battery grade and other lithium derivatives and the impact of the Talison joint venture.","Overall volume growth in the third quarter was 14% year-on-year with pricing improving by 3%. Volume growth in battery grade products significantly exceeded the average and battery grade pricing improved by over 6%. Our full-year outlook for Lithium remains unchanged from the beginning of the year, but I want to remind you that fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA is expected to be negatively impacted by JV production timing as we have previously noted.","Adjusted EBITDA for our bromine-based business was $59 million in the third quarter, down 6% compared to third quarter 2014 on an as-reported basis, but flat with third quarter 2014 excluding unfavorable currency exchange impacts.","Note that last year's third quarter results included a large sale of methyl bromide that occurred this year in the second quarter. Excluding the impact of that methyl bromide sale and currency, adjusted EBITDA actually increased by almost 10% compared to third quarter 2014. While adjusted EBITDA performance was in line with expectations and margins almost reached 31%, net sales were down 14% versus last year on an as-reported basis, and 12% excluding currency.","Over half of that decline is due to the timing of methyl bromide sales already noted but, as expected, we saw declines in sales of clear brine fluids compared to both third quarter 2014 and second quarter 2015 and also saw some negative volume impact in industrial bromides and flame retardants as a result of our price increases.","Overall pricing in the Bromine portfolio improved by over 6% relative to the third quarter of 2014. And we remain committed to the price increases and to capturing fair value for our bromine-based product lines. Based on volumes in the third quarter, publicly available electronics market data, the current fourth quarter order book and customer forecast in flame retardants, we expect to see some weakening of the Bromine business in the fourth quarter. It is too soon to predict if flame retardant weakness in the fourth quarter reflects year-end inventory management across the supply chain or a reduction in end market demand.","In addition, production timing could also negatively impact adjusted EBITDA compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. Given these factors, our full-year expectations for Bromine are somewhat reduced from third quarter guidance. We now see full year performance as flat to slightly down compared to 2014 instead of slightly up.","Finally, Performance Catalyst Solutions, which also includes Curatives for reporting purposes, continues to perform very well. Adjusted EBITDA was up 27% compared to third quarter 2014, driven by volumes and product mix and polyolefin catalysts. Our full-year view is further improved by the third quarter results. We now expect adjusted EBITDA to improve by close to 20% versus 2014.","Note that we do expect a meaningful sequential adjusted EBITDA decline in the fourth quarter due to the timing of sales and negative impacts related to our joint ventures in this segment.","Chemetall Surface Treatment net sales were $212 million, with adjusted EBITDA of $54 million, resulting in adjusted EBITDA margins of 25%. Excluding unfavorable currency impacts, sales and adjusted EBITDA were up 14% and 16%, respectively, compared to third quarter 2014. Performance both in key end markets and regionally was in line with expectations. Automotive, aerospace and aluminum finishing were all strong. Regionally, North America and Asia Pacific, where we are benefiting from 100% ownership of the former Shanghai JV, lead the way.","Western Europe also performed well. In emerging markets, we continued to see solid results in China, but sales in Eastern Europe and South America were down primarily due to weakness in Russia, the Ukraine and Brazil. Our full-year outlook remains unchanged with adjusted EBITDA expected to grow by a few percent compared to 2014. Excluding unfavorable currency exchange impacts, adjusted EBITDA is expected to increase by the mid-teens on a percentage basis.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Luke.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Thanks, Scott, and good morning, everybody. Before I comment on the businesses and our strategic objectives, I'd like to provide some context on the recent announcement of Raphael Crawford as President of Bromine Specialties and John Mitchell as President of Lithium & Advanced Materials effective January 1, 2016.","After an external search and extensive consideration, we came to the conclusion that it was in the best interest of the company to promote Raphael and John. Both have been instrumental in delivering the results we've achieved in Performance Chemicals year-to-date, an adjusted EBITDA increase of 15% through the end of the third quarter.","In making this move, we also decided to report what has been Performance Chemicals in two segments starting with the first quarter of 2016, Bromine Specialties and Lithium & Advanced Materials, which includes Lithium and the PCS businesses. As we are already publicly reporting these results for these segments, there is no impact on your ability to model our performance. Other than our not reporting consolidated results for Performance Chemicals, there will be little, if any, change on how we operate. Raphael and John will report to me, their reports remain the same and our focus on delivering superior growth, margins, synergies and free cash flow will not change.","I'd like to make some general comments about year-to-date performance. Despite a challenging macro environment including low oil prices, significant foreign exchange headwinds and weak growth in China and other emerging markets, our core businesses have performed exceedingly well. All of our businesses, with the exception of Clean Fuels Technologies and Fine Chemistry Services continue to meet or exceed our expectations from January.","We have also made progress against our strategic objectives. First, our integration team has now executed projects that will deliver $60 million in savings in 2015. That represents 20% more achieved synergies than we originally forecasted for the year. On a full-year basis, actions already taken will deliver savings of roughly $85 million in 2016. In September, we increased our synergy target for calendar year 2016 from $100 million to $120 million and remain confident in our ability to execute against identified projects to deliver this level of synergies.","Secondly, we are making good progress in our two most strategic capital projects, startup of our 20,000 metric ton battery grade lithium carbonate plant in La Negra, Chile is continuing as planned. We also announced our plans to build a world-scale battery-grade lithium hydroxide into our lithium carbonate plant to convert our share of spodumene production from our Talison JV to these derivatives. This conversion plant will enable us to meet the growing demand for battery-grade lithium derivatives with capacity brought online in increments consistent with that growth in demand.","These facilities are key to meeting our strategic objective to capture about 50% of overall lithium growth. Once they are fully operational, we will be the only global player with capacity necessary to support expected growth in both battery-grade lithium carbonate and lithium hydroxide, and we will be positioned to succeed no matter which product is required.","Third, as Scott highlighted, we continue to demonstrate the cash generation power of Albemarle with adjusted free cash flow before onetime items reaching $405 million through the end of the third quarter. That's 90% of the low end of our full-year forecast.","Finally, we announced this morning a definitive agreement to sell the Metal Sulfides business to Treibacher Industrie AG with closing expected in the next two months. We are pleased with the sales price and we'll apply all our proceeds to debt reduction. In addition, we continue to make excellent progress on the divestiture of the Minerals business and are currently in exclusive negotiations with a strategic buyer. Clearly, we have delivered on our commitments year-to-date and we expect that to continue.","Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we see no change in our outlook for Lithium and PCS. However, as expected, Lithium is forecasted to be roughly flat compared to the fourth quarter of 2014 due to joint venture production and shipment timing and PCS down due to negative impacts related to our joint ventures and shipment timing.","Bromine is forecasted to close the year somewhat weaker than expected in July as we are seeing some negative volume impact from weaker to market demand and the effect of our price increases. As Scott indicated, it is too early to predict if the fourth quarter softness is a result of inventory management or true weak end market demand.","Nevertheless, we expect Performance Chemicals adjusted EBITDA for the full year to be up by double digits on a percentage basis versus 2014, excluding unfavorable currency exchange impacts.","Our Refining Solutions full-year forecast remains unchanged with EBITDA expected to decline by about 20% compared to 2014. We expect continued strong performance in Heavy Oil Upgrading and continued pressure on Clean Fuels Technologies in the fourth quarter.","Finally, Chemetall Surface Treatment continues to deliver very steady results, and we still expect full-year adjusted EBITDA to be up by low single digits on a percentage basis versus 2014 and by mid-teens excluding negative impacts from foreign exchange.","Based on third quarter results and our expectations for the fourth quarter, we now project full-year 2015 adjusted EBITDA of $940 million to $960 million. This includes $52 million from the non-cash foreign exchange gain which we recorded in the first quarter related to cash on hand after the closing of the Rockwood acquisition and roughly $50 million of EBITDA from the three businesses targeted for divestiture.","On an adjusted earnings per share basis, we are narrowing our annual guidance to $3.65 to $3.80 per share. Note that the driver for the reduction in the top end guidance from the second quarter is the poor third quarter performance of our Fine Chemistry Services business and their reduced fourth quarter forecast.","In closing, while we will not give 2016 guidance until our next earnings call, based on our financial and operational performance to date in 2015, I am more confident than ever in Albemarle's future. We have a strong business platforms with the right leaders in place to make them even stronger. We are taking steps through our integration and synergy programs and through other strategic initiatives to further improve our performance. Our strong cash generation and disciplined cash management have us on track to deleverage in line with our commitment. All of these factors position us to perform no matter the operating environment and to deliver superior shareholder returns over time.","Matthew K. Juneau - Albemarle Corp.","Operator, we are ready to open the lines for Q&A. But before you do so, I would remind everyone to please limit your questions to two per person at one time so that everyone has the chance to ask questions. Then feel free to get back in the queue for follow-ons, if time allows. Please proceed.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Matt Andrejkovics - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yes. Good morning. Actually, this is Matt Andrejkovics calling in for Vincent. Thanks for taking the call.","Scott A. Tozier - Albemarle Corp.","Hey, Matt.","Matt Andrejkovics - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey. Can you just give a sense of how much of your original \u2013 you had an original estimate of headwinds for Bromine, including clear brine fluids earlier in the year. And so, it seems like some of that is creeping in into the back half of this year. But can you give a sense of how much of that original estimate might be lingering as you head into 2016?","Scott A. Tozier - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. So, I mean, as we were expecting going into the second half, we were expecting that clear brines would be significantly down based on the CapEx forecasts that were out there, the completions that we're seeing. We're actually seeing somewhat better performance in the second half than we expected. And I think, as you go forward, it's holding up better, primarily on the back of the Gulf of Mexico as well as some of the deepwater fracking jobs that are in the Gulf of Mexico.","Rest of world is still quite weak. There's some early signs of improvements in the rest of the world, but, at this point, too early to call in terms of how that all play out. We still expect based on the CapEx spending, the announcements from the service providers as well as the exploration guys that there will be continued declines in this business.","Matt Andrejkovics - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks. And then can you indicate how much the acquisition of the Shanghai JV has contributed to Surface Treatments this year? Thanks.","Scott A. Tozier - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. So if you look at Surface Treatment's results for the third quarter, they are up roughly 16%, excluding currency that Shanghai JV contributed roughly 5% to 6% of that growth.","Matt Andrejkovics - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bob Koort from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to ask about the Clean Fuels business and at what point does the continued waiting for that recovery turn into a new reality that maybe it will never occur?","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. Let me \u2013 I think on that one, Bob, it's going to recover. They've got to change them out. And they've got to run the units, so that they can't change that. I think if you listened to some of other calls, if \u2013 the heavier is it, they have to change out sooner, the distillates and VGO where were stronger, they can delay longer. So, our hurt has been a little more painful than others. But I think, as we've said, I would expect 2016 to be a better year than 2015 for CFT. I don't see it getting any worse.","Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And then you mentioned some pricing power in Lithium. And, I guess, I was under the impression that a lot of those contracts get reset annually. And your competitor, one of your main competitors out there is talking up price quite a bit. So, can you talk about your new plant in La Negra, how you think about that feathering into your revenue base?","And then, secondly, what is the stage-gater, what's the make-or-break timing for a decision, what you're going to do with that spodumene conversion plant?","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Well, from a La Negra plant, we're in the process of start-up. And as we've said, you ought not been modeling much in the way of revenue, any material way till the beginning of 2017. We've got long periods of time both for qualification and to get \u2013 it takes a long time to get from brine coming out of the ground to the evaporation process for us to be able to load the plant. So, from a La Negra standpoint for next year, I wouldn't \u2013 you ought not model a whole lot of revenue upside from lithium in that, more in the 2017 timeframe.","There is no timetable to pull the trigger on the spodumene plant per se. If you want it online in 2019 or 2020, which is the path that we're working on, we'll have decision points along the way, but we've got 12 months or so before we have to make that type of decision. So, it's a 2016 type of decision and we're doing work now to ensure that we're able to make a decision both on timing, location, size, everything else. So, that will be a 2016 type of decision.","Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Luke, sorry, just to clarify, so in La Negra, there is brine in the holding ponds and you're at just some stage of that 18-month process or just filling into the ponds or...","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. No, no, there's constantly brine in the ponds, but the ponds are in the salar, but, yes, they're in Chile. So, we have it in there as well. But you've got a \u2013 that was for existing capacity that we have down there. So, this additional capacity, we need more brine, and we're in the process of ensuring that that's in the pond and we've got enough to allocate where it needs to be.","Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Thank you.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","You bet.","Operator","Your next question come from P.J. Juvekar from Citi. Please proceed.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Yeah, hi. Good morning.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Hi, P.J.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","You know, Luke, you guys raised bromine prices by 30% or announced a price increase. But now today, you're reducing guidance in bromine. So I guess my question is, do you think the strategy of raising prices that aggressively could backfire?","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah, it could always backfire. I mean, I think we've been clear that we've lost volume. We've lost volume in the bromine world. And we've got to price for value. So, you can't ever second-guess those decisions. We've got models that indicate and we can show you how today we believe we're better off financially from raising the price. If you look at our expectations for bromine at the beginning of the year, it's overperformed.","A piece of that outperformance is the increase in pricing that we've been able to achieve, and a piece of that has been clear completion fluids have been stronger than we anticipated. So, I don't look back on it and think it was a bad decision. I think you've got to be able to adapt to the marketplace and you got to get value for your products or there's no sense coming to work.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Yeah, just on that, is that \u2013 you're losing volume, is that sort of low-end volume that you are losing or is that because competitors aren't going along with the pricing?","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","It's \u2013 all I would have would be anecdotal on that. I mean when you're losing volume, if you're losing volume, you're losing it to somebody. So, you got to listen to the other conversations that are having on the analyst calls and see whether they are up or whether they are down or what they are. And then I think, end of the year, you always see a little weakness in bromine. So, we see that every year, people start taking down the inventory levels and that \u2013 and people are generally worried about what's going on in the world and what's going on in China, are we getting ready to roll into a problem.","So, they don't want to be stuck with a lot of inventory on year end. So, I'm not too worried about the bromine right now today. I think we're in good shape. Glad we took the steps that we did, and we'll play out to see whether or not this is a inventory adjustment that's going to pick up next year or whether it's true demand. And either way, we're going to be prepared to maximize the profitability of the business.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thank you. And just for my second question on free cash flow. You talked about roughly about midpoint of $500 million of free cash flow next year. Maybe you can talk about what are puts and takes on that. And if you want to get leverage down, would you consider selling Surface Treatment at some point? Thank you.","Scott A. Tozier - Albemarle Corp.","So, on the free cash flow comment, the $500 million midpoint is really for this year, P.J. We're actually expecting an increase next year. And a lot of that's on the back of reduced one-time costs, also the reduced interest costs that we have and underlying business performance including synergies. And so, all of those components coming together will allow us to grow our free cash flow next year in a variety of different business conditions. So we feel good about that lever continuing to show through next year.","And, Luke, do you want to talk about the...","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. If you look at it, we don't need to sell any of these business to hit our deleveraging target. So, it's not a question of do we need to sell something to hit our deleveraging targets? I'm confident that we will deleverage without the need to do that.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thank you.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Operator?","Operator","Your next question comes from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Hey, David.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, Luke, staying on bromine. Why do you think competitors aren't supporting your price increase?","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Hey, David, I didn't say all competitors weren't supporting our price increase. What I said is, we're losing volume on price. So, I think that everybody has got a different situation, some people \u2013 Chinese are moving it at cash cost. And their cash cost hasn't gone up as the amount of our price increase. So, we knew there's a risk that we were going to lose it. We've essentially lost, Matt, I'd say just about the bulk of our volume that goes into China particularly in flame retardants, we've lost that as result of the price increase.","Scott A. Tozier - Albemarle Corp.","Particularly in bromine.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah, that's what I mean.","Scott A. Tozier - Albemarle Corp.","Methyl bromides.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. So, it's \u2013 different people have different models. And we knew that going in, and we take that into account when we raise the price.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Very clear. Thank you for that. And just on FCC, Luke, very strong performance. Can you discuss the supply-demand and pricing dynamic in the industry currently going forward?","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","I'm sorry. I didn't quite hear \u2013 FCC pricing going forward. Yeah, I'm sorry...","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. FCC supply-demand dynamic and pricing going forward in FCCs?","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. I'm going to let Silvio Ghyoot, our Head of our Refining Solutions, take that one.","Silvio Ghyoot - Albemarle Corp.","Okay. Thanks, Luke. Well, thanks for the question. You know that the supply-demand ratio that we are running at pretty high rates. Structurally, we see a strong market, new units coming on, as well as strong demand for gasoline, for fuels in general. So the combination of that strong supply-demand and the strong demand for end products create a positive atmosphere for pricing.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","What is pricing up in FCCs year-over-year?","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Scott, you have that.","Scott A. Tozier - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. So pricing is up low-single digits on a year-over-year basis, consistent with what we've had in the past.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mike Harrison from Seaport Global Securities. Please proceed.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Scott A. Tozier - Albemarle Corp.","Hey.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Hi, Mike.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Luke, can you give us some detail on where the additional synergies are coming from?","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. I'll let Scott go ahead and give a little bit of that. I think a lot of it's coming from we're getting a bigger restructuring than we anticipating to start off with, and at a very high level, from the efficiencies in the system when you bring these companies together, and you just look at the buying power that you have. We're getting a significant amount of leverages by pulling in all our purchasing together, and doing an RFP for all of that volume, from a services standpoint, from everything else. So the team has really done an excellent job, and that supply chain has done a fantastic job in finding ways to make sure we get that \u2013 the products and the assets and the services that we need, and that we're doing them as efficiently as possible. Scott?","Scott A. Tozier - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. I would just add that the whole organization has coalesced around this challenge around supply chain and leveraging that scale that Luke talked about, and that's really where a lot of the additional savings are coming from. And as Luke said that, we do have additional savings in the reorganization as well. As we go into next year, you're going to see a bigger impact from supply chain than what we have, as well as the impact to some these reorganization starting to take \u2013 starting to hit our P&L as opposed to what we had in this year.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","All right. And then on the lithium business, I was wondering if you could give us a little bit of a weather report. There was some rain in the Atacama earlier this year and I think El Ni\u00f1o weather patterns could potentially bring some more rain. Did you see any impact on your operations and are you taking any precautions to ensure that you don't have any supply disruptions if there is some rain?","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. There's not a whole lot of precautions I can take against rain, but what I would say is, we \u2013 the main issue that you have on \u2013 when that happens is you get \u2013 it dilutes the brine somewhat, but you don't get enough rain down there at those ponds that it really dilutes it. So, sometimes we have operational issues getting really \u2013 transporting the brine from the cellar to the Atacama to La Negra to be \u2013 because of the road, it's desert and a lot of dirt roads over there, but that's \u2013 we usually have enough brine at La Negra to do that, and we plan for it. This just happens to be I think one of the wettest years on record down there, but we have not seen any material impact from those rains other than some operational issues that we were able to fix in the plant.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Thanks very much.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Okay, Matt.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Aleksey Yefremov from Nomura. Please proceed.","Aleksey Yefremov - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Good morning. Thank you. Following up on a free cash flow question. For 2016, if we look at this year's adjusted guidance of $450 million to $550 million, can you reach the same level next year on an unadjusted basis, given that restructuring cash costs and tax payments will be lower?","Scott A. Tozier - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. I don't know that we can quite there from an unadjusted basis. We will still have some costs related to synergies in our numbers next year, somewhere in that $75 million to $100 million range. We still have some of the one-time tax payments related to the restructuring we did the Rockwood acquisition of around $30 million to $40 million. Those are going to be drag on our next year's actual reported free cash flow. But that underlying \u2013 without those one-time, we'll see a meaningful growth. And obviously, on a reported basis, we'll see significant growth in those numbers.","Aleksey Yefremov - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Thank you. And as a follow-up, on HPC pricing, is it getting worse as you go through the year or is that sort of staying at about the same level in terms of competitive intensity from euro-based producers?","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Silvio?","Silvio Ghyoot - Albemarle Corp.","Thank you, Luke. Let me put it straight. On a product comparison basis, it's not getting worse. However, what we do see is that refiners do select some lower cost or lower priced solutions and that has an effect on the reduced margins.","Aleksey Yefremov - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tyler Frank from Robert Baird. Please proceed.","Tyler Charles Frank - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Private Wealth Management)","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Hey, Tyler.","Tyler Charles Frank - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Private Wealth Management)","Just on FCC, one of your competitors commented they, they were essentially running at 90% utilization rates in Q3 and except that to ramp up to about 95%, which should be at full capacity in the second half of next year. Can you talk about your utilization rates and where you see that going in 2016? And then on order flow, what's the type of mix that you expect in terms of higher margin versus lower margin catalyst?","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Silvio?","Silvio Ghyoot - Albemarle Corp.","Thanks. On your first question, I think that the projections on the capacity utilization are correct that we are running at comparable rates. The order flow, hard to predict. We are strong in the polypropylene market and the propylene markets. You know that we ship primarily much in Middle East and Asian markets. Gasoline demands or orders from the U.S. are high also, so it's somewhat hard to predict on what's the exact outlook of next year's order pattern will be.","Tyler Charles Frank - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Private Wealth Management)","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Laurence Alexander from Jefferies. Please proceed.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC","Good morning. I guess first on the Clean Fuels performance. Can you give a sense for or can you tease out if demand recovered to normalized levels, how much of a headwind the share losses would be? And secondly, can you give a sense at current FX levels, how much of a headwind you're looking at for next year?","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","On the demand, if the demand recovered, how much would the share losses be, what kind of \u2013 we had \u2013 we've lost a little bit of share, maybe a couple of percentage points, but it hadn't been that significant from the overall standpoint. And we'll pick up some too. The way that the CFT works on HPC is their bid \u2013 you have a higher likelihood for, if you have that first fill to get the second fill, but once you get to that third and fourth fill, it's really a bid process because they know how much that unit works and what the operating dynamics are, so they are more out to make a swap out there.","So, it's more bid. I think next year we'll pick up some business. We always lose some business, we always pick some up, and we keep track of it. This year, we did lose a couple of share points, but I wouldn't expect it. It wouldn't be a significant detraction. On the free cash flow numbers, Scott, I don't know if we have that, can you...","Scott A. Tozier - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah, on the foreign exchange, I haven't really fully modeled that out yet, because obviously you've got some moving parts even as we speak today. But as you look at the 2015 numbers, a lot of the foreign exchange impact in total occurred in the fourth quarter of last year as well as early first quarter of this year. So, I'm not expecting a huge impact going into next year, although there will be some. We'll have to see as the Fed and the ECB starts to make their decisions here in the fourth quarter how those numbers start to change though.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC","Thank you.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Operator?","Operator","Your next question comes from Mike Sison of KeyBanc.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hey, guys. Good morning. Nice quarter.","Scott A. Tozier - Albemarle Corp.","Hey, Mike.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Thanks a lot.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Luke, I know \u2013 in terms of 2016, you did talk about headwinds from \u2013 I don't know about a headwind, but you're not going to see the FX gain next year, nor the divestitures, so you are somewhere in a $100 million hole.. Can you \u2013 I know you don't want to give specific guidance, so maybe talk about some of the areas where you have EBITDA growth next year within your control to offset some of those?","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Well, I mean, we've said we're going to get synergies. So if we get $60 million this year and we'll add a $120 million next year, that ought to be $60 million right there. So I \u2013 the way I think of it is the additional synergies kind of offsets the divestitures, or it should, and that's what we're expecting.","And then, I think if you look at our overall businesses, we've talked about the Surface Treatment, we ought to have growth there. I would expect lithium to continue to grow with the demand and pricing. I would expect Surface Treatment to continue along its path that it's shown over the last five years from a continual growth. And then it comes \u2013 PCS has nice more like GDP growth and it comes down to bromine, and what I just don't know about bromine is, what's going to happen on completion fluids.","Eventually, if these \u2013 if we keep seeing these projects \u2013 at some point in time, if we keep seeing these projects delayed or canceled, there will be a reduction in Clean Fuels \u2013 and I mean, in clear brines. I just don't \u2013 I don't know enough today to see where that's going to be.","So bromine's probably flat to down next year and the rest of them I see growth. So I think, we'll roll out more \u2013 a lot more detail on that, Mike, in our next call, what our 2016 forecast will be with regard to EBITDA, free cash flow and items like that. But I think we see a path to be in good shape there.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Great. And then, you know PCS continues to have a pretty good momentum there. Can you \u2013 is there any big share gains for the new products that are coming out that continues to give that business momentum?","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","I wouldn't say there's a whole lot of share gains there. I mean, this is a pretty \u2013 as we've talked about, it's a pretty \u2013 particularly for aluminum alkyls, that's a pretty tough market. We still need some pricing momentum there that we don't have. It's very, very competitive. Pricing has not been good from an aluminum alkyl standpoint. But we've done some shuttering of facilities, as you know, and the team has really worked hard to get cost right-sized of what that market is, because it \u2013 it adds a tremendous amount of volume. We've seen some growth in some of the lithium specialties that are in there. So, and curatives has done quite well. The competitor had a shutdown in 2015 that we've benefited greatly from that they're back up and running, their business is still doing fine. So, I think that, overall, it's just good, sound fundamental of operations, Mike.","Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jim Sheehan from SunTrust. Please proceed.","James M. Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Good morning. Could you talk about how much of your portfolio has taken bromine price increases so far? Do you expect more ramp up in the next couple of quarters and your pricing be higher in 2016 as a result? And I'm thinking about your polymeric flame retardants there. If you could talk about what pricing level you're going to have on the polymeric product? Thank you.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. If you look across our bromine portfolio, remember, we did not include a price increase on clear completion fluids given the dynamics. So, the bulk of our portfolio we pushed through price increase, and I think pricing is up year-over-year about 6%. So, we had a 30% increase. Price is up about 6%. So, you can kind of see that model and we're losing volume. I don't see a whole lot of pricing opportunity going forward. We still got work to do to get this one included. So, I wouldn't model in a significant price increase for next year. I think we'll get the full-year benefit of what we've got year-to-date so far and wouldn't see much more opportunity in that, Jim.","James M. Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Great. And then lithium, could you talk about what your normalized margins are \u2013 where you see normalized margins in that business, and also what was the contribution from Talison in the quarter?","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yes. Scott, you want to talk about Talison?","Scott A. Tozier - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. Talison, on the quarter, we were probably in \u2013 on a year-over-year basis, probably kind of mid-single digits millions of dollars, maybe high-single-digit millions of dollars overall. Normalized margins for lithium. We continue to expect that to be in the high 30%s, as the product portfolio continues to shift toward battery grade. And as you know, we're doing some of that tolling work out of spodumene from Talison as well. That will affect the margin rates. Although, we continue to expect very healthy dollar growth rates in that business.","James M. Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Ritzenthaler from Piper Jaffray. Please proceed.","Mike Ritzenthaler - Piper Jaffray & Co","Yeah. Good morning, guys.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Hey, Mike.","Mike Ritzenthaler - Piper Jaffray & Co","If I could just go back real quickly on one of the previous questions on lithium pricing, the way that I guess I understood that previously is that's pretty much negotiated earlier in the year versus sold on a merchant basis. Is that a fair way to kind of think about how lithium pricing might kind of phase in through 2016?","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. The bulk of the pricing is negotiated in the fourth quarter for the following year. And we are looking at trying \u2013 because the market is going to get really tight, we're actually exploring ways to enter into longer term agreements with customers who want to make sure they have the security of supply.","Mike Ritzenthaler - Piper Jaffray & Co","That makes sense. And is it mostly contract-based, I mean in terms of the volumes. I'm not looking for anything specific, but just in terms of direction.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. The bulk of the lithium, particularly battery grade products, is contract-based.","Mike Ritzenthaler - Piper Jaffray & Co","Okay. And then just maybe just to get a sense for some of the needle movers in the full-year 2015 outlook. Just because we look to model kind of Q4, so $3.65 to $3.80. How much of that is kind of CFT shipments that are previously scheduled versus, I don't know, clear brines, some of the cautiousness around that?","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. I mean if you look at the change on the top end, it's all custom services.","Mike Ritzenthaler - Piper Jaffray & Co","Right.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","I mean all other businesses are performing about or either about like we said they were going to perform in July. The only delta for the second half of the year is custom services, that business that we're trying to sell. So, it's always, you can have a Clean Fuels or a HOU shipment that moves out one way or the other in or out and it can have an impact in Clean Fuels and clear brines. Obviously, the volumes on that, people, that can be really quick. But at the end of the day, all that's really built into our guidance. The thing that moved our guidance was the Fine Chemistry Services.","Mike Ritzenthaler - Piper Jaffray & Co","Yeah. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Dmitry Silversteyn from Longbow Research. Please proceed.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Good morning, guys.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Hey.","Scott A. Tozier - Albemarle Corp.","Hi, Dmitry.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Thanks for taking my call. I just wanted to follow up on a couple of things that were said earlier. First of all, on the FCC part of your Catalyst business, I think you said you're getting double-digit volume growth there, not a normal level of growth for the industry or your business in this area. So, have you picked up share somewhere or accounts or got a new product that you're entering into a new sector of the FCC market that you weren't in before? Can you talk about sort of where this strength is coming from?","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. Dmitry, we said profit was up. We didn't necessarily say volume was up double digits.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. I thought I read your slides that said that volume was up.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","And maybe volume's up, I'm just not sure it's up double digits but it's up. So, it's a relative same question. I think what's happened is if you look, we've had this year-to-date six new FCC units have come online, gasoline demand in the summer was very strong and saw some really good addition rates. All those big new units coming online is meaning a volume increase and that increased demand means some of the other ones aren't coming offline. So we're seeing \u2013 I think across the industry, are seeing volume increases from the catalyst suppliers and seeing good opportunities to continue to do that.","Now, I think long term, Dmitry, this is 3% to 4% -- it's based on what transportation fuels are, it's 3% to 4% growth. We've outgrown over the years, over the last few years because of our technology and the strength of our technology in these emerging markets and these new units that are being brought online where they're looking to handle that heavy resid feed and maximize their propylene yield.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. Luke, that's helpful. So, I must've misheard about the 10% growth on volumes. In the Surface Treatment business, it's holding up okay. You've gotten sort of good growth there and it's performing in line with your expectations and it sounds like you still expect the business to do well, but if you sort of look at the end markets in some of the important geographies, things are slowing down.","Metal and mining is not doing particularly well. The automotive industry reaching a peak in North America and Europe and is down to no growth at least in the third quarter in China and maybe some ramp-up in the fourth quarter. As you sort of look at the end markets in the industries that this business serves, how do you maintain this growth level when the industry overall is subsiding?","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah, I'm going to let Joris \u2013 he's on the phone \u2013 let him handle that.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Okay.","Joris Merckx - CHEMETALL GmbH","Yes. Thank you, Luke. Well, the observations are correct, but you have to realize that we are serving a very well-balanced portfolio of segments. We are not depending only on the automotive industry. We have a very steady business in aerospace, where we see order patterns in, for instance, at our customers, they have back orders for the next four years or five years. We are on a strategy of diversification, like you mentioned China, where we have low market shares in other segments, except for automotive. So we can grow in other segments.","Apart from that, you mentioned North America, where we are a very small player in the automotive industry. So, we have potential to grow, meaning capturing market share from other competitors, and we do that year-on-year, and we have \u2013 we are weathering other crisis, just like the crisis in 2008, 2009. We have seen areas where like South America, where we gain tremendous market share, when the economy would pick up. Again there, we would be in good shape. So we are confident to maintain this growth pattern as we have been doing over the past 8 years, 9 years, 10 years.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. Thank you. And then one final question on synergies and again, now that I've been corrected on the FCC, I want to make sure I didn't mishear what was said earlier, but you're getting $60 million in savings in 2015 and did you say you're going to get $85 million in 2016?","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. So, it'll be a total \u2013 let me \u2013 from 2014 actuals, we will have $60 million of savings in 2015. Those actions that we've taken in 2015 to get that $160 million, when you put them on a full year run rate basis, they add up to $85 million on a full year run rate basis, Dmitry.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Okay, okay. I got it.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","And then, what we're saying is we still have our target of $120 million savings by the end of 2016. So, you take that $85 million, put another, what's got \u2013 $35 million on top of it, that would get you to the $120 million, okay?","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. That's what I misunderstood from Scott's part because when he said $85 million in 2016, I thought it was the absolute level of savings, not the run rate. I got it. Thank you.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Kapsch of BB&T Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Christopher J. Kapsch - BB&T Capital Markets","Yeah. Hi. Good morning, guys. I wanted to follow up on a comment that you made a few minutes ago. I believe you said the bringing in of the high end of your guidance range was due entirely to the poor performance of the FCS business and so I guess, put another way, if you were to look just at the core business guidance for those business would've been either unchanged, maybe even slightly higher. So, I guess the question is, remind us why maybe you haven't classified these all other businesses, the ones being divested, as disc ops and it seems like, in this case, with the guidance reduction, those effectively discontinued ops are distorting the optics of the guidance here?","Scott A. Tozier - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. The guidance, I mean, the accounting rules related to disc ops changed at the beginning of this year, and at this point in time, these businesses did not qualify for that kind of reporting. So, obviously, we had looked at that, but it's one that \u2013 they just don't qualify. So we can't put them in there. But as a result of that, obviously, we're trying to split out the impacts so that you guys have a clear view as to what's going on, at least as clear as we can make it for you.","Christopher J. Kapsch - BB&T Capital Markets","Right. And excluding FCS with the rest of the businesses, would've the guidance been unchanged or actually slightly higher?","Scott A. Tozier - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah, I would say that we saw a little bit of a decline in bromine like we talked about. We saw some impact from foreign exchange fully offset by positive synergy activity.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","And in a day, it would've been the exact same or slightly up.","Scott A. Tozier - Albemarle Corp.","Same, yeah?","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Exact same or slightly up.","Christopher J. Kapsch - BB&T Capital Markets","Right. That's what I thought. Thanks. And then just a follow-up on the CFT business. I know you guys track very closely systematically all refinery activity and anticipate change-out activity. So based on your comments prior about maybe losing a little bit of shares, I was just curious what -- in terms of the negative variance year-over-year, what's a bigger contributor, is it this sort of trade-down effect to cheaper catalysts or is it more just delayed change-out activity?","And then to the extent that refiners are trading down to lower-quality, lower-priced catalysts, does that effectively -- are those catalysts going to lead to a higher cadence of change-out going forward since the activity level or the robustness of those catalysts might not be as good as some of the higher-quality catalysts? Thanks.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","Yeah. I think the answer there would be that it depends on how they're operating. So if they don't have to run hard, if they have benign operating conditions that weaker catalyst could last the same amount of time, it's just we \u2013 or you don't know exactly what's going to happen. A lot of can move in with moly and things like that and moving on moly price and it can make people buy different types of catalysts. So, overall again, I believe that next year will be a better year for CFT than what we had this year. It won't be back to the 2014 levels, but we'll definitely see improvements in CFT as we go forward.","Christopher J. Kapsch - BB&T Capital Markets","Right. But the negative variance this year, was it a...","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","It's hard to really pull that out and say is it that, because if we lost a unit, was it that we lost it because somebody was offering a cheaper catalyst or not. I would say that it was about \u2013 it would be more mix than it was delaying the change-outs.","Christopher J. Kapsch - BB&T Capital Markets","Okay. Thanks.","Luke C. Kissam - Albemarle Corp.","It would be more downgraded than mix, but I don't have a specific number that we can give you.","Christopher J. Kapsch - BB&T Capital Markets","Thank you.","Luke C.

","Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Luke.","Luke Kissam","Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everybody. In the first quarter of 2017, Albemarle continued to build on the strong momentum we established last year. Excluding divested businesses and negative currency exchange impacts, revenue grew by almost $95 million or 15% and adjusted EBITDA grew by $27 million or 14% compared to the first quarter of 2016. Growth was driven by adjusted EBITDA increases of 56% in lithium and 11% in bromine. ","The combined adjusted EBITDA margins for our three global business units reached 35%, up from 2016\u2019s average of 33%. And total company adjusted EBITDA margins remains strong at 29%. As we\u2019ve discussed in our recent Investor Day, demand for lithium continues to grow rapidly and our business team continues to focus on increasing production to meet both the current and future demand of our customers. Our bromine business is benefiting from improvement employment in demand across various electronic applications and reduced bromine production in China. ","At the corporate level, we completed our deleveraging plan following the Chemetall divestiture during the first quarter. As of the end of March, Albemarle net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 0.6. We\u2019re also very pleased with the progress on our $250 million accelerated share repurchase plan and remained on track to complete the buyback by the end of June. ","Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Scott.","Scott Tozier","Thanks Luke, and good morning. ","In the first quarter, we reported adjusted net income of $1.05 per diluted share, an increase of 13% compared to the first quarter of 2016, excluding the year-over-year net impact of divested businesses. The increase was driven by an adjusted EBITDA increase of $35 million or about $0.24 per share from our three GBUs. ","Business results were countered by about $0.12 per share of negative impact from the combination of corporate costs, foreign exchange, tax, D&A and interest expense. As Luke noted, our $250 million accelerated share buyback program is well underway. At this point, we have estimate the buyback will result in an average diluted share count for the full year of 2017 of about 112.1 million shares. We continue to expect our 2017 effective tax rate, excluding special items, non-operating pension and OPEB items to be approximately 22%. ","Capital spending in the first quarter was $54 million with significant commitments executed for major equipment and services for our wave one lithium projects. As construction activities progress and equipment deliveries are made over the course of 2017, the spending rate will increase. We still expect total 2017 spending of $350 million to $400 million. ","Corporate costs in the first quarter were $32 million driven by compensation costs and negative currency exchange impacts. We do not expect the first quarter spending rate continue, but given first quarter costs and our updated view on the rest of the year, 2017 corporate costs are now expected to range from $95 million to $105 million. Operating working capital ended the first quarter at 27% of revenue in line with our 2017 guidance, and we expect to remain at a similar level through the rest of the year. ","Adjusted free cash flow in the first quarter was strong at $76 million. For the full year, we continue to expect adjusted free cash flow of $200 million to $300 million with the expected ramp-up in capital spending impacting the rest of 2017. And finally, currency exchange rates compared to 2016 negatively impacted adjusted EBITDA by $5 million in the first quarter. ","We currently forecast a negative full year adjusted EBITDA impact of $10 million to $15 million compared to 2016. The primary impact both in the quarter and in the full year forecast is from the euro. Our 2016 average rate was just over \u20ac1.1 per the U.S. dollar, and we currently forecast \u20ac1.06 for 2017. ","Now let me turn to our business units. Lithium and Advanced Materials had another strong quarter led by the Lithium business. First quarter net sales of $284 million increased by 32% compared to first quarter of 2016. While adjusted EBITDA of $120 million was 39% higher than first quarter of 2016, adjusted EBITDA margins were strong at 42%. ","Lithium had another outstanding quarter, with first quarter net sales of 58% and adjusted EBITDA of 56% compared to the first quarter of 2016. Adjusted EBITDA margins were 46%, above our long-term expectations of the low-40s for this business. ","Volume growth for the first quarter was 39% with pricing up 21%. Battery-grade products drove essentially all of the volume growth and most of the pricing improvement. Most of the volume growth came from our recently acquired spodumene conversion assets, but we also continue to utilize total conversion as well. Also La Negra II in Chile began initial commercial production with a strong ramp expected as 2017 progresses. ","We are pleased with the initial performance of our new spodumene conversion assets in China. Production rates in the first quarter were outstanding and operations at both sides are undergoing rapid integration with the rest of Albemarle. We are already utilizing Albemarle systems to manage and report production activities, and most back-office functions are running through our regional shared services center. ","The capital project to expand production by 28,000 to 25,000 metric tons of lithium hydroxide at the [indiscernible] site is already underway. ","Compared to the first quarter of 2016, PCS sales were down $11 million and adjusted EBITDA was down $2 million. Weakness in our [indiscernible] and catalysts and organic metallics businesses and impact from the SunEdison bankruptcy was partially offset by initial results from our cost savings program and stronger year-over-year performance in curatives. ","Bromine Specialties\u2019 first quarter sales of $219 million and adjusted EBITDA of $68 million were up by 12% and 11%, respectively, compared to the first quarter of 2016. Increased demand for flame retardants across various electronic applications was a major driver of sales growth, but we also benefited from sales improvement in elemental bromine and specialty bromine derivatives. High operating rates and continued productivity improvements in manufacturing also contributed to the year-over-year improvement. ","First quarter adjusted EBITDA margins of 31% were over 300 basis points above the 2016 average of 28%. While it is still early, we are encouraged by the favorable trends we saw in bromine in 2016 and have continued in the first few months of 2017. ","Refining Solutions reported first quarter net sales of $185 million and adjusted EBITDA of $50 million. Compared to the first quarter of 2016, sales were up 9% and adjusted EBITDA was down 10%. ","Fluid catalytic cracking, or FCC Catalysts, and clean fused technologies, or HPC Catalysts, contributed by an equally to sales growth. FCC sales increases were driven by strong demand in North America while solid demand globally, especially in the heavier feed resid segment drove HPC revenues. Adjusted EBITDA was down as expected driven by the impact of customer turnarounds and competitive trials at FCC, less favorable product mix in CFT and higher input costs.","Now I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Luke to update our 2017 outlook.","Luke Kissam","Thanks, Scott. Our strong first quarter results have positioned Albemarle for another outstanding year in 2017. Lithium and bromine both outperformed our initial expectations in the quarter, with Refining Solutions and PCS performing about as expected. Lithium is forecasted to drop second quarter results with year-over-year growth similar to the first quarter. Bromine faces comp comparison both sequentially and against the second quarter of 2016, but favorable market trends appeared to be continuing. In Refining Solutions, negative mix comparisons in CFT and FCC and some cost increases are expected to impact adjusted EBITDA compared to last year.","Finally, PCS is likely to continue relatively flat year-over-year performance as competitive pressures continue to impact the base organic metallic\u2019s segment. At a company level, our overall expectations have strengthened since the beginning of the year. ","More favorable outlooks for lithium and bromine are forecasted to overcome expected weaker performance in refining. We now expect 2017 net sales of between $2.9 to $3.05 billion and adjusted EBITDA of between $835 million and $875 million. Adjusted EPS should range from $4.20 to $4.40, up from our initial guidance of $4 to $4.25. ","As we noted in our recent Investor Day, we\u2019re very excited about the growth potential of Albemarle\u2019s businesses. First quarter results demonstrate our continued pivot to a higher growth profile, and we expect that to continue going forward. Our business teams are focused on meeting the growth challenge by driving results for the second quarter and the rest of 2017 and by executing on our capital projects and business strategies to drive long-term opportunities for our business.","Matt Juneau","Operator, we\u2019re ready to open the lines for Q&A. But before you do so. I would remind everyone to please limit your question to two per person and at one time, so that everyone has a chance to ask questions. Please feel free to get back in the queue for follow-ups if time allows. Please proceed.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, we will now conduct the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And your first question is from the line of Arun Viswanathan from RBC Capital. Please go ahead.","Arun Viswanathan","Just wanted to confirm what kind of pricing volume expectations are embedded in your updated guidance. You said 21% price growth in lithium for Q1. Do you see that continuing? Thanks.","John Mitchell ","This is John Mitchell. As from a pricing perspective, we\u2019re focused on long-term agreements with our customers. We now have over 80% of our volume under agreement in the 2017 year. And you\u2019ve seen that we\u2019ve been able to secure 21% increase in pricing in Q1. We expect that to continue, and that pricing to hold for the remainder of the year. From a volume perspective, we\u2019ve always messaged that we expect to bring on about 10,000 metric tons or more per year of additional incremental volume. So we\u2019re on track to do or better in 2017.","Arun Viswanathan","Great. And then as a follow-up, could you just give us an update on projects in the industry? I understand you guys are bringing on 10,000, but what about the other projects that you\u2019re seeing in the industry? Do you see those coming to fruition and what\u2019s the cadence of that through the year?","John Mitchell","So with regard to additional capacity filling the demand need in 2017, we see principally the mines in Western Australia providing some of that capacity in conjunction with some Chinese extra capacity that\u2019s out there in the market. And then also Albemarle is playing a big role in meeting the demand need as well as a result of the two Chinese asset that we have that we\u2019re ramping up in Xinyu and Chengdu and then also our ramp-up in La Negra, our La Negra II plant.","Luke Kissam","The only thing I\u2019d add is was that it is consistent with the expectations and the discussions we had in Investor Day playing out pretty much as we expected it would.","Operator","Our next question is from Alex Yefremov of Nomura Instinet. Please go ahead.","Alex Yefremov","Could you give us your latest view of the lithium demand in China, specifically in the EV market, we had a pretty slow start of the year in January and February, but a bounce back in March. What are your customers telling you? Do they see reacceleration going forward or clearly slow environment?","John Mitchell","Yes, this is John. We see it was just really a short-lived, no real concern by our cathode and battery customers. If you look at the number of units sold and the breakdown of EVs and plug-in hybrid sales in 2016, in China was about 45% of the market. In Q1, they\u2019re about 30% of the market, and that\u2019s really just off of a strong March. So we see a good rebound in China. They\u2019re going to be a significant player in terms of the overall EV and plug-in hybrid growth going forward, and no concern from the customer base.","Alex Yefremov","And then if I look at your new financial guidance, 35%-plus for lithium segment, for a free EBIDTA growth, I think those guidance suggest that 100 million in the first quarter could be the high water mark for this year? Is that correct? And if it is, why is that?","Scott Tozier","Yes, Scott. One of the key things that drove our first quarter was great performance out of our factories. So we\u2019re a little bit hedging on that, make sure that if that continues, we have a bit of an upside that\u2019s based into that range. So we continue to think that we\u2019ll have 100 to 100 plus in the following quarters, so.","Operator","Our next question is from Robert Koort of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Robert Koort","John, I had a question for you on the Jiangli assets under Albemarle fold. Can you talk a little bit about operating rates and how much more you could ramp those before your expansion? And then do you expect most of that production to stay within China or would that also be an export engine for you?","John Mitchell","Hi Bob, so the nameplate capacity of the two combined plants, the Chengdu is 5,000 metric tons, and Xinyu 10,000. So we have room to continue to ramp up in 2017. And then we\u2019ve already begun the expansion of another 20,000 to 25,000 metric ton expansion in Xinyu bringing total capacity there to 30,000 to 35,000 metric tons by probably early 2018.","And in terms of where we\u2019re placing products, it\u2019s a combination. I mean, that product is qualified with our key battery customers. And so we\u2019re able to export it to even customers with the most stringent quality metrics. So we worked hard through the integration period and the negotiation period to ensure that those plants were qualified.","Robert Koort","So John, just to follow up on that. If you could provide lithium hydroxide or lithium carbonate from any of your locations to your customers, or is it there are some customers where you come from Chile or elsewhere, how does that specification flexibility for your work?","John Mitchell","So it is true that certain customers has specifications that may lend itself to only being supplied from certain assets. However, we are trying to make sure that we have as much flexibility in our Albemarle supply chain as possible so that we can supply customers for multiple facilities. So in the specific case of lithium hydroxide, we have a single battery customer that we can supply from Kings Mountain from Xinyu and from Chengdu, but we have to make sure that each of those plants are qualified to the specific customer specification. But we\u2019re taking those decisions, what makes sense, what\u2019s economical, what\u2019s efficient for us and making sure that we have as much flexible in our system. But it is true each individual plant, no matter, whether it\u2019s Albemarle or through someone else, have to get qualified to a specific customer specification.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Kevin McCarthy of Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.","Kevin McCarthy","If we look at your lithium results on a sequential basis, your sales increased $8 million and yet the EBITDA increased 11 million in playing contribution margin of more than 100%. Just wondering if you could walk us through some of the moving parts and elaborate on how you\u2019re able to accomplish that.","John Mitchell","So one of the key things is acquisition of our Chinese assets. As you recall, last year, they were part of our pulling portfolio, so there\u2019s a bit of an arbitrage in terms of taking them into the Albemarle portfolio. And then also, we\u2019re getting better performance out of those assets than the old owners we\u2019re getting out of it, and it\u2019s a great team that we have there in China. So we\u2019re getting better performance and we\u2019re also getting the effect of arbitrage around the tolling fee. And then, obviously, we have better pricing this quarter versus last quarter.","Kevin McCarthy","That\u2019s helpful. And as a follow-up, you\u2019d commented you planned to increase production by 10,000 tons or more this year. I was wondering if you could comment on the composition of the positive increment there. For example, how much are ramping that La Negra II and other sources of new supply this year?","John Mitchell","So I believe on previous calls, we hinted that La Negra will be ramping up kind of the 1\/3, 1\/3, 1\/3, so this year bringing 6,000, 7,000 metric tons of carbonate coming on from La Negra and then the balance coming from the Chinese assets in Xinyu and Chengdu. So that\u2019s, we\u2019re pretty much on track, and I see some extra volume coming out of the Chinese asset going forward, though.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley.","Unidentified Analyst","This is Neil [ph] calling in for Vincent. It looks at your guidance for lithium for the balance of the year is down a bit versus growth experienced in Q1, so I was wondering if you can just touch a bit.","Luke Kissam","Can you repeat that? We can\u2019t hear anything you\u2019re saying. It\u2019s really -- I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re playing with a microphone or something, but can you repeat that, please?","Unidentified Analyst","Sure. Can you hear me now?","Luke Kissam","Yes.","Unidentified Analyst","I was just saying it looks that your guidance for lithium the balance of the year is down versus the growth you experienced in Q1. So I was wondering if you could just touch on that a bit.","Luke Kissam","Yes, I think that\u2019s similar question and it was asked earlier. If you really look what we said, we had a really strong performance out of our Chinese assets in the first quarter. And one quarter does not a year make. So we have to make sure that we can operate that, that on a consistent level during the course of the year. If we do that, we can be able to achieve better than we did, both for the first quarter. If we don\u2019t, we\u2019re going to have a little downside. So what we try to do is range with a regional expectation will be for operating those assets, and that\u2019s how we get to the forecast that we\u2019ve got. But we will have a very strong growth year-over-year in lithium. But on the top line, volume and on the bottom line.","Unidentified Analyst","All right. And another question on bromine. Given the strong quarter, have your longer-term expectations for bromine flattish to low single digit type growth in your business that you gave in your Analyst Day. Has that changed at all?","Raphael Crawford","This is Raphael. I think we are pleased with our Q1 results. We do think it we\u2019ll perform better than what we originally expected for the full year. But on the long-term basis, bromine is still a little growth business from a volume and an EBITDA standpoint. But we\u2019re certainly doing all the things we can to keep our margin profile high. And if there are additional volume opportunities in some of our markets, we\u2019ll be looking to capture those opportunities.","Unidentified Company Representative","Raphael. I might add, too. We\u2019re in a favorable electronics market right now as well, I think favorable tailwinds from that. As you know, there\u2019s a quite cyclical industry that we just got to be cautious that we take this trend in being long-term. Eventually, that\u2019s going to turn and cycle back down. ","Operator","Our next question is from the line of John Roberts of UBS. Please go ahead.","John Roberts","China apparently is considering mandating electric vehicles as a percent of each manufacturer sales in a couple of years. Do you have any insights into what percent that they\u2019re thinking about targeting and how quickly they might implement something like that?","John Mitchell","Yes, we don\u2019t have any insight on what the Chinese government would do there other than what we would read in the press. So we don\u2019t know. But anything that they do in such stat is going to be a continuation of what we\u2019ve seen around the world from a regulatory standpoint and encourage you to electronic vehicles and we see it is something that could possibly impact our Lithium business in the growth process.","Operator","Thanks for your question. Our next question is from the line of Jim Sheehan of SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Jim Sheehan","One of your competitors announced that they\u2019re looking into a major capacity expansion in Argentina, about 20,000 tons in the next two or three years. If they move ahead with that project, does that change your view on the supply demand balance over that time frame? And how do you see supply demand being impacted by that much capacity?","Luke Kissam","Yes, I think we\u2019re going to add -- we\u2019ve announced that we\u2019re going to add between now and 2021 roughly another 100,000 metric tons of capacity in lithium carbonate and lithium hydroxide. And we\u2019ve got that we\u2019re back integrated into resource that give us guarantees if we\u2019ve got the feedstock with that. So we\u2019ve always said we\u2019re going to capture 50% of the growth and we look to the other majors to step-up and filled out our GAAP. So I think this is consistent. I think, John, you\u2019d still see, I mean, supply demand stands relatively consistent throughout this period, is that right?","John Mitchell","Yes, Luke. Just second to Luke\u2019s said, we track all the projects around the world. We make sure that they\u2019re considered in terms of the supply demand balance. So I think the project that you\u2019re referring to it is included in some other, we don\u2019t see any change in terms of our outlook, in terms of supply demand balance.","Jim Sheehan","Great. And in bromine, you mentioned you\u2019ve got high operating rates. So I was just wondering if you could just quantify what your utilization is on the bromine assets currently? And are you seeing -- when do you expect to see any pickup in the clear brine fluids demand?","Raphael Crawford","Sure. Without commenting directly into our operating rates are, I want to go back to what we\u2019ve said at Investor Day, which is one of the core strategies within our bromine business is to focus on productivity improvements. So what we\u2019ve been able to do in -- through the course of last year and then the first quarter, we\u2019re seeing the benefit of that is really to be able to get more out of the existing asset base we have, and that\u2019s had a very positive effect on our ability to capture demand that would exist. And we\u2019ll continue to do that and we will continue to be able to get more of our asset base at the same or lower cost than what we\u2019ve had. ","So that\u2019s really a favorable piece for what we\u2019ve been able to accomplish. But, Jim, what was your second piece of your question?","Jim Sheehan","Clear brine.","Raphael Crawford","Yes, I\u2019m sorry. On clear brine, we still see good demand in the Middle East. We saw that through last year. We see that in the first quarter. But if you remember, Albemarle was strategically advantaged with having a plant, both in North America as well as in Jordan. So we\u2019re able to capture opportunities in clear brines as they come up. We see the Middle East is still fairly good. Gulf of Mexico, we should see that coming back at the end of 2017 or, let\u2019s say, the second half into 2018. And the rest of the world is soft, at least from our perspective.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of P.J. Juvekar of Citi. Please go ahead.","P.J. Juvekar","Question on lithium. I know you have long-term contracts with your customers. So what percentage of your contract would you say having repriced in the last 12 months?","Luke Kissam","I mean, it\u2019s a significant portion of the last 12 months. If not all, it\u2019s pretty damn close. So we\u2019ve had good pricing over the last one, [indiscernible] contract by contract, PJ. But we\u2019re getting price increases across the board on battery-grade products. Probably not as much, John, I would say on the technical grade products. Maybe comment some more on that, but I think on battery grade, it\u2019s safe to say, the entire industry has seen pricing increases.","John Mitchell","Yes, P.J. Just to reiterate what Luke just said, I would say mostly on of our battery grade customers have seen some pricing movement. As you get into other markets, as we\u2019ve said before, we typically price the value. And you look at a lot of other external factors, like energy prices and things like that, to make sure that the value of our products makes sense for the consumer. And again, in terms of our long-term view with customers, we\u2019re going to treat our customers a very fair way where we can work together to supply the needs of the industry, the energy storage market, and we\u2019re going to grow together. And so that\u2019s really a key part of our overall strategic approach and partnership approach with the leading battery producers in the world.","P.J. Juvekar","Great. And then there are [indiscernible] junior miners trying to advance project, in Australia as well as in the Americas, would you look at M&A versus doing your greenfield project in Argentina?","Luke Kissam","Yes, I think, PJ., what we said at the Investor Day still holds. We\u2019re going to look to deploy the cash that we have in a way that creates the greater shareholder value. We\u2019re obviously looking for M&A opportunities that would de-risk or expedite our strategy that could certainly become what resources where we believe they\u2019re viable resources that put us on the cost position that would allow us to be competitive and maintain a market leadership globally that are priced at a point, that we can get a better return on that and we can own other investments that we see. So it all comes down to what\u2019s the viability of the resource and what kind of return can we get on their asset. But John talked in Investor Day about the resource team, we\u2019re out scouring the globe for resources, that includes new resources, that includes companies that are in start-up phase that are looking to attract dollars. So we\u2019re very active. But just because something is for sale and somebody\u2019s talking about it, doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a quality asset, it doesn\u2019t mean that you can meet the value expectations of that particular owner.","John Mitchell","PJ, this is John. Just one other quick comment, and again, we mentioned this during Investor Day, but I think it\u2019s important in terms of our approach. We are only building out capacity on the back of long-term agreements, which is different than maybe others in the market. So it\u2019s really going to come down to our partnership arrangements with our customers, what their demand is, and then that\u2019s going to need to us building out capacity, whether it\u2019s through Greenfield, Brownfield or M&A.","Operator","Thanks for your question. Our next question is from the line of David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","David Begleiter","Luke, on refining, I believe your guidance implies a better back half in the first half of the year. Can you discuss the drivers of improved performance and is that sustainable into 2018 as well?","Luke Kissam","I didn\u2019t hear the last piece of it.","David Begleiter","Is that improved second half performance sustainable into 2018 as well?","Luke Kissam","Yes, okay. I\u2019m sorry. I think as I look overall at refining, it\u2019s doing about what we would thought. I think both from a margin standpoint as well as from the EBITDA standpoint, you\u2019re going to see a stronger end of the year. And it just a told you see the mix. I think FCC will be strong in 2018 than in 2017 from what I see today. And then when I look at HPC, it just depends what that mix is going to be. How much of it\u2019s going to be resid, are we going to get a good mix for some of our high profit or not. So I would say on FCC, for what I would see, it would be stronger, a strong and continued that in \u201818. But for HPC, it\u2019s still too early for me to call right now, David.","David Begleiter","Very good. And Luke, you mentioned in bromine reduced production in China. Can you discuss that, quantify that and how that might impact pricing and margins as is going forward?","Luke Kissam","Yes, I think we\u2019re getting a little -- I\u2019ll just start off of that Raphael get into details. Part of what we\u2019re seeing a now is [indiscernible] and some tailwinds from what\u2019s going on in China right now. That was reflected in our earlier calls -- our earlier comments, I\u2019m sorry. So I believe we are seeing tailwinds there, but Raphael, I think, could go into more detail.","Raphael Crawford","Yes, David, I\u2019m going to agree with what Luke is saying. There\u2019s a tailwind on the tightness of bromine availability in China. And that has the effect on local Chinese pricing, which is continues to be favorable. We\u2019re still -- compared to last year, the average, we\u2019re up 50% better on local bromine pricing in China. So that\u2019s helpful for our development of bromine business into China, so that\u2019s still relatively small. So the real tailwind that we\u2019ve seen recently on the limited exports of flame retardants out of China which could take a little bit of the pressure of some of our other markets, so that\u2019s been favorable to us on a volume standpoint as well as holding pricing constant. But all this, we watched this closely, we have folks on the ground in China, we held all major reports, we always launching this. And we\u2019re always cautious coming out of the winter months where production is low. And as we look at the summer, we didn\u2019t need to get to the summer, see how production might ramp back up in China. If it does, what the impact would be before we can settle in on the real factor.","Operator","Thanks for your question. Our next mentioned is from the line of Mike Sison of KeyBanc. Please go ahead.","Mike Sison","One quick question on lithium. When you think about the battery grade [indiscernible] for you guys, you said to the sold out for the year? And is the industry essentially sold out for the year?","Luke Kissam","I can\u2019t really comment on the overall industry, but I can comment on the fact that every metric ton that we bring on the market is sold. So it\u2019s sold be our long-term agreement. Some of those agreements have options if we able to produce more volume, we can place it directly with those customers. So as much as we can make in the battery grade will be placed into the market to our long-term customers.","Mike Sison","And as a quick follow-up in terms of battery grade, is all the incremental demand coming from EVs or are you seeing some growth in consumer products as well as other areas as well?","John Mitchell","Yes. So as we outlined in Investor Day, we continue to see growth in consumer products area. These are cellphone, power tools, that\u2019s sort of thing, and 7% to 8% per year. And the big growth is actually coming from the transportation space, automobiles, buses, that sort of thing. Small contribution from food storage, really, very, very small that\u2019s more of story that\u2019s 5 to 10 years out type of thing.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Mike Harrison of Seaport Global. Please go ahead. ","Mike Harrison","John, I was hoping that you could comment a little bit on whether you\u2019ve seen the impact of the higher cost out of Chile related to the royalty payments. And also, can you talk about the contribution of potash in the quarter?","John Mitchell","So Mike, the royalty payments, community payments, are all fully baked into Q1 results. So that went into effect January 1. So it\u2019s all part of the mixed now. With regard to potash, as you know, potash is a pretty small part of our business in terms of the way it contributes 5-ish, around 5%. As we actually extract more brine out of the viatorcoma [ph], we\u2019ll have the ability to expand on a potash basis. But right now, we\u2019re essentially maxed out in terms of our potash plant and we\u2019ll evaluate as we extract more brine what the opportunities look like for potash going forward.","Mike Harrison","All right. And then I was also hoping you could comment on what you\u2019re seeing in terms of lithium carbonate versus lithium hydroxide pricing in your outlook. I assume that the 20%-ish growth number for the rest of the year is kind of a blended average from everything. Is one of them significantly stronger and increasing? Can you just give us some color on that?","John Mitchell","With regard to pricing, I would say no. I mean, one it is necessarily stronger or weaker on an incremental basis. As you know -- may know that the price for hydroxide trends higher than carbonate. But on a year-on-year basis, one is performing better than the other at this point.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn of Longbow Research. Please go ahead. ","Dmitry Silversteyn","A couple of questions, if I may, revisiting the refining catalyst business. First of all, in the first quarter results, you talked about trails and a couple of other things, the debt to EBITDA, but I would have thought that would\u2019ve also impacted revenue. So was it most fixed that margin supply?","Luke Kissam","Yes, it was mainly, Dmitry, price and mix, call it a disconnect. And remember at our Investor Day, we talked about moving in and trying to get more into the resid market, [indiscernible] resid market and how they trading capital. We had good volume in hydro treating catalyst, but more of it was in that resid where we make our margins are less, and if we sell into this business market, so that was a piece of it. And we also had with our joint venture, sold more resid out of that, too, in Japan. So that was really a mix issue.","Dmitry Silversteyn ","Okay. So the turnarounds that you mentioned, that impacted your profitability, should we sort of keep that in mind for a year from now when they may not happened in the first quarter as an adjustment to our expectations or is it just the ramp sort of forecast beyond the current quarter?","Matt Juneau ","Dmitry, this is Matt. Since Silvio is not here, let me take this one. If you look at what we\u2019ve said about FCC from the beginning of the year, we knew that some of our major customers were going to be undergoing turnarounds and doing competitive trials in FCC, and that\u2019s why our Refining Solutions guidance have been back ended a little bit second half versus first half. It\u2019s kind of like Luke said earlier in response to \u201818, it\u2019s probably a little too early to get into detail in \u201818. But right now, our review of \u201818 in FCC is favorable.","Dmitry Silversteyn","Fair enough. And then as my follow-up question, just fantastic really quick one, and I understand as a small business than the PCF portion of the company, but I mean, we haven\u2019t had other than business and probably two to three years. If I could change or whether it\u2019s something you shouldn\u2019t do more something with that but that market needs to change for both the polyolefin piece and the organometallic piece to actually become something that we can talk about positively?","Luke Kissam ","Go ahead, John.","John Mitchell","So first off, I do think that this business has growth potential. It suffers from some over capacity in the organometallic, so we\u2019re seeing volume growth. We\u2019re just seeing price decline over the last number of years. Hopefully, we hit the bottoms. But its growth -- the overall business will continue to grow based on the growth of plastics and the new and more high-performance types of plastics and resins that are going into packaging. So it does have -- as we outlined at Investor Day, we do believe that it does have a nice growth profile. We\u2019ve suffered also from a significant customer bankruptcy. And so we\u2019re kind of in a turnaround year, where hopefully will bottom out. And then the business will be back on a nice trajectory going forward.","Dmitry Silversteyn","Okay. So 2018 when we should see at least the polyethylene turnaround than it sounds like maybe a couple of more years for organometallic\u2019s?","Matt Juneau","That\u2019s right.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of David Wang of Morningstar. Please go ahead.","David Wang","First is on the guidance, I think as I look at the EBITDA guidance was raised by about $35 million, but the net cash from operations and adjusted free cash flow remain the same. Is there some additional cash usage that and of course something like working capital, or is it more so that\u2019s a lower net cash from operations and free cash flow lines have a wider range, so this adjustment doesn\u2019t really move a needle?","John Mitchell","Yes, David. As you look at the guidance, so EBITDA is up, you\u2019re correct, $35 million, but that comes on the back of increased revenue, and as a result of that, increased working capitals. And since most of the guidance increases in the second half of the year, not in the second quarter, but in the second half. The working capital really stays out there on our balance sheet that you are in. So as a result, that are cash flow -- we\u2019re expecting cash flow to be about the same, maybe a little bit better, but about the same, so in that range of $200 million to $300 million. There really are no other spending changes, if you will, captured in that guidance. CapEx is about where we thought it was going to be. Other items are where we thought they\u2019re going to be.","David Wang","All right, great. And then it looks like as we have discussed Chinese EV sales maybe a little week in January and February, but bounced back in March. But they are stepping down there incentives this year versus the previous year. Are you concerned at all about that and what\u2019s your outlook for Chinese EV sales for the remainder of \u201817?","John Mitchell","As we said a little bit earlier on the call in talking to our cathode and battery customers and just having spend a little bit of time in Asia. No concern in our end, that the actions by Chinese government or the incentives, well in a way affect our guidance for the remainder of 2017.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Laurence Alexander of Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Dan Rizzo","This is Dan Rizzo on for Laurence. The cyclicality that you mentioned in bromine before, is that lessening with your reduced exposure with electronics end market?","Raphael Crawford","This is Raphael, Dan. I don\u2019t think that we reduced our exposure to the electronics. But what I would say is that there\u2019s been a greater diversification of applications within the electronics that has given us more confidence going into the future. As Scott had mentioned, there\u2019s still as cyclicality in electronics overall, but we\u2019re no longer as dependent, for example, on PCs and TV sales and that we\u2019ve diversified, but the market have diversified into wire and cable for automotives, so transportation, wire and cable and Circuit Boards has really increased and some of the end markets have changed. So we feel like it\u2019s in a more stable position going forward.","Luke Kissam","So from my standpoint, I think Raphael mentioned really growth point there I think we have de-risk of that bromine business on the downside because of the broad applications that we have in that business and how this evolved over the last five or 10 years.","Dan Rizzo","With the diversification in the Internet of Things and just a broad use of different semiconductors, electronics [indiscernible] and everything, I mean, would that be a growth driver for bromine, or is it, am I just over thinking it?","Luke Kissam","I mean, look, I think I don\u2019t think you\u2019re over thinking it. I think that everywhere that you have a connector or anywhere you need more computing power where you have a fitted wiring board, that\u2019s an opportunity for bromine for that application today. The question becomes over the next decade as they become smaller or they stay in the same size or what\u2019s the new technology others. So I think where we feel very positive about that business. We continue to operate it as a key to our strategy. It continues to generate excellent cash flow. And we continue to harvest that cash and invest in the maintenance of our bromine business so that we can guarantee the prompt response that our customers need and to continue to grow as best we can. But do not expect bromine to grow high single and low double digits for the next five years. It will not do it. We\u2019ve said it will grow around GDP, up some, down some. This year, it\u2019s going to be enough. I don\u2019t know what the future holds. But within what we can control, we\u2019re going to make this the best bromine business in the world.","Operator","Our next mentioned is from the line of Chris Kapsch of Aegis Capital. Please go ahead.","Chris Kapsch","I had a follow-up on the Lithium business and perhaps the margin profile there. You mentioned that obviously strategically, you\u2019re shifting a bunch of your tonnage to captive conversion from toll, but you did mention toll conversion still part of the mix. So I\u2019m just wondering how far along are you in shifting overall toll volumes to captive conversion? And what sort of affected the toll volumes are still there have an margins? And then how do you see that playing out over time?","John Mitchell","So this is John. The shift from toll to captive happened as a result of the acquisition of the two Chinese facilities that we acquired. So they were tolling facilities for us originally than through the acquisition, now they\u2019re producing volumes that are part of our portfolio, plus we\u2019re expanding the volumes within those assets. Tolling will always be a part of our portfolio. And we continue -- we have a couple other tolling partners that we continue to do business with this year. The tolling volumes this year for those other tolling partners, not necessarily growing, but we continue to maintain those relationships going forward and expect to for a long time.","Chris Kapsch","And just the influence on the margins, I guess, apples-to-oranges now that you have those significant chunks of conversion capacity effectively captive via the acquisitions?","John Mitchell","Yes. So margins from a tolling facility as you can imagine will be lowered than the margins from facility that we own because the tone needs to make some kind of process in terms of operating that asset for us. So yes. So you end up improving your margin by shifting from tolling to captive assets.","Luke Kissam","So what you got to look back overall, when you look at the fact is what you\u2019re capital cost, what\u2019s your cost of depreciation that goes in there, how do you operate the assets versus how they were operated before, what do our ages any standards and the other process standards that we have, how does that impact that margin. We\u2019ve obviously, as you would expect, believe that resid rely tolling that we make more money and we de-risk of those strategy by having. So you saw some improvement in our first quarter margin. And if you look at that, we said a good deal of it was driven by a recent of those Chinese assets that we own. So it\u2019s a positive move and as we bring on more and more capacity and reduce our unit costs down, we will be able to continue to deliver the best-in-class type of margins that we did in the first quarter.","Scott Tozier","And again, I go back to our philosophy and strategy to secure long-term agreements with customers on a long-term basis, multi-year basis and bring on capacity to meet those contracts and so as we bring up on our own captive capacity, essentially sold out day one. So we need the relationships with the tolling partners to give us some flexibility as well.","Luke Kissam","But Chris -- hi Chris if I can make one other point. I know everybody\u2019s what are margins going to be, you can\u2019t just look at in one avenue and say you\u2019re moving now to your own conversion assets, so your margins are to be bought or. You we\u2019ve got additional cost that are -- that we\u2019re going to be running through that will ramp up of the course of the year from the expiration standpoint. That didn\u2019t hit as much in the first quarter as you\u2019re going to see it in the next three quarters. And we have got to spend that money to understand the quality of the potential resources that we could bring on in the next decade. And that money that been in a ramp-up over the course of the rest of the year. So we -- as we look at our margins overall, this year, our margins in lithium could be a little bit higher than the target that we set. But I don\u2019t see the first quarter repeating every quarter for the rest of the year from a margin perspective.","Chris Kapsch","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. It makes sense. And then just one quick follow for Raphael, Raphael lot of air time today. Just real quick, though. Just on the strength your seeing in flame retardants, bromine flame retardants and specifically and understand the rising tide of an overall more healthy electronics and the market. But can you talk about specifically where you\u2019re seeing strings for BFRs? Is it across the board, or is it more specifically PWBs versus enclosures versus connectors for automotive? Thanks","Raphael Crawford","Yes. Sure, Chris. It\u2019s roughly in the printed wire board market as well as the connector space, that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing the strength in flame retardants. It\u2019s not so much in enclosure. It is good news that when we look at the statistics, certainly, we\u2019ve seen the bottoming out or leveling out on the enclosures market, but it\u2019s not what was the meaningful contribution to our improved performance. And now, we think it will drive the rest of the year.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Tyler Frank of Robert Baird. Please go ahead. ","Tyler Frank","Just on the growing market, are you seeing strength in the other markets besides electronics that are notable? And then how low do you expect the lower volumes out of China to last? Is it a 1 to 2 quarter thing or [indiscernible] longer term? Thank you. ","Scott Tozier","So the other markets -- I mean, the largest market for Albemarle is our flame retardants market. The largest market for the industry is flame retardants for bromine. Next is completion fluids, and then we have a whole host of specialty applications, and those have been there small in volume, but in total, they performed pretty well. But overall, the strength of our business, because of the importance of flame retardants, the strength of our results in Q1 and when we look out for the year, it\u2019s really going to be driven by flame retardants and then some recovery in clear brines later in the year. With regard to China, as I had said, I think that we -- we\u2019re expecting prices an average to still be higher than what we\u2019ve seen on the average of the previous 5 years. We think it\u2019ll still remain strong on year, but we don\u2019t know with the second half of the year will look like when summer production could come back up in China. And there are volume -- the production has been low, the demand has been fairly good. And therefore, that\u2019s been -- what\u2019s driven up prices. Expected to be good, but we\u2019re not banking on it on the long term. That is why we continued to work all the things we do on productivity within our assets to make sure we stay competitive whether the market is up, whether the market is down.","Operator","Okay. So, our next question is from the line of Robert Koort of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Ryan Berney","This is Ryan Berney. Just wanted to get one more in for John, if I can. John, I wanted to ask you about I know you got a couple of questions answer already, but I think there was some chatter that perhaps you\u2019ve got some inventory that maybe was on a lower COG basis coming out of last year. So I guess, can you talk about the $60 million to $70 million in the royalties any other cost this year? And your guidance in the back half seems to be somewhat flat with the first half, really just kind of the read we\u2019re getting from you, so I guess I think about production growth presumably we have La Negra II in the back half, we should be getting some significant health there. So I\u2019m wondering if those $60 million to $70 million in the earnings headwinds there, that you called out are both more back calculated and maybe if you can give some granularity on how much you see and you saw in the first quarter?","Scott Tozier","Yes. So, Ryan, it\u2019s Scott. So specifically about the lower cost inventory, one of the key things to remember with the Chilean concession and the royalty that we\u2019re paying as well as the community payments, that\u2019s tied to production that started in 2017. So we did not see a full run rate, if you will, of that royalty in the first quarter. So we saw something like, I don\u2019t know, $7 million to $8 million in the first quarter. We\u2019re still expecting to see a full year of around $50 million. So that certainly had some support for that margin in the first quarter. And maybe, John, you can talk a little bit about the production ramp up La Negra II, and how that layers in for the rest of the year?","John Mitchell","Yes. So we\u2019ve started production in Q1, certainly going to continue to ramp from a volumetric perspective, increasing throughout the year. And as we\u2019ve said, we\u2019re going to probably bring 6,000 to 7,000 metric tons on this year and then another one third in 2018. So it\u2019ll be a continuous ramp through 2017.","Matt Juneau","So, Lisa, this is Matt. I think we\u2019re out of our time limit. Thank you. You could close the call for us.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect your lines. Have a great day. Thank you."]}}
