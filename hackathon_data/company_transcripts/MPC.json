My name is Sheila, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions]. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Kristina Kazarian. Kristina, you may begin.","Kristina Kazarian","Welcome to Marathon Petroleum Corp.'s First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. The slides that accompany this call can be found on our website at marathonpetroleum.com under the Investor Center tab. On the call today are Gary Heminger, Chairman and CEO; Greg Goff, Executive Vice Chairman; Tim Griffith, CFO; Don Templin, President of Refining, Marketing and Supply; Mike Hennigan, President of MPLX; as well as other members of the executive team.","We invite you to read the safe harbor statements on Slide 2. It's a reminder that we will be making forward-looking statements during the call and during the question-and-answer session. Actual results may differ materially from what we expect today. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included there as well as in our filings with the SEC. Slide 2 also contains additional information related to the proposed MPLX transaction. Investors and security holders are encouraged to read the consent statement and registration statement to be filed with the SEC as well as other relevant documents filed with the SEC.","Now I will turn the call over to Gary Heminger for some opening remarks and highlights on Slide 3.","Gary Heminger","Thanks, Kristina. Good morning, and welcome for -- and thank you for joining our call. Our integrated business generated approximately $1.5 billion of adjusted EBITDA during the first quarter, as the stability of our Midstream and Retail segments helped to offset challenging refining market conditions. The diversification of our business model and flexibility of our refining system enabled us to generate through-cycle cash flow. And despite this being a weaker quarter, we generated nearly $1.2 billion of operating cash flow before working capital.","In the quarter, we returned over $1.2 billion of capital to MPC shareholders, including $885 million in share repurchases. Over the long term, we remain committed to returning at least 50% of discretionary free cash flow to investors.","Beginning of the year was difficult for the entire U.S. refining industry. Inventory levels were high as the industry came off a strong fourth quarter and a seasonal lack of demand as well as several weather disruptions led to challenging gasoline margins. At the same time, medium and heavy sour crude differentials compressed substantially, given geopolitical and policy changes.","As the quarter progressed, though, [indiscernible] supply reductions helped rebalance the market, and gasoline and distillate inventories are now below their 5-year averages. For April, our blended crack spread of $18.80 was more than double the first quarter average.","With the sweet\/sour crude spreads inside $3 per barrel, we have moved towards max sweet mode, but also continue to see the incentives to keep our coverage full. With our Midstream business, we continue to see a tremendous opportunity set. Earlier this morning, MPLX announced it had entered into a definite merger agreement to acquire ANDX. Details on the transaction were provided this morning, and we encourage you to read the deal announcement press release for more information.","Looking forward, the U.S. has become the largest producer of crude oil in the world, and natural gas and NGL volumes continue to grow as well. With this increased production, we believe that our midstream business is well positioned to participate in the infrastructure build-out opportunities. Mike Hennigan will speak to some of the key project updates later in the call. On the Retail side, the strong same-store merchandise sales and legacy Speedway markets that we have seen over the last 9 months continued into April. We expect this trend to continue as we move into the prime driving season. As we look to the remainder of 2019, our positive outlook is also supported by solid economic growth and expected contributions from the 700 store conversions. And in fact, we finished our 300th conversion yesterday.","Lastly, we see opportunities to drive the value creation using our technology platform. And inside the store, we continue to pursue opportunities to enhance customer interaction and drive sales.","We expect positive dynamics across all 3 of our business segments to support growing cash flows throughout the remainder of 2019. One of our core objectives is to grow profitably and create competitive advantages through strategic and disciplined investments. On that front, we also continuously assess our project portfolio to ensure our investments would generate strong project returns. Based on our internal forecasts, the Garyville Coker 3 project no longer comfortably exceeds the 20% hurdle rate we typically use for our refining projects. As such, we have decided to stop the Garyville Coker 3 project after completing definition engineering and remove it from our capital spending plans.","The change in the project return is primarily driven by our long-term outlook for heavy crude differentials. Geopolitical events have caused lower production of heavy crude, including lower Venezuelan production, slower Canadian pipeline development and our Iranian sanctions. In addition, more light crude is being produced as a result of continued U.S. shale growth. Having said this, our Garyville coker match project remains on schedule to complete the first phase in the fourth quarter of 2019 and the second phase in the first quarter of 2020 to take advantage of the new IMO bunker fuel requirements. Recall this project expands our capacity at the 2 existing cokers by about 14% by replacing the 4 existing 30-foot diameter drums with 32-foot diameter drums.","The LARIC project at our Los Angeles refinery remains on track to be completed in early 2020 and will increase our ability to produce higher value distillates. We're also pleased to announce that for the second year in a row, Marathon was awarded the EPA ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year. This is an impressive accomplishment and tangible evidence of our commitment to driving energy efficiency through everything we do.","As we look forward to the remainder of 2019, we expect improving industry dynamics of our past investments to support our growing cash flow outlook. And our team remains focused on operational excellence, achieving synergies and creating long-term shareholder value.","Now let me turn the call over to Greg who will provide some comments on our integration process, strategy development and commercial opportunities.","Gregory Goff","Thank you, Gary. We have made notable progress integrating the 2 companies over the past 7 months. Multiple senior executives and other key leaders have moved to our Findlay headquarters. In April, we launched a complete redesign of our corporate website. Much of the back-office work that prompted this relaunch was driven by our aligned direction work. The focus of this work was on cultural integration and developing the framework for the company's vision, strategy and core values.","Additionally, we have launched an initiative to begin the process of integrating our technology platforms. This initiative will allow -- enable us to improve efficiencies and deploy a world-class ERP system. Related to our commercial and competitive strategy, we are also very pleased with the continued success we have had growing our integrated business into new key markets.","In Western Mexico, we are currently supplying 192 sites, of which 142 are ARCO-branded. We now have the ARCO brand in 5 states that include Baja, California; Sonora; Sinaloa; Baja California Sur; and Chihuahua. Recently, we held grand opening activities at our first ARCO site in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez. The ARCO-branded sites in this area will be supplied directly from our El Paso refinery. In support of this ARCO growth, we continue to pursue additional Mexico supply capabilities through development of our Rosarito light products terminal in Northern Baja and lease capacity being built in Sinaloa.","On the other [indiscernible], we announced our agreement to acquire a large light product in Asphalt thermal and 33 NOCO Express retail stores in Buffalo, New York from NOCO Incorporated in support of our Midwest product placement strategy. This builds upon prior investments, including Speedway's acquisition of 78 Express Mart locations in Western New York. This extension of our integrated business model is positioned to be supplied from the Midwest [indiscernible] or the New York Harbor via multiple supply routes, including pipeline, truck rail or marine. ","We continue to progress additional commercial development projects related to development of our renewables portfolio, continuing to grow the reach of our integrated business model and optimizing our existing portfolio of integrated assets to create additional value for our stakeholders. ","Now let me turn the call over to Tim, who will provide a walk-through of our financial results.","Timothy Griffith","Thanks, Greg. Slide 4 provides a summary of our first quarter financial highlights. We reported $7 million loss attributable to MPC in the quarter. Income from operations was $669 million. Adjusted EBITDA was nearly $1.5 billion for the quarter. This does also include the $186 million of turnaround costs incurred during the quarter. Operating cash flow before working capital was approximately $1.2 billion. Capital spending for the quarter was just over $1.3 billion. Share repurchase and dividends were over $1.2 billion in the quarter, including $885 million in share repurchases and $354 million in dividends, which is reflective of the 15% increase in MPC dividends announced in January.","We ended the quarter with 667 million shares outstanding and consolidated leverage of 39% of book capitalization or 1.4x adjusted EBITDA at a parent-only basis. To allow additional time for questions, we've streamlined the information on the call for this quarter. The more detailed segment earnings walks we -- have been provided in the appendix of the presentation. The new format on Slide 5 captures our segment results and the walk of income by segment from the first quarter of 2018. ","Refining and marketing segment income decreased $201 million versus the same quarter last year as the addition of Andeavor's refining and marketing system was offset by narrow crude discounts across our medium and heavy sour [Technical Difficulty] additionally, high industry gasoline inventories following fourth quarter's strong production environment resulted in weaker-than-expected gasoline margins and price realizations. Quarterly segment results were also impacted by 1 extra month of incremental cost from the February 1 drop-down transaction. ","Refinery capacity utilization was 95%, resulting in total throughputs of 3.1 million barrels per day from the first quarter, which was 1.2 million barrels per day higher than first quarter last year due to the addition of the legacy Andeavor refineries. Recall, during the quarter, we completed planned maintenance work at our Robinson refinery and the Wilmington portion of the Los Angeles refinery.","Looking at our Midstream segment. Income increased $341 million versus the first quarter of 2018. The increase was due to contributions of $220 million from Andeavor Logistics and $121 million increase in results driven primarily by growth across MPLX's businesses. Moving to our Retail segment. Income increased $75 million versus same quarter last year primarily due to the addition of Andeavor's retail and dealer -- direct dealer operations as well as the $24 million increase in MPC legacy Speedway segment earnings. Retail fuel margins averaged $0.1715 per gallon in the first quarter of 2019. Same-store merchandise sales increased by 5.4% year-over-year, and same-store gasoline sales volumes decreased by 3.2% year-over-year.","Items not allocated to segments had a favorable impact of $14 million versus last year primarily due to $207 million noncash gain related to the exchange of MPC's undivided joint interest in the Capline system for an equity ownership in the newly formed joint venture. This benefit was partially offset by $91 million of transactions-related costs primarily associated with adopting MPC's vacation accrual policies across the legacy Andeavor employee base as well as higher corporate costs and expenses for the combined company. Interest and financing costs were $123 million higher during the first quarter of this year primarily due to higher combined debt balances as a result of the combination. Income tax has increased to $82 million due to higher income from operations as well as $36 million prior period state tax adjustment. We expect our effective income tax rate to be 2 to 3 percentage points lower than the statutory rate over the long term.","Noncontrolling interest increased $68 million, primarily driven by higher earnings in MPLX and the addition of Andeavor Logistics and the allocation of those earnings to the public unitholders of both partnerships. Slide 6 presents the elements of changes in our consolidated cash position for the first quarter. Cash at the end of the quarter was just under $900 million. Core operating cash flow before change to working capital was $1.2 billion source of cash in the quarter. Working capital was $470 million source of cash in the quarter largely due to the effects of rising commodity prices and the shorter terms on refined products compared to the longer terms on purchase of crude oil.","Return of capital to MPC shareholders by way of share repurchase and dividends totaled over $1.2 billion with $885 million worth of shares acquired during the quarter. Distributions to public unitholders of MPLX and ANDX was $230 million in the quarter. At quarter-end, we had approximately $28 billion of total consolidated debt, including $13.8 billion of debt at [indiscernible] and $5.1 billion at ANDX.","With that, let me turn the call over to Don.","Donald Templin","Thanks, Tim. As Greg mentioned, we are pleased with the significant progress we have made integrating our assets and operations. One example is the continued success we've had delivering synergies. As seen on the Slide 7, we realized $133 million of synergies in the first quarter, $89 million in refining and marketing, $29 million in corporate and $15 million in retail. We continue to have confidence in our ability to deliver on the significant opportunity set available to us, as most of these realized synergies are recurring or run rate synergies.","Within the refining business, we realized approximately $55 million of synergies during the quarter. Examples include utilizing turnaround best practices to lower costs and accelerate the completion date for the Los Angeles, Wilmington turnaround; catalyst reformulation changes; and optimizing Tier 3 gasoline compliance. Crude oil supply and logistics delivered approximately $30 million of realized synergies during the quarter. The majority of these synergies were driven by our ability to again leverage our scale to optimize access to Canadian crudes at our Mid-Continent region and foreign spot crude oil purchases as a combined business.","The $29 million in corporate synergies represents continued contract renegotiations made possible by the combination. Moving on to Slide 8. As we discussed at our 2018 Investor Day in December, we listened to investor feedback and are now providing R&M margin on a regional basis. An important point to note is that because of differences in our margin calculation method and different composition of our regions for the combined company, our reported margins are not directly comparable to historical margins reported by Andeavor. Some of the reasons include cost allocation between cost of sales and SG&A as well as expenses that are not allocated to any specific region such as fees paid to MPLX and ANDX.","For the first quarter, our Gulf Coast refining margin was $7.82 per barrel. Our Mid-Con refining margin was $15.26 per barrel. And our West Coast refining margin was $10.94 per barrel. Slide 9 provides updated outlook information on key operating metrics for MPC for the second quarter of 2019. As we look through 2019, we continue to expect our turnaround slate to be later than 2018. With that said, in the second quarter, we do have plant maintenance work at our Garyville, Martinez and Los Angeles refineries. ","The most significant of these activities is at Los Angeles where we are nearly complete with the 50-day outage on the FCC and alkylation units. Inclusive of these events, we expect total throughput volumes of approximately 2.9 million barrels per day. Our average total direct operating cost is projected to be $8.70 per barrel, and our corporate and other unallocated items are projected to be $200 million for the quarter. ","With that, let me turn the call over to Mike Hennigan to briefly discuss our Midstream business and projects.","Michael Hennigan","Thanks. We continue to see tremendous opportunity set across our midstream portfolio. We have recently progressed on several key midstream projects across our companies. First, today, MPLX announced its participation in the Wink-to-Webster crude pipeline. Although our prior project had sufficient commitments, we made the decision to join this project to enhance our capital efficiency and achieve a much higher return. Second, MPLX completed a binding open season [indiscernible] pipeline, which is partially owned by MPC, where we see significant shipper interest for both light and heavy crude, providing the opportunity to move forward with plans to start light oil deliveries in September 2020 and heavy oil deliveries in 2022. This project will allow Cushing supply to reach the Eastern Gulf and open the ability to export crude via the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port commonly referred to as LOOP. ","Third, at the MPC level, the Gray Oak project, where we have a 25% ownership, remains on track to come online in the fourth quarter of this year. Last, as Gary mentioned early this morning, MPLX announced a recent agreement to acquire ANDX. We are incredibly excited about the announcement. This deepens our presence in the Permian, has natural synergies and integration with MPC's refining business, and it creates tremendous opportunity to expand the logistics [indiscernible] focused regions of the U.S.","Now I'll turn it back to Kristina.","Kristina Kazarian","Thanks, Mike. [Operator Instructions]. With that, we will now open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Phil Gresh with JPMorgan.","Philip Gresh","First question for Gary. Just looking at your guidance for the second quarter and thinking back to your guidance back in December for the full year EBITDA, how are you thinking about that today in terms of whether the macro environment that we're seeing right now kind of with 1Q in the rearview would still be supportive of your full year EBITDA guidance?","Gary Heminger","Well, Phil, as you know, the first quarter ended up dramatically different for the entire industry, not just for us. And particularly, West Coast margins were weaker than we had anticipated. But the first quarter is in the rearview mirror, and as I stated in my comments, we're bullish on the balance of the year. As I stated, our margin here quarter-to-date is $18.80, which is about twice what it was in the first quarter. And -- but I think more important and kind of following in the line with -- if you recall what I stated in the fourth quarter call, we had predicted that inventories were going to start to fall some 6 million to 7 million barrels per day, and they did. We see right now inventories are at the low end. Gasoline is at the low end. ","If you look at it by region, really PADD III are the only -- is the only area that inventories are a little bit on the high side. That's also the big export region of the country, and those were also got back in line, I think, very quickly. So we're very bullish on where inventories are across the board, PADD V, PADD II, even PADD I inventories. I look at it, it's a very light turnaround year for us. Don just mentioned that we made tremendous progress. We're going to -- knock on wood here, but we're going to finish the LA turnaround ahead of schedule below budget. This is one of the key synergies that Greg and I spoke to when we talked about this combination was how we can do major turnarounds, major projects and bring in our expertise to be able to accomplish those. So I would say with first quarter being in the rearview mirror that we remain very bullish on the balance of the year.","Philip Gresh","Okay. Great. And then a second question, you made some comments in your prepared remarks about the rationale for canceling the Garyville Coker project. I had two ask questions about that. One is whether we should read into that, that perhaps you're less bullish on light-heavies, specifically around IMO 2020? Or is it more just a longer-term comment since the project doesn't come on till 2021? And then secondarily, what does this mean for capital spending at the parent company level? I think you said $2.8 billion annually in '19 and '20. And so should we see that come down ratably each year for canceling that project? Or are there other offsets?","Gary Heminger","No. As you recall, Phil, when we talked about this project to begin with, we stated it was not an IMO 2020 project. This was subsequent to the initiation and implementation, if you will, of IMO 2020. So this has nothing to do -- we're very positive about IMO 2020. And you've noticed all of the discussions in D.C. and in and around the international markets. And I specifically went over to Singapore and some Asian markets to really get a real good fix and came away very positive that even those markets are going to be in compliance with IMO 2020 going forward. So this project was clearly the -- canceling or long deferral is maybe is a better -- was clearly where we see the light-heavy spreads today. Let me turn over to the Don to give you some more color on the spreads.","Donald Templin","Yes, Phil. I mean, think I Gary explained it right. We're very bullish on IMO. So our view hasn't changed there. This was really a longer-term view around what was happening on the light-heavy differentials. And then to your comments or questions around sort of capital spending, I think we indicated at Investor Day, but this was very much back-ended in terms of the spending. 2019 was going to be primarily an engineering year. And so we had about $70 million or so in the budget in 2019 related to this project. A really big proportion of this spend was actually in 2021. So I think as we sit here, we're very comfortable with the guidance that we gave for 2019 and not being over that. And we're very comfortable with being flat into 2020. And we'll -- as we get to the end of the year, we'll give more color around our 2020 budget. But I don't think you should see a dramatic change in 2019. It wasn't a pro rata spend.","Gary Heminger","Phil, I'll just add one more thing. As we've talked several times, you've been into business with us, about capital discipline. This just illustrates how disciplined we are. Ray came to us and said, as we look at our internal forecast, the spreads weren't there, still was a good return project. But we have better projects down the road. And so we're very disciplined and said now's not the time.","Operator","Our next question comes from Roger Read with Wells Fargo.","Roger Read","And let me say thanks for the additional disclosure at the regional level. I think that'll be very helpful going forward. Just jumping in here, kind of 2 main questions. One, if you could help us to understand on the synergy progress, how that compared to sort of your expectations not just in the $133 million relative to the $600 million-plus run rate by year-end, but also kind of by segment, how that's progressing? And then my other question is kind of dovetailing with that. As you generate more cash flows out of the synergies, what should be a better outlook overall for the remainder of the year, how the share repo -- share repurchase program should be thought of here? The pace we saw in Q1, maybe some deceleration to kind of match cash flows from here. Just how you're thinking about that?","Timothy Griffith","Yes, Roger, on the synergy -- I'll just start up by -- on the synergy. The $133 million this quarter is incremental to the first 3 months of operation, which we had $165 million, $166 million of synergies. So if you look at it, it's about $300 million in total. I just want to clarify, it's not $133 million by itself. You have to look at what we already accomplished. But Don can go into the details here and then Tim will talk about the share repo.","Donald Templin","Yes, Roger, it's fair to say that we are well ahead of our plan in each of the segments around the realization of synergies. So you'll recall that our original guidance was $480 million [indiscernible] the year and up to $600 million that's for end of 2019. That would imply $40 million a month at the $480 million level and higher than that at the $600 million level. We're already above $40 million a month averaging for the first quarter, and that was along all of the different business segments. So I feel very comfortable in our ability. We had a ramp in the plan anyways. It was going to grow as the year went on, and you definitely see that in things like Retail, where we're doing the conversions and you would have those synergies coming on. The other thing that happens is as we realize synergies, they enter -- they -- you get more months of capturing the synergies. So if we capture the synergy, let's say -- or realized the synergy in March, we would have only had 1 month of that synergy in the first quarter, but we're going to have 3 months of that synergy in the second quarter. So we feel really good about the positioning. And let me turn it over to Tim to talk about the share repurchase piece of it.","Timothy Griffith","Yes, Roger, thanks for the question. I mean, as we did at Investor Day, we really laid out what our commitment around return of capital is going to be, 50% of discretionary consolidated free cash flow, and we're going to be steadfast to that commitment. We had the $885 million in the first quarter, probably had a little bit of concentration to it, but we'll assess it over the course of the year. Again, we've built this metric as a direct tie to operating cash flow less the maintenance capital we need to support the business. So from that point I want to make is that we're really viewing return on the capital on par with capital by that construct. But we remain steadfast. We'll see how the rest of the year plays out to the extent that synergies result in additional cash flow through operating cash flow. It's part of that formulation. So we're -- we'll be steadfast to that commitment for the long term and will measure it over calendar period. ","Gary Heminger","And another thing, Ray, I like you to talk about -- Ray just updated us this week on the big turnaround that we're just completing at LA and some of the catalyst formulations that you will see these synergies coming in the subsequent months. But talk a little bit about what you're seeing there.","Raymond Brooks","Sure, Gary. At LA, as Gary alluded to earlier, we're completing a very large turnaround on the cat and alkylation unit at -- on the Carson side. Right now, one of the synergies that we've got pretty much in the bag, as you talked about, was from the turnaround management side. We expect [indiscernible] turnaround in close to a week ahead of schedule and under budget. So that's all working well. But where we think the real value is, is once we start the unit up, we will move to a different catalyst formulation in the cat cracker. And this is a true synergy with how we operate our Garyville refinery. We'll go to a formulation that mirrors Garyville, has the same output of that and will result in a huge yield benefit once we start that unit up. In fact, we actually are transferring about 750 tons of spent catalyst from Garyville so that when we start that unit up hopefully in a week or 2, we'll get the benefit from that immediately.","Operator","Our next question comes from Prashant Rao with Citigroup.","Prashant Rao","I wanted to pick up on that a little bit, Ray, on the LA turnaround coming out of that PADD V, gasoline price obviously very strong. Just wanted to get sort of shorter-term outlook on how we should think about capture as you come out of the maintenance period, given the healthy gasoline frac. And bigger picture, I guess, question for multiple members of the team, we're entering positions to transfer gasoline, I think, nationwide now versus where we started at the beginning of the year. I think that the mentality has changed 180 degrees. And looking forward to IMO 2020, where you think about maybe some benefits there as well. I was wondering if you could speak to the strength of the global gasoline market, maybe the U.S. overall, within that sort of your view maybe going out a few quarters. Are you more bullish now than you were maybe 3 months ago? And is there a reason to maintain that bullishness for us as we look at modeling this out?","Gary Heminger","Prashant, this is Gary first. I would say we definitely are more bullish on the global gasoline market than we were 3 months ago. Let's back up and make sure everybody understands what happened over the 6-month period. The fourth quarter was very strong due to very wide crude differentials and very strong -- or excuse me, and a very quick collapse of the crude market, which led to very wide differentials or crack spreads as well as very wide gasoline margins at the Retail. So all of those things therefore led to refineries running to pull out. Then we came over to the first quarter and we have ample inventory. Now that inventory really came back in check, not only here in the U.S., but when I look at things globally -- and one of the reasons I went to Asia to really understand what the markets were doing there. I think we're the -- the West refining industry is set up very, very well for 2 things. ","We're set up very well for both gasoline. Everybody's talked about IMO and the distillate expectation. And yes, we've been running max distillate for the most of the first quarter. But I would suggest again that I think there's a good shot that we'll be seeing kind of a max gasoline mode second quarter and into the third quarter. And Ray can talk about that in more detail here. But we certainly are much more bullish, and it's certainly evident. Yes, the first quarter, PADD V margins in the first quarter were very challenged. But I look to where they have been, they got much better in February, got a lot better in March and very strong in April and month-to-date here in May. So PADD II continues to be very strong. So I think as I said earlier, PADD III is really the export market to the globe, and I think that they're going to be able to bring those inventories in check. But Ray can go over for you by pad or by region what he sees as far as a max gas or max diesel.","Raymond Brooks","Sure. Sure. And it varies as far as what region we're in and where we are with our streams. On the West Coast, back in March, we saw incentive to move to a max gasoline mode and we did that. In the Mid-Con area in early April, we saw that incentive, and we made that move to gasoline focus. The Gulf Coast is a little bit different animal. On the Gulf Coast, one, we've seen stronger diesel prices relative to gasoline, which support being at -- staying in the diesel mode. The other thing is it's not all just about diesel prices and gasoline prices. On the Gulf Coast, where we have the ability to buy and sell intermediates, that comes into play. And specifically, the weakness of the NAFTA market has driven us to remain in the diesel mode on the Gulf Coast. What I like to emphasize is that, one, it's not a 2-variable equation. And then the other thing, every day, we're looking at the prices and we're running our LP models to determine, hey, where should we be from our cut points from our gasoline focus and diesel focus? We're seeing a little bit of a change out on the West Coast. Even though gasoline has been strong, we're seeing diesel become strong relative to gasoline. And if need be, we'll pivot again on that. ","So we don't have a set opinion about which way we're going to go. We're going to let the market tell us and do what's most economical. The other thing before I leave this question and follow-up to California and back what I was talking about with the LA-Carson cat cracker, that's a large cat cracker, about 100,000 barrels a day. And the catalyst reformulation was really driven to fully optimize the LARIC project that Andeavor had done. If you recall, that project actually shut down a cat cracker, but remained with two alkylation units. What we're doing with the catalyst formulation is make sure that we fully utilize those 2 alkylation units to make a very premium gasoline blend product. That's it.","Prashant Rao","Appreciate all the color. And then just one last quick one. I wanted to circle back on the Garyville Coker 3. Appreciate the color there that it's a change maybe and where we are with light-heavy differentials and expectations. Just wanted to get a sense, as we think about longer term from your view, are you -- I think maybe light-heavy differential is just a push on how tight we are right now that the widening and normalization, sort of the shape of that curve is similar, but we're just starting at a tighter point? Or is there something that in the duration of light-heavy differential volatility looking out? As we go through to 2020, that changed in your mind?","Gary Heminger","Yes. Prashant, this is a long-term project. If we thought that this was just an aberration, a 1-year aberration, we would have continued down with the project. Our concerns over some policy changes around the world, the issues going on in Venezuela that was a big supplier of heavy crude. And so therefore, it kind of leads -- the Middle East producers as the swing producer to bring heavy into this market. And so we just see that is -- I would say the latter to your point, this is going to be narrower or compressed differentials for a longer period of time. And I want to emphasize, though, that we will finish the conceptual engineering. This is done. We'll have it available to us. If we decide that the market has turned, the Canadian markets open back up, the Venezuelan situation improves, there's other heavies that come into the marketplace, we can reinstitute this project quickly. But again, I think it's -- there's just about right capital play and right capital discipline this time.","Operator","Our next question comes from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.","Neil Mehta","I guess, my first question is just around earnings consistency, Gary. And if I look back over the last 5 years, so let's take the last 21 quarters, you've beaten consensus about 50% of the time, you missed consensus about 50% of the time. And the S&P large-cap average is closer to 75%. So just wanted your thoughts on what the company can do to get a more consistent pattern of earnings execution. We're not quarter-to-quarter folks, but certainly that helps with continuing to support the story when you have a more consistent earnings set of results.","Gary Heminger","Well, Neil, I'm in the same camp as you. I wish we were all perfect and -- to provide forecast that follow a simple model. But we're running a dynamic model. And in a dynamic model with -- and we're 2 quarters into this very large transaction. I applaud the team here for tremendous accomplishments to date, not only on synergy, but on integration and where we see how we are accelerating this integration from the systems and our modeling concept going forward. We provided this time information to the market here on a regional basis, which you've been asking for and rightly so, and asking for some time, which is certainly going to help with that. And I think as the market really gets more attuned, we have a huge MLP. ","And with that MLP, we have assets that -- the thermal assets, the marine assets, pipeline that used to be within the R&M sector that now flow into that -- into the MLP. Therefore, that is a deduction, if you will, or an operating expense that goes through the last R&M section. I think for the most part, the MLP in the Retail side is more of a simple model to be able to forecast. But it's a multiple layer dynamic model to be able to do the whole R&M system. We're going to get better with that. I haven't done the math to be able to confirm or deny your comment of -- I think we're better than 50-50. But as I said, I haven't done that nor is that the real question. The real question is how do we get our system to be able to help you model better going forward to have the best the data that you can. But I'll take you back to the first quarter in the way we -- we're out front talking about where we thought inventory levels were going to go and see that happening and it did happen. So stay tuned. I wish we were perfect, but we're going to get better as we go forward. Don, do you want to add a few things?","Donald Templin","Yes, Neil. I mean, maybe one other comment is we're trying to provide you with information I think that allows that modeling to occur. So a little bit more color on turnarounds like we did this time, so you understand it was a cat alky. So that will obviously impact gasoline production on the West Coast. I mean, we're trying to give that kind of data, so you can build that into your model. And that's our commitment going forward is to try to give incremental color like that.","Neil Mehta","And we definitely appreciate incremental color, it goes a long way. I guess, the follow-up is the stock, the way we look at it, is so dislocated relative to its sum of the parts value. The question we consistently get is what ultimately is going to unlock that value. So going back a couple of years, there was a talk about disintegration and whether there is value in doing that. But Gary, what are your latest thoughts there? I'm just saying if there is -- if the stock is just discounted relative to its sum of the parts, how do you pull forward that value? Is MPC better together or apart?","Gary Heminger","Well, you're right, Neil, the stock is discounted when you look at it on a sum of the parts basis. But I also want you to take a strong look at the first quarter's performance. The MLP performed really, I would say, right in line. The MLP is right in line with expectations providing $908 million of EBITDA. The Retail, Retail performed a very, very well. And as we stated, the merchandise sales are running at about 4% to 5% same-store increase, which is very, very strong. Granted, in the first quarter with the rising crude price, same-store volume was on gasoline slips, because you're trying to get that gasoline price to the street. But you add those 2 sectors together and they are very, very strong sectors and now compare to those to some of our peers in the first quarter who did not -- they did not have those sectors in their portfolio. I would say for the long term, I'd rather be invested in a company that has that type of a portfolio balance. But your -- you saw here in the first quarter, we bought back a substantial amount of shares. I think it was a very smart purchase to continue to buy back shares at this low valuation rate. And as we project, the second through the fourth quarters, we expect to be, as I said earlier, bullish. And that should provide us with the capital to continue to lean into the share repurchases. And Greg? I think Greg will add a few more...","Gregory Goff","Yes, Neil. What I'd like to do is just add a couple of comments to what Gary said. I think, one, everybody needs to recognize that we just went through a tremendous change. We're only 6 months or 7 months into this big change. But I think underneath that change, when our whole idea going back many months ago, was that the power and what we were able to create by having this integrated business provides tremendous opportunities to generate earnings and cash and competitive advantages. And we're on track to be able to do that. So one of the things that I think that has an impact on the valuation at this point in time is just that we're in the early stages of developing a track record of pulling all these things together. And I think everything you've heard about, the synergies, the work in the marketing business, the retail to do the conversions that drives the integration and all that will start to deliver over time. But we are absolutely convinced that our integrated business, by taking it from where we buy our crude to how we sell it in the marketplace, is the most powerful way to run the business forward, and we'll demonstrate that over time.","Operator","Our next question comes from Manav Gupta with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Manav Gupta","So when I go back to the days of Galveston Bay, it used to be a high-cost asset. And then you took over and crushed the OpEx over there. And I'm looking at the West Coast OpEx guidance. It looks a little high right now. And if somebody can crush it, it's you. So I'm just trying to understand what's the plan of action to bring this more to a normalized level? And by when, can we see this op cost trending down lower?","Gary Heminger","Sure, Manav. And that's a good point. If you go back to our Analyst Day, we had a couple of slides in there that depicted the difference in the Solomon index. If you look across the industry what our Solomon index is for the legacy Marathon versus the legacy Andeavor sites and specifically to LA, we took Galveston Bay from a very high fourth-quartile performing refinery. But we expect to end -- the final numbers are going to come out mid-year this year for '18. We expect to have that down to probably the top end of a first-quartile refinery on an EDU basis. The second thing to understand -- I was going to turn over to Ray, but Ray is too humble to answer this question. Ray ran Galveston Bay. We asked Ray to go run Galveston Bay. It was with our succession plan and was that Ray went in there and did a good job operating that place. He more than likely was going to run all of refining, and he did an outstanding job. He has, on LA -- our new plant manager came from a Catlettsburg, Tracy Case who ran Garyville, who ran the best EDU on a cost per barrel basis, the best refinery in the country, is looking over that refinery now. So trust me, we are very, very focused. And I think it's further illustrated in that we're going to this turnaround done early and below budget. So we're very, very focused. And lastly, the work that we just came out of -- we've now completed all of the represented refineries are complete with the negotiations of those contracts. And we cut a significant amount of cost out of the LA refinery here in our first contract negotiations. Ray, any more to add?","Raymond Brooks","Yes, I'd just like to add that your point is spot on with what our focus is. We've put for the second quarter, of course, some of that is driven by the high turnaround work that we have in California in the second quarter. But our real focus is looking at the other manufacturing costs. And when you see that differential relative to the Gulf Coast, we know California won't get to the Gulf Coast, but directionally, we can improve from where we are. So that's spot on. And it's not one thing. It's not turnarounds. It's not people. It's a combination of looking for all the efficiency knobs. And Gary talked about one of them just now as far as, hey, our contracts, we believe coming out of the first quarter, we have more efficient contracts to work with. And so we will continue to work with the California teams to just say, hey, how can -- given the landscape that we have out there, how can we get better?","Manav Gupta","And a quick follow-up, guys. On the Analyst Day, one of the slides kind of highlighted that in 2019 and '20, you expect close to $1.9 billion in cash to be kicked back from the Midstream to the parent. Given the deal announcement today morning, I did my quick math, I was still coming very close to $1.9 billion. I'm just trying to understand is that still the number that you expect the Midstream component of the business to give it back to you in terms of cash returns?","Timothy Griffith","Yes, Manav, it's Tim. The -- obviously, the guidance on distribution back was based on sort of standalone with the combination there could be some adjustments to it. And again, we're not going to sort of reguide to it, but there is certainly, by way of a combination, less distributions that would be made out of what would have been the ANDX system. So there's probably some adjustment offset by what the distribution outlook as we set that for 2020, which we're not doing at this time. So I don't think we're concerned at all about any degradation of cash flow coming from MLP distribution and its impact on MPC's capital or return plans.","Operator","Our next question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America.","Douglas Leggate","Gary, the MPLX deal address is one element of complexity one could argue. But I think in your prior conversations, prior remarks you've made about this, you remain quite unhappy with the way the overall MLP is traded by way of its yield today, which I think is still one of the highest in this space. What can you do next now that you've simplified this part of the structure? Any further thoughts on how you can improve the market reception to what is now one of the most attractive yields in this space?","Gary Heminger","Sure. Sure, Doug. The conversation for the last 6 months has been the overhang of having two MLPs and the overhang not only on MPLX, but therefore the overhang that then translates into MPC. So we just announced the transaction this morning. We will see over time here how things move. The -- we would talk with the market over time that we continue to look at does the C-corp structure make sense, does some other structure makes sense. But I think that give it some time here. This overhang should come out of the market. All the projects that Mike Hennigan outlined here on this call and earlier today on the MPLX call and this combination, we probably have the best backlog and best growth of third-party fee-based revenue in -- really in the whole MLP space. So time would tell if we get respect for these projects and respect for what we have put forth. I think we will, because it's very clean, it's very simple and performance will dictate how we recover.","Douglas Leggate","Okay. Well, I guess, we'll have a chance to chat more [indiscernible] I'm sure. My follow-up is just a quick one follow-up on the synergies question from earlier. I just wanted to be clear whether you're achieving the same synergy target quicker or if you're you finding more in terms of the overall prognosis for your synergy target? And I'll leave it there.","Donald Templin","Doug, this is Don. I would say yes to both of those. So we knew that there were opportunities and the goal was, one, to expand the opportunity set and the ideas that we have that would generate synergies. And the second was to accelerate the realization of those. And so we're really pleased actually with both. The portfolio backlog is growing and the realization rate is occurring much faster than we anticipated.","Gary Heminger","And Doug, the first quarter here, it was unfortunate that the whole industry struggled just from the commodity prices, but mainly from the big overhang in inventory and then the compression of the crude diffs. But our synergies are really masked by the downturn in the overall refining industry. But I really would like to compare this transaction, as Greg just said, we're only 7 months into this. I'd like to compare this transaction to any other major transaction that's ever been put together on how quick we're able to integrate and how quick that we're delivering these synergies. And you'll see it now that the markets are turning around, we had a little bit of noise here with some catch-ups on vacation accruals and some things that just happened in the large transaction. But you'll see it really start to accelerate and these synergies will be sticky into the earnings power going forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matthew Blair with Tudor, Pickering, Holt.","Matthew Blair","Maybe turning back to the sum of the parts discussion. Gary, you have a pretty expansive portfolio these days. Are there any opportunities to potentially divest any underperforming businesses or noncore businesses that eventually might help your multiple?","Gary Heminger","Certainly, and we have discussed that in the past. We are looking at -- there are possibly -- and we're high-grading some of the assets and systems right now in the Midstream system. There may be some assets in certain basins that could fit some other players better than they fit us. And the market is valuing some of these assets quite lofty right now. The -- we certainly, on the Retail side, Tony -- Speedway there, they have a number of assets that aren't at the high level of performance that Speedway wants, that we've put together some package between Tony and Brian Partee here to probably divest of some of those assets into our trade eventually. We are quite pleased where we sit right now on the refining side. As we look at the refining systems and how I think we can go in and really make some improvements in the operating expense, we are quite pleased. I don't see that we make any divestitures in refining at this point, but some components within Retail, within Midstream that we are going through that process right now.","Matthew Blair","Great. And then your other operating expenses in refining picked up by about $180 million compared to Q4 levels. I think it's about $0.19 EPS impact. Could you just walk through what drove that increase? And is the $1.268 billion figure from Q1, is that a good run rate going forward?","Timothy Griffith","Yes, Matthew, it's Tim. I mean, remember that, that other category within R&M has got really the sort of cumulative effect of a lot of the drop activity that was done frankly even before the combination. So you had in first quarter an extra month of the drops that were done in February of last year. That's probably the big delta versus where we saw things in fourth quarter. But that level around between sort of $1 billion and $1.3 billion is -- there are no other big factors in there that would [indiscernible] anything unusual that suggested that, that is going to change dramatically on a going-forward basis. Again, we're not going to guide to it specifically, but there were things present in first quarter that we wouldn't expect to be present on a going-forward basis. So you've got the cumulative effect of the drops, an extra month in there from where we were in prior year. And again, I guess, the other big change here is that the -- a lot of the transportation costs within the legacy Andeavor system were captured in refining margin. So we've reclassified and remapped those costs into this category. So there is a relatively big delta on bringing those transportation costs into that category. But again, it's probably going to be around that ZIP Code on a going-forward basis.","Operator","Our next question comes from Justin Jenkins with Raymond James.","Justin Jenkins","I realize we're at the hour mark here, so I'm just going to keep it to one. Gary, you mentioned in your prepared remarks about going towards maximum light sweet on the crude side of things. Just curious how you see it playing out here with a lot more discussions on the quality of the light sweet crude being produced here in the U.S. and increasing amounts of the higher gravity material and how that's impacting operations here.","Gary Heminger","Right. Just let me turn that over to Rick Hessling who runs all of our supply function.","Rick Hessling","Very good question. If you look at a 10,000-foot level, we're running just shy of 60% sweet. And if you do a comparator to 2Q or -- that will be our 2Q number. Now if you go 2Q of '18, we're 12% up from it. So we are maximizing light sweets in and around WTI-Midland as you well can track. Those differentials are very attractive. We're the beneficiary of those differentials at an El Paso, at a Gallop, at Galveston Bay. And then throughout our Midwest system, we've got just shy of 800,000 barrels per day. We are certainly maximizing light sweet there as well as Garyville. And then last, but not least, certainly the West Coast. So we are all out light sweet where we can, where the differentials make sense. And similar to what Ray said earlier, we're running our LP models every day and tweaking them every day based on current length and\/or lack of length in gas and diesel in specific regional markets.","Operator","And that is all the time that we have for questions today.","Kristina Kazarian","Thank you, Operator.

Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Ms. Pam Beall. Ms. Beall, you may begin.","Pamela Beall","Thank you, John. Good morning everybody and welcome to our fourth quarter 2012 earnings webcast and conference call. The synchronized slides that accompany this call can be found on our website. On the call today are Gary Heminger, President and CEO; Garry Peiffer, Executive Vice President of Corporate Planning and Investor & Government Relations; Don Templin, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Mike Palmer, Senior Vice President of Supply, Distribution and Planning.","Now, if you turn to slide two, please read the Safe Harbor statement. It is a reminder that we will be making forward-looking statements during the presentation and during the question-and-answer session today. ","Actual results may differ materially from what we expect today and factors that could cause actual results to differ are included here as well as in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","Now, I will turn the call over to Gary Heminger for some opening remarks.","Gary Heminger","Thanks Pam and good morning. Thank you for joining us. If you please turn to slide three, during our first full calendar year as an independent company, our commitment to safety and operational excellence underpinned our ability to capture value and deliver strong financial results. Our employees and contractors achieved record safety performance across our operations, including the world-class safety record for the DHOUP project.","As a result of MPC\u2019s outstanding operational and financial performance in 2012, our continued strong financial position and positive outlook, we were able to allocate capital to value accretive investments and return significant capital to shareholders.","We returned approximately $1.76 billion to shareholders during the year. This was accomplished through two accelerated share repurchase programs totaling $1.35 billion and a 40% increase in our dividend. Earlier today, we announced the board authorized an additional $2 billion share repurchase, augmenting the $650 million remaining authorization that was announced in the first quarter of 2012. This provides a total outstanding authorization of $2.650 billion through 2014. ","The expansion of our share repurchase authorization reflects our intent to continue balancing our use of capital and our recognition of the trust that our investors have placed in us to be good stewards of their capital. In 2012, the U.S. energy industry continued to adapt the growing North American crude oil and natural gas resources and to transportation bottlenecks for those resources. These forces will continue to influence the domestic energy market for years to come, and MPC will invest to remain strategically positioned to create value from these shifts, as they reshape our energy landscape.","While we returned substantial capital to our shareholders, we balance that commitment with critical investments that will enhance MPC\u2019s ability to benefit from changing market conditions. Most significant among these was the very successful initial public offering of MPLX LP, our new midstream master limited partnership, the completion of the $2.2 billion heavy oil upgrade project at our Detroit refinery and the agreement to acquire a world-class refinery in the Western Gulf Coast of Mexico.","First, I will highlight the strategy for MPLX and how it will add value for MPC shareholders. We believe we have created a premier MLP, one that has some very attractive features. MPLX is a fee-based business with stable cash flows and multiple avenues to grow earnings and distributions over an extended period of time.","With multiple avenues to expand, MPLX will be our primary vehicle to grow our midstream business and to participate in the infrastructure investments needed to meet the changing North American energy landscape. MPLX assets are integral to MPC\u2019s integrated logistics and marketing system, providing MPC's refineries access to foreign, Canadian and domestic crude sources and finished products to its wholesale and retail marketing customers. The growing production of crude oil and natural gas liquids and changing supply patterns create opportunities for MPLX to play a vital role in the fast-changing energy landscape. In addition to organic investments, MPC has a significant and growing portfolio of logistics assets that could be acquired by MPLX in the future. ","MPC's interest in MPLX, including its ownership of the general partner, will allow MPC shareholders to participate in the value created by growing the fee-based stable cash flow business of MPLX. ","Turning to another significant accomplishment for the year, in November, we enhanced our feedstock acquisition economics by completing the Detroit Heavy Oil Upgrade Project known as DHOUP. This project increased our Detroit refinery\u2019s heavy oil processing capacity from 20,000 barrels per calendar day to 100,000 barrels per calendar day, while increasing our total crude oil refining capacity at the facility from 106,000 barrels per day to 120,000 barrels per calendar day.","Our Detroit refinery\u2019s strong financial prospects are validation of the investment decision we made several years ago that now enables MPC to benefit from discounted Canadian heavy crudes. DHOUP also set a new standard for megaproject execution. The $2.2 billion project was completed on schedule and on budget. And just as importantly, it also achieved extraordinary safety records since we started construction of this project in the mid-2008. Early indication of Detroit's operations and financial performance are promising.","The third accomplishment I wanted to highlight is the agreement we reached last year to purchase BP\u2019s Texas City refinery near Galveston Bay. As the North American energy industry continues to adapt to a significant crude supply shifts, we see the Western Gulf Coast as a primary destination for the surge in crude supply. This transaction will expand our presence in this increasingly important region. The agreement includes a world scale refinery, along with related midstream assets and branded job or contract assignments. We plan to complete the transaction on February 1st, 2013. The transaction is expected to be funded with cash on hand and be accretive to earnings in the first year of operation. This acquisition will enhance our ability to refine price advantage crude oil and it expands our distribution options for refined products, including greater export opportunities. They will provide immediate scale to enable further expansion of our Marathon brand presence in the southeast. This refinery is one of the largest and most complex in the U.S., and is considered to be one of the most technologically advanced and flexible refineries in the world. ","It will be the most complex refinery in our portfolio and it will increase our overall refinery complexity index and significantly increase our participation in the chemicals value chain. In addition to major accomplishments such as DHOUP, the creation of MPLX, initiation, other refinery acquisition, 2012 was a busy year for other improvements for MPC\u2019s operational capabilities.","Our Speedway retail segment increased its store count by about 7% last year, after acquiring 97 convenient stores in Indiana, Ohio and Kentucky. The acquisitions included 87 GasAmerica stores and 10 Road Ranger stores, bringing its total count to now around 1,460 stores. In addition to strengthening its presence in key marketing areas, Speedway also achieved record segment income and EBITDA per store.","At the same time, Speedway grew its merchandise same-store sales for the 15th consecutive quarter and achieved its best ever safety record. Speedway same-store merchandise sales, excluding cigarettes increased 4% compared to the same quarter last year, which achieved a 7.2% same-store increase over the prior year.","And moving on, we strengthened our position as a customer of choice for hydrocarbon liquids productions from the Utica shale by building additional infrastructure at our refinery in Canton, Ohio to received crude oil and condensate deliveries by transports from nearby wells. We entered into a letter of intent to jointly develop infrastructure intended to facilitate transportation of hydrocarbon liquids production from the Utica shale. The project will result and up to 24,000 barrels per day of truck unloading capacity and a terminal capable of loading up to 50,000 barrels per day onto barges on the Ohio River at MPC's current Wellsville, Ohio asphalt terminal. ","To increase access to Bakken and Canadian crude, MPC agree to be the anchor shipper on Enbridge's proposed southern access extension with an option to acquire a 25% equity interest in the pipeline.","This line will originate in finding in Illinois, near Chicago and terminate in Patoka, Illinois, a critical crude storage and blending hub and the origination point for crude supply for our four Midwest refineries.","Recently, Marathon pipeline and the owners of Capline have agreed to terms for formalizing a new operating agreement for Marathon pipeline to become the operator of the Capline system effective in September of this year. Capline is a 633-mile 40-inch crude oil pipeline, running from St. James, Louisiana to Patoka, Illinois. It was constructed in the 1967-68 period and has been operated by Shell since that time. Marathon was one of the original owners and today, MPC retains a 32.6% interest.","I have spoken about balance often, and the balance between investing in the business and returning capital to shareholders has been and we expect will continue to be a powerful driver of value. Our share price rose 89% from year-end 2011 to year-end 2012. Combined with dividends, total 2012 shareholder return was approximately 93%. ","The value we have provided for our shareholders as a result of our continuous efforts to meet the needs of our customers in the most efficient way as possible, whether it\u2019s sourcing the most price advantage crude slate, identifying the most cost-effective transportation for crude oil and finished products, or determining where our products will be needed most at any given time.","We believe our focus on safe and efficient operations strategically located, refining access to virtually just take some multiple marketing options positions us to make the most of opportunities wherever and whenever they may occur.","If you please turn to slide four, and looking ahead to 2013, we remain committed to operating our assets in a safe and reliable manner, with a continuous improvement in our safety record across all of our operations. Our outlook for U.S. gasoline demand for 2013 is flat and U.S. distillate demand to be up about 3.5%. In addition, we expect export opportunities to remain attractive in 2013. Our distillate exports rose to 151,000 barrels per day during the fourth quarter, compared to 94,000 barrels per day in the same quarter last year.","We remain optimistic about the global competitive position of our U.S. Gulf Coast refineries and the prospects for future exports of gasoline and distillate. Our 2013 capital investment plan totals $1.5 billion, excluding the Galveston Bay refinery purchase price. It allocates capital across all our operating segments to capture value from ships in the energy landscape in North America and to increase our exposure to stable cash flow businesses. Don will go into more detail on specific projects, but I want to highlight a few key points. ","We will continue our expansion projects in the pipeline transportation segment, including investments in MPLX operations, and we will pursue additional growth opportunities for this critical logistics operation to support both MPC and third-party business. We will continue to invest in our Speedway segment through a combination of selective acquisitions and organic projects for new stores, rebuilds, remodels and site acquisitions.","This channel of distribution generates stable cash flow from crude and merchandise sales inside the store. Our 2013 plan includes high return projects in our refining and marketing segment that will increase higher value distillate yields, expand our export capacity, allow us to process higher volumes of light hydrocarbons expected to be produced in greater volumes from the Utica Shale, and to continue upgrades at the new Galveston Bay refinery.","And all above, we just completed our first year as an independent company in 2012. We celebrated our 125th anniversary, having been founded in this part of Ohio in 1887. Our long-term success will continue to be built on our ability to adapt the changing marketing conditions and a commitment to value us of health and safety, environmental stewardship and integrity. ","We look forward to new opportunities in 2013. As we do, we have recognized the trust our shareholders have placed on us. Our mission continues to be value-creation for our investors, incorporating a balance between internal and external investment and return of capital to shareholders through a strong and growing base dividend over the long term and share repurchases. ","In all, we were pleased with what we were able to accomplish in 2012 and we remain very enthusiastic about our prospects into 2013. Now, I will turn the call over to Don Templin to review the financial results for the fourth quarter and the full year of 2012. Don?","Donald Templin","Thanks, Gary. Slide five provides earnings both on an absolute and per share basis. Our fourth quarter and full-year 2012 financial performance was very strong. MPC had adjusted earnings of nearly $760 million or $2.26 per share during the fourth quarter of 2012. This was compared to a loss of $75 million in the fourth quarter of 2011.","For the full-year of 2012, our adjusted earnings were $3.3 billion, almost $1 billion over the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share was $9.79 for the full year of 2012, compared to $6.72 for 2011. The waterfall chart on slide six shows by segment the change in adjusted earnings from the fourth quarter of 2011 to the fourth quarter of 2012. The primary driver for the change in our adjusted earnings was the increase in refining and marketing segment income, partially offset by additional income tax expense.","The significant improvement in refining the market segment income was primarily the result of higher crack spreads and wider solid crude differentials in the quarter. The increase in income tax expense is a function of higher 2012 earnings. As shown on slide seven, refining and marketing segment income from operations was almost $1.14 billion in the fourth quarter of 2012. This was compared with a loss of $182 million in the fourth quarter of 2011. In explaining the key components of the refining and marketing gross margin, I will refer to the changes in market indicators applied to MPC actual volumes to arrive at the quarter-over-quarter variances. First, the blended LLS 6321 crack spread. It was $2.73 per barrel higher in the fourth quarter of 2012 than the fourth quarter of 2011, resulting in an estimated favorable variable of $371 million.","Both Chicago and Gulf Coast crack spreads were higher in the fourth quarter of this year compared to the fourth quarter of last year. The most significant variance quarter-over-quarter relates to the sweet-sour differential. The sweet-sour differential for the 2012 fourth quarter was $13.41 per barrel, which was $12.44 per barrel higher than the comparable quarter last year and represents an estimated $809 million favorable variance.","The LLS WTI differential was $21.29 for the fourth quarter of 2012, compared with $16.77 for the fourth quarter of 2011. This increase in our differential resulted in an estimated $81 million favorable gross margin variance between the two quarters.","The first three market indicators are calculated by reference to a LLS Prompt price. Rapid changes in crude prices can cause significant differences between the LLS Prompt prices embedded in the market indicators and the actual amount we pay. On average, the delivered LLS crude cost was $1.36 per barrel less than the prompt LLS price during the fourth quarter of 2012, while the average delivered crude cost for the same quarter last year was $6.52 per barrel higher than the prompt price. This $7.88 difference resulted in an estimated $182 million favorable variance.","You may recall there was a dramatic narrowing of the WTI to LLS crude differential at the end of last year, which had a significant impact on our crude oil acquisition costs in the fourth quarter of 2011. Direct operating costs had an unfavorable quarter-over-quarter effect of $90 million. This was primarily due to higher depreciation expense associated with the completion of DHOUP and higher planned turnaround cost in the fourth quarter of 2012, compared with the fourth quarter of 2011. As you know, we completed the turnaround at our Detroit refinery in the 2012 fourth quarter. ","The gross margin column captures a number of other factors that need to be considered when reconciling the market-based metrics to the change in our gross margin. They include items such as actual realized prices, refinery yields, other feedstock costs and crude slate variances compared to the values assumed when we calculate the market indicators.","It also includes refinery volumetric gains and purchase for resale activity. As you can see from the waterfall chart, this combination of factors led to an estimated $24 million unfavorable impact in the fourth quarter of 2012 compared to the fourth quarter of 2011.","Slide eight provides a similar earnings walk for the refining and marketing segment on a year-over-year basis. The blended LLS 6321 crack spread in 2012 was double to $3.35 per barrel of crack spread of 2011, resulting in an estimated favorable variance of almost 1.7 billion. The sweet-sour differential accounted for an estimated favorable variance of $870 million, as the differential was $3.36 per barrel higher than the average for 2011.","The WTI to LLS differential was $0.26 per barrel higher in 2012 compared to 2011, which resulted in estimated of $119 million of favorable gross margin variance between the two years. The LLS Prompt versus Delivered price variance was not significant when comparing the annual results. The total prompt versus delivered LLS crude variance accounted for an approximately $49 million positive impact in the full-year comparison.","Market structure had an estimated unfavorable variance of $126 million, that was $0.39 per barrel less of contango in the NYMEX WTI market structure in 2012 compared to 2011. Our direct-to-operating costs were $197 million higher in 2012 compared to 2011, primarily due to higher planned turnaround expenses and higher depreciation expense in 2012.","With respect to other gross margin, a number of factors impacted the change year-over-year. The mix of crudes we actually processed versus the market indicators was the primary contributor of this difference.","On the next few slides, we include earnings walks for each of our other operating segments. Turning to slide nine, Speedway\u2019s income from operations was $77 million in the fourth quarter of 2012 compared to $73 million in the fourth quarter of 2011. Light Product and Merchandise gross margin combined were about $21 million higher in the fourth quarter of 2012, compared with the fourth quarter of 2011.","Life Product margins increased by $8 million as margins averaged $0.1424 per gallon compared to $0.14 in the fourth quarter of 2011. Merchandise margin was $196 million in the fourth quarter of 2012 compared with $183 million in the same period last year. This $13 million increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of stores compared with the same period last year.","On a same-store basis, gasoline sales volumes decreased 0.2% and merchandise sales increased 0.2% in the fourth quarter of 2012 compared with the 2011 fourth quarter. The lower same-store gasoline sales volumes primarily reflect the impact of the higher absolute price of gasoline. Speedway's average retail gasoline price was $3.32 per gallon during the fourth quarter of '12 compared with $3.20 per gallon for the comparable quarter last year. In January 2013 we've seen an increase in demand with an approximately 2% increase in same-store gasoline sales volumes at Speedway.","Speedway's income from operations for all of 2012 was $310 million compared with $271 million for 2011. Light product margins increased by $15 million as margins averaged $13.18 per gallon in 2012 slightly higher than the 2011 average. On a same-store basis, gasoline sales volumes decreased 0.8% in 2012 compared to 2011. The decrease in same-store gasoline sales reflects lower gasoline demand in our market area. Merchandise margins were $795 million in 2012 compared to $719 million in 2011 or an increase of $76 million. The increase in light product and merchandise margins were partially offset by increased expenses of $52 million primarily due to an increase in the number of stores operated in 2012 as compared to 2011.","Slide 10 shows fourth quarter and full year changes in our Pipeline Transportation segment income from operations was $72 million in the fourth quarter of 2012 compared with $38 million in the fourth quarter of 2011. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in transportation tariffs and earnings from pipeline affiliates offset by slightly higher mechanical integrity costs. Some of the increase in the transportation tariffs were related to the formation of the MPLX, 2012 income from operations was $216 million compared with $199 million in 2011. This improvement is primarily attributable to an increase in transportation tariffs partially offset by higher mechanical integrity costs and a reduction in pipeline affiliate income in 2012.","The chart on Slide 11 provides an analysis of cash flows for the fourth quarter of 2012. At December 31, 2012 our cash balance was nearly $4.9 billion. Operating cash flow before changes in working capital was just over $1.1 billion. The working capital benefit of $919 million noted on the slide primarily relates to the impact of lower refined product prices on our ending receivables and a reduction in our inventory levels at year-end. Capital expenditures and investments during the quarter were $403 million including amounts related to the completion of our Detroit heavy oil upgrade project also shown on this slide is the $500 million of cash used in connection with our second accelerated share repurchase program and the cash we received related to the initial public offering of MPLX.","Slide 12, shows that at the end of the fourth quarter, we had nearly $4.9 billion of cash and approximately $3.4 billion of debt. With EBITDA of over $6.3 billion during the last 12 months. We continue to be in a very manageable debt position with leverage of 0.5 times EBITDA and a debt to total capital ratio of 22%. This strong liquidity position will enable us to fund the Galveston Bay refinery in cash with sufficient remaining balances to support our core liquidity position and continue to focus on capital return.","Turning to Slide 13, during the last 12 months we generated almost $4.5 billion in cash from operations and nearly $3 billion of free cash flow. Consistent with our commitment to return capital to shareholders we distributed 60% of our free cash flow in the form of dividends and share repurchases during this past year. We are committed to being a leader in our peer group in terms of total shareholder return going forward. As Gary mentioned earlier, our strong liquidity position has supported the board\u2019s authorization of the repurchase of an additional $2 billion of common stock for a total outstanding authorization of $2.65 billion through 2014. We will periodically update you on the progress of the share repurchase program. Regarding the $500 million accelerated share repurchase program we initiated in November. We expect the program to complete tomorrow. The total shares to be received will be based on the average share price over the three-month period of the program based on share prices to date we expect to receive approximately 930,000 shares in addition to the 7.4 million shares received at the inception of the program. This will bring the total shares acquired under the program to approximately 8.3 million shares or about 2.4% of the shares outstanding when the program began.","Slide 14 provides outlook information on key operating metrics for MPC for the first quarter of 2013. This information assumes the February 1 closing date for the Galveston Bay acquisition. For comparative purposes those same metrics for the first quarter 2012 are also shown.","Slide 15 provides a breakdown by segment of our actual 2012 capital expenditures and investments along with our approved capital budget for 2013.","Slide 16 indicates the significant capital projects that we\u2019ll be working on in 2013 and beyond. Total capital spending in 2013 associated with planned upgrading of the Galveston Bay refinery and related assets is expected to be approximately $400 million. We will continue infrastructure investments and complete several programs that are underway at this time. In addition, we've identified synergies that we should begin to capture during our first year of operation. Executing on our commitment to expand our assured sales, we have allocated $255 million for organic and acquisition opportunities within our Speedway segment in 2013. At our Garyville refinery, we are continuing our projects to optimize diesel and gasoline yield through modifications to the older crude unit, hydrocracker and the distillate hydro-treaters. Total capital spending is estimated at $225 million with the hydrocracker revamp to be completed in 2014 and completion of the final phase of the program in 2015. We intend to be a first mover in the Utica Shale play and will position MPC to be the customer of choice for the crude oil and condensate. Total spending is estimated at approximately $300 million through 2014 to accomplish to these objectives. New barges will be purchased to allow Utica production to be transported to Catlettsburg from the Wellsville facility. We plan to invest in condensate splitters at Canton and Catlettsburg to allow the refineries to process up to 60,000 barrels per day of condensate from the Utica field.","In 2013 we should complete our Wellsville truck-to-barge crude system project and begin a condensate gathering line project that will connect production via pipeline to both our Wellsville terminal and the Canton refinery. The Patoka to Catlettsburg crude oil pipeline upgrade project is within MPLX and has been prefunded with a $160 million of proceeds received from the initial public offering. This major upgrade project is expected to increase capacity and reliability and will be completed in September of 2014. The Robinson uni-cracker project is a planned revamp of our distiller hydrocracker to improve margins by processing more feedstock at a lower conversion and shifting approximately 10,000 barrels per day of other products to diesel production.","Estimated total capital spending for the project is $75 million and it should be complete in 2015. With respect to our gasoline and distill export project to Garyville we are progressing well and plan to have the final phase of the project complete ahead of schedule in late 2013. This $40 million capital project along with some minor optimization work has already allowed us to increase our diesel export capacity by 50,000 barrels per day while the addition of a tank will expand our ability to export gasoline as well. The Catlettsburg vacuum cut-point project is a revamp that will recover additional volumes of gas oil from the refinery's residual oil production to be processed in the Cat cracker, thus increasing the production of higher valued gasoline and diesel. This project is expected to be completed in 2014.","Now I\u2019ll turn the call back to Pam Beall.","Pamela Beall","Thanks Don. Many of you have asked about the assets in MPC's refining and marketing segment that could potentially be acquired by MPLX in the future. You will find in our 10-K which will be filed next month additional disclosure about those assets that we believe will be useful to investors. Now, as we open up the call for questions we ask that you limit yourself to one question plus a follow-up and then of course you may re-prompt for additional questions as time permits. So, John with that we would like to open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, we will now begin the question and answer session. (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from Chi Chow from Macquarie Capital, please go ahead.","Chi Chow - Macquarie Capital","Alright. Thanks and good morning. Gary, you mentioned in your remarks the news on Capline and I am wondering with Marathon becoming operator does that change your thoughts at all on a possible reversal of line or are you still happy with the crude supply optionality from the Gulf Coast longer term?","Gary Heminger","Thanks Chi and good morning to you. The operatorship -- this has been under discussion for some time and so I would find that separate from whether or not there is an opportunity to reverse the line. We continue to study those opportunities. As we\u2019ve said before there were three owners and it takes all of us to agree on which direction that pipeline might flow. So, we will continue to analyze this going forward and determine if there's any change in that direction.","Chi Chow - Macquarie Capital","So, the ownership structure doesn\u2019t change at all?","Gary Heminger","No, it does not.","Chi Chow - Macquarie Capital","Okay, and does the upcoming decision on the Keystone XL line influence your thoughts or I guess, all three owners thoughts?","Gary Heminger","","Well it\u2019s going to be very interesting if Keystone XL gets approved or if its delayed, that is, I think it\u2019s going to take longer to get that decision made than we had initially thought. But certainly if something would to happen in that pipeline doesn\u2019t get built to the Western Gulf, then that would put I think a different view maybe for some of the owners on Capline, but all remains to be seen.","Chi Chow - Macquarie Capital","","Okay, Thanks Gary. And then a second question on DHOUP. Can you talk about how the unit is operating so far? You\u2019re in January and I think you have put out a $350 million EBITDA accretion number out there on 2011 pricing. What are your thoughts on handicapping upside or downside on that increase at this point?","Gary Heminger","Right, the numbers that you have quoted are correct that we put out numbers to both the 2006 to 2010 timeframe and 2011. The number you have quoted is correct and Chi we are very pleased, I really congratulate and complement our refining team that built this project and had it up and running. It\u2019s running very well. It's been able to meet its stated capacity very early on and so we are in the process now of testing to see, it\u2019s too early yet Chi. If I take you back to how we brought Garyville up, we are in some very early stages, so I don\u2019t have any of the test data yet on if it can outrun its design capacity, so it\u2019s too early. But its running very well, and it came up relatively seamless.","Chi Chow - Macquarie Capital","Great, what type of barrels are you displacing with the increased runs of the heavy Canadian?","Gary Heminger","","Let me ask Mike Palmer to answer that.","Michael Palmer","","Oh yes Chi, obviously, we talked before about the ability of bringing in an incremental 80,000 barrels a day of heavy Canadian and we've been ramping that up. But basically we've been bringing in the heavy Canadian, which we've been very successful at acquiring and moving, and just backing out a really what is a variety of other lighter in some sweet crudes.","Chi Chow - Macquarie Capital","Okay, great, thanks Mike, appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Doug Leggate from Bank of America, please go ahead.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America","","Well, thanks, good morning everybody. I've got a couple as well, hopefully I won't take too long. You guys mentioned that you're getting ready to basically or you'd be able to process increasing amounts of condensate opened from the Utica, have you already got line up sight as to where the supplies are coming from and have you been in negotiations with suppliers already, because obviously volumes are still somewhat fairly sparse, as we understand it?","Michael Palmer","","Yes Doug, this is Mike Palmer. You know, you\u2019re right. Certainly, the Utica production both the crude oil and condensate has come on more slowly than what the producers originally estimated, but it's very interesting. Just to give you some rough numbers. There have been something on the order of 500 drilling permits that have been issued. There have been about 200 wells that have been drilled and only about 50 wells were actually producing. So, there is lot of wells that have been already drilled that are just waiting to be hooked up to gas processing and takeaway capacity. And we\u2019d certainly expect that that's going to begin to happen around mid-year this year and continue through 2013, \u201814, and beyond. So we remain very optimistic about the volumes of condensate and some crew that we'll have coming out of the Utica for our operation.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America","Great, thanks. Two quick follow-ups if I may. Gary, the accelerated or rather the step-up in the buyback program, could you give us some idea as to how you're thinking about prioritizing that between competitive dividend growth and buybacks. And perhaps what the likely pace you would anticipate given the cash in your balance sheet of executing that buyback program, and have got one final input?","Gary Heminger","","Sure Doug. Let me ask Don to take that one.","Donald Templin","","Yes Doug, this Don. With respect to returning capital to shareholders, we've indicated to you on a number of occasions, our bias is to having a strong base dividend, and then to the extent that we have incremental cash like we have currently to use other mechanisms to return the capital to shareholders. So, we've favored share repurchases historically, and we will continue I believe to favor share repurchases going forward. With respect to our base dividend, we view that as a long-term commitment to our shareholders, and we believe that successful companies grow their share, their dividend overtime on a sustained basis and we'd be committed to doing that. But to the extent that we have excess cash and we would look to use tools like a share repurchase program. I think we've historically used accelerated share repurchases, at least for last two times that doesn't necessarily mean that that's how we would plan to do it going forward.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America","Great, thank you. I apologize to squeezing the third one in, but just very quickly on the micro Gary. If I could just ask for your perspective on the outlook for Canadian heavy differentials, I know that you guys are essentially a fairly significant buyer of that, and I'll leave it there, thank you.","Gary Heminger","","Yes Doug, there are going to be many changes in the Canadian heavy market this year. Now, of course it depends on what happens with the Excel pipeline, but that won't be completed even if they were approved first half of this year, probably won't be completed into the 15th timeframe or so, somewhere in that arena. But we just brought Detroit up, DHOUP in November, and there is another very large project up in Whiting that will come up, we understand later this year. So we really would expect to have strong differentials through the front half of this year, and then we'll see what happens when those other project comes up. But at the same time you're going to see one or two more fields come on stream. And I still think it's going to come down to the pipelines and the pipeline capacity, and where and what regions that heavy crude can move. And then of course that will be tempered by any turnarounds and not any downtime in any of the Canadian upgraders or Canadian production operations.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America","Got it, thanks for the answers Gary, I appreciate that.","Gary Heminger","Thanks Doug.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse, please go ahead.","Edward Westlake - Credit Suisse","Hey, good morning Gary and everyone and congrats on the results. Just trying to focus in on Texas City, obviously we'll actually see the EBITDA soon enough. But, could you give us any updates on say OpEx per barrel, or the logistics EBITDA within Texas City, or the potential capture rate that you think relative to Gulf Coast margins given that you've got lot of aromatics and propylene production in Texas City?","Gary Heminger","Right, let me ask. Thanks for the comments there Ed, and let me ask Don to cover this.","Donald Templin","Yes. Ed, with respect to I would say the operating expenses or manufacturing costs, we have embedded those manufacturing costs in the outlook information that we have included in our slides. So that includes two months\u2019 worth of Galveston Bay or the Texas City refinery in those amounts. So, you can see kind of those numbers as reflected or compared to 2012. With respect to the EBITDA, we don\u2019t give specific EBITDA per plant or by refinery, but at the time that we did announce the acquisition last year we used two different price decks and the incremental EBITDA associated with the refinery using those two price decks was between $700 million and $1.2 billion.","Ed Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities","Great.","Donald Templin","Ed, the other thing with your question on aromatics, we are just going to take over on Friday. We just received the LP, late in the process here and because the former owner that was their property and we need to make sure the same got to the finish line, as I said, it will on this Friday. So, we just got that LP. We will be refining that and really get into the details of that starting next week. So, we really can\u2019t breakout the aromatics yet. But all of that value is embedded in the numbers, the 700 or 1.2, that John just gave you. Those numbers were based on a 12-month and of course, this is going to be an 11-month period.","Ed Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities","Yes. The other question is around gasoline versus diesel. Oversea gasoline prices have been depressed partly because of American demand and partly because refineries in the US are running as hard as they can whereas diesel obviously has been a little bit more profitable. When you think about uses of the free cash flow that you have. What sort of thoughts do you have around making some larger investments to improve the diesel yield at the refinery system?","Donald Templin","Well, Ed, we have made and I think we were a little bit ahead of the curve going back to when built Garyville. We built Garyville to be a balanced refinery about 50% gasoline and 50% diesel. Then when we did DHOUP the same thing to get more diesel output and to be able to lessen the amount of reset in the marketplace and then further investments we made at Garyville to even expand the hydrocracker to make more diesel and with the help of other process units and then lastly to be able to export that diesel out of the marketplace in an efficient manner. So we have made a lot of investments in what I call low hanging fruit early on and probably ahead of some.","Ed Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities","But no plans to do a major sort of hydrocracker build?","Donald Templin","Not at this time, Ed.","Ed Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities","Okay, thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley, please go ahead.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. Inc.","Hi, good morning, guys. ","Gary Heminger ","Good morning, Evan.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. Inc.","","Question on your 2013 CapEx. I guess first can you quantify how much of the $1.6 billion is midstream including dock capacity, I am trying to understand the better the organic growth or kind of more of the conventional growth in MLP assets within the portfolio? I have a second question.","Donald Templin","Evan, this is Don. We have not typically broken that out. I mean, you can see what we have included for pipeline transportation but a big piece of that number relates to the Patoka, the Catlettsburg upgrade expansion project. We have not separately detailed the other projects.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. Inc.","Right. But the fact is listed number two would mean it\u2019s a pretty big priority item you are spending here? I guess my second question is -- I mean maybe you are just saying you want to answer that but in terms of the Galveston Bay or the Texas City CapEx, I mean, can you mention how much is regulatory maintenance versus growth, just trying to understand how much invested capital could drive incremental returns on a flat crack basis rather than aggregate amount of what\u2019s being invested?","Gary Heminger","I think $400 million is our expectation of the spend that we would have related to Galveston Bay this year, Evan. I would say substantially of all that relates to either regulatory or projects that were ongoing. Our view around expansion opportunities actually occurs in subsequent years.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. Inc.","Okay. Maybe finally a question is, obviously, it\u2019s very topical around midstream and downstream this quarter but do you see any role for rail in your system or do you really think you are kind of best served by pipe given your location? I would leave with that. Thanks.","Michael Palmer","Evan, this is Mike Palmer. We have looked at rail over and over again. If you look at our system, again, with our plants in the Midwest and the plants in the Gulf Coast, we just don\u2019t think that our investing in rail makes a lot of sense. We think that we can accomplish much lower transportation costs through pipeline. We understand why others do it, but what we have looked at it and just can\u2019t make sense of it.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. Inc.","","Okay. It makes sense. Appreciate you guys. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Doug Terreson from ISI, please go ahead.","Doug Terreson - ISI Group","Good morning, everybody and congratulations on your great results. ","Gary Heminger","Thanks, Doug.","Doug Terreson - ISI Group","Gary, industry exports or net exports seem to have slowed during the past year although I think you pointed out that you didn\u2019t have any problems because yours was -- increased further with the expansion in Garyville. My question involves any insights that you may have into the slowdown in the industry exports, meaning, are there supply or demand side features that are present here and what you consider your major advantage is in this area? Also how the new refinery will affect your export capabilities in coming years? Meaning, will you have to make investments or is it readymade for exports. So if you could just comment on couple of those items I would appreciate it?","Gary Heminger ","Sure, Doug. Our numbers on exports appear to be about flat for distillate and I can talk about distillate because that\u2019s the commodity that we export the most. So about flat to last year. One of the things that I think give us a good position in the market is the quality of the distillate that we are making out of Garyville as a high cetane rate which is sought after in the marketplace. So I think that is, say, it gives us a strong position. You will notice that we substantially increased quarter-over-quarter last year, the numbers were 151 this year to 94 last year. So we substantially increased that and continue to have a strong demand for our distillate. ","As we take on Galveston Bay and the way -- part of the synergies and the way that we are going to operate there, the day we move some of our products, I would say we kind of crisscrossed with Galveston Bay because Galveston Bay is a very large supplier into the Florida market as same as Garyville is and then we also both plants were exporters into the Latin America, South America market and some to Europe. So, we will be able to pick up some synergy and be able to optimize how we move those products to marketplace and I think take advantage of some good transportation savings both in distance and in the volume or the metric tons that you are going to ship in one batch. So, that\u2019s what we are looking at upfront, Doug.","Doug Terreson - ISI Group ","Okay. I had a couple of other questions about inventory. I think you guys mentioned that there was an inventory gain in the quarter, so I want to find out the magnitude? And then Gary, you are (inaudible) for the industry in Washington, so I wanted to see if we could get some updated insights from you on, potential changes in industry tax policy and specifically, while it doesn\u2019t sound like there is going to be some type of mandate whereby the refiners migrate from LIFO to FIFO, just want to see what your views might be in that area and also the level of your current LIFO reserves, so there is three question there.","Gary Heminger","Right. Donald, go over the inventory first.","Donald Templin","Yes. So, with respect to inventory I think the comment I made was in the fourth quarter as part of our cash flow or working capital items our inventories at year-end were slightly below or were lower than our inventories at the end of the third quarter. On a year-on-year basis our inventories are just slightly up, maybe $200 million I want to say roughly. So, that\u2019s the inventory.","Doug Terreson - ISI Group ","","And industry tax policy Gary, your view?","Gary Heminger","Right. A couple of things, industry tax policy of course the industry would certainly embrace staying with LIFO and that\u2019s the direction that we are working hard and trying to explain in Washington. I would say the biggest item in Washington that we are dealing with short-term will be the renewable fuel standard. It\u2019s unworkable in its current approach. You see that there was a decision that came out this week that said that a decision was made that EPA oversteps some boundaries within the biodiesel side of the business. I would say Renewable Fuel Standard because as we come to hit the blend wall and the requirements that are there for blending and the lack of cellulosic and the lack of some other advanced cellulosic type of materials it really puts us in an unworkable solution, or unworkable position, I should say. The next discussion point is going to be around E15 and we don\u2019t think that works either and it\u2019s going to be something that we continue to work very hard inside the beltway. From a tax position, we certainly embrace staying with LIFO. I will let Don discuss.","Donald Templin","Yes. I think you had asked about LIFO but I don\u2019t have the reserve number with me right now. If you are asking about the replacement cost, I mean, fair value exceeds our carrying cost by somewhere around $5.4 billion at the end of the year.","Doug Terreson - ISI Group ","Okay, great guys. Thanks a lot.","Gary Heminger","See you, Doug.","Operator","Our next question comes from Blake Hernandez from Howard Weil, please go ahead.","Blake Hernandez - Howard Weil","","Hi, guys, good morning. I had a question for you on Texas City, understanding you are about to close but just kind of the history of the facility, it\u2019s obviously been run somewhat inefficiently I am just curious if you have had a chance to get in there and assess some cost cutting and efficiency opportunities yet?","Gary Heminger","Yes, Blake. First and most important to us is to bring this on a very safe manner, safety to the employees, safety to the community and the environment and that\u2019s really where we are focused. We have set up a complete separate team to be able to bring this on and turn this over so that they are not distracted with their job back at one of their other refineries they are there to look after this plant. We have named the new management team and we have confidence in their abilities. We are not going to focus on cost cutting early on. We really need to, as Don outlined a little bit ago, that the capital that is on our plate this year is mainly to this and the next couple of years is to complete the regulatory or consent decree capital if you want to call it then that is required in this plant. Then we will focus on what is the best way in our opinion to operate. Mike Palmer\u2019s group is going to focus on the best way to optimize the feedstocks and then how we sell it into the marketplace. I want to be very clear, we are not going to step out and try to reduce operating cost immediately until we totally get this under control and a safe turnover the operation.","Blake Hernandez - Howard Weil","Understood. Thanks, Gary. And then the second question was -- one of your peers yesterday talked about I guess the opportunity to where they have pushed out all the foreign barrels that we are using along the Gulf Coast and replaced it with domestic barrels. I am just curious, do you have a similar opportunity with Garyville and of course Texas City coming online. I don\u2019t know if you have a mix offhand of what foreign crude you run, is there a chance to replace those?","Michael Palmer","Yes, Blake. This is Mike Palmer. We certainly believe that here in 2013 that there really won\u2019t be any material volume of foreign cargo sweet crude left in the Gulf. We always look to optimize our crude slates and where we can bring in a domestic barrel that\u2019s priced better and provides higher profitability than a foreign barrel, we do that. So, there is not a lot of foreign sweet crude that we bring into the Gulf anymore. There may be some at Galveston Bay and once we get the LP and we are looking at that refinery closely will determine what the best crude slate is there. The other thing I would say is, while they won\u2019t be any real material light sweet cargo crude coming into the Gulf, there will always be opportunities that various refiners will look at to bring special crudes in that provide value to that refinery. So, it\u2019s not as if this crude is going to go completely away.","Blake Hernandez - Howard Weil","Got it. Perfect, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Dietert from Simmons, please go ahead.","Jeff Dietert - Simmons & Company International","Good morning. I know we are late in the hour. My question is regarding barging activity on the Mississippi River. I think historically you have moved something like 50,000 barrels a day and by barged down to Garyville. Are you being impacted by the low water levels and what are the constraints to moving more (inaudible) crude down to Garyville?","Garry Peiffer","Yes, this is Garry Peiffer. Regarding the Mississippi River, at moment it\u2019s pretty much operating as normal. We are operating at Wood River dock with 9 foot drafts, so that\u2019s pretty much what we normally operate at. So the good news is we had some pretty good precipitation here lately. So from a operation standpoint, other than the incident that occurred down in the southern part of the river here over the weekend that they expect to have up and running in the next couple of days, the river levels are not impeding our flow on the or activity on the Mississippi.","Jeff Dietert - Simmons & Company International","Is the 50,000 barrel a day movement the right ballpark and what\u2019s the constraining factor to keep these from moving more?","Michael Palmer","Yes, this is Mike Palmer. Let me answer that. As you well know, the reason for these very wide differentials that we are seeing on the heavy Canadian now is due to pipeline constraints and that\u2019s for everybody. What we will do as we go forward is we will have to look at the logistics space, the pipeline space that we have and how we best utilize that space within the system. So, whether or not the heavy barrels that we can get into say the Patoka area, whether those move on to Garyville by barge or whether we move those by pipe down to Galveston Bay or whether we move those to the Midwest system will be part of the optimization process that we will do each and every month. But there are pipeline constraints.","Jeff Dietert - Simmons & Company International","Thanks, Mike. Thanks, Garry.","Pamela Beall","John, we will take one last question and then we will call it a wrap.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) We have a question from Thomas Stinball from Brokerage [ph], please go ahead.","Thomas Stinball - Brokerage [ph]","Hi, good morning guys and congratulations on a great year. My question to you is on how you are acting as a blender and producer of gasoline in response to the moves higher and RINs over the last few weeks. You alluded to sort of the structural question on the blend wall, but we have incurred RIN economics and shortage of ethanol after last year\u2019s crop year, how are you planning to comply with the renewable mandates for \u201812 and \u201913?","Gary Heminger","We don\u2019t see that we will have any problem meeting the renewable mandate. Please understand the way that RINs work is you can carry some RINs forward and then we buy RINs on the third party market as well and of course there was a bit of issue a couple of years ago with the validity of some RINs but that has pretty much been all straightened out and we feel confident that it is not going to give us any problem in meeting that window.","Thomas Stinball - Brokerage [ph]","Would you prefer if you could get term ethanol supply agreement or buying RINS from the third party market as a means to fulfill that obligation?","Gary Heminger","We don\u2019t have any problem, we have term ethanol agreements already. So that\u2019s not a problem to us. ","Thomas Stinball - Brokerage [ph]","","Alright, thank you.","Gary Heminger","","Alright. Pam let me state that, I mentioned something in my speech that I thought afterward, for the folks at Speedway I said 15 straight quarters, it\u2019s really 15 straight years that they have increased their merchandise sales and my compliments to them.","Pamela Beall","Okay. Well thank you Gary. Thanks everyone for joining us today. If you have any follow-up questions I will be in the office this afternoon if you want to give us a call. Thank you. Bye, bye.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen this concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for participating.

My name is Jeanette and I'll be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Tim Griffith. Mr. Griffith, you may begin.","Timothy T. Griffith","Okay. Thank you, Jeanette, and good morning. Welcome to Marathon Petroleum Corporation's second quarter 2014 earnings webcast and conference call. The synchronized slides that accompany this call can be found on our website at marathonpetroleum.com under the Investor Center tab.","On the call today are Gary Heminger, President and CEO; Don Templin, Senior Vice President and CFO; Mike Palmer, Senior Vice President of Supply, Distribution and Planning; Pam Beall, Senior Vice President of Corporate Planning and Government and Public Affairs; and Rich Bedell, Senior Vice President of Refining.","We invite you to read the Safe Harbor statement on Slide #2 and to remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements during the presentation and during the question-and-answer session. Actual results may differ materially from what we expect today. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included here, as well as in our filings with the SEC.","Now I'm happy to turn the call over to Gary Heminger for opening remarks and highlights. Gary?","Gary R. Heminger","Thanks, Tim, and good morning to everyone. We are pleased to report a very strong quarter. Our focus on top-tier operational performance across the MPC refining, marketing and transportation system has continued to yield excellent results. This quarter, we were able to officially meet consumers' needs and capture higher product price realizations, which demonstrate the value of our integrated system.","I'm especially pleased with our smooth ramp up following the largest concentration of turnaround activity in our company's history, which we executed in the first quarter. I am also very proud of the tremendous response by our team in Garyville, Louisiana, to bring the facility back up to full capacity quickly after it was impacted by a tornado in late May.","Balancing return of capital to shareholders with investments in the business remains a priority. We purchased $459 million of shares in the second quarter. Yesterday, our Board of Directors authorized up to an additional $2 billion of share repurchases through July of 2016, and increased the quarterly dividend to $0.50 per share. During the 12 months ended June 30, we have returned $3.1 billion of capital to shareholders, representing a 13.5% yield against our average share price. This is one of the highest effective yields of any company in our comparator group.","We also have made excellent progress on our strategic priority of growing our higher value to the stable cash flow of businesses, while we continue meaningful return of capital to our shareholders.","In the midstream, we recently exercised our option to acquire a 35% ownership interest in Enbridge Inc.'s Southern Access Extension pipeline project. This investment will position us as an equity owner in a system that will increase our access to an important region for North American crude oil production growth, as well as provide a potential addition to MPLX over time. MPC expects to invest approximately $295 million in the pipeline project that is expected to be completed in mid 2015.","On the retail side, we have received notice from the Federal Trade Commission that it concluded its review of the acquisition of Hess retail operations by our subsidiary, Speedway, which continues to prepare for a closing later this year. We continue to believe that there is significant opportunity to leverage the best of both businesses. Hess fuel sales volume with Speedway's industry-leading merchandise sales per store. We believe this acquisition will be a source of long-term value to MPC and provides for enhanced strategic opportunity for the business over time.","I also want to address an item that is affecting perceptions of our industry: the recently publicized private rulings for limited condensate exports. Unfortunately, the rulings by the Commerce Department are not transparent and have created much uncertainty about exports going forward. We think the market has overreacted to the news that is not clear -- that is not a clear change in policy and an outcome that remains uncertain.","We believe that our industry has the ability to handle much more of the light shale crude oil and condensate than is processed today. But the investments to do so will not likely be made in the environment of uncertainty that has been created. Whatever the outcome, refiners in the U.S. will continue to have a transportation advantage. Even if the export infrastructure is built, the cost advantage for U.S. refiners will continue to be significant due to proximity to the domestic production.","We are confident the flexibility and optionality in our system positions of MPC -- positions MPC very well in any circumstance. In addition, we continue to believe the return profiles for the condensate splitters under construction at our Canton, Ohio and Catlettsburg refineries will be strong given the geographic proximity of those refineries to the Utica condensate production.","With that, I'll turn it over to Don to review our financial performance for the quarter. Don?","Donald C. Templin","Thanks, Gary. Slide #4 provides earnings, both on an absolute and per share basis. Our second quarter 2014 earnings were $855 million compared to $593 million in the second quarter of 2013. Second quarter 2014 earnings include pretax pension settlement expenses of $5 million, while the second quarter of 2013 included $60 million of such expenses. Earnings per diluted share were $2.95 for the second quarter of 2014. We reported $1.83 per share for the same period last year.","The bridge on Slide 5 shows the change in earnings by segment from the second quarter of 2013 to the second quarter of 2014. The primary driver for the change was the increase in Refining & Marketing segment income, which I will discuss shortly. The corporate and other unallocated item includes a $55 million favorable variance due to pension settlement expenses.","As shown on Slide 6, Refining & Marketing segment income from operations was $1.260 billion in the second quarter of 2014 compared with $903 million in the same quarter last year. The change from 2013 was primarily due to higher product price realizations. That impact is reflected in the $657 million change in Other Gross Margin.","You may recall that the second quarter 2013 product price realizations compared to spot market values were negatively impacted by volatility in the Chicago market and effects of the Renewable Fuel Standard. The effects of the Renewable Fuel Standard were more pronounced in the second quarter last year, causing the average RIN prices to be almost $0.35 higher than they were in the second quarter of this year. The increase in LLS prompt versus delivered also had a favorable impact on earnings that was offset by more narrow LLS to WTI crude differentials and backwardation in the market. Direct operating costs also increased quarter-over-quarter due to additional maintenance costs and higher natural gas prices versus last year.","To help investors better understand the quarter, we've added Slide 7, which provides a sequential earnings walk for our Refining & Marketing segment. The primary drivers for the significant increase in income over the first quarter were higher crack spreads and lower refinery operating expenses. The LLS 6-3-2-1 blended crack spread was $10.40 in the second quarter compared to $7.85 in the first quarter. This added about $568 million in additional earnings. Refinery direct operating costs provide a favorable variance of $398 million, primarily due to lower turnaround costs in the second quarter. The favorable other gross margin variance is primarily due to higher product price realizations.","Turning to Speedway segment results on Slide 8, income from operations was $94 million in the second quarter of 2014 compared with $123 million in the second quarter of 2013. Speedway's light product gross margin was $32 million lower in the second quarter of 2014 compared to the same quarter last year, as gross margin decreased by $0.046 per gallon. Merchandise margin was $224 million in the second quarter of 2014 compared with $212 million in 2013. This $12 million increase was primarily due to higher merchandise sales and margin percentage. The unfavorable $9 million other variance primarily relates to Speedway's operating expenses. Operating expenses were higher during the second quarter of 2014, primarily driven by an increase in the number of stores versus previous-year levels. On a same-store basis, gasoline sales volumes decreased 1.5% and merchandise sales, excluding cigarettes, increased 4.6% in the second quarter of 2014 compared to the second quarter of 2013. Activity in July has been positive with a 1% increase in same-store gasoline sales volumes versus the prior year.","Slide 9 shows changes in our Pipeline Transportation segment income. Income from operations was $81 million in the second quarter of 2014 compared with $58 million in the second quarter of 2013. The increase of $23 million was primarily attributable to higher transportation revenue and pipeline affiliate income. $9 million of the $12 million increase in transportation revenue was attributable to the recognition of deferred transportation credits during the quarter. The remainder was primarily due to higher average tariff rates. The increase in pipeline affiliate income was primarily attributable to our ownership interest in LOOP.","Slide 10 presents the significant drivers of changes in our cash flow for the second quarter of 2014. At June 30, our cash balance was just over $2.1 billion. Operating cash flow, before changes in working capital, was an approximately $1.1 billion source of cash due to the very strong financial performance in the second quarter.","As Gary highlighted, we continued delivering on our commitment to balance investments in the business with return of capital to our shareholders. We repurchased $459 million of shares and paid $122 million of dividends in the second quarter. We also increased our quarterly dividend to $0.50 per share. This increase represents a 32% compound annual growth rate from the dividend level established at the time of the spin in June 2011.","Slide 11 shows that at the end of the second quarter, we had $2.1 billion of cash and just over $3.6 billion of debt. With EBITDA of about $4.3 billion during the last 12 months, we continue to be in a very manageable debt position with leverage of 0.8x EBITDA and a debt-to-total-capital ratio of 25%.","Turning to Slide 12. During the last 12 months, we generated $3.4 billion in cash from operations and $1.7 billion of free cash flow. Over this period, we've returned $3.1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases or approximately 1.8x our free cash flow. During the second quarter of 2014, we purchased approximately 5 million shares for $459 million through open market purchases.","It is our intention to continue returning capital to our shareholders that is not currently needed to support the operational and investment needs of the business, and we continue to believe share repurchases are the most efficient way to do so. The additional $2 billion board authorization adds to the approximately $700 million remaining on previous share repurchase authorizations and reinforces our commitment to continuing this activity in the future. As Gary indicated and you've heard from us on multiple occasions, maintaining a balance between disciplined investments in the business and returning capital to shareholders continues to be a strategic focus.","Slide 13 provides our outlook for key operating metrics for MPC for the third quarter of 2014. We are planning for third quarter throughput volumes to be comparable to the second quarter of 2014 and down slightly compared to the third quarter last year, due to higher planned maintenance.","Now I will turn the call back over to Tim Griffith.","Timothy T. Griffith","Thanks, Don. [Operator Instructions] With that, Jeanette, we are prepared to open up the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we have a question from Ed Westlake of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Congratulations and thanks for researching the cost advantages of the U.S. refiners. I was actually down at the BIS and they said, \"As long as it goes through distillation towers and looks like product we can sell it,\" which sounds like a refinery to me. So the first question, just a small one, on the Garyville, it seems like the opportunity cost for this [ph] may be lower than you thought. I mean, do you have a number for that?","Donald C. Templin","Ed, we didn't -- we don't have a specific number, I guess. When we -- after the tornado had hit, we'd indicated that the impact on crude throughput would be less than 5%. And the team did an amazing job of getting that fully operational in about 14 or 15 days. So the impact on sort of crude throughputs was not that significant.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And then, great color on the deltas and there's that other gross margin number, which obviously does vary over time. And obviously, thanks for shouting out how bad it was last year, which is some normalization this year. But is there any structural change, do you think, in terms of that contribution from, say, pricing over and above the cracks that you mentioned?","Gary R. Heminger","Ed, this is Gary. I wouldn't say there's a structural change. But if you compare the slides of the price realization, as Don was going to, as compared to Speedway, you can see that there was a change in Speedway's gross margin for the quarter, just illustrates how important our integrated system is and how we can take advantage of the marketplace and that dislocation as illustrated in those 2 slides. So I wouldn't to say it's a structural change, it's we have the ability to go to where the margin is.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. So then my just strategic question was just around the logistics business. Any sort of color or update you can provide in terms of where you see the EBITDA of your overall logistics business standing a few years out? And whether there's any change to your fairly consistent guidance in terms of a steady monetization of that via the MPLX?","Gary R. Heminger","I would say, first of all, we're still in pretty much the same steady state of, we said, about $800 million left from -- as compared to what we've already dropped down. That does not include the Sandpiper and SAX pipeline, nor does that include Cornerstone that we're working on now. So if you add those in, we're probably into circa $1.2 billion of EBITDA over time. As far as the ratability of drop downs and -- we look at MPLX as a great currency. And we want that currency to be very strong today, and we want it to be very strong as we drop down over many years to come. There certainly have been some other changes in the marketplace that some are employing. That continues to illustrate how important these MLPs and the growth trajectory of MLPs are. We expect to remain at a high level of compounded annual growth and -- which is what we have emphasized quarter-on-quarter, Ed. So we want this currency to be strong today, we want it to be strong tomorrow, and we're going to continue to manage within those parameters.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And vision-wise, I mean the North American infrastructure spend and opportunity set continues to get larger. Just a question, presume you are still looking very hard at additional projects over and above the ones that you mentioned on the call today.","Gary R. Heminger","We certainly are, Ed. As I've said many times, MPLX is going to be a growth vehicle for our midstream, but it's not going to be tied, like it has been historically, just to the volume that MPC moves. So we have the ability, the intellectual capabilities to branch out, whether it would be into NGLs, whether it's into transportation fuels or other opportunities that are eligible earnings for an MLP. We believe we have the capacity to do any.","Operator","And we have a question from Doug Leggate of Bank of America.","Jason Smith - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","It's actually Jason Smith on for Doug. So I just wanted to dig again into your strong catch [ph] rate relative to your peers. It looks like your distillate yield also increased relative to gasoline. Gary, if you can maybe talk about if there's any specific that was driving that, and is that sustainable going forward?","Gary R. Heminger","Let me ask Rich to talk about the distillate yield first.","Richard D. Bedell","Jason other than just optimizing on crude slates, we did finish a hydrocracker project at Garyville in the first quarter, which increased its capacity. The design capacity was to increase it by about 10,000 barrels a day -- excuse me, 20,000 barrels a day. And that was successfully put on stream at the end of the first quarter.","Gary R. Heminger","But I will say, Jason, that we really haven't had any other structural change in the way we're operating.","Jason Smith - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And to follow up. And I mean, so when you guys bring on the Garyville hydrocracker and some of your other projects, I mean where can you see that distillate yield potentially going to in time?","Gary R. Heminger","Are you talking about the Garyville reset hydrocracker?","Jason Smith - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Yes.","Gary R. Heminger","The project? Well, first of all, we haven't sanctioned that project. And it won't be until the fourth quarter, early first quarter, that we make our final determination. And we do not have all the engineering complete yet to be able to give you that number. We do expect, if we were to do that, it would add about 25,000 barrels a day of ultra low-sulfur [ph] diesel. But really what that project, and Rich can go into the details of what that project is doing as far as our feedstock slate.","Richard D. Bedell","Yes, I mean, that -- what we call the ROUX project, that reset hydrocracker project. It increases, like Gary said, I think it's about 28,000 barrels a day of distillate. It decreases our gas oil imports, and really, it's just -- it's a project based on the spreads between resid and ULSD.","Jason Smith - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Follow-up is maybe for Don. Don, so you mentioned that you guys want to keep the buybacks going. But given the retail acquisition and given that you guys have talked about a kind of $500 million to $1.5 billion targeted cash level, how should we think about the pace of buybacks going forward? Should we expect it to potentially slow from this kind of $400 million or $500 million a quarter?","Donald C. Templin","Well, I think, we've consistently said that it's very important for us to maintain our investment grade credit profile. And we've consistently said that we're going to manage the core liquidity, that's the $500 million to $1.5 billion you have referenced there, Jason. I think, we've also had conversations with you all about the fact that our balance sheet, even maintaining a strong investment grade credit profile, could take on incremental leverage. So we would expect that we would fund the acquisition with cash, but we'll also be accessing the debt markets to do that because we do think it's an important part of the investment thesis in MPC to be returning capital to shareholders and we're very confident and our board is very confident, based upon the recent announcement yesterday of the share repurchase authorization, that we can continue to do so.","Operator","And our next question comes from Paul Cheng of Barclays.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Before I ask my question, just want to have a request to Don. As over the next couple of years that the GP speed start to moving up to the high-speed, if possible that you would be really helpful, I think, for all of us, so that we don't have to check so many different 10-Q document, you actually on your press release, to list out what [ph] Is in your GP cash flow, and what is your unit of the LP given that sometime with the job done, you may change?","Donald C. Templin","Okay, Paul, good suggestion. We'll continue -- we think, MPLX, and particularly, the GP, is a real value adder. And so we'll do that in order to make -- highlight that important cash flow.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Yes, 2 questions. First, a simple one. Gary, there's a speculation CITGO may be selling their refining asset. From an M&A standpoint, how you look at your portfolio. You're pretty satisfied or that you think you have more appetite, you want to expand your refining footprint further from your current portfolio?","Gary R. Heminger","Well, I have read this rumor that CITGO might be interested in doing something, but I would say right now, we're pretty satisfied with our footprint.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. The second question, maybe, that's for both Don and Gary. If we're looking at the pace of your job done, comparing to some of your peers, is a formal measure. I think, that's 2 school of thoughts, and given the valuation for the GP is significantly different than any for the LP and the refiner C-corp. And also that from an investment standpoint, is it better off there for you to accelerate substantially on your job done pace so that you will allow the MPLX actually use their own balance sheet for their future organic growth, [indiscernible] instead of using the C-corp, and also, they're seeing the value of the GP grow at a much faster pace.","Gary R. Heminger","Well, Paul, I would say I agree with all of the above. But as I said, we think we have an outstanding currency. That currency has been very valuable today. It gives us the flexibility in the event we want to accelerate. If we need to accelerate for MPC purposes or we want to accelerate for MPLX purposes, we have that tremendous flexibility. But at the end of the day, we want to make sure the currency is valuable going forward. Yes, we have been measured and, yes, we're watching what's going on in the marketplace. But all of your suggestions, I think it was more of a statement than a question. I think all of your suggestions are spot on and is things that we study very, very carefully.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Can I just sneak in with a final question for clarification?","Donald C. Templin","Only for you, Paul.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","For the $800 million of the potential job done of the $1.2 billion, are those including the storage tank inside the refinery gate and the barges that you own?","Donald C. Templin","Yes, sir.","Operator","And our next question comes from Doug Terreson of ISI Group.","Douglas Terreson - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Gary, one of your mantras has been value-added investment and sustained focus on shareholder returns and obviously, the company has delivered in that area. And on this point, I wanted to see if there was some type of generic progress report that we could talk about on Galveston Bay synergy capture and projected capital that were referred to at the recent Analyst Meeting, that is if there is one. You highlighted a couple of slides and I just wanted to see if you could provide somewhat of a generic update as to how happy you are with the outcome there?","Gary R. Heminger","Yes, Doug, and good morning to you as well. We're very, very pleased with Galveston Bay. First of all, it's an outstanding employee base, an outstanding workforce with a great work ethic. Secondly, as we've gone through now about 16, 17 months of operation, we continue to get more and more comfortable with the asset. You recognized it was in our K and will be updated in the Q here. The -- what the earnout was that at the -- the earnout payment to -- that we had to the prior owner was right in line with what we said, which says, the refinery is performing on a financial basis very well. I had stated earlier in our last conference call that this is an important year. We've already finished a major turnaround in the plant where we went in and repaired and really got things up to standards on the -- I will call, the crude side of the equation. And as I said, it's an important year. We still have another big turnaround to complete this year on the aromatic side of the business. Once that is complete, we will have pretty much been through the refinery. Then we're going to go to the low hanging fruit. The preliminary meetings that Rich and his team have had with me suggest there is a lot of low-hanging high-return projects that we can do. So I'm very pleased with the value generation, very pleased with how this positions us in the marketplace. And now with the Hess acquisition and picking up additional Colonial line space, we now have been able to pick up 90,000 barrels a day of Colonial line space, which -- between these 2 transactions, which I think gives us significant advantage to the marketplace to have that assured line space all the way to the East Coast. So, Rich, I don't know if you have anything else to add, but -- operationally, but we are very pleased, Doug.","Richard D. Bedell","Yes, I'll just ditto Gary's comments that we see that the refinery has a lot of upside potential from where it is now. And that's part of our capital budget process, and we're going through those options today. And they become clear as we learn more and more about the facility.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jeff Dietert of Simmons.","Jeffrey A. Dietert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Jeff Dietert with Simmons. My question is regarding domestic crude price discounts in the back half of the year given continued robust oil production growth, upcoming fall maintenance and belated startups of new pipes into the Gulf Coast. What's your outlook for the back half of the year? I think, the forward curve has got WTI-Brent, over $10 and LLS-Brent to widen out around $7. Do you think that's a reasonable outlook or do you expect wider or narrower?","C. Michael Palmer","Jeff, this is Mike Palmer. I think that when you look at the forward curves that have things widening out a bit, I think that, generally, that does make sense to us. We haven't seen the kind of price signal from the domestic light crude oil that I think really would test refiners to run as much as they possibly could. I do think, as production continues to rise, as the BridgeTex pipeline gets built into Houston, I do think that there is the likelihood that you could see these differentials widen a bit. So what we're seeing in the forward market just generally makes sense to us.","Jeffrey A. Dietert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","And is there a point that you look at between, say, Mars and LLS, at which you really see a move towards lights being economically advantaged over mediums, does it need to get inside of a $3 discount or is there any kind of rule of thumb we can use to think about that?","C. Michael Palmer","No, I don't think I really could give you a rule of thumb. We're running our LPs every day. It really depends upon the product values in the market and which way we go between, say, LLS or Mars. I can tell you that with the recent price action generally over the last, I'll say, 6 months, that it's back and forth between whether you'd want to run LLS or Mars. But that's something we just have to look at every day.","Gary R. Heminger","And Jeff, one other key point. When we look at how much medium sour versus light we run, and it's a point that I make in D.C., it's a point that I make with the financial community, the market is far from saturated of running light sweet crude. We have the ability to run approximately 65% light sweet crude. We only ran approximately 45%, 46% in the quarter. So it's -- every barrel, as you know, is an alternative barrel. So again, that just shows there is tremendous opportunity, but we're always going to choose the most economical barrel.","Jeffrey A. Dietert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Yes, and in weekly statistics, we're seeing Gulf Coast oil imports coming down and some of the pricing that's visible in the marketplace has increased on oil imports. Are you seeing a shift in your portfolio away from importing oil towards more domestic consumption?","Gary R. Heminger","Well, as I said, every barrel is an alternative barrel. So we're always going to look at what is the most economic barrel for us to purchase, and that's going to set the tone for us every day. As we look across the global supply chain. And again, this issue of condensate exports, I think, really is a sticky wicket in the marketplace today, if you will. Because the lack of transparency and the unknown has changed. I think some people, some foreign suppliers' ideas on how to supply the North American market, it's changed some of the South American suppliers and how they want to supply the North American market. I think it's going to take about 90 days, probably, for that stuff to sort itself out.","Jeffrey A. Dietert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Public policy through private letter rulings is not a real efficient way of communicating the requirements.","Gary R. Heminger","I echo that.","Operator","And our next question comes from Paul Sankey of Wolfe Research.","Paul I. Sankey - Wolfe Research, LLC","I was extremely impressed that you just made a cricket analogy -- sticky wicket, Gary. Very impressive. I've just got a few follow-ups to the various discussions. Firstly, on the crude exports thing, would you guys have any possible incentive to export crude? And I'm thinking obviously of the LOOP.","Gary R. Heminger","That's something, Paul, that we've looked at as -- LOOP as a part of the infrastructure. But let me kind of share with you how LOOP is built. You have 3 SPMs to unload these ships. Everything flows from the gulf into the shore base. We do not have the capability to bidirectionally flow that. We've looked at it. There's been some consideration, but in order to be able to pay off that investment to bidirectionally load, you would have to have significant volume. So technically, it could be done over time, but you'd have to change everything from the caverns at Galliano and change the flow pattern from Galliano all the way back out to the unloading platform in order to be able to do that, which would be a significant project and very, very costly. But we have looked at it.","Paul I. Sankey - Wolfe Research, LLC","I think, it's fair to say it's the only major offloading, onloading potential point in the U.S. right now, isn't it, for deepwater?","Gary R. Heminger","Yes, it is, Paul. And we'll just see -- I don't -- I do not believe that we're ever going to see that type of volume that would be required to be able to justify that type of a project. Certainly, not on the condensate export side. And when you look at the curves, long term, of domestic production versus whether or not we should export, I think, the markets are going to suggest, and the way the global producers are supplying the market, I think, long term, the global price will suggest that it's going to be very challenging to be able to support those type of economics and that type of investment.","Paul I. Sankey - Wolfe Research, LLC","Sure. A quick follow-up is, did you mention -- apologies if you did, the product volumes of exports that you had this past quarter?","Donald C. Templin","Paul, this is Don. It was 298,000 barrels a day.","Paul I. Sankey - Wolfe Research, LLC","Could we get gasoline-disti [ph] split?","Donald C. Templin","I'm sorry.","Paul I. Sankey - Wolfe Research, LLC","Could you split the gasoline out for us?","Donald C. Templin","Yes, just 1 second, please.","Paul I. Sankey - Wolfe Research, LLC","And I'll just follow up quickly rather than dominate the whole call. Obviously, a bit surprised that there was less contribution than I would have anticipated for the sweet\/sour differential. Could you just talk a little bit about that and any outlook? I know you have already addressed some of this on the call, but any further thoughts on that particular differential, which I know you're very sensitive to?","Gary R. Heminger","Mike just reviewed the differentials on a prior question. Mike, you want to mention that again?","C. Michael Palmer","Yes. I mean, specifically, with regard to the sweet\/sour differential, Paul, I think that -- during the second quarter, I think that when you look at the Canadian heavy, for example, we had fairly reasonable differentials. And we expect to see those in the same kind of level going forward. When you look at the LLS Mars, I don't think there was anything that was particularly noteworthy.","Paul I. Sankey - Wolfe Research, LLC","Yes, I guess then -- no, I'm just looking at the variance as you mentioned on Slide 7, but I guess, essentially, those differentials were more or less flat with Q1. So that deals with that. Okay. And the gasoline?","Donald C. Templin","And Paul, it's 2\/3 distillate, 1\/3 gasoline. So just over 200,000 barrels a day of distillate and the remainder is gasoline.","Operator","And our next question comes from Roger Read of Wells Fargo.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I guess, the first thing I would like to maybe get a little more clarity on. I was just comparing your refining margins this year in the second quarter to last year, and then just kind of a quick skim across your peer group. A much better quarter relative to your numbers, and certainly, relative to your peers. I'm just wondering, as you walk through the various items, since everybody is dealing with the similar volumes of crude and pricing of the crude, was there a hedging impact? Was there something where you're able to move the crude around better? Do you believe it was mostly a geographical event? I'm just trying to understand kind of the moving parts here, maybe a function of how much downtime you had last year in the second quarter where you weren't able to realize as well against expected crack spreads?","Donald C. Templin","Yes, I guess -- Roger, this is Don. I would say it's more a function of our capability to be able to provide refined product to the markets where it was needed and the flexibility that we have with our logistics system, including our significant marine or barge system that allows us to be very flexible in moving product to markets where there is a good demand. So I think, historically, you've seen that we've been able to capture good margin from that -- price realizations compared to spot market prices. And we clearly were able to do that this quarter as well. I mean, if you saw the difference between sort of Slide 6 and Slide 7, Slide 6, that $657 million of other gross margin was really a comparator to a quarter where -- last year, where you had some unusual noise because of RINs and because of volatility in the Chicago market. One of the reasons we put in Slide 7 was we thought it also would demonstrate that $159 million is substantially or predominantly our ability to realize product realizations over spot. And we thought that would help people sort of triangulate, if you will, how we're doing in that area.","Gary R. Heminger","Roger, there were no onetime hedging gains or anything, either.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Yes, that's what I'm trying to understand. So basically, it's -- I mean, it's the flexibility in your system and it sounds like to some extent, downstream from the refining gate in terms of where you're able to move the product at a given moment.","Donald C. Templin","Yes, I would say definitely downstream from the refining gate.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's what I was just trying to understand. If it was simply a utilization thing or something more deep. And it sounds like it's on the more deep side. Follow-up question, CapEx, you've got the slide there first of the Appendix, and it looks like, if I do the math, you've got a huge spend in the Pipeline Transportation side coming up in the back half and a relatively healthy growth in Speedway. I'm assuming that's x anything going on with the acquisition of Hess's retail business. Just wondering if you could give us some clarity on kind of what the plans are there?","Gary R. Heminger","Yes, so I think, your presumption is correct. It is x Hess acquisition for Speedway. On the Pipeline Transportation side, we did expect that a good portion of that would be back-ended, particularly with our investments in SAX and Sandpiper. So we expect that we will broadly be at that $2.4 billion by the end of the year. It's just sort of how those dollars are being spent and the timing of when they're being spent, Roger.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And any particular project you could highlight for us in the Pipeline?","Gary R. Heminger","Well, for Pipeline Transportation, SAX and Sandpiper, are 2 of the bigger pieces.","Operator","Our next question comes from Faisel Khan of Citigroup.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just going back to the other sort of gross margin bucket. If I go to Slide 20, where you sort of look at the absolute numbers, the $477 million of sort of other gross margins. I just want to make sure I understand this right. So you're saying that this is sort of a function of your sort of spot to rack margins farther down between your refining gate and your terminals, is that a fair assumption in terms of --","Donald C. Templin","Yes. So Faisel, I mean, historically, I think when you guys -- when we provided the market metrics that get us to indicated gross margin, there has always been sort of the difference between that indicated gross margin, and our reported gross margin has broadly been, I would say, in the $200 million to $300 million range. And that in second quarter of '13, it was a -- it was under that number, due in large part to the sort of noise around the RINs and how it impacted the spot prices. So in this quarter, I would say the difference between sort of the $200 million or $300 million that you would normally expect to see is the ability to -- the product price -- incremental product price realization that we were able to realize during the quarter.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Is that just a function of basis, like if I look at either near New York Harbor or if I look at -- New York Harbor versus like Gulf Coast or sort of the Florida market versus the Gulf Coast in terms of gasoline and also distillate price?","Donald C. Templin","I think some of it is that, we're using, for example, in the Midwest, Chicago, 6-3-2-1 crack, and our activity in the Midwest is all over the Midwest, including markets that aren't in Chicago. So we're always -- we tell -- we think we have a lot of flexibility. We know we have a lot of flexibility in the ability to supply markets, and we use that flexibility to make sure that we're optimizing value.","Gary R. Heminger","Faisel, I would say, it's the -- it just illustrates the efficiency of our system probably to be able to move to the markets quicker than anyone else.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Yes, I know, and that's definitely clear from the results. I'm just trying to figure out if there's things that we can look at in the market quarter-to-quarter that might help us sort of gauge how much this other gross margin moves around. But I guess, following up on this is, with the Hess acquisition, how much is this other gross margin do you think going to change?","Donald C. Templin","That will remain to be seen. But as we said, when we roll out the Hess acquisition, it gives us -- it just helps with the efficiency of our system. Now we'll have nearly 75% of short volume that we know where the volume is going. We picked up tremendous pipeline space on Colonial, and other pipelines have been servicing the Northeast and some of the Southeast markets. So we think it will be an add-on to our business today.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","With the Hess piece, how much total capacity will you guys have on Colonial after this is all said and done?","Gary R. Heminger","I don't think that we have made that public individually.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","Timothy T.

My name is Jason and I will be your operator. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. ","I will now turn the call over to Lisa Wilson. Lisa, you may begin. ","Lisa Wilson ","Thank you, Jason. Welcome to Marathon Petroleum's Corporation fourth quarter and full year 2016 earnings webcast and conference call. The synchronized slides that accompany this call can be found on our Web site at marathonpetroleum.com under the Investor Center tab. On the call today are Gary Heminger, Chairman, President and CEO; Tim Griffith, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and other members of our MPC executive team.","We invite you to read the Safe Harbor statements on Slide 2. It is a reminder that we will be making forward-looking statements during the call and during the question-and-answer session. Actual results may differ materially from what we expect today. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included there as well as in our filings with the SEC. ","Now I will turn the call over to Gary Heminger for opening remarks and highlights.","Gary Heminger","Thanks, Lisa, and good morning to everyone.","If you'd please turn to Slide 3. This morning we reported fourth quarter earnings of $227 million or $0.43 per diluted share and full year earnings of $1.17 billion or $2.21 per diluted share. We were pleased with the results for the quarter across all areas of the business, despite a 2016 that proved to be challenging from a commodity price and margin perspective. We are also enthusiastic about MPLXs 2016 results. One year into the combination of MPLX and MarkWest, and remain very encouraged by the growth opportunities in front of the partnership, which will continue to be a source of long-term value for our investors.","Moving to the company owned retail business in 2016, Speedway set all-time records for the year, while continuing to maintain its disciplined approach to cost control. Speedway surpassed segment all-time highs in income from operations, light product gallons sold, merchandise sales, and merchandise gross margin on both the percentage sales and absolute dollar basis. Speedway continues to exceed expectations by driving marketing enhancement opportunities and continuing to realize acquisition synergies across the network.","Turning to refining and marketing, Garyville successfully completed the largest turn around in its history during the quarter. As part of the turnaround we completed an SEC LTF grade project, increasing Garyville's production capacity of high value Alcolift and light products. We also completed the Galveston Bay refinery export capacity expansion, increasing Galveston Bay's export capacity by 30,000 barrels per day, increasing our total export capacity from both the Galveston Bay and Garyville refineries to nearly 400,000 barrels per day.","This morning we also announced our 2017 capital investment plans for both MPC and MPLX, which remained focused on strengthening the sustained earnings power of our business to growth and margin enhancing projects, as well as expanding on more stable cash flow businesses. We are discussing these capital plans separately as the funding will be managed independently and we think the consolidated totals will be less useful going forward.","Our capital investment plan for MPC for 2017 excluding MPLX is $1.7 billion, this planned spending for MPC is roughly in line with MPC's capital spending and investments in 2016 and includes nearly 1.2 billion for refining and marketing, 380 million for Speedway, 90 million for Midstream Investments at MPC and $100 million to support corporate activities. The refining and marketing segment includes 325 million for margin enhancing investments including Garyville distillate maximization projects, Galveston Bay export capacity expansion and approximately $85 million for the South Texas Asset Repositioning project. This morning we also announced a $500 million reduction in the total planned investment for the STAR project. ","We now plan to spend a total of 1.5 billion for STAR through 2021, while principally maintaining the project's scope and projected returns. The high returns stage investments planned for STAR are designed to enhance profitability and reliability, while integrating Galveston Bay at Texas City refineries creating the second largest refining complex in the United States.","We expect to invest about $380 million in Speedway primarily to build new stores and to remodel and rebuild existing retail locations in its core markets, driving continued growth and opportunities in merchandize across the platform. This morning MPLX also announced its 2017 capital spending and investment plan, a $1.4 billion to $1.7 billion for organic growth plus approximately $100 million for maintenance capital.","About 75% of these growth investments are directed to the development of natural gas and gas liquids infrastructure expansion to support MPLX's producer-customer demand, primarily in the Marsalis region. The remaining growth capital will be for the Utica infrastructure builds-out in connection with a recently completed Cornerstone pipeline, a butane cavern in Robinson, Illinois and a tank farm expansion in Texas City, Texas.","Additionally, we are executing the strategic actions announced on January 3, to enhance shareholder value. We plan to significantly accelerate the drop downs of MLP qualifying assets generating approximately $1.4 billion of annual EBITDA to MPLX as soon as practicable and now planned for 2017.","Our proposed transaction representing approximately $250 million of this annual EBITDA is already under review by the conflicts committee on the MPLX board and is expected to close by the end of the first quarter. Work related to the remaining plan drop downs is on schedule and we were pleased to see the qualifying income regulations finally released. We are currently reviewing the amended regulations and pursuing all actions to get comfort around the qualifying income treatment for our proposed, fuels distribution model, which will likely involve a private letter ruling on the structure given the substantial differences to precedent transactions.","In conjunction with the completion of the plan drop downs, MPC also expects to exchange its economic interest in the general partner, including incentive distribution rights for newly issued MPLX common units. We expect this exchange will capture the underappreciated value of our general partner interest and optimize the cost of capital for the partnership. Similarly to our long-term intent to maintain an investment grade credit profile cash proceeds from the drop downs and ongoing LP distributions to MPC are expected to fund the substantial ongoing capital to shareholders. ","Importantly, all transactions were subject to requisite approvals including the independent conference committee of the MPLX Board and will be subject to market and other conditions including tax and other regulatory clearances. Additionally, a special committee of the Board has been formed and has selected an independent financial advisor to assist in the full and thorough review of Speedway to ensure optimum value is delivered to shareholders over the long-term. We expect to provide an update on the review by mid-2017.","As we start the new year, I also wanted to provide some observations on the macro-environment we are expecting in 2017. From a commodity and oil price perspective we are encouraged by OPEC's resolve around production levels and think the prospects were more balanced supply and demand environment, should be supportive of higher crude prices throughout the year. This bodes well for a number of important differentials on the refining side, as well as helping to continue to generate meaningful midstream development opportunities for MPLX.","We think the U.S. macro picture remains solid and although we have seen unusual weakness in refining products demand in January, we expect a solid economic growth will continue to support good underlying demand for refine products, as inventory levels are worked down over the course of the year. We are also encouraged by the early tone set around energy policy by the new administration. Although the ultimate changes remain to be seen, it appears we may have a ligament opportunity to walk back some of the regulatory burdens that the industry has had to deal with over the last several years. Including excessive delays on important and needed pipelines, a potential revisit of the requirements on the renewable fuel standard, as well as much needed reform on taxes.","The execution of our strategic plan, strengthening commodity prices, recovering refinery spreads and an improved regulatory environment all contribute to what we expect will be a strong 2017, and believe we are well positioned to deliver long-term sustainable value to our shareholders.","Before, I turn the call over to Tim, as we announced last Friday, MPC looks forward to welcoming Mike Stice to our Board later this month. Mike comes to us with more than 35 years in the upstream and midstream gas businesses, including as Chief Executive Officer of Access Midstream Partners, where he had one of the largest gathering and processing MLPs. On behalf of the whole MPC Board it's a pleasure to have Mike joining our ranks as we embarked on an exciting year.","With that let me turn the call over the Tim to walk you through the fourth quarter and the full year 2016 financial results, Tim?","Tim Griffith","Thanks, Gary. Slide 4, provides earnings on both an absolute and per share basis for the fourth quarter and full year 2016. MPC's fourth quarter earnings of $227 million or $0.43 per diluted share were up from last year's 187 million or $0.35 per diluted share. For the full year 2016 earnings were nearly 1.2 billion or $2.21 per diluted share, down from 2.9 billion or $5.26 per diluted share in 2015.","The chart on Slide 5, shows the changes in earnings over the fourth quarter of last year. It's important to note that the $187 million of fourth quarter 2015 earnings included a $370 million pretax lower cost for market inventory valuation charge. $345 million of this prior year charge is reported in the refining marketing segment, and 25 million was in the Speedway segment with the related tax benefit reflected in income taxes. There were no LCM adjustments in the fourth quarter 2016 resulting in a favorable year-over-year effects for both of these segments and unfavorable quarter over quarter change for income taxes. ","The quarter-over-quarter comparison also reflects several impacts related to the MarkWest merger in multiple bars on the walk. Midstream segment results increased as we had a full quarter of MarkWest results this year compared to less than one month in 2015. The walk also highlight to increased interest expense resulting from the assumed MarkWest debt and an increased allocation of MPL's earnings to the publicly held units in the partnership shown here as non-controlling interest.","Turning to Slide 6, our refining and marketing segment reported income from operations of $219 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to 179 million in the same quarter last year. Looking at our key market matrix, an increase in LLS-based blended crack spread had a $105 million favorable impact of segment results as an increase from the Gulf Coast crack more than offset the effects of the decrease in the Chicago crack. The blended crack increased from $6.65 per barrels in '15 to $7.39 per barrels in 2016.","We also benefited by 47 million on the sweet\/sour differential, as a higher percentage of sour crude in slate more than offset a slightly narrower sweet\/sour differential. Offsetting much of these favorable impacts was an unfavorable other gross margin effects of $397 million primarily due to two factors, first we experienced weaker asphalt, price product realizations compared to fourth quarter 2015. Asphalt realizations were exceptionally strong in the fourth quarter of 2015, and did not increase at the same rate as the rise in the price of crude in the fourth quarter of 2016.","Second, we experienced weaker gasoline product price realizations versus LLS-based crack spread reported in our market metric for the quarter. Segment results also reflected an unfavorable impact from direct operating cost of 70 million, primarily related to turnaround activity in the quarter. Turnaround and major maintenance cost were $0.45 per barrels higher in the fourth quarter of 2016 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2015.","Turning to Slide 7, we\u2019ve also provided a sequential comparison of the refining and marketing segment results for the fourth quarter of '16, as compared to the third quarter of 2016. A decrease in the LLS-based blended crack had a $201 million unfavorable impact of segment results, as an increase in the Chicago crack spread was only partially offset by an increase in the Gulf Coast crack. The blended crack spread decrease from $8.08 per barrels in the third quarter to $7.39 per barrels in the fourth quarter.","Direct operating cost was 70 million higher than the third quarter, primarily related to turnaround activity at our Garyville refinery. A favorable other gross margin effect of $257 million almost completely offset these unfavorable effects. The change in other gross margin was primarily due to two factors, first we experienced stronger product price realizations versus spot market prices used in the LLS-based crack spread reported on our market metrics. Second, crude and feedstock acquisition cost compared to the market indicators were more favorable fourth quarter compared to third quarter. ","Slide 8 provides the drivers for the change in refining marketing segment income for the full year versus 2015. Income from operations was $1.5 billion in 2016 compared to $4.1 billion in 2015. The LLS 6-3-2-1 blended crack spread has nearly a $2 billion unfavorable impact on the full year segment results with lower crack spreads in both the Gulf Coast and Chicago markets over the full year. The blended crack spreads for the full year decreased from 9.70 per barrel in 2015 to 6.96 per barrel in 2016. We had $334 million improvement from the sweet\/sour differential as a $0.42 wider differential combined with about 5% higher crude oil throughput over the full year.","The primary contributors for the nearly $1.1 billion unfavorable other gross margin variance in this walk was narrower gasoline and diesel price realizations versus the LLS-based crack spread in 2016 compared to last year.","Finally, the value of refinery biometric gains continues to be lower than last year due to the absolute lower refined product price environment in 2016. The $407 million increase in direct operating costs over 2015 was related to the higher refinery turnaround activity in 2016 versus prior year. Turnaround and major maintenance cost increased $0.70 per barrel compared to 2015 with significant turnaround activity occurring at Garyville, Galveston Bay and Robinson in 2016 compared to a fairly light scheduled turnaround activity in 2015.","In addition, year-over-year results reflect the favorable effects to 2016's full year segment results caused by the 345 million LCM charge in '15 and the subsequent reversal of the inventory valuation reserve as refined product prices increased in 2016.","Moving to our other segments. Slide 9 provides the Speedway segment results for the fourth quarter and full year. Speedway segment income was a 165 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to 135 million in the same period 2015. The increase in segment income was primarily due to lower operating cost, increased merchandize margin and the absence of an LCM adjustment in '16 compared to the 2015 LCM charge of 25 million. These favorable impacts were substantially offset by lower light product margins, which decreased from $0.1823 per gallon in the fourth quarter of 2015 to $0.1617 per gallon in the fourth quarter of '16.","Speedway's income from operations for full year 2016 was a record 734 million compared to 673 million in '15. The increase in segment income was the result of record merchandize margin, gains from asset sales and the effects of LCM adjustments mentioned earlier. The favorable impacts were partially offset by lower light product margins which decreased from $0.1823 per gallon in '15 to $0.1656 per gallon in 2016.","So far, this year we've seen a roughly 3.8% decrease in same-store gasoline volumes when comparing January '17 to January of last year due to lower demand seen across our marketing area, in addition to the impacts from the ice storms in the southeast. For the same period U.S. gasoline demand decreased approximately 6.5%. As Gary mentioned earlier, despite the seasonal weakness in demand we continue to expect gasoline demand to rebound to levels comparable to 2016.","Slide 10, provides the changes in the Midstream segment income of a 151 million quarter-over-quarter and 491 million year-over-year. The increases were primarily due to the combination with MarkWest on December 4th of last year and from the result of new pipeline and marine equity investments during 2016.","From a cashflow prospective Slide 11 presents elements of changes to our consolidated cash position for the fourth quarter. Cash at the end of the year was just over 887 million. Core operating cash flow before changes to working capital was an $896 million source of cash. Working capital was $95 million source the cash for the quarter, as the price impact and crude payables more than offset inventory impacts in the quarter.","Cashflow for the quarter also reflects opportunistic equity issuances by MPLX, through its ATM program during the quarter, with net proceeds of 277 million. Return of capital to shareholders by way of dividends and share repurchases was $210 million during the quarter. Going forward we intend to maintain our focus on disciplined and balanced approach to capital allocation, including careful investment in the business and continued return of capital to shareholders. ","As Gary mentioned early, we expect cash proceeds from drop downs and ongoing LP distributions to fund the substantial ongoing return of capital to shareholders. All conducted with the continued focus on maintaining an investment grade credit profit at both MPC and MPLX.","Slide 12 provides an overview of our capitalization and financial profile of the business at the end of the year. We had $10.6 billion of total consolidated debt, including $4.4 billion of debt at MPLX. Total debt-to-book capitalization was about 33% and represented 2.5 times, last 12 months adjusted EBITDA on a consolidated basis or about 1.9 times if we exclude MPLX. We continue to show the metric without MPLX as we think it's more useful to show the bifurcated capital structure, given the effect of the relatively higher leverage of the growing partnership and consolidated matrix. ","Slide 13 provides updated outlook information on key operating metrics for MPC for the first quarter of 2017. We're expecting the first quarter throughput volumes to be down slightly compared to the first quarter of 2016, due to more plant maintenance during in the quarter.","Total direct operating costs are expected to be $10.05 per barrel on a total throughput of 1.68 million barrels per day. The increased operating cost quarter-over-quarter is primarily attributed to plant maintenance, mainly in the Gulf Coast where turnarounds will occur at all three refineries.","Gulf Coast crude throughput its estimated at 800,000 barrels per day. Included in the first quarter of plant maintenance is the first turnaround of processed units from Garyville's 2009 major expansion. While costs are higher than first quarter of last year, we expect the full year plant maintenance cost to be similar to 2016 levels.","Manufacturing cost on a per barrel basis are also expected to be higher due to higher forecasted natural gas prices combined with lower throughput volumes. We expect to continue to see the advantage from processing sour crude as reflected in our expectation that will make up about 64% of crude oil throughput in the first quarter. Estimated percentage of WI type -- priced crude is 15%. Our projected first quarter corporate and other unallocated items are estimated at 80 million.","With that let me turn the call back over to Lisa. Lisa?","Lisa Wilson","As we open the call for your questions, as a courtesy to all participants, we ask that you limit yourself to one question plus a follow-up. If time permits, we will re-prompt for additional questions. With that, we will now open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brad Heffern from RBC Capital Markets. ","Brad Heffern ","Gary, I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the border adjustment tax. If it happens, how would it affect MPC's behavior, how it would affect product markets in general and maybe the likelihood you think that it would get passed? ","Gary Heminger","Well let me start, in the event that it was to be passed, Brad, the refineries is going to be able to pass -- is going to have to be able to pass any incremental cost on to the consumer. And I'm very confident that we will be able to do that, just as we did when crude prices were $100 to $147, we passed the price on to the consumer.","Now the calculus is really a political calculus on do I think it would be passed, because that's going to be the concern trying to pass something through congress that really is going to increase domestic crude prices at the benefit of domestic producers to the detriment of the consumer, I think is something that is it's going to be difficult.","But if it were to pass, we'll be able to -- we'll be flexible, we'll be able to move the price on to the consumer. Now I've had a lot of questions, Brad, what do I think will happen with incremental exports, the companies who have their refineries in the Gulf Coast have the infrastructure and logistics to be able to export, will be the ones who will still be the most likely to export because we'll have the lowest cost.","So, as we stated, we are a little over 300,000 barrels per day of exports in this quarter. We now have the infrastructure set that we can go around 400,000 and moving up to 500,000 barrels per day. So we're in a very, very good position. And even if border adjustments were to happen, I think Marathon is in one of the best positions because of our logistics, infrastructure, our optimization between PAD-2, PAD-3 refining, I think we'll be in good shape if it were to happen.","Brad Heffern","Okay. Thanks for that color, Gary. And then shifting over to the OPEC cut, I was curious if you've seen any impact on your volumes. Because of that cut, one of your peers said that they were getting prorated. And has there been any meaningful impact on the system overall?","Gary Heminger","Yes, let me have Mike Palmer cover that.","Mike Palmer","Yes, Brad. Certainly, we've seen the OPEC cuts. We have seen that there has been a tightening in some of the sour foreign opportunities that we've seen in past quarters. We at MPC, we've got strong relationships and contracts with Middle-East suppliers, so far we -- of course in January and February we've had turnaround, so there has been really no impact on us, our demand's been down.","But as I said, we've got very strong relationships, we don\u2019t think that there is going to be a big impact, we are already in the market buying March and April crude oil for the system, and we've continued to see some real values in sour crude opportunities. So, I don\u2019t think it's going to have a big impact on us.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Phil Gresh from JPMorgan. ","Phil Gresh ","First question is just. to follow up on some of the demand commentary. Gary, just curious, what you're seeing on the demand front. Why the data has been as weak as it has at the start the year and what makes you confident that it will get back to a stable outlook as progress through the year?","Gary Heminger","Well first of all Phil, I'll take you back to the same time last year, we didn\u2019t have a winter, if you recall. So last year demand in January was strong, plus it was -- we were on the rebound after the rapid decline in crude prices and therefore gasoline prices. And you couple that with really no upsets in the weather patterns over the same period last year, led us to a very, very strong first quarter volume.","Now we've had a couple of big storm cells that have come through mainly the South East, here earlier in the year. That has caused a pretty big upheaval. And then secondly, a lot of fog in and around the Gulf Coast regions used in ship channel, all the way through to Florida that has caused, really some supply and demand issues. ","But I think we'll get beyond this and everything seems to have really, got back into a different place right now, and what we\u2019re seeing though secondly, as you see crude prices increase, what you're going to see in many of our markets, Tony Kenney's Speedway operations in many of the markets, he has to lead the price up in order to get the incremental cost to the street. That will have some short term hit on demand, but I believe as long as crude prices continue to have a methodic pace upwards, I believe we'll be able to get that price to the street and not be too big of a hit on volume.","Phil Gresh ","Okay. Got it. And my second question is just on the maintenance. Obviously a very high first quarter level for you as well as for your peers. How do you think about maintenance for the full year in the MPC system relative to what we saw last year? And are you anticipating the whole industry -- based on what we've heard from a couple, it feels like the whole industry is going to have pretty heavy maintenance, February through April. Is that consistent with your view?","Gary Heminger","Let me have a Ray Brooks, first handle our maintenance.","Ray Brooks","Okay, as Tim stated earlier, our maintenance for the first quarter is up substantially because in the Gulf Coast we have significant turnaround activity at all three of our refineries, so we're up for the quarter. But for the year, we look at being flat with 2016, where we actually ended up at 2016 and I will say, in 2016 we were very aggressive about bringing our spend levels down. So we're projecting to hold it even with that for the year.","Gary Heminger","And Phil, as we looked across the entire industry, I think we see both, where we have our refining PAD-2, PAD-3 to be about equal to the total maintenance of last year, may be just a little bit of an uptick in the Gulf of Coast.","Some of the concerns, we have been -- the work we've done already here in January has been just little bit ahead of schedule and under budget, so we've been doing very well. There have been some concerns in the industry though about the labor force, but I don\u2019t think at the end of the day that it's going to have a substantial impact on the refining industry, but that is something I would say to keep an eye on, but we're in very, very good shape on all of our turnarounds.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse.","Johannes Van Der Tuin","Hi. It's actually Johannes here pinch hitting for Ed. First and foremost, just a quick question on, it's really the logistics side of the house. It seems like there was a bit of a bump in MPLX EBITDA guidance. How much of that is throughput utilization in the Northeast kind of low capital intensive improvements?","Gary Heminger","Don, you want to take that?","Donald Templin","Yes, I don\u2019t think any of it was related to that I mean we\u2019re just seeing stronger demand as we especially are moving into '17, we feel great about the growth opportunities that we have. The logistics and storage business is performing really, really solidly and we have some very good potential growth opportunities on the gathering and processing side.","Johannes Van Der Tuin","Okay. Are there any regional differences or specific drivers you would like to highlight? ","Donald Templin","Well I would say that from our perspective, Marcellus probably has some very strong opportunities for us and we're seeing good volumes there, our major producer customer such as Antero and Range and EQT have been very bullish on volumes going into '17. And then, we see a lot of optimism and opportunities for us in the Southwest. Our capital budget probably will spend more money in the Southwest this year, than we do in the Utica region.","Johannes Van Der Tuin","Okay. That's very helpful. And then circling back to the border adjustment tax very quickly, out of curiosity, do have a sense as to either for yourselves or the industry as a whole what percentage of WCS is on long-term contract?","Gary Heminger","Well, I don\u2019t -- Mike, do you have any sense on WCS?","Mike Palmer","Well, on long-term contract, again going back to WCS, WCS is really it referrers to the heavy Canadian, WCS is a particular grade, but there are many heavy Canadian grades. Most of that crude oil coming out of Canada is either sold spot month-to-month or on 30 day or 60 day kind of evergreen contracts. So, it can be turned around fairly quickly. I think that regardless of the border tax, the Canadian crude, the heavy Canadian continues to grow and that crude will flow into the U.S. does that answer your question?","Johannes Van Der Tuin","I think it does more or less. So most of it is at the outside as kind of a 60 day contract?","Mike Palmer","Yes, most of that is -- [Multiple Speakers] ","Gary Heminger","The way you really have to look at this is that, there may be shippers who have long-term shipping commitments, but they are fulfilling that buying through the 30 day or 60 day evergreen window. So typically, we do not have a long-term shipping contract, like some those are going through the Gulf Coast, but the requirements were fulfilled year on a spot or 30 day, 60 day window.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Doug Leggate from Bank of America.","Doug Leggate","Gary, I realize that the process around Speedway is still ongoing. But I wonder if I could ask you to frame your latest thoughts on the viability of a separate retail business while still pursuing the fuels distribution drop. I know control and influence over fuels distribution is important to the refining business so I was wondering if you could talk about the viability at a very high level, albeit we're still waiting on the result of the outcome of the review by mid-year.","Gary Heminger","Sure Doug, as we said -- and I said on the January 3rd call and to be very specific, the viability will be one of the scenarios that we looked at, but we're doing the full and through review over all the scenarios that we really can consider at this time. You have to look counterparty risk, you have to look at the balance sheet of MPC, after you drop in the fuels distribution. You have to look at the credit profile. So we\u2019re going to look at all the different scenarios and I'm not going to lean one way or another. Our statement that we made on January 3, is just that, it's going to be a be full comprehensive review and then we'll determine by mid-year, what the outcome is.","Doug Leggate","kay. I thought it was worth a try but we will have to be patient. Gary, my second -- my follow-up question if I may, is unfortunately also on tax. It's a slightly different question though just in terms of how you are preparing or planning internally. And what I'm driving at is, you guys are obviously a fairly large cash tax payer. What scenarios are you running in terms of the current corporate tax potential changes -- the Brady Bill versus a 15% corporate rate and obviously the offsets from depreciation and so on? How are you trying to frame it? And it at the end of the day, if the tax rate fell, would you expect to see a material improvement, a reduction in your cash tax payment. That's really what I'm trying to get out. I'll leave it there. Thank you.","Gary Heminger","Sure Doug, Tim you want to take that?","Tim Griffith","Sure, Doug, I think the picture is still a little bit murky in terms of how all the potential reforms play out. I mean certainly the reduction and the proposed change in the corporate tax rate, either under the Republican blue print or under the Trump plan, that potentially 20% to 15%, obviously very helpful and could dramatically lower the cash tax burden of the company. There is also obviously a proposal to eliminate interest expense as a deduction there is a part of the proposal that incorporates immediate expensing of capital and then obviously the border tax adjustment.","There is really a pretty complicated set of potential changes that come out and we're trying to look at them, as clarity is offered in terms of what the net impact could be on the business and sort of where it plays out. I think a little bit though to handicap exactly what form it takes, but certainly there are elements to the tax reform that we think are extraordinarily positive, the lowering of the tax rate and the immediate expense are two areas that we're very supportive of, and what the offset from some of the other provisions could be, I think remains to be seen at this point.","It would be tough to handicap or indicate exactly where that\u2019s going to come up, but we're going to look at it pretty carefully. We certainly are entirely supportive of the notion of tax rates going down to make the U.S. more competitive on the global stage and we think those are very productive discussions and could be fantastic it's implemented, but I think it's tough to say at this point what the net impacts on a cash tax basis for us could be?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Cheng from Barclays. ","Paul Cheng ","I think the first question is for Tim. Tim, explaining that the quarter -- you were talking about the outer margin improvement sequentially due to two factors. One is there are stronger price realization than what the screens say and the other one is the true and the fiscal purchase call and small favor at both end of the benchmark. When you are looking at so far in the quarter, if those trends continue and getting more favorable or about the same or just getting less favorable?","Tim Griffith","Well we wouldn\u2019t give guidance necessarily on the trending into the first quarter. I mean I think we would highlight the third quarter from a -- sort of product price realizations on a number of fronts was what we thought to be unusually low from a product price realizations. A lot of those impacts did not occur again in fourth quarter, and less likely we would see those as we go forward. But we really would not provide guidance necessarily on how that will shake out in the first quarter, we'll see what the product markets look like.","As Gary indicated in environments where prices are rising, there is generally a little bit of the lag in terms of the catch-up on street prices which will have a product price realization impact, but again I think we would probably characterize third quarter as a little bit unusual relative to the realizations that we've seen over the last several years here.","Paul Cheng","Tim, in the fourth quarter do you have any sales of inventory?","Tim Griffith","I'm sorry, Paul?","Paul Cheng","In the fourth quarter, did you sell any inventory? Did you sell down anything from the inventory?","Tim Griffith","No. We actually had a slight inventory build into the fourth quarter. So there was no net liquidation of the inventory in the fourth quarter.","Paul Cheng","The second question is that, Gary, should we assume the MPLX 1.7 billion in the CapEx for this year is going to be fully funded? It's not going to require any support from MPC? And also, that the -- wondering, is there any additional color in terms of the drop down pace for this year? Are we going to do the 1.4 billion totally in this year, 250 million in the first quarter, should we assume, the other remaining, all get dropped down in the fourth quarter?","Gary Heminger","Well I'll take the last part of that first. As you know we've already turned over to the conflicts committee approximately 250 million, then we are working on what the optimum pace is for the balance of the year, that has not been -- we've not turned anything else over to the conflicts committee yet. That was expected, you would see something, maybe I wouldn\u2019t necessarily call it ratable, Paul, but maybe another chunk sometime in the third quarter or so just to spread it out a little bit over the year. Let me have Don take the budget and how he is going to fund that.","Donald Templin","Yes, Paul on the 1.7 billion. We would expect to fund that all with NPLX, without any support from the parent. You'll recall that in 2016 there was a real focus on capital preservation the balance sheet and the leverage metrics at MPLX were higher than we wanted them to be and what we were targeting, so we started out with about 4.7 times leverage at the beginning of '16. We're down to 3.4 times by the end of '16, and we're in a very comfortable position to be able to fund our organic growth through a combination of equity and debt.","Paul Cheng","Thank you. Gary, just want to make one comment about the retail. Given the pretty aggressive drop down and also the change of the GP, we just hope that maybe that -- maybe I'm wrong, but personally I think it is probably far better off for you to keep Speedway inside [ph] instead of spinning it off. Thank you.","Gary Heminger","Thank you, Paul. I appreciate your comments, always appreciate your comments.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Chi Chow from Tudor, Pickering, Holt.","Chi Chow","Regarding the acceleration of the Midstream drops, does the commitment to contribute all the assets this year suggest that you may forgo the private letter ruling on field distribution? And I suppose by extension, did the recent IRS regulation give enough comfort on dropping that field distribution business down as qualifying income?","Gary Heminger","Sure, Tim?","Tim Griffith","Yes, I think the regulations that are issued were we think positive, we don\u2019t see anything in them at our initial review that is suggestive of anything that would be a gaiting item to fuels distribution. Nonetheless, we still think its slightly that we will pursue a PLR just given the size of the earnings that represents and the impact it could have on the partnership.","So we're certainly, as Gary said, pleased to see them finally issued, we are working through them now and again think it's still likely that we would pursue a PLR just to make sure we've got high levels of comfort that we're not putting something in the partnership that would not be qualifying in nature and potentially threaten the partnership's QI treatment.","Chi Chow","Given your drop-down guidance, do you expect that PLR then soon, I would think? Sometime this year then? Is that what you're suggesting then with the guidance?","Tim Griffith","You never know exactly what the timing would be, and there could be a little bit of a backlog on some of the PLR's. But we will, again, we're working through it now and again with the likelihood of the PLR, expect that we would be submitting that in the near term and then again would wait for guidance back from treasury around that. And again, we're still hoping that this -- all of these events could unfold in 2017, but that\u2019s probably the wild card.","Chi Chow","Okay. Thanks. Second question, can you give us your thoughts on the potential change in the RIN obligation from refiners to blenders and what potential impact that might have on Marathon?","Gary Heminger","Well Chi, if you look at the how RIN prices have already come down from little bit over a dollar early in the fourth quarter to $0.47 today and that is not caused necessarily by concerns over the change in the point of obligation. I think it's really caused from the new administration taking over and stating that do not like this RIN requirement and the renewal volume obligation requirements.","As we've always said, the market can be balanced at just a little bit under 10% in ethanol. And refiners and blenders, we need the ethanol in order to be able to meet our octane requirements. So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a volume obligation versus RIN cost scenario, I think it's -- really we need to step back and look at, does this renewable fuel standard make sense in anyway going forward and my answer would be no, that the way it's set today on an absolute volume basis that needs to be changed to a percentage basis and if that happens, that will take care of all the RIN cost.","Chi Chow","Okay. Thanks. Gary, one other follow-up. If I read the IRS regulations correctly and I might not be able to, that was a hard document to get through, but it appears that they are ruling that the sale of RIN is considered a qualifying event. Does that change your thinking at all on possibly dropping RINs if they're still around into MPLX down the road?","Gary Heminger","Well, one of the things that we have always said. We do not see the RINs as affordable and so it will be very difficult to separate RINs and have a steady revenue stream from RINs. It's our belief that the RINs are in the crack spread and Mike, I'll turn it over to you to see if you see any different.","Mike Palmer","No, Gary. I wouldn\u2019t answer the question any differently than you just did.","Chi Chow","Okay, great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs.","Neil Mehta ","This is related to Speedway and retail. What drives the pickup in capital spending here in 2017 versus 2016 at Speedwell? And then, Gary, can you talk about how you think about the outlook for retail margins next year? Especially, if you're right that crude prices continue to grind higher?","Gary Heminger","I'll take the latter part, if crude prices and again it's the rate of the pace that crude prices were change, Neil. If there is slow and steady climb -- at your conference I outlined that we expect 2017 will end somewhere in the $60 to $65 range, is where we expect. So if it's a slow and steady climb into that level we'll be able to move the price to the street and really not effect demand much.","I think at your conference I stated that, if we look the elasticity for an increase at the retail price, you're looking about every $0.50 increase in retail price, you may have somewhere 1.5% to 2% change in demand and that may vary over regions. But I don\u2019t think it will have that much of an effect, we're expecting gasoline for the full year to be flat and diesel to be up a couple of percent for the year, and I'll let Tony talk about his capital budget for the year.","Tony Kenney","The biggest change in our capital is, we had a provision in our capital for 2017 to be able to comply with the euro pay MasterCard, Visa requirements at our dispensers at 2,700 locations. As you know that date has changed, we have the capital in there, it's not going to go away ultimately, sooner or later the U.S. is going to have to comply with the ability to take chip cards at our retail locations. So we're currently evaluating how we want to approach along the changed timeline, our investment in the changes that will make it retail. So most of that change is in regard to how we are going to go forward with the investments we need to make in accepting chip cards at our locations.","Neil Mehta ","I appreciate the comments. And the second is on Dakota Access. Can you just talk about where we are with in terms of the Dakota Access Pipeline and when you ultimately expect that crude to start flowing?","Gary Heminger","Okay, Don, do you want to take that?","Donald Templin","Sure, we're optimistic that especially with recent communications coming out of the administration around that pipeline, we\u2019re optimistic that that pipeline gets completed and gets completed quickly. And from an MPLX prospective, we are prepared to make our investment in that pipeline when the conditions to close or met. So with respect to their -- I would -- I think it's probably not our place to talk about sort of first oil and what not. But in terms of the transaction or the pipeline being completed, we know we're optimistic that will happen in the near future and we are well prepared for it.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Roger Read from Wells Fargo.","Roger Read","Gary, maybe just to come back to some of the retail questions here. You mentioned on the January 3 call, I think, in response to a question, that you felt that most of the RINs expense is in the crack. If that's the case, then as we think about retails EBITDA generation down the line, should we think about it as sands RINs price? And that it's maybe a little lower performer than what we've been used too?","Gary Heminger","No I don\u2019t think so, Roger. We don\u2019t have -- we're not showing any value at the Speedway side for RINs. Marathon is the blender of record for a lot of our volume, that goes into Speedway, but I think we're going to see any change in Speedway due to possible change in RINs, Tim do you see it any different?","Tim Griffith","No I think that\u2019s right, Gary. I mean ultimately Marathon is ultimately the blender, which is where this is getting picked up. So Roger, I don\u2019t -- there is really nothing with regard to Speedway segment earnings that has a RINs component. Obviously, the RINs reflected and pricing gets factored into the sort of transfer pricing that we look at within the business, but there is nothing really that would change, even if there were some separation in the future, which obviously remains to be seen.","Roger Read","Okay. So there is not an allocation risk, like you said, on the transfer pricing or anything?","Gary Heminger","No.","Roger Read","Okay. Perfect. And then, Gary, can you give us a little more detail on exactly who's doing the evaluation of Speedway for the spin and maybe what Marathon management's input is on that directly?","Gary Heminger","Yes Roger, as I stated we\u2019ve already have -- the Board has appointed a special committee and they are going down the path of their work with a financial advisor. We want to keep this as a very independent confidential study between the committees, so we\u2019re not going to announce at this time who the financial advisor is, we will overtime. And managements job like -- I'm not on the special committee, this is -- I felt that was important to keep this totally independent and we have five Board members making up this special committee, all member of the Board, but I'm not part of that.","Now management will prepare a lot of the data, that the committee and the advisors that are working on this. Management will compile a lot of data for the advisors to work on, but that's the management job, is just to compile data and to turn that over.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Dietert from Simmons.","Jeff Dietert ","We've tracked about 10 Bcf a day of new pipelines coming on in the Marcellus this year and another 10 Bcf a day in 2018. I was wondering if you could talk about how you expect this infrastructure to impact Northeast natural gas prices and opportunities for you in the Marcellus?","Gary Heminger","So, Don.","Donald Templin","Sure, Jeff. We are also tracking those individual projects and we are confident that many of those projects will ultimately be completed. From our perspective right now, I think the last sort of year has been -- we were very focused on supporting our producer-customers in allowing them or providing them opportunities to move NGLs out of the Utica Marcellus.","I would say from my perspective and I think based upon our discussions with producer-customers, residue gas movements out of the Utica Marcellus are an important part of their consideration around growth going forward. We would expect that overtime when you get those particular projects in place that the differential would probably come from -- get down to just maybe as $0.50 differential, which would really be a transportation cost differential.","And you well know Jeff, that in the summer time and other parts of the year, that differentials has been probably as much as a $1.50. So we would be improving the differential for our producers-customers by a $1 probably.","Jeff Dietert","Great. You've previously guided to about $7.5 billion of organic spending between 2016 and 2020. It sounds like your 2017 guidance is kind of in that fairway. Any biased higher or lower on your long-term organic spending outlook?","Donald Templin","I think we we're really confident about and optimistic about the opportunity to identify and to deliver on organic growth projects, Jeff. So I would say that if I had a bias, it would be on the higher side of that, not on the lower side of that.","Jeff Dietert","Thanks for your comments.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Benny Wong from Morgan Stanley. ","Benny Wong","Just wondering if you can give us an update on how you're thinking about your return of capital program this year and how you guys balance the pace of your buybacks stock with the visibility you might have with your drop-down plan.","Tim Griffith","Again, if we look back at '16, obviously, the buyback activity is always a function of sort of where we see operating cash flow in the business. But I mean, I think with the plans that are announced with regards to the drops and again the prospects and at least the potential for the full 1.4 to be dropped into MPLX in 2017.","Again, subject to our maintaining an investment grade credit profile and any adjustments we may need to make the capital structure to support that, the primary source of those funds is going to be in return of capital, so that will come in the formal potential considerations around the dividend and certainly for share buybacks which we think are the most efficient way to get the capital back.","So I think our expectations based on what's laid in front of us for '17 is that, capital return will be a much larger source its activity in '17 and again outside of any adjustments we make to debt will be the primer use of the cash.","Benny Wong","Thanks for that. Just a follow-up, unrelated, can you give us some color around the scale back of the capital at the STAR program? Is there items that you are no longer investing in or did you figure out some work around where you're able to obtain the same result without spending the money? Just trying to get a better understanding of the change there.","Gary Heminger","Ray you want to talk about what the reduction entails?","Ray Brooks","Sure, the STAR program, we continue to progress that and as Gary stated earlier, we're -- that\u2019s now viewed as $1.5 billion project. Still looks really good, just a little bit of color on that is, the STAR program actually has several components across the Galveston Bay TRD complex that we've looked at. And the first part of that, we actually pulled in in 2016 with -- when we looked at a resid de-asphalting unit. And we did a repurpose of that unit to actually run resid and then expanded it. And that had phenomenal return, it exceeded our expectations and so has generated more EBITDA then we previously projected.","And then it was three other components of that going forward. Looking at our sour crude unit and revamping that, expanding our recent hydrocracker and then also looking at just a diesel hydrotreater. At this point we are going to progress engineering on two basis of that, the crude unit revamped and resid hydrocracker revamp. And at this point not progressed any further on the engineering with the diesel hydrotreater. And that\u2019s simply based on looking at all the components on a stand along basis for their return and two projects exceed our refining total rate, well under the 20% and where the diesel hydrotreater did not. So that\u2019s just a little bit more detail on that project going forward. [Multiple Speaker].","Tim Griffith","And Benny, what Ray was talking about there, our expectation for 2016, the de-asphalting unit that was complete, we had expected about 80 million of EBITDA and now we're projecting that to be north of a 100. So a very, very strong increase due to the performance of the unit. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Corey Goldman from Jefferies. ","Corey Goldman","A quick follow up to Johannes' question on MPLX guidance. Don, can you comment what's included for DAPL in 2017 in the guidance?","Donald Templin","There is nothing included for DAPL in guidance.","Corey Goldman ","Okay. And if I remember correctly, you guys already pre-funded to CapEx for DAPL? Is that right?","Donald Templin","We have about 2.7 billion of liquidity currently, so we're in really -- with almost $300 million in cash, so we're in a very good position, sitting here in anticipation of that. ","Corey Goldman","Okay. That's helpful. And then a quick follow up. I'm assuming you guys have been in communication with rating agencies as it relates to some of the pro forma debt-to-EBITDA metrics following the drop downs. Can you give us some commentary on what we can expect it would take to retain IG for both levels there?","Tim Griffith","Sure, we've had dialogs and even with negative outlooks that Moody's and Fitch put out, more recently we have talked even beyond that. But I think we feel very comfortable that, anything that we do with regard to capital structure will be supportive for both entities. For MPLX what we've indicated as that, about a four times debt-to-EBITDA over the course of the time, we think makes sense, and is an appropriate amount of leverage for a partnership that's investment credit rated. You may have seen even yesterday S&P published that MPLX on a standalone basis is investment grade, that initial rating was based on the rating of appearance, so we think that's very encouraging.","And then again on the MPC side, we will continue to look at and evaluate, I think the initial reactions to the announcements with some concern about the increase in leverage and again what we've indicated is that we will take actions and adjust the capital structure as we need to, to support that profile overtime.","Even with all of the actions we're taking here I think it's worth reminding everyone that the amount of cash distribution that come back to MPC, even once we work through a GP buy-in, are going to be substantial and that will afford us a tremendous amount of financial flexibility to make adjustment as we need to, as well as continue to return capital.","So I think we're very comfortable that the investment grade credit profile for both the entities is something that we'll be able to maintain and we'll take action to, to support that overtime.","Corey Goldman","Okay. Any commentary on what appropriate cap structure could look like at MPC in terms of like an absolute number?","Tim Griffith","Well, I think if we look on sort of the net MPC basis which has also been an important part of the dialogue with the agencies and with fixed income investors we think that's probably sort of two times debt-to-EBITDA is probably in our comfort zone and would probably look to maintain things at or around those levels as we go forward?","Corey Goldman","Okay that' really helpful. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Spiro Dounis from UBS Securities.","Spiro Dounis","Just wanted to ask you on your decision to repay or prepay some debt last quarter, I'm just wondering where you're thinking about going forward? Did you make a decision again and could we see you scale that down over the next quarter? Thanks.","Tim Griffith","Well, again Spiro its Tim. I think the consideration around the debt paid in the third quarter again was just based on where we saw the full year earnings coming out for refining and just making sure that again we're calibrating the capital structure for the underlying earnings.","Again, any further adjustments to capital structure would really be based on sort of what we're doing with the drops and what things will look like in terms of the new debt taken out of MPLX and what that could mean for the consolidated picture. So it's something we'll look at, I don\u2019t think there is anything that compels us at point, but again it would really be a function of the drops and what the pro forma capital structures look like once this activity is completed. So it's something we'll continue to monitor, no specific guidance that we would provide right now other than, we're going to continue to watch very carefully and adjust the leverage situations at MPC as we think appropriate.","Spiro Dounis","Got it, thanks Tim.","Operator","Thank you. We have no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back to Lisa Wilson.","Lisa Wilson","Thank you, Jason. And thank you for your interest in Marathon Petroleum Corporation. Should you have additional questions or would like clarification on topics discussed this morning, Denise Myers, Doug Wendt and I will be available to take your calls. Thank you for joining us this morning.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference.

[Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Tim Griffith. Mr. Griffith, you may begin.","Timothy T. Griffith","Okay, thank you, Vivian. Welcome this morning to Marathon Petroleum's Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Webcast and Conference Call. The synchronized slides that accompany this call can be found on our website at marathonpetroleum.com under the Investor Center tab.","On the call today are Gary Heminger, President and CEO; Don Templin, Senior Vice President and CFO; Mike Palmer, Senior Vice President of Supply, Distribution and Planning; Pam Beall, Senior Vice President of Corporate Planning and Government and Public Affairs; and Tony Kenney, President of Speedway.","We invite you to read the Safe Harbor statements on Slide 2. It's a reminder that we will be making forward-looking statements during the presentation and during the question-and-answer session. Actual results may differ materially from what we expect today. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included here, as well, as in our filings with the SEC.","Now I'll turn the call over to Gary Heminger for opening remarks and highlights.","Gary R. Heminger","Thanks, Tim, and good morning, and thank you for joining our call. We are pleased to report strong results for the quarter with $672 million of net income in the third quarter. The efficiency, flexibility and optionality in our integrated downstream system enabled us to continue capturing opportunities in the markets we serve.","Our ability to supply refined products to the markets of greatest value continues to serve consumers and our shareholders well. Speedway, our company owned and operated retail system, achieved record results for the quarter. This was particularly impressive because they achieved these results while working to close the Hess retail acquisition, which occurred on September 30. This expansion makes Speedway the largest company-owned convenience store chain in the United States by revenue. Speedway's consistent ability to generate strong merchandise margins in the store will provide great synergies with a strong volume that Hess locations have historically experienced. We are confident we can leverage these potential synergies further as we introduce Speedway's focused merchandising approach to these 1,245 locations.","We're also pleased to welcome our new employees to the Speedway family and are eager to expand the relationships with the new customers along the eastern seaboard, who will come to know us under our Speedway brand. Return on capital continues to be an important element of our strategy and our activity in the third quarter underscores this enduring commitment. We returned a total of $442 million to our shareholders during the third quarter with $301 million coming in the form of share repurchases. Don will talk a little further about our capital return activity over the last 12 months, but we continue to have one of the highest effective capital return yields in our competitor group.","We are also announcing plans this morning to significantly accelerate the growth of MPLX. Initially coming in the form of larger drops into MPLX, our intent is to grow the partnership substantially and accelerate the annual distribution growth rate to average in the mid- 20% range over the next 5 years. As we evolve MPLX into a large cap diversified MLP, we will be focused on building size and scale in the partnership more rapidly in the near term. As a part of this acceleration, the MPC board has authorized the sale of the remaining 31% interest in pipeline holdings to MPLX. With the objective of growing MPLX's December 15 annualized EBITDA to at least $450 million.","We can turn to the graphic on Slide 4, where you can see this is about 3x the annualized EBITDA of MPLX for the third quarter of 2014. The roughly $80 million of EBITDA represented by the remainder of pipeline holdings is an important piece of that growth plan. And we would expect those earnings to become part of the MPLX earnings stream in the near term.","I wanted to provide some color on what has changed in our perspective and why we believe now is the right time to execute this acceleration strategy. Slide 5 provides a few of the elements, which have impacted our thinking and shift in strategy. Substantial growth in domestic oil and gas production and the tremendous midstream build-out in the U.S. create numerous opportunities where size and scale becomes strategically important to the midstream growth vehicles like MPLX. And it is fully our intent to participate in that development. The acquisition of the Hess Retail system has also expanded our opportunity set by providing an additional source of MLP qualifying income through the fuels distribution piece of the business. Adding the roughly 3 billion gallons, which have historically been part of Hess' business, to the volumes from MPC's total system, results and wholesale volumes totaling approximately 20 billion gallons. Attaching a reasonable margin to these volumes results in approximately $600 million in MLP qualifying earnings, which is in addition to the $1.1 billion we have discussed previously, bringing the total potential pool of eligible earnings to $1.7 billion.","Finally, we remain convinced the market has failed to recognize the total value of our enterprise, including the substantial contribution of MPLX to the business. Accelerating the growth of this highly valued portion of our business, as we are doing with Speedway, will highlight the tremendous value of our business that we believe is being missed in our current valuation.","With the amount of discussions surrounding the potential of crude oil exports from the U.S., I also want to provide some of our perspectives on these issues. Before we consider crude exports, it's important to acknowledge that we faced market distorting regulations and conditions both here and abroad that make it difficult and sometimes impossible for the free market to function. We also must keep in mind that the issue of crude exports is often based on the misperception that there is a glut of light sweet crude oil in the U.S.","We are in the market buying $5 billion worth of crude oil every month. And we do not see a glut of light sweet crude. In fact, there have been times during the year when producers could not deliver the volumes they committed to sell us. MPC and the U.S. refining industry, as a whole, is keeping pace with the supply. The studies that encourage lifting the crude oil ban tend to make the same flawed assumption, that U.S. refiners cannot and will not be able to process the increasing supply of light crude being produced in this country. And we disagree with these assumptions. We and others in the industry are making significant investments today that will allow us to process more light sweet crude in the medium and long term. In fact, all the projects announced by refiners and midstream companies to process light oil add up to more capacity than MPC's forecast of incremental shale crude growth.","We should also keep in mind that our country still imports up to 8 million barrels of crude oil per day. For decades, energy policy has been focused on energy security for our country. That vision can be a reality, but it can only be achieved with a vibrant refining industry to process the light crude oil we produced in this country into usable products. For that to happen, refiners need certainty. MPC remains an ardent supporter of free markets and the unrestricted movement of commodities, goods and services to the markets of greatest efficiency and value. We continue to support policy actions that move the U.S. economy in that direction, but we believe strongly that the underlying assumptions dictating any policy change must be based on facts, rather than the misperceptions about our industry.","To wrap up my opening comments, I'd like to highlight that MPC shareholders now own the largest refining, logistics and retail systems east of the Mississippi. Our successful retail segment has almost doubled in size and our midstream business, increasingly represented by MPLX, is well positioned to grow along with considerable developments in North American energy production. Our world-class refining system is characterized by top-tier assets, located in attractive geographic markets. The investments we are making in the business continue to build stable cash flow, highly valued businesses. And we are fundamentally committed to long-term value creation for our shareholders.","With that, let me turn it over to Don to review our financial performance for the quarter. Don?","Donald C. Templin","Thanks, Gary. Slide 6 provides earnings both on an absolute and per share basis. Our third quarter 2014 earnings were $672 million compared to $168 million in the third quarter of 2013. Third quarter 2014 earnings included pretax pension settlement expenses of $21 million, while the third quarter of 2013 included $23 million of comparable expenses.","Earnings per diluted share were $2.36 per share for the third quarter of 2014. We reported $0.54 per share for the same period last year. The bridge on Slide 7 shows the change in earnings by segment from the third quarter of 2013 to the third quarter of 2014. The primary driver for the change was the increase in refining and marketing segment income, which I will discuss shortly. Items not allocated to segments include $11 million related to acquisition costs for the Hess retail operations.","As shown on Slide 8, refining and marketing segment income from operations was $971 million in the third quarter of 2014 compared with $227 million in the same quarter last year. The change from 2013 was primarily due to higher product price realizations and the improved crack spreads, partially offset by higher direct operating costs. As indicated in the earnings walk, the higher LLS 6-3-2-1 blended crack spread had a positive impact on earnings of approximately $379 million. The blended crack spread was $8.70 per barrel in the third quarter of 2014, compared to $6.52 per barrel in 2013. The increase in LLS prompt versus delivered also had a favorable impact on earnings that was largely offset by backwardation in the market.","Direct operating costs increased quarter-over-quarter due to higher turnaround and maintenance costs as well as higher natural gas prices versus last year. The impact of higher product price realizations is reflected in the $548 million change in other gross margin. You may recall that the third quarter of 2013 product price realizations compared to spot market values were negatively impacted by the effects of renewable identification numbers or RINs. RIN prices averaged approximately $0.085 on a per E [ph] 10-gallon basis for the third quarter of 2013 compared to $0.05 per gallon in the third quarter of 2014. In addition, consistent with last quarter, we continued to see strong product price realizations in the third quarter of 2014.","Slide 9 provides a sequential earnings walk for our refining and marketing segment. The primary drivers for the decrease in income over the second quarter were lower crack spreads and higher refinery operating expenses.","The LLS 6-3-2-1 blended crack spread decreased $1.70 per barrel from second quarter, which reduced earnings by approximately $229 million. Refinery direct operating costs increased $62 million, primarily due to higher turnaround costs in the third quarter compared to the second quarter. Product price realizations are included in the other gross margin amount.","Turning to Speedway segment results on Slide 10. Income from operations was $119 million in the third quarter of 2014 compared with $102 million in the third quarter of 2013. Excluding a $6 million impact from the Hess acquisition, Speedway's segment income was $125 million, which as Gary referenced, represents a record quarter for the business. Speedway's light product gross margin was $22 million higher in the third quarter of 2014 compared with the same quarter last year as gross margin increased by $1.09 per gallon. Merchandise margin was $235 million in the third quarter of 2014 compared with $224 million last year. This $11 million increase was due to higher merchandise sales and merchandise margin percentage. The unfavorable $16 million other variants primarily relates to Speedway's operating expenses, which were higher in the third quarter of 2014, largely driven by an increase in the number of stores versus previous year levels.","On a same-store basis, gasoline sales volumes decreased 0.8%; and merchandise sales, excluding cigarettes, increased 4.8% in the third quarter of 2014 compared to the third quarter of 2013. Activity in October has been positive with a 1.2% increase in same-store gasoline sales volumes versus the similar period last year.","Slide 11 shows changes in our Pipeline Transportation segment income. Income from operations was $69 million in the third quarter of 2014 compared with $54 million in the third quarter of 2013. The increase of $15 million was primarily attributable to higher transportation revenue and pipeline affiliate income, partially offset by higher operating expenses, attributable mainly to the timing of pipeline maintenance and expenses related to MPLX's proposed Cornerstone pipeline project. $11 million of the $15 million increase in transportation revenue was attributable to the recognition of deferred transportation credits during the quarter. The remainder was primarily due to higher average tariff rates.","Slide 12 presents the significant drivers of changes in our cash flow for the third quarter of 2014. At June 30, 2014, our cash balance was just over $2.1 billion and we ended the third quarter with just under $1.9 billion of cash.","Operating cash flow before changes in working capital was an approximately $1 billion source of cash due to the strong financial performance in the third quarter. We borrowed approximately $2.7 billion in debt during the quarter to finance the $2.8 billion acquisition of Hess' retail operations. This is shown separately from the $736 million of capital spending in the quarter. As Gary highlighted, we continued delivering on our commitment to balance investments in the business with return of capital to our shareholders. We repurchased $301 million worth of shares and paid $141 million of dividends in the third quarter, continuing the regular returns of capital Gary alluded to in his remarks.","Slide 13 shows that at the end of the third quarter, we had $1.9 billion of cash and $6.3 billion of debt. With EBITDA of about $5.1 billion during the last 12 months, we continue to be in a very manageable debt position with leverage of 1.2x EBITDA and a debt-to-total capital ratio of 36%.","Turning to Slide 14. During the last 12 months, we generated $4.1 billion in cash from operations and nearly $2 -- $1 billion of free cash flow, excluding the Hess Retail acquisition. Over this period, we've returned $2.4 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases or approximately 1.2x our adjusted free cash flow.","During the third quarter of 2014, we purchased approximately 4 million shares for $301 million through open market repurchases. It is our intention to continue returning capital to our shareholders that is not currently needed to support the operational and investment needs of the business, and we continue to believe share repurchases are the most efficient way to do so.","Slide 15 provides our outlook for key operating metrics for MPC for the fourth quarter of 2014. We are planning for fourth quarter throughput volumes to be slightly less than the third quarter of 2014, but up compared to fourth quarter last year due to less planned maintenance.","Before I conclude my comments, I wanted to highlight one of the points Gary referred to earlier around the tremendous value contribution of MPLX to MPC. Slide 16 provides an illustration of the potential cash distributions for MPC's limited partner units and general partner interest over the next 5 years, assuming a 25% average growth rate of LP distortions. The chart on the right illustrates potential 2019 valuations using a range of recent market multiples for LPs and GPs. As I hope is clear from this illustration, the embedded value to MPC is considerable.","Now, I will turn the call back to Tim Griffith.","Timothy T. Griffith","Thanks, Don. As we open up the call for questions, we ask that you limit yourself to one question plus a follow-up. [Operator Instructions] With that Vivian, we're prepared to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Congratulations on the strong earnings, and thanks for the slides on MPLX visibility. Just a quick question, I'm sure I could do the math. But what type of drop-downs are you assuming, say on an annual run rate, say from here through to 2019 to drive this GP distribution, LP distribution growth?","Gary R. Heminger","Don, you want to handle that?","Donald C. Templin","Sure, Ed. We haven't given specific drop-down guidance. I guess, what we are showing here is that over that time period, we would expect to grow the LP distributions by an average compounded annual growth rate of 25% and as we showed in the slide deck, that has an even more powerful impact on the GP distributions through our IDR ownerships or our IDR cash flows. But we've not given a specific guidance on individual drop-downs or the timing of those.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And then on Slide 19, you've got the $1.7 billion of currently identified eligible MLP EBITDA sources, which presumably is part of MPLX as well as MPC. Maybe clarify whether that's held at the parent as opposed to the current MPLX EBITDA stream. And then does that include any growth or is all of the growth that you're obviously investing for on top of that $1.7 billion?","Donald C. Templin","Sure. The $1.7 billion, Ed, reflects the $800 million that we had originally pointed to at the time of the IPO of MPLX. So it would have included pipeline holdings as well, but there have been some additions there. Then there's been about $300 million of growth projects that we've identified and elaborated on over a period of time and that would include the investments in Sandpiper, Southern Access Extension, the condensate splitters. That broadly adds another $300 million. And then the fuels distribution is really incremental to that. For this purposes, we value that at approximately $600 million, which is 20 billion gallons at a $0.03 average.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And MLP of the fuels distribution business potentially?","Donald C. Templin","I mean those are MLP-qualifying EBIT. Those -- that's MLP-qualifying EBITDA. And it's -- our view that we want to continue to drive value for the MPC shareholders by making sure that we're maximizing that, which can be dropped into an MLP.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Very clear.","Gary R. Heminger","Ed, let me add to that. Our strategy was MPLX. And our whole midstream system is that, just like a production company looks at reserves, we want to keep a very strong reserve base of eligible assets that can be dropped into an MLP. But secondly, we plan to continue to have very strong organic growth from projects inside the company, very strong third-party growth as we continue to invest in the projects like Cornerstone that we've talked about. And then we've geared up and have been very active looking at projects in and around some of the production fields and other gathering type systems that could make sense to be bolt-ons to our system. So we're not just going to be limited. This is not a drop-down story, this is going to be an aggressive growth strategy. Yes, we see this -- the MLP business continues to consolidate.","Operator","And our next question comes from Doug Terreson from ISI Group.","Douglas Terreson - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Gary, this -- the retail transaction appears transformative for the business, for that business rather, as you indicate. And I have a couple of questions about that. First, how was the transaction financed? Meaning last quarter, I think we talked about available cash and debt. And then second, with your EBITDA per store much higher than Hess and the other peers too, you guys seem justifiably enthusiastic about the outlook for the combination. So now that it's closed and the team has had the opportunity to take a closer look, I want to see if you could spend just a minute on some of the financial or strategic opportunities that appear most obvious to the team and 1 to 2 guys are most excited about as you go through the integration process?","Gary R. Heminger","Sure Doug. Let me ask Don to take the first part, Don or Tim, to handle the financing piece. And I invited Tony to be on the call today, who runs all of Speedway. And I'll have Tony take the strategic and the synergistic questions. So Don?","Donald C. Templin","Sure. Doug, at the end of the third quarter, we had about $6.3 billion of debt and the increases of debt during the quarter were primarily in 2 areas. We had $700 million term loan and then we issued $1.95 billion of senior notes. So the transaction was largely funded with debt, but we also had available cash that we used.","Anthony R. Kenney","As far as the opportunity with the assets, what we see and you correctly pointed out, Doug, the difference in the EBITDA between the Speedway assets and the Hess assets, all of that is due to the difference in the performance inside the store. So from a light product perspective, Hess had always performed well on the volume and the margin outside. So the opportunity really is upgrading or enhancing the performance inside the store. And what really comes into play there is some of the elements that we bring in terms of some of our merchandising, and specifically, the loyalty program that we've had in place for over 10 years on the Speedway side. So we think while leveraging some opportunities in food service, general merchandise, in combination with partnerships with our key suppliers and consumer product companies, with our loyalty program is going to give us an opportunity to leverage the traditional Speedway performance into the Hess assets. So I think that's where the upside is. And along with that, we'll generate a number of synergies on those marketing enhancements.","Gary R. Heminger","Doug, just to let you know. We've been managing these for all of 30 days now. But what Tony and his team have learned is the administrative synergies that we have identified and some procurement type synergies, not getting into the marketing synergies that we expect due to the incremental merchandise sales. So just those that we identified, we're way ahead of what our first-year plan was and being able to capture synergies. So we've already identified significantly more than we had expected to achieve in the first year. So very pleased with how the transition has gone and how we're really starting up the operation.","Douglas Terreson - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","And Gary, we can just -- I can tell by your tone over the past several months, you've gotten more and more enthusiastic. It seems like this thing's really pulling it in a positive direction.","Operator","And our next question comes from Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Gary, great strategy shift this morning from midstream. It should begin to unlock some value for your shareholders. I know it's in line with your highest growth peers now. Can you discuss how you arrived at the new pace for distribution growth in the mid-20s over that 5-year period as you look at your potential? And then how does this stream of visible and less cyclical cash, less cyclical cash flow affect a potential pace on the buyback?","Gary R. Heminger","Sure. I'll take the first part and ask Don to talk about the potential buyback. We've been studying this strategy for quite some time. And with the Hess acquisition, this has always been part of our strategy with this acquisition that those assets should be able to be throw off eligible-type earnings. So we get -- got this transaction complete. And over this same period of time, we were doing this strategic study to determine what's the best way forward. And as I said in my speech that we believe now is the time. We believe first of all, we've recognized a significant underperformance, if you will in pull through that the market has not recognized in the assets of the company. And the question of how committed are we going to be to growing this MLP? I think this shows clearly how committed we are to growing this MLP. We've always been committed. It's just when was the right time to be able to bring all this together. So with the addition of the Hess wholesale fuels distribution, I'm talking about on top of the other 17 billion gallons that we already had, this was the perfect timing, we believe, to be able to highlight this and really to be able to communicate to the market how much value is underlining the value of MPC, but how fast we can grow MPLX and how fast therefore the GP should grow and we should get that pull-through back into the marketplace. And Don, do you want to handle the use of cash?","Donald C. Templin","Sure. Evan, I think that we will continue to view the cash that would come back to us from both the drops and the distributions and the ownership of the LP units similar to how we do it now. I mean we are and have been very committed to achieving a balance between investing in the business and returning capital to our shareholders. And we would expect that, that will certainly continue. One of the things that is nice about having these drops is that you will generate cash that can continue to be redeployed in the increased growth and build-out of the midstream infrastructure. And while we would like, to the maximum extent possible, have projects funded initially from MPLX, there may be times, or will be times when a project may be bigger or the timeline over the cash profile might be longer than we can -- that makes sense for us to have at an MPLX initially. And we'll use that cash to invest in midstream, hold it at MPC until it is MLP-ready and then drop it in. So I view this as being a continual cycle here of getting cash that we can return to our shareholders, but also getting cash that we can continue to invest in the midstream and infrastructure build-out.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","MLP clearly increases that, that cash amount. Maybe add some color specifically. I mean do you anticipate the drops that you laid out for cash or units or a combination of both. And secondly, do you see structures, other than taking units, that allow a capital gain deferral for some of your other MLPs have employed?","Donald C. Templin","I think we will, for every drop that occurs Evan, we will certainly evaluate the tax implications of those. And we will, I think, continually balance making sure that we're doing them in the most tax efficient way with also making sure that we're meeting the business needs of MPC and MPLX. And if there's a need for cash, either to return it to shareholders or to invest in the business, we're more likely to take cash. If there is an opportunity to do something in a tax-efficient way, we might end up taking back units or more units. So I think it will be a fact and circumstance-driven decision versus sort of a philosophical or a policy around how everyone is going to occur.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","That's great. Maybe one last one, if I may. It's somewhat related, but on your announcement that you and your partners are evaluating options for Capline. I mean while preliminary, do you see the need for reverse pipe of that size to the Gulf Coast? Or do you envision some coordinated project that would -- with other logistics that would move Canadian crudes into that Chicago market? Any preliminary thoughts there on how that might work out?","Gary R. Heminger","If you really look at this, this is just an announcement of a preliminary study. If you look at the Louisiana side of the refining sector, refining corridor in the Louisiana or Gulf Coast, you do not have an efficient manner to be able to get heavy crude down there. The Houston side of the Gulf is in great shape on pipelines. And we expect keystone will eventually be approved and we'll even be in better shape. So therefore, it opens itself the question, why not improve the logistics to the Gulf Coast. So this isn't a study to look at just Chicago. You look at the volumes that go south to north, and we were always going to need a good supply source from south to north to be able to feed the PADD II refineries. So this is a study to determine long term, does it makes sense to look at Capline in a different type of operation than it is today. And all of the things that you mentioned are on the table as we do this very detailed analysis.","Operator","And our next question comes from Paul Cheng from Barclays.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just want to say thank you for adding those information about MPLX into your presentation, really helpful. Maybe I have a couple of questions. First, on MPLX, Don, from a financial standpoint, can you tell us that what is the kind of comfortable level the balance sheet could support in terms of whether it's an outside acquisition or that an internal acquisition dropped down on a per year basis? I mean is it a $1 billion a year? Or that you think it is going to be -- the balance sheet will be able to support bigger?","Donald C. Templin","Well, I think the way we would look at the balance sheet, Paul, is by making sure that we have a good balance between issuing equity and maintaining a debt profile that we want to be investment grade. And so the way we think about investment grade profile would be to have a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of probably somewhere, managing to somewhere, no more than sort of 4x. So that's -- that is how we will look at and evaluate opportunities. And in a growing environment, when MPLX is growing quickly, our view around that 4x debt-to-EBITDA would be on sort of the last quarter annualized or a run rate EBITDA versus the last 12 months, just because you don't want to get yourself into a situation where you're getting -- you're incurring debt sort of at an acquisition date, but not giving any benefit for that EBITDA. So when I say 4x, it's really around a run rate EBITDA number. And we feel comfortable doing that because we believe that when something finds its way into MPLX, it is a revenue stream that's largely certain. And there won't be a lot of -- there's not a lot of volatility around commodity risk or something like that.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Maybe the second question is that for, maybe either Tony or Don, do you have a number that you can share after the Hess acquisition on the pro forma basis, the impact to your Speedway gross margin on the field and gross margin on the C store [ph] look like? And also Don, do you have the inventory market matter [ph] in excess of book and working capital and the long-term debt for the MPC C Corp level?","Donald C. Templin","So long-term debt is 6., just under $6.3 billion. The excess of fair value over book value for inventory is $5 billion, and working capital is $2.5 billion.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","The $2.5 billion is including cash or not including cash?","Donald C. Templin","It is including cash.","Anthony R. Kenney","Paul on the enhancements, I think what I would say is that with the synergies, and the synergies will cut across both the existing Speedway assets as well as the Hess assets, will enjoy some uplift in our gross margin inside the store from realizing those synergies. I don't have a specific number on that. We know what we've said publicly in terms of all of the marketing synergies in the deal. Year 3 run rate is $70 million in total, but I can't give you a split between how much of that is on the Speedway side and the existing Hess assets.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Tony, do you have a pro forma for the fourth quarter in terms of actual, if we just say, if you have closed the deal at June 30 and just 1 year, what will be the reported fuel margin and the C [ph] store margin in the third quarter, so that we can use it as a baseline to project forward?","Anthony R. Kenney","Paul, I don't have that number. I've really not done any work around that. We're really just now beginning to integrate the 2 financial systems to understand exactly what that would look like, but that's all I could say about that now.","Gary R. Heminger","And Paul, as you know, we've never given forward guidance.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I just want to look at say on the actual -- on a pro forma basis, what is the baseline we should use?","Gary R. Heminger","Let us continue to get this transition under our belt and we'll see what we can prepare.","Operator","And our next question comes from Brad Heffern of RBC Capital Markets.","Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Sort of attacking on previous question slightly different way. Looking at the acceleration in MPLX. How much of that is due to faster drops? And then you also mentioned potential consolidation in midstream. Are you assuming some incremental acquisitions in order to sort of triple the EBITDA there?","Donald C. Templin","So Brad, this is Don. When we did the modeling there, that is a projected EBITDA growth rate. And that was a projected EBITDA growth rate or distribution growth rate that we can easily support with the portfolio of assets that we currently have. Now that doesn't mean that we're -- in fact, we're very focused on growing organic projects, identifying the next big opportunity, identifying potentials for M&A that might make sense and be strategic to us, but we're very comfortable that we can support the growth rate that we've identified there solely with assets that exist at MPC. But knowing that we will certainly, over time, grow MPLX in other ways and that would be through organic means and through M&A.","Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, thanks. And talking about Capline, is that in the EBITDA drop inventory number you typically provide? And if ultimately it was reversed, do you think that, that would have a substantial impact on the drop to you going forward?","Gary R. Heminger","Don, you want to take the first part and I'll take the second.","Donald C. Templin","Yes. So currently we haven't indicated actual EBITDA from those types of assets, but the EBITDA from Capline right now would be not a significant number. And so to the extent there was a reversal and it was more fully utilized, I'm assuming that there would be incremental EBITDA that could accrue from that. But in terms of the numbers that we're showing here, there's a lot of other contributors that are probably more meaningful to that EBITDA number, Brad.","Gary R. Heminger","Right. Brad, the last part is it's too early to be able to put a forecast, but heavy crude from the Canadian region was available. There's substantial demand in the Louisiana refining corridor. Most of those refineries from Baton Rouge through Garyville and on are heavy refineries. So I think there could be a lot of volume that, that can go that direction someday. So we don't have any pro formas on what that is yet, but I think it could be a significant value.","Operator","And our next question comes from Paul Sankey from Wolfe Research.","Paul I. Sankey - Wolfe Research, LLC","Did you talk about the Garyville hydrocracker expansion? I guess we were wondering whether there would be a decision on that this year and if the CapEx would then be starting next year.","Gary R. Heminger","Yes. Paul. We have not discussed that yet. We will -- our plan that we've always been on schedule with is to make that decision sometime around end of the year to the first part of next year. We're just wrapping up our front-end engineering and design work that then drives all of the capital investment type final numbers. So we won't make that decision again until the end of the year. If we were to go forward, the in 2015, the capital would not be that significant in 2015 because it takes a -- we would finish up the detailed design and engineering and start some of the land excavation work and piling it in 2015 and '16. So really the bigger part of that CapEx will not come for a couple of years yet.","Paul I. Sankey - Wolfe Research, LLC","Understood Gary. Gary, on global oil markets, do you expect OPEC to cut production in the November meeting.","Gary R. Heminger","Well, I'm not close enough to OPEC to be able to give you a good answer on that. But the discussions so far, they've been very clear that they're not going to cut production this time. When you look though, a lot of analysis has been put out on countries such as OPEC. It would suggest that the majority of the countries need a higher price than is in the marketplace today in order to be able to support the budgets that they have. So I see -- I expect that the market's going to be continue to be volatile on the front end here. But based on lot of the discussion that's been going on, I would be surprised to see that there would be a change in the direction that has been stated so far.","Paul I. Sankey - Wolfe Research, LLC","Thanks. And then finally, the bigger issue is demand. We just heard Tom O'Malley saying he thought that yesterday's draws in inventories of products were extraordinary bullish for refiners. Can you -- it seems that the distillates market may be a lot stronger than people realize globally. Would that be -- would you agree with that? Could you also, just talk about you -- I would ask you this, firstly about your exports distillates and gasoline; and secondly, about the demand that you're seeing across your networks.","Gary R. Heminger","Okay. Mike Palmer, do you want to handle the majority of those questions?","C. Michael Palmer","Sure, Gary. Paul with regard to our exports, the third quarter was still very strong. I guess we probably see just a little bit of weakness in Europe and a lot of strength in Latin America. But we're still, if those record kind of level of exports and don't have reason to believe that ought to change.","Donald C. Templin","And Paul, this is Don. The actual volumes were 299,000 barrels per day for the third quarter for exports. About 2\/3 of that was distillate. The remainder was predominantly gasoline.","Paul I. Sankey - Wolfe Research, LLC","And gasoline demand coming back with low prices in your networks?","Donald C. Templin","I think what we're seeing in October was that we're up slightly over 1% same-store gasoline demand.","Operator","And our next question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I'd like to dig in a little bit to how the balance, if I may, on the MLP growth impacts the cost base of the refining business. It's obviously, we've had a very strong refining environment with the benefit of crude spreads and so on. But if we had to go back to a normalized level, let's assume it was not as high as we are currently. I'm just trying to understand what the priority is in the MLP drop-downs and the context of what it means for the cost base for the refining business. So I wonder if you could help me with that, starting first with the $450 million run rate? What does that mean for the cost basis of the refining business?","Gary R. Heminger","Great question, the way we have always modeled things, the way we've always done our business, Doug, is we've tried to transfer our prices at market. And the way we value those assets are all at market. So I don't think it changes from a market competitive standpoint. It changes any of those dynamics. Don, you were going to add something?","Donald C. Templin","Doug, I wasn't exactly sure I understood what your question was around the sort of the impact on refining.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Let me try a different way, Don. So previously, before today, you talked about I think $1.1 billion of EBITDA, $300 million organic and $800 million within the existing system, so when you transfer that ratable EBITDA to the MLP, one has to imagine someone's paying for that. And that of course is, I'm guessing, is going to be a cost within your refining business. So I'm trying to understand where the transfer of cost takes place? And what it does to the base ratable stable earnings within the refining business, if you like. You see what I mean? Am I explaining that well or no?","Donald C. Templin","Yes, so in terms of the EBITDA, clearly, that is embedded now within MPC on a consolidated basis. I mean one of the things that ends up happening is that, if you drop those assets down, you get paid a reasonable multiple already for those assets. And then at MPC, we continue to participate in a portion of that EBITDA stream, just based upon our LP ownership. So our view around the kind of a drop-off in EBITDA or the cost transfer, I guess that you're speaking with, is that it, it is not that significant. We get proceeds back to MPC, we will evaluate how to deploy those proceeds. And sometimes they may end up getting deployed into capital projects at refining that continue to grow the refining EBITDA. A good example, would be, as we continue to consider the ROUX project. So to me, I think this is all about a growth story rather than a story where we're just moving EBITDA from sort of one legal entity to another legal entity. This is about an opportunity to grow MPC and MPLX to be able to take advantage of the capital markets in order to be able to grow both our midstream, but the rest of our business.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. I guess I'll take the details offline. I understand the IDP or the IDR benefit and all the rest of it. What I'm just kind of trying to wrestle with what happens in a down cycle for refining when you have got the added cost base. We can take it offline. My follow-up is that I may have missed this in your prepared remarks. On Slide 8 of the presentation, can you just quantify again, what the other gross margin, the of $548 million, what was that and what was absolute in the quarter?","Donald C. Templin","Yes. We did not -- the absolute in other gross margin for the quarter -- just 1 second here. It's -- the absolute is $501 million, which was on our appendix, Slide 26.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","What is that?","Donald C. Templin","It's a combination of a number of things would be in there. That includes our product price realizations, it includes refinery gain, it includes our purchase for resale activity. We have not given any color on sort of the individual components.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. I want to just go back very quickly, the $1.7 billion, is that inclusive of the original $1.1 billion or is that added to that? I assume it's inclusive of.","Donald C. Templin","The $1.7 billion is the original $800 million plus $300 million of projects, which would be SAX, Sandpiper, Condensate Splitters and what not. And then the $600 million of fuel distribution.","Operator","And our next question comes from Phil Gresh of JPMorgan.","Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First question was a clarification. I know you're talking about the uses of cash from the acceleration plan. With the leverage levels where they are, you've had a step function change with the Hess deal. Are you anticipating that we're just going to keep it at this new level moving forward? Or would some of that cash actually be used to kind of slowly delever the balance sheet for other opportunities, just your thinking around that?","Donald C. Templin","Phil, our expectation is that we would continue to -- we're committed to maintaining an investment grade credit profile. So we would maintain -- would not go past a leverage model that would put pressure on that, but we're very comfortable with where our balance sheet is currently on a leverage basis. And we think it has allowed us to access some attractively priced capital.","Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Got it. Okay. Second question is just on the gasoline markets. We're seeing a divergence in the fundamentals in the Gulf Coast cracks versus where we're seeing in the East Coast and Mid-Continent. So I'm just wondering if you could give a little bit of color what you're seeing there? And how you might expect that to play out in the fourth quarter?","Gary R. Heminger","Mike?","C. Michael Palmer","Yes. Gary. So Phil, I guess, what I would say is that, if you look at the gasoline market, it's kind of by region for most of the year. What you've really seen, I think, is that the Chicago area, the New York has been stronger than the Gulf Coast. And I think certainly, within the Gulf Coast, there is a lot more refining capacity to make gasoline than the region can absorb. And that gasoline must be exported to the other markets. And I think that's what you're seeing. So I think, from a macro standpoint, that's going to continue to be the case. The other thing that certainly happens is that during periods, during quarters, you get mini events that take place. You get pipeline issues, you get the refinery, planned maintenance as well as unplanned maintenance, and that can have a pretty significant impact on a specific region. And certainly, that's been the case. We've seen some refinery downtime in the Midwest region over the last several months, I think, that's contributed to margins.","Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Understood. Thanks for the color. Last question is just on the retail side. I appreciate the color on how things are going early days. Would you say that kind of for now, you guys are mostly just focused on the integration of Hess as opposed to organic store openings and\/or additional acquisitions within the retail business. I know you talked about Hess slowing the pace of your organic store openings. But it sounds like things are going well. So just wondering the growth side of that story.","Anthony R. Kenney","As far as the integration, that's our #1 focus. But backing up from there, let me just say this, what was important was, as we transferred ownership and operations from Hess to Speedway, the most important thing was making sure there was no impact to the customer, and I think we have accomplished that. So as we move forward from there, then as day 2 and beyond progresses, we're looking to be able to integrate both the Hess and Speedway operations to take advantage of the synergies that are available there and the capital that we'll spend this year, as far as new store openings, we did have an organic growth plan in the base Speedway business and we're continuing to execute on that. We're probably going to complete approximately 60 new store or rebuild openings this year. So we're balancing the focus on both the existing or the base Speedway business as well as the integration, the reidentification and then eventually some remodeling of some of the Hess assets to bring the entire chain together under a common brand.","Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Got it. Okay. And then on the acquisition side of things?","Anthony R. Kenney","We don't comment on what we may or may not want to do in that arena. I think it's going to be opportunistic. We'll look at things, but beyond that, probably don't have much I can add to that.","Operator","And our next question comes from Ryan Todd from Deutsche Bank.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","A couple of follow-up questions. I know it's kind of theoretical at this point, but on Capline, if the decision were to be made following the study about a potential reversal, what would be the timing in terms of how long it would take to get that done?","Gary R. Heminger","Ryan, it's just way too early to look at that, including in the study. First of all, they're going to do a market study, supply demand study. Then if it would point towards -- let's look at from an engineering standpoint, what it would take. We've already done some work, but a lot of hydraulic analysis work needs to be complete. So we're not far enough yet that I can give you a good timeframe.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And another follow-up on the retail side on the MLP and the retail eligible income. The question is I think it sounds like the EBITDA is purely kind of throughput volume x margin on the retail business. Does that include at all any of the rental income or leasing income from the stations? And then on the -- would we expect, if this were eventually to make its way into an MLP, would it be a stand-alone MLP? Or would you drop it into MPLX?","Gary R. Heminger","Don?","Donald C. Templin","The calculation is truly a volume times $0.03 per gallon. So we're primarily focused in that analysis on -- or that estimation on refinery to rack volumes. It does not include anything that would be incremental to that. So it's 20 billion gallons times $0.03. With respect to sort of plans for how it gets dropped, when it gets dropped, we are going to get continue to evaluate the timing and what makes sense. And I guess, our view is, it's just increased our portfolio of opportunity. The opportunity set is now bigger and gives us even more confidence in our ability to really grow MPLX, so that we can participate in this midstream infrastructure build-out.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And I guess, if I can just one final one actually on the refining business. Your gasoline yield was down to probably the lowest level that we've seen in quite a while in the quarter. Is this a sustainable trend? And I mean I think you were at 45% yield in the quarter. And if we're moving in that direction, can you continue to reduce that yield and shift more towards distillate further going forward? Or how should we think about that going forward?","Richard D. Bedell","This is Rich Bedell. I think probably that's more a reflection of some of the turnarounds that were going on in the process units that were offline for turnaround than anything else. There hasn't really been a fundamental shift in our yields. We have been increasing our distillate percentage through some of the projects and that will continue on into some next year, but nothing that would have swung those volumes other than maybe turnarounds.","Operator","And our next question comes from Roger Read from Wells Fargo.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I'd like to come back a bit on the Capline. Can you walk us through the ownership structure and what the decision-making process is there? I understand, too early to say what the timing would be and all that, but how exactly are decisions made there, what's your influence is , et cetera?","Gary R. Heminger","Right. There are 3 owners BP, Planes and Marathon. And in order to be able to make a change of service, like this study is going to be done, it takes all 3 to approve such change.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then coming back to the other gross margin that Doug asked about earlier. Obviously, it was a big component of the Q2 out performance and Q3's overall performance. Any guidance you can give us at this point? I know you're not big on guidance, but maybe some help you can give us on how to think about that kind of performance as we look forward, not just to the fourth quarter, but also to next year, is there some seasonality to that number? Is it just a function of market conditions at any given moment? Maybe any color you can offer us on that would be helpful?","Donald C. Templin","As Roger, I guess, what I would say is both the second quarter and this quarter, the comparable periods last year included some noise around sort of the RIN impact on the market. You'll recall that we use market indicators that start with the 6-3-2-1 crack and we try to build to it. One of the reasons that we wanted to show and have been showing a sequential walk is to maybe give a little bit of color or maybe the absence of a really big green bar or change quarter-to-quarter would suggest that maybe the unusual circumstances existed last year as opposed to the unusual circumstances existing this year.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","So if we were to compare to 2012, we might not see such a large green bar. Is this the other way to think about that?","Donald C. Templin","That might be -- I have not done that, but that might be another way to do it. We are also growing our portfolio and our sort of reach every year as well. But I think '13 was a little bit abnormal, and so that's why you're seeing maybe the big differences.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then the last question on the acceleration and the MLP, whether it's internal drop-downs or something on the other side. What would you look at in terms of acquisitions? I mean, should we think of something that's a fairly significant step out? Or is it -- you want to kind of stick close to your knitting? Or you want to something close to the assets you already hold?","Gary R. Heminger","Roger, it's too early to -- and we don't comment on M&A activity, but what I said in my script was, we expect to be a very big player in the -- for the development of the North America oil and gas transformation and renaissance. So and that includes all liquids, not just oil and refined products, but also the natural gas and LPG markets. So we have the capacity, it's from an operating and engineering standpoint, to operate in all of those different businesses. So we plan on being right on the forefront of that development.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","All right. Casting a wide net and now we are all going to be MLP analysts as well.","Gary R. Heminger","There you go.","Operator","And our last question comes from Allen Good from MorningStar.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] I'm not showing any further questions.

My name is Katie and I will be operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions]. I will now turn the call to Lisa Wilson, Director of Investor Relations.","Lisa Wilson","Thank you, Katie. Welcome to Marathon Petroleum Corporation's second quarter 2016 earnings webcast and conference call. The synchronized slides that accompany this call can be found on our website at Marathonpetroleum.com under the investors center tab. On the call today are Gary Hemminger, Chairman, President and CEO; Tim Griffith, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and other members of MPC's executive team.","We invite you to read the Safe Harbor statements on slide 2. It is a reminder that we will be making forward-looking statements during the call and during the question-and-answer session. Actual results may differ materially from what we expect today. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included there as well as our filings with the SEC.","Now I will turn the call over to Gary Hemminger for opening remarks and highlights.","Gary Heminger","Thanks, Lisa. And good morning to everyone. Thank you for joining us. If you'll please turn to slide 3. Earlier today, we reported second quarter earnings of $801 million or $1.51 per diluted share. Earnings included net benefit of $0.44 per share primarily related to a reversal of our lower cost of market inventory valuation reserve. All segments of the business performed well in the second quarter. Earnings benefited from improving crack spreads, robust product demand entering this summer driving and asphalt season, strong retail margins and the inclusion of Mark West in our consolidated results.","The refining and marketing segment delivered strong results despite less favorable operating and market conditions during the quarter. Our integrated Seven refinery and extensive logistics network allows us to capture advantage feedstock and other raw materials as well as enhanced price realizations to our refined product distribution system. Our unique asset mix and flexibility position us to optimize operations even during disruptions such as those caused in the second quarter by the Canadian wildfires and refinery outages.","Speedway continued its outstanding performance with a record second quarter segment income. In addition to higher light product sales volume and margins, the business delivered higher merchandise margins in the quarter. This improvement is consistent with a strategy to drive marketing enhancement opportunities. We're pleased with our progress in realizing synergies across the Speedway network earlier than originally planned and believe this will be a continuing source of value to the business. Speedway provides significant and growing stable cash flow, complementing MPC's integrated refining and distribution network. Speedway is MPC's most ratable distribution channel, provides a solid base to enhanced overall supply reliability and allows us to optimize our entire refining, pipeline and terminal operations.","The midstream segment, including MPLX's financial and operational results, also delivered solid performance during the quarter. MPLX remains on target to achieve its 2016 distribution growth guidance without the need for additional dropdowns from MPC during the year. During the quarter, MPLX expanded its midstream presence in the Southwest with the completion of its Hidalgo gas processing complex in the Delaware Basin, where utilization is exceeding initial expectations. Construction of the Cornerstone Pipeline is also progressing as planned, with the completion expected in the fourth quarter.","Cornerstone Pipeline is designed to provide MPC's Canton, Ohio, refinery with a direct supply of condensate out of the Marcellus and Utica regions and to supply natural gasoline to our Midwest refineries. As commodity prices recover, optimism is growing among MPLX's producer customers. And with world-class midstream assets located in some of the best resource plays in the country, MPLX is well-positioned to capitalize on an exceptional set of opportunities along the entire hydrocarbon value chain.","As we enter the third quarter, both heavy and light Canadian crude differentials have returned to more favorable levels as the impact of the Canadian wildfires subsided. Canadian heavy production continues to grow and we expected good values throughout the third and fourth quarters. Additionally, we expect to continue to see spot opportunities in foreign sweet and sour cargos. The regional diversity of our refining assets also enabled us to benefit from access to the export market. We believe we have the right assets in the right locations, with 60% of our crude oil refining capacity in the Gulf Coast and 40% in the Midwest.","We also expect to complete the first phase of our multi-year STAR program at the Galveston Bay refinery in Texas City next month. This phase will revamp and expand the resid hydrocracker by 12,000 barrels per day, improving the profitability of the refinery by increasing the conversion of lower-value residual oil into gas oil. EBITDA contribution from this initial phase is expected to average approximately $80 million per year.","During the second quarter, we returned $221 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In addition, on July 27, our Board of Directors announced a 12.5% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.36 per share. The 29% compound annual growth rate and our dividend since MPC became an independent Company demonstrates our continuing confidence in the cash flow generation of the business. It also demonstrates our long term focus on capital returns while maintaining an investment-grade credit profile and strong liquidity throughout the cycle. The efficiency and flexibility of our integrated retail, logistics and refining system drives the diversified earnings power of the business and we remain encouraged by the long term prospects of our business and the value proposition for our investors.","With that, let me turn the call over to Tim to walk you through the financial results for the quarter. Tim?","Tim Griffith","Thanks Gary. Slide 4 provides earnings on both an absolute and per-share basis. MPC's second quarter 2016 earnings of $801 million or $1.51 per diluted share, were down slightly from last year's second quarter earnings of $826 million. Gary referred to the $0.44 per-share net benefit in the quarter which included a benefit of $0.47 per diluted share related to the reversal of the lower of cost to market inventory valuation reserve and a charge of $0.03 per diluted share related to the impairment of one of MPLX's equity investments.","The chart on slide 5 shows by segment the change in earnings from the second quarter of last year. As mentioned, earnings were impacted during the quarter by a $385 million pretax benefit to fully reverse our lower cost of market reserve. $360 million of this benefit is included in the refining and marketing segment and $25 million is reflected in the Speedway segment. After adjusting for this benefit, earnings were down approximately $410 million over the same quarter last year, largely attributable to lower income from our refining and marketing segment, higher interest expense resulting from the MarkWest merger and the equity impairment I just mentioned. These negative impacts for the quarter were partially offset by higher income contributed by our midstream and Speedway segments and lower income taxes.","Turning to slide 6, our refining and marketing segment reported income from operations of almost $1.1 billion in the second quarter, compared to the income from operations of $1.2 billion in the same quarter last year. The decrease, after excluding the $360 million benefit from the LCM reversal, was primarily due to weaker crack spreads in both the Gulf Coast and Chicago and narrower LSWTI differential, less favorable market structure and higher costs related to turn our activity in the second quarter. Partially offsetting these negative impacts was an improvement in the sweet\/sour differential in the quarter. The lower blended crack spread had a negative impact on earnings of approximately $502 million. The blended crack spread was $2.58 per barrel lower at $7.66 per barrel in the second quarter of 2016, compared to $10.24 per barrel in the same period last year.","R&M segment income benefited $227 million by an approximately $2 per-barrel widening of the sweet\/sour differential as well as higher sour runs in the quarter versus last year. The LSWTI differential narrowed $3.25 per barrel from $4.99 per barrel in the second quarter of 2015 to $1.74 per barrel in the second quarter of this year. This had a negative impact on earnings of about $100 million based on the WTI linked crudes in our slate.","The market structure contango effect during the quarter is reflected in the $78 million unfavorable variance on the walk and relates to the difference between the product crude prices we use for market metrics and the actual crude acquisition costs in the quarter. The $70 million increase year over year in direct operating costs relates primarily to higher turnaround activity in the quarter versus last year. Turnaround in major maintenance costs increased $0.50 per barrel or over $80 million, compared to the second quarter of 2015. The higher turnaround activity also impacted total throughputs which were 62,000 barrels per day lower than the second quarter last year. Capture rate for the quarter was negatively impacted by the effect of rising crude oil prices on wholesale and secondary product margins, narrower crew differentials and tighter differentials on feedstocks relative to crude.","Turning to our other segments, slide 7 provides a Speedway segment earnings walk versus the same quarter last year. As Gary mentioned, Speedway had a record second quarter earnings of $193 million which were $66 million higher than the second quarter 2015. Light product margin was a significant contributor to this increase along with higher merchandise gross margin and the $25 million reversal of Speedway's lower cost of market inventory reserves in the quarter.","Gasoline and distillate margins were about $0.02 higher than in the second quarter last year at $0.155 per gallon, while volumes were up 33 million gallons quarter over quarter. On a same-store basis, gasoline sales volumes increased 3\/10 of a percent over the same period last year.","Merchandise gross margin was $10 million higher than the second quarter last year due to overall higher merchandise sales and the higher margins realized on those sales. Merchandise sales in the quarter, excluding cigarettes, increased 2% on a same-store year-over-year basis, reflecting some of the progress we're making on enhancing our merchandise model across the entire business.","In July, we've seen a decrease in gasoline demand, with approximately 1% decrease in same-store gasoline sales volumes compared to last July which you may recall was a very strong month in 2015. Speedway same-store gasoline sales growth was lower than estimated U.S. demand growth as we continually strive to optimize total gasoline contributions between volume and margin to ensure fuel margins remain adequate.","Slide 8 provides the changes in the midstream segment income versus the second quarter last year. The $98 million increase quarter over quarter was primarily due to the combination of MarkWest at the end of last year which contributed $81 million of the incremental segment income to the quarter. The remaining increase of $17 million was primarily due to an increase in income from our equity affiliates and lower operating expenses versus last year.","Slide 9 presents the significant elements of changes in our consolidated cash position in the second quarter. Cash at the end of the quarter was nearly $1.8 billion. Core operating cash flow was a $1.2 billion source of cash. The $1 billion source of working capital noted in the slide primarily relates to an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities partially offset by smaller increases in accounts receivable.","The increases in accounts payable and receivable were primarily due to higher crude oil and refined product prices during the quarter which led to the net source of cash given the generally longer terms in the crude payables versus refined products. As we discussed in the first quarter call in April, MPLX issued convertible preferred equity during the quarter, generating equity proceeds of about $984 million. Proceeds from this private placement are broken out separately in the walk. MPLX used a portion of these funds to pay down its revolver which is included in the $521 million of net debt repayment on the walk.","Return of capital during the quarter included the repurchase of $51 million worth of shares and $170 million of dividends. Share purchase activity may vary from quarter to quarter based on our needs and the cash flow characteristics of our business in any particular period. Our commitment to continuing returning capital remains the fundamental element of our strategy and important part of the value proposition for investors. Share count at the end of the quarter was approximately 528 million shares, reflecting repurchase activity of about $7.4 billion, retiring approximately 28% of the outstanding shares at the time that it's been. In addition, as Gary mentioned earlier, the $0.36 per-share dividend announced by our Board yesterday represents a 12.5% increase over last quarter's dividend and contributes to a 29% compound annual growth rate in the dividend since our spin.","Slide 10 provides an overview of the capitalization and financial profile as of the end of the quarter. We had $11.1 billion of total consolidated debt, including 4.4 billion of debt at MPLX. Total debt to book capitalization was about 36% and represented a manageable 2 times last-12-months adjusted EBITDA of over $5.8 billion which is pro forma for the MarkWest acquisition. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $1.2 billion before reflecting the $1 billion source of cash for working capital in the quarter.","Slide 11 provides updated outlook information and key operating metrics for MPC for the third quarter. We're expecting third quarter throughput volumes to be down slightly compared to third quarter 2015 due to more planned maintenance. Total direct operating costs are expected to be $7.65 per barrel on total throughput of 1.85 million barrels per day which reflects the impact of higher expected turnaround activity in the third quarter versus our third quarter last year. Our projected third quarter corporate and other unallocated items is expected to be about $75 million.","With that, let me turn the call back over to Lisa for questions.","Lisa Wilson","Thank you, Tim. As we open the call for your questions, as a courtesy to all participants, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. If time permits, we will re-prompt for additional questions. With that, Katie, we will now open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Doug Leggate","Gary, there has been obviously a lot of noise in the sector about the arbitrage potential value of your retail business. And I think your comments in your prepared remarks probably underlined your thoughts. But I just wondered if I could ask you to reiterate your view that retail is -- you are happy with the current structure of Speedway and the current business and whether you would ever consider a separation to try and exploit the arbitrage that some others were talking about.","Gary Heminger","Well, Doug, as you and I have talked many times, of course we look at this all the time. But, as in my remarks, we're very happy. And it illustrates when you have a down market like the refining sector has been in the last couple quarters, how important having a diversified portfolio and a diversified value chain is to a business like ours. It is not only the most ratable customer within our portfolio, it's also this and our long term strategy to grow the midstream business as well as the retail business.","Those two segments are becoming, I would say, our most ratable cash flow streams within the business. So, yes, we're happy with the structure. But, yes, we continue to analyze and analyze very critically as you call an arbitrage. But when you look at an arbitrage, Doug, you also need to understand what the integration value is. Now, the integration value is, I would say, proprietary. I can't give out a number from a competitive reason of that integration value, but I can say it is very significant, especially when you look at downturns in the cycle.","As I've mentioned several times, then you look again at the first half of this year, the EBITDA from Speedway the first half of this year clearly covers the total dividend and interest costs on our capital. So, yes, we're happy. Yes, we continue to analyze it very carefully. But I would expect that we will continue on as we're.","Doug Leggate","I realize it's not always easy to answer those kind of questions. My follow-up is really on the dividend. Obviously a nice bump last night. You're now mid-range with the peers. Going forward, what are your thoughts on the bounds in terms of distributions between buybacks and continued dividend growth? And I'll leave it there. Thanks.","Tim Griffith","Doug, our thinking has been and really since the time of the spin, that we would have a focus around maintaining a regular dividend that's got a growth cycle to it that is really sort of through the cycle and has got -- what we would love to see is double-digit over an extended period of time. So that is our primary focus to make sure that we have baselined capital turnaround -- an attractive and growing dividend that has got sustainability through cycle.","Share repurchase for us continues to be a flywheel depending on the cash needs of the business, where we sit from a core liquidity perspective and how we're viewing things. Obviously we have taken down our capital spending plans in 2016 and I think some of the reductions that we have seen on the share repurchase side have gone in parallel with really a careful look at how the year will play out and what the cash flow generation looks like, but I think it will continue to be an important source and it will really be a function of the cash and liquidity position we find ourselves in as we move forward.","So, continued focus. I know the activity is lower in second quarter and in first quarter than it's been over the last several years. But, again, it's really just a function of what the liquidity needs of the business are at different points in time.","Gary Heminger","And Doug, one more point to that. As many leading analysts have already printed this morning, as MPLX now has gotten into a good rhythm within the capital structure, the balance sheet and our growth going forward and as we expect that the yield will continue to improve within MPLX, that's going to give us that ability in the future as we have dropdowns to be able to bring that cash back in and further buy back shares. So that's a very important ingredient in our strategy as well.","Operator","And our next question comes from Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Evan Calio","My question is a sum follow-up to Doug's first question and maybe a different way to partially monetize the value arbitrage. I know you filed the IRS letter to expand the characterization of wholesale EBITDA which would add to your droppable inventory. Any update there and can you dimension the potential range for expansion of what might be MLP-able out of what is currently characterized as retail? Really appreciate it.","Gary Heminger","Well, Evan, we continue to wait on the IRS to answer our PLR. We're expecting that soon, but I don't know if that means this quarter, next quarter or the following quarter. We filed a long time ago, but still awaiting. The fuels distribution that we discussed earlier is really a -- I think an elegant way to consider -- Tim talked about a flywheel before. But that is an elegant way without getting caught up in a retail blocker, if you will -- a tax blocker to be able to drop down part of those -- of that value. So, we need to remain in our seats and wait for the IRS to opine on our request. But we feel confident that it will go forward. And, albeit, we give you a better range after we get that work back from the IRS.","Evan Calio","And the second question is on midstream. Shell is now building a cracker in Pittsburgh. It's still five years out. It's very positive for MPC and MPLX both from volume growth and what it means for pricing and relative Northeast pricing in particular put at parity with Mount Bellevue. Can you discuss that project or how it could affect your business and maybe how you are thinking about our positioning for that today?","Don Templin","Yes, Evan, this is Don. We have a leading ethane position in the Marcellus and the Utica. We've invested considerable capital in the past to be able to handle ethane recovery. And our view is that there is going to be continued production of -- and growth in ethane which will give us an opportunity. We're estimating probably -- depending on where the forecasts and up, we've heard or seen forecasts that would suggest in the early 2020s that there would be 500,000 barrels per day of ethane production.","And if you got to those kinds of volumes, we could anticipate having capital projects that would be in the $500 million to $1 billion range in order to be able to extract that ethane to be able to support things like the crackers, but also to support ethane needs in the Gulf Coast and also for pipelines and other projects that are taking it to the East Coast.","Operator","And our next question comes from Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Neil Mehta","Gary, can you comment on the state of the product market as you see it? Inventories are elevated right now. Do you think that's a function of refining supply or a demand? And how do we work our way out of this? Do you ultimately think we need to see run cuts later this year in the world? And if so, where?","Gary Heminger","Yes, Neil, that's a very prudent question. And especially if you look at the same period last year, when we were in a very strong refining market last year. But refiners ran full out and that tremendous build and excess inventories is what really led to the downturn in the fourth quarter and early first quarter this year because of the rapid build of inventories and the long term to be able to run those off. I look at the inventories that came out yesterday, Neil -- in these PADDs where we predominantly operate, gasoline and PADD 2 is 2.9 million barrels over same period last year.","And we were down 2 million barrels for the week. So we're in pretty good shape. The Gulf Coast is still a bit high on inventories. But Mike Palmer pointed out to me earlier today, if you look at the turnaround schedule coming up in the Gulf Coast for PADD 3 and early into PADD 4, it appears to be a significant turnaround schedule somewhere between 700,000 to 1 million barrels are going to be down over this period of time. And then of course we're going to switch to the winter-grade gasoline before long. On distillates, both PADD 2 and PADD 3 were fairly balanced on distillates the way I look at it across the chain -- or I should say across the industry.","But the key point is and I believe that the refining industry has shown pretty good resolve in the past, that there is no need to be running inventories up that are going to cause the degradation in margins into the future. But as I say, distillates in pretty good shape right now. Gasoline PADD 2, we're in good shape. It's just PADD 3 gasoline is a bit high.","Neil Mehta","I might've misheard that, but did you call out same-store gasoline sales in Speedway were down 1% in July? And do you think that's just a function of comps? And could you just speak to how you see the demand trends on the gasoline side for the balance of the year?","Gary Heminger","And that's what we said; you are right, Neil. Gasoline has been a real strong contributor to Speedway over the first half of the year and I think somewhat can be timing. As you know, weather has been outstanding across most of the markets so far early in Q3 here. So, I would say it would be a bit more timing. I know Tony is on the line. Tony, would you like to add what you are seeing across the market?","Tony Kenney","Yes, you're right about the weather. That is driving traffic. We're seeing some nice benefits inside the store. On the volume, though, I think the comment about the comps that were hurtling from last July, fairly significant. We were close to 2% up last year and that's relative to both year's performance isn't all that bad.","Operator","And our next question comes from Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Ed Westlake","When the market opens in the two minutes whether yield on MPLX goes. But do you think the yield at MPLX is now low enough, bearing in mind you've got the IDRs, to get on the front foot for growing projects at this cost of capital assuming that the upstream customers are there to do it? And also to start dropping down for cash?","Gary Heminger","That's kind of a softball question to add on whether I think the yield's where it should be. No, I think the yield should be much lower than where it is based on the tremendous suite of assets, both drop-down assets and organic assets. And then the other thing that we pointed out in the release this morning is we've indicated a double-digit growth in 2017 and we have not talked about that previously.","So, I think that with the increase we just had in MPLX, with the expectations of growth in 2017, with the success that we've had and what we believe will be growing volumes in our base business -- and the other key to watch within MPLX as well, that is -- if you look at our capacity utilization, as commodity prices improve, we have a tremendous amount of basically free space to be able to fill up some of the capacity that we already have invested in that will fall directly to the bottom line.","So, we're expecting that our yield is going to continue to improve with this solid performance, again, that we've had. Our balance sheet is in good order. But in order to be able to make a real step improvement in being able to drop down more at favorable multiples, we expect to be more competitive in the yield going forward.","Ed Westlake","Yes. I guess I was just trying to get to the point that obviously there's been an improvement in cash this quarter. Obviously part of it is the preferred and the working capital release. But if you can start dropping down for cash, you can start to build cash at MPC level, drive the LP BCF per unit up and also then obviously buy back stock. So just trying to get a sense of when that process might start, in your opinion.","Gary Heminger","Yes, you are absolutely right. As we stated earlier, we're in very good shape. We don't need to have another drop here in 2016. But we will continue to see how the markets perform and we can always pivot if we need to. But I think we're in very good shape, as we said.","Ed Westlake","And my follow-up is just on the synergy capital progress. Obviously that's a big chunk of potential future EBITDA -- $6 billion to $9 billion. Obviously, the industry is not on the front foot yet, but I'm sure you're doing a lot of work in the background. So maybe just give us a bit of color on -- I guess you have got nine projects. How those projects -- maybe not each one, but how those projects in aggregate are coming on.","Don Templin","Yes, this is Don. We're very focused on progressing a number of those projects. And as we think about the ones that we have prioritized, the first priority is to help move NGLs to the East Coast. So, we think about our producer customers. They are seeing some optimism in terms of NGL pricing and improvement in NGL pricing. But the flat price isn't the only issue for our producer customers in the Utica Marcellus in that basin. It's been the deferential that they have been experiencing like Mount Bellevue pricing.","So, very focused on moving NGLs to the East Coast and I can say that that project is probably the one that is furthest ahead in terms of an in-service date and getting a solution. We're also looking at moving NGLs to the Gulf Coast and have been in regular discussion with our partner enterprise on Centennial and evaluating the feasibility of a reversal of Centennial.","And then the third major project that we've been spending a lot of time on is a project to a butane-to-alkylate project that would likely be positioned somewhere near our processing facilities in the Utica Marcella's and that will allow us to convert butane to alkylate and allow our producer customers to see an uplift in their overall valuation. But that's a big project. That's a multi-year -- would be a multi-year project. And we're in, I would say, the heavy part of the engineering right now in terms of evaluating that.","Operator","And our next question comes from Brad Heffern from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Brad Heffern","Circling back on repurchases for this quarter, obviously there is the big working capital benefit and the cash balance was up pretty significantly on a sequential basis. Can you talk about why there weren't more repurchases? Is it a matter of that working capital potentially reversing next quarter?","Gary Heminger","Well, again, I think anytime we're making decisions on the liquidity position and where we're positioned, it also incorporates how we see things playing out from a forecast basis over the coming months and quarters. So I think we're mindful of that.","The working capital benefit obviously is a big function of where absolute crude prices are at and how quickly they move. So, a lot of what -- and frankly, a lot of what was done from a cash basis was done as really sort of a pre-funding for capital spend we would have expected at MPLX over the course of the year.","So that capital raise was less about trying to build into a big capital -- big cash position that could be spent and more about really taking care of the needs of the partnership over the back half of the year. We did pay down some of the debt, again, just to open up some capacity. But it really is -- I would say most of the proceeds that were brought in are sort of spoken for this point and probably would not go back and perform a share repurchase.","Brad Heffern","Okay, understood. Then in the prepared comments, you talked about the phase 1 of the STAR project coming online and the $80 million in EBITDA. I'm curious, is that all EBITDA that comes online when you guys flip the switch on that or has some of that been seen in previous quarters? And additionally, what's the underlying assumption for that $80 million in EBITDA? Is that at current cracks or is that some sort of five-year average number?","Ray Brooks","Yes, this is Ray Brooks. I'll take a shot at answering that question. The $80 million of EBITDA is on an annualized basis. So, as Gary mentioned, we're bringing on phase 1 of STAR this year which is actually two parts of that. One part that we did a few months ago where we resid the asphalting unit. We essentially did a project to turn that into its original purpose to be asphalt resid. And then, as Gary said, by the end of next month, we will have the rest of that project completed, but we're actually expanded by 12,000 barrels a day. So, those two parts together lead to a combined EBITDA contribution of $80 million a year. And we continue to look at this -- the economics on a point-forward basis and we're still good based on the assumptions here that it's in that range.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jeff Dietert from Simmons. Please go ahead. ","Jeff Dietert","Question on -- as you look at your linear program models with the current margin environment, it looks to continue to drive relatively strong throughput per your guidance. How is the LP evolving? Still maximizing summer-grade gasoline? Is there any -- are there any regions where you are shifting to a more distillate-based yield? And there's been some commentary of that shifting to winter-grade gasoline production. Could you talk about how the current pricing is shaping up for you?","Ray Brooks","Sure. This is Ray Brooks and I will take a shot at that question, too. You asked a couple different things here. First regarding the LP model, yes, we do run the LP model on a weekly basis and we look at our crude avails and our product mix and determine what we're going to make and at what rate. And we will only run to what's economic for us -- makes economic sense to us.","Regarding distillate and gasoline and winter-grade production, right now we're producing summer grade and we have about two months before we can legally sell -- start selling higher vapor pressure gasoline to our customers. So we're still in that mode. Now as far as distillate to gasoline, as you know, the economics there change frequently. And right now predominantly we're pointed towards diesel. And just to give you a little flavor, we have about a 10% swing that we have the ability to swing back and forth on our swing strings between gasoline and diesel.","Jeff Dietert","And secondly, product exports have been an important part of your strategy. Could you talk about what you saw on second quarter product exports and perhaps give a view on early 3Q outlook on exporting product?","Mike Palmer","Yes, Jeff, it's Mike Palmer. I would be happy to talk a little bit about exports. If you look at the second quarter of 2016, we have exports of 325,000 barrels a day. So, exports were strong. Things look very good for us in the second quarter. When we look around the market, most of the strength was in Latin America, although -- and obviously you know we're well-situated to supply Latin America due to the proximity, but we're also finding that we've had diesel cargos that are making its way over to Europe.","So that ARB has been more difficult but still works under certain circumstances. So, we see the exports being strong. We have no reason to believe that will change at all in the third quarter. The first quarter was a little light due to supply, really, due to turnaround activity. But things continue to go very well.","Operator","And our next question comes from Chi Chow from Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Please go ahead.","Chi Chow","Just a couple questions -- I guess one on the crude slate. It looks like you ran a really high percentage of WTI-based crudes in the Gulf Coast in Q2 relative to recent history. That's a bit surprising given the TI spread. Can you talk about that? And also, it looks like that heavy and medium sour crude differentials have narrowed recently, particularly on a percentage basis. What is your outlook there on the dynamics on the heavier crude markets going forward?","Ray Brooks","Yes, Chi, Mike Palmer again. You know, with regard to your second question first, I guess, with regard to sour crude, we're finding a lot of opportunities in the sour crude right now. Not only in the Gulf of Mexico where, if you look at those spreads over the last six months, Mars has been discounted to LLS in the range of $5 to $6. It's been pretty stable. We see that continuing. The sour crudes in the Gulf are still growing and we see really good value there.","With the ARB coming in, we're also seeing some really good opportunities worldwide. We're bringing in more spot sour cargos than typically we have been able to find value in. And because Galveston Bay and Garyville have the ability to run the heavy, more difficult crudes high-TAN crudes, that's what we tend to focus on because that's where we get the discount. So we see that continuing to go forward.","In terms of the additional WTI-based crudes, that's going to shift back and forth depending upon what's happening at the plants, what crudes we're really optimizing on a daily basis between the WTI and the LLS-based crudes. So I don't think there's anything structural in the market there. It's just part of the overall optimization.","Gary Heminger","Chi, it was the right question. If you look at our slate -- as we talked about at this same time last year, last year we were running about 55% sour. This year we ran a little over 61%. So we have the ability to swing back and forth due to the composition of our refineries and take advantage wherever the best margins are in the market. So, 61% is one of the highest percentages of sour we've run for some time. I just want to give you those parameters.","Chi Chow","That's really high. But are you seeing Canadian barrels back to normal levels of availability at this point? And I guess on the Gulf Coast, just from the Latin American barrels, any concerns about the steep production climbs we're seeing -- Mexico, Colombia, Venezuela -- on the heavier crude availability out of those regions?","Gary Heminger","You know, we've had a hard time trying to make sense of a lot of the Venezuelan crudes for some time there. They are not very dependable and they have been declining. So, I don't -- I would say that we really haven't had a big focus on much of the Latin American crudes. There are some out of Columbia that have made a lot of sense for us, but we don't really see that as a big deal.","We have seen more interest in, for example, some of the Middle Eastern heavy crudes. With regard to Canadian, yes, the wildfire situation is behind us now. And we've seen the Canadian spreads return back to normal. They look a lot more attractive to us than they did before. And, as you know, the Canadian heavy with these projects that were sanctioned prior to this fall in crude prices, those projects continue. So, the Canadian heavy continues to grow. And we see a lot of value in the Canadian heavy.","Chi Chow","And then one question on the potential drop of the fuels distribution margin. When you look at that, I guess what happens to the RIN if hypothetically you do drop that -- the fuels distribution margin down? Does the RIN go with it or does the RIN stay at the MPC level?","Gary Heminger","No, the RIN would -- we would expect, Chi, that the RIN would still be controlled by MPC.","Chi Chow","Okay. Even though you've got the wholesale piece going? Structurally--","Gary Heminger","Yes, but where we're looking at the fuels distribution, it would be after the RIN or after the blending would have taken place. So, I would expect that we would not be putting any RIN volatility inside of MPLX.","Ray Brooks","Yes and Chi, I think the other important piece of that for how we have thought about this and the potential for structuring it, we're really looking at it as a sort of service arrangement as opposed to the transfer of inventory necessarily. So the -- I don't think we would expect any change to the -- where the RINs are resident and where the benefit resides.","Operator","And our next question comes from Roger Read from Wells Fargo.","Roger Read","Guess I would like to catch up a little more and try to -- how to think about the share repurchases and how they will fit in. I understand a little early to lay out 2017 CapEx, but you did improve the balance sheet year to date. It sounds like in every which way, MPLX is on much firmer footing and a solid growth outlook. Refining, probably better in 2017 than it is right now. So, as you get free cash flow, how should we think about it between consistent raising of the dividend, further balance sheet repair if need be and then the share repurchases?","Gary Heminger","Well, again, I think, again, the focus around capital return and how we do that is going to continue in the business for as long as we can imagine. How we balance that -- I think the key part, Roger, is maybe as you allude to a little bit that this is really going to be a balanced approach. I think we're not inclined to go all in on full investment. We're not inclined to go all in on full share purchase.","It's really going to be finding that balance that's in the business based on what the earnings look like, what the cash flow generation could be and exactly where we find ourselves financially at each point in time. Again, as I referenced earlier, this really becomes sort of a flywheel as we evaluate exactly how we want to position the business from a capital allocation perspective. We expect a level of activity will be there and could vary in different periods in time, but will be an important part of our balanced approach on the capital allocation side.","Roger Read","And as a follow-up to that, Gary, certainly Marathon has been an acquisitive Company. I understand you may be in more of a digested phase right now. But as you do free up more capital, whether from a retail, wholesale drop-down or further growth inside of MPLX, what else looks interesting on the M&A front? Is there a desire to expand the refining or should we think about it as a midstream retail growth really only at this point?","Gary Heminger","When you look at the valuation metrics of refining today, I think we're -- we have a very good platform and a good footprint in refining of where we want -- where we like being today. Doesn't say that we won't look at the other opportunities that may come about; we will. On the retail and midstream side, of course, we're very interested in continuing to build out within our footprint. The retail side -- we have the platform, the ability and, as Tony's team has been able to certainly illustrate, the expertise to be able to step outside of our footprint and perform very well. So we will continue to be interested in retail. I think retail and midstream probably give us higher returns. But I would say where our share prices are, as Tim just alluded to, buying back shares will be the top of mind as well.","Operator","And our next question comes from Paul Cheng from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Paul Cheng","Gary, with MPLX sort of stabilized, do you believe that this point and going forward, whatever is the new investment opportunity, whether it is building out more NGL distribution business over there, I think it would be all self-funded that the need for the parent operation -- any support we need just [indiscernible] behind and you are not going to consider going forward? Or that this is -- may have opportunity that at some point it would be so great from MPLX that you would still consider support from the parent? ","Gary Heminger","And you are right, Paul; it just depends on the situation. As Don just mentioned, we have -- he was speaking to some of the big organic projects we talked about. And some of those can be hefty because of the size of the projects. And we will see what the carry might be, if any. But we have stabilized the balance sheet. I think that the business -- the base business is picking up. As commodity prices improve, the coverage should continue to improve. So I believe that it can stand on its own into 2017 and we will see at that point. But I don't see anything over the next few quarters that MPC would need to step in and support their balance sheet.","Paul Cheng","I know it's early. Any memory -- CapEx for 2017, even from a direction standpoint, you can share given the recent weaknesses in the refunding margins? Should we assume that CapEx is going to be somewhat similar to this year or that you think it's going to be down or going to be up?","Gary Heminger","Well, Paul, I would say that when we come to your conference during September, we're going to be able to have a pretty good idea of where we're looking at CapEx going forward. We're in that phase right now. I wouldn't expect it to be up from where we're in 2016, but we're just in an initial phase of looking at the capital for 2017 and beyond.","Paul Cheng","A final one and maybe this is for Mike -- Sandpiper. With a number of the major projects our region from getting oil out from Bakken, are we going to have enough oil from Bakken to fill that line?","Gary Heminger","Yes, Mike will take that. Mike?","Mike Palmer","You know, that really depends on what happens with crude prices and we think that things are rebalancing quickly now. We think that oil prices will be up and we do believe that North Dakota production is a big resource. We believe that North Dakota production will go up as well. So there will be oil into the future to feed the various pipelines.","Operator","And our next question comes from Phil Gresh from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Phil Gresh","Perhaps just as a follow-up to Ed's question on the drop potential, how do you think about the deal pace of drops moving forward in terms of maybe on an annualized basis, what you think MPC you can get back from jobs that can be reallocated? And then also in terms of value-unlock opportunities, how are you thinking about the GP here? Do you think it's at a mature enough state to consider unlocking some value there or do you think you would need more time?","Gary Heminger","Well, I would say, Phil, we don't look at it as what can we hurry up and drop. We look at it as what is the growth rate that we're trying to achieve and what are the mechanisms that we use to achieve that growth rate. And as we stated in our release this morning that we expect double-digit growth rate, we're on target, first of all, to meet that parameter that we set out of 12% to 15% this year and then a double-digit growth next year. So, that is directionally how we look at it, Phil.","Phil Gresh","Okay and on the GP?","Gary Heminger","The GP -- when you were out visiting with us, we still believe that the GP is -- this is a -- it has to mature more to consider that. This clearly isn't the market to try to float a GP IPO. And the other thing that as -- we certainly have recognized in the market with some changes in structure is that it appears that simplification is better. But we continue to analyze and we will continue down that path.","Phil Gresh","Okay. And then my follow-up is just around the level of maintenance spending that we're seeing this year in the refining side. As we look ahead, would you say this is above normal in terms of maintenance this year? Or how might you suggest we think about the normal level of maintenance spending moving forward?","Ray Brooks","Well, this year was definitely a step up on the maintenance side from the standpoint -- it was a heavy turnaround year. So -- but it was definitely a step up. But our goal in refining is what do we have to do year in, year out to level that spend as much as possible. Take care of our turnarounds, but try to keep things as constant as possible.","Phil Gresh","Is there a specific number you might think about that you would get back next year just from having fewer turnarounds?","Ray Brooks","Yes, I don't think I can talk forward in forward numbers at this time.","Operator","And our next question comes from Paul Sankey from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Paul Sankey","Back to these terrible RINs, Gary, I'm afraid. I don't know if you listened at all to what [indiscernible] was saying yesterday about a lawsuit or if you saw Jack Lipinski's comments this morning which were very aggressive, about essentially the idea that third-party traders and speculators are driving up the price of RINs. My question to you, Gary, knowing how involved you are in Washington is what is your stance, first, on what you think should happen? And what do you guys actually want as Marathon Petroleum? What do you feel is in your best interest as regard to RINs? Thank you.","Gary Heminger","Sure. While clearly we need to have our best interest which we continue to strive for, is full repeal of the renewable fuel standard. But knowing that that is a heavy lift, there has been a bill that's been introduced on the floor known as the Flores bill that would limit blending at 9.7% which really takes into account the neat gasoline that's in the market as well. We think that that needs to be supported with tremendous amount of support already inside the House on this bill and we need to get others on schedule as well.","The RIN prices, you're right. Upwards of $0.95, $0.98. I know they've hit $1 over the last couple weeks. And it's a -- and I think -- I don't think, I know the reason is because the market is understanding that we're going to be very close and probably will tip over the 10% ethanol blend wall this year. Therefore, RINs are going to be at a -- the demand for RINs are going to outpace the supply. The steps that we've taken over the years, as illustrated as well in this morning's comments, is that we're in very good shape and we're fairly balanced on the RIN side. But nevertheless, we want a significant amendment or repeal of the renewable fuel standard and are working very hard towards or in that direction.","Operator","And our final question comes from Spiro Dounis from UBS. Please go ahead.","Spiro Dounis","Just one really quick one for me. Hopefully on M&A, and I know the question was asked earlier, but maybe just from a different perspective. Just in terms of the opportunity set out there and maybe quarter over quarter, it seems like things are pretty dire in the first quarter and gradually improved. And I'm wondering if you saw maybe a lot of fire sales come out of the market or if you still see a lot of opportunity out there in terms of what is available to pick up in whether it be retail, refining or midstream?","Gary Heminger","I think for the most part -- except on the midstream side, for the most part, R&M and retail has really ridden the wave here to the fourth quarter and first quarter. There is nothing pending on the refining side of the slate. There are rumors on different things that might be available. But I think the refining side still would be fairly pricey and be pricey versus the multiples that are achieved in the marketplace today. But beyond that, I would say there is some -- there has been some movement in the retail space. And Don can mention here on the midstream side what he is seeing across the midstream space.","Don Templin","Yes, Spiro, we haven't really seen any significant change. I think the people that were really in a desperate situation at the end of the fourth quarter going into the first was primarily on the E&P side. Clearly, the cost of capital was increasing for the midstream producers -- or midstream players. But I just haven't seen a dramatic change one way or the other. The folks that would be potentially in play in the first quarter are still in play and we haven't seen any big pullback in terms of opportunities.","Operator","And with that, I will turn the call back to Lisa.","Lisa Wilson","Thank you, Katie and thank all of you for joining us today and your interest in Marathon Petroleum Corporation. Should you have additional questions or would like clarification on topics discussed this morning, Teresa, Holman and I will be available to take your calls. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating and you may now disconnect."],"14394":["Marathon Petroleum Corp.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Geri Ewing, Director of Investor Relations. Geri Ewing, you may begin.","Geri Ewing - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Thank you, Adrianne. Welcome to Marathon Petroleum Corporation's second quarter 2015 earnings webcast and conference call. The synchronized slides that accompany this call can be found on our website at marathonpetroleum.com under the Investor Center tab.","On the call today are Gary Heminger, President and CEO; Don Templin, Executive Vice President of Supply, Transportation and Marketing; Tim Griffith, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Mike Palmer, Senior Vice President of Supply, Distribution and Planning; Pam Beall, President of MPLX, and Tony Kenney, President of Speedway.","We invite you to read the Safe Harbor statements on slide two. It's a reminder that we will be making forward-looking statements during the call and during the question-and-answer session. Actual results may differ materially from what we expect today. Factors that cause \u2013 could cause actual results to differ are included there as well as in our filings with the SEC.","Now, I will turn the call over to Gary Heminger for opening remarks and highlights. Gary?","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Thank you, Geri, good morning, and thank you for joining our call. We're pleased to report second quarter earnings of $826 million, reflecting a strong performance across to our operating platform. Refining performance was solid with $1.2 billion of income for the quarter as our refineries benefited from the combination of high utilization and favorable market conditions. Crack spreads were strong throughout the quarter, reflecting increased refined products demand in the U.S. We expect demand to continue to be strong in the near term due to the strengthening in the U.S. economy and lower fuel prices, which should continue to benefit our refining and marketing business.","The new condensate splitter at our Catlettsburg, Kentucky refinery went online during the second quarter. Along with the splitter recently completed at Canton, we have increased our system's refinery capacity by over 40,000 barrels per day, as well as our ability to process condensate production from the region's emerging shale plays. These two splitters further enhance MPC's extensive high complexity system.","Turning to our midstream business, we are pleased to highlight MPLX and MarkWest's recently announced merger agreement. This strategic combination complements our operations and expands MPC's commercial opportunities. It represents a significant step in executing our strategy to grow our higher valued stable cash flow businesses. The combination enables us to increase our participation in the U.S. energy infrastructure buildout and transforms MPLX into a diversified large cap MLP.","MPC's strong balance sheet and liquidity will enable MarkWest to accelerate organic growth in some of the nation's most economic and prolific liquids-rich natural gas resource plays. We expect the combination of these projects and MPC's inventory of MLP eligible assets to support a strong distribution growth profile over an extended period of time for the combined partnership.","It also defers the need for the recently proposed MPLX acquisition of MPC's marine transportation assets in 2015, with this drop being indefinitely postponed and the estimated $115 million of EBITDA to be returned to the $1.6 billion of backlog.","As part of the transaction, MPLX affirmed its anticipated distribution growth guidance of 29% in 2015. In addition, it expects a 25% compound annual limited partnership distribution growth rate for the combined entity through 2017 with an annual distribution growth profile of approximately 20% in 2018 and 2019. This transaction also enhances the cash flow profile of MPC's general partner interest in MPLX. You may recall that MPLX's first quarter distribution put MPC's general partner interest in the highest year of the incentive distribution rights and the partnership just declared an additional 7.3% increase in LP distributions to $0.44 per unit for the second quarter.","Speedway performed well during the quarter and continues to make tremendous progress integrating the East Coast and Southeast retail locations acquired last year. Over 650 of the retail sites have been converted to the Speedway brand since the acquisition last September, and we're on pace to achieve the anticipated synergies for 2015 from light product supply, as well as from operating and administrative expense savings.","Additionally, the accelerated progress of store conversions and subsequent remodels has allowed us to more rapidly implement Speedway's industry leading Speedy Rewards loyalty program. This program and other marketing enhancements are expected to drive the synergies anticipated over the next several years.","MPC continues to balance investments to grow the business with returning capital to shareholders. During the second quarter, MPC returned $544 million of capital to shareholders, including $408 million in share repurchases and $136 million in dividends. This brings our total return of capital to shareholders to $8.7 billion since becoming an independent company four years ago. To further underscore this commitment, our board increased MPC's dividend by $0.07 per share to $0.32 per share and authorized up to an additional $2 billion in share repurchases over the next two years. This authorization is on top of the $1.1 billion still available for repurchases at the end of the quarter and brings total repurchase authorizations to $10 billion since 2011.","The company maintains a strong financial position and continues to execute a strategy through great value through new investments in the business and continued strong operating performance.","With that, let me turn the call over to Tim to talk through the financial results for the second quarter. Tim?","Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Thanks, Gary. Slide four provides earnings on both an absolute and per share basis. As you can see in the yellow bars in the chart, our financial performance was strong once again in the second quarter of this year. MPC has earnings of $826 million, or $1.51 per diluted share during the second quarter of 2015, compared to $855 million or $1.48 per diluted share in the second quarter of last year.","The chart on slide five shows by segment the change in earnings from the second quarter of last year. Earnings were fairly consistent period-over-period with Refining & Marketing's income from operations down $54 million, partially offset by higher income from Speedway and lower income taxes resulting from lower overall taxable income.","Turning to slide six, Refining & Marketing segment income from operations was $1.2 billion in the second quarter of 2015, compared to the $1.3 billion in the same quarter last year. The slight decrease was primarily due to less favorable product price realizations compared to the LLS base crack spread, less favorable crude oil acquisition costs relative to our market indicators resulting from narrow crude differentials, and lower dollar base refinery volumetric gains resulting from overall lower commodity prices.","Segment results were also affected by a charge of $46 million to recognize increased estimated cost for compliance with the recently proposed renewable fuel standards. All these unfavorable impacts are included in the $458 million of other gross margin on this slide. These negative impacts were partially offset by a $372 million favorable effect of contango in the crude oil market in the second quarter of 2015. This $1.90 per barrel of contribution in the second quarter compared to the detrimental impact of backwardation in the second quarter last year of $0.93 per barrel.","Additionally, direct operating costs were $130 million lower in the second quarter of 2015 compared to last year's second quarter primarily due to lower energy and turnaround costs","Other refining and marketing segment net expenses increased $149 million compared to second quarter 2014 as a result of a number of items including higher terminal and transportation costs and lower equity affiliate income.","On slide seven, we provide the Speedway segment earnings walk for the second quarter. Speedway's income from operations was $33 million higher in the quarter as compared to the second quarter of 2014. Speedway's newly acquired locations contributed income of approximately $14 million to the quarter's results or approximately $45 million of EBITDA.","For the legacy Speedway sites, the merchandise gross margin was $23 million higher in the second quarter of 2015 compared to the same quarter last year, and the light product gross margin was about $16 million higher.","Speedway same-store gasoline sales volume was down two-tenths of a percent versus same quarter last year compared to estimates of U.S. demand growth in the second quarter of approximately 3% higher. The primary reason for this difference is how Speedway continuously strives to optimize total gasoline contributions between volume and margin to ensure fuel margins remain adequate, as well as a substantial number of new locations and remodels during the quarter. Overall, gasoline sales volumes for legacy Speedway locations were up 3% in the quarter, reflecting the impact of investments in new, rebuild and remodel locations.","Another key performance metric for our retail group is same-store merchandise sales, and we're continuing to see strong demand for our in-store offering as our same-store merchandise sales in the quarter excluding cigarettes were up 4.6% versus same quarter last year. So far in July we've seen a 1.6% increase in same-store gasoline volumes compared to last July.","Slide eight shows the changes for our pipeline transportation segment versus the second quarter last year. Income from operations was down $2 million to $79 million in the second quarter. This decrease was primarily due to lower equity affiliate income and increase in various operating expenses, partially offset by higher transportation revenue in the quarter, reflecting higher crude and light product throughput across the system.","Slide nine presents significant elements of changes in our cash position in the quarter. Cash at the end of the quarter was almost $1.9 billion. Core operating cash flow was a $1.2 billion source of cash. The $237 million use of working capital noted on the slide primarily relates to an increase in receivables and inventory, partially offset by higher accounts payable and other accrued expenses. The increases in receivables and payables were primarily due to higher refined product and crude oil prices during the quarter along with slightly higher inventory levels at the end of the quarter.","We continued delivering on our commitment to balance investments in the business with return of capital to our shareholders. We repurchased $408 million of shares and paid $136 million of dividends in the second quarter. Share count at the end of the quarter was 537 million shares on a split adjusted basis, reflecting share repurchase activity since the spin of 26% of shares outstanding at that time.","Slide 10 shows that our balance sheet continues to be strong with a gross debt right at one times the $6.5 billion of LTM EBITDA and a debt-to-total capital ratio of 35%.","Slide 11 provides updated outlook information on key operating metrics for MPC for the third quarter of 2015. We are expecting third quarter throughput volumes to be down slightly compared to third quarter of 2014 due to more planned maintenance in the quarter.","Since we have no comparable 2014 data that includes the newly acquired Hess locations, we are continuing to provide Speedway outlook information by quarter for 2015. For the third quarter of 2015, we expect Speedway's light product sales volume will be approximately 1.5 billion gallons.","With that, let me turn the call back over to Geri.","Geri Ewing - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Thanks, Tim. As we open for questions, we ask that you limit yourself to one question plus a follow-up. You may re-prompt for additional questions as time permits. With that, we will now open the call to questions. Adrianne?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And our first question comes from Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Edward G. Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hey. Good morning, and congratulations again on the strategic tie-up in the midstream. I guess people are concerned that given the MPLX price response, and the fact that obviously the implied price for MWE has faded, that \u2013 and given the strength of the assets that MWE has that you might be forced to defend a bid at perhaps a higher price or sweeten the deal. Maybe just talk us through a little bit about your thought process there?","Richard D. Bedell - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Well, Ed, good morning. And I understand your question, and we feel this is a very compelling transaction, compelling for both sides. And when you look at the profile of MPLX, one of the things I think investors have not fully been able to understand yet is that our risk profile really hasn't changed from where we were before, because we had \u2013 we needed to execute on a number of organic growth projects within MPLX since we started the IPO in October of 2012, and a good part of the growth that we have there was eventually going to become dropdowns, all was going to be dependent upon executing an organic growth profile. And the same thing happens here with MarkWest, and then the key to this transaction is you look at MarkWest today, they are around $1 billion or so of EBITDA. And we're speaking to $1.6 billion, $1.7 billion of EBITDA still sitting in backlog within MPC, MPLX. So that's the great strength or the great combination going forward, but we really believe this is a compelling transaction, understanding the value that MPLX brings to the table.","Edward G. Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. And then a separate follow-on, I mean, you've got a lot of maintenance or some maintenance in the Mid-con if I look at your turnaround costs in the 3Q. Maybe just talk a little bit about any upgrades to the plants that you're planning during that maintenance to perhaps give better EBITDA from self-help off to the turnaround, if there is any?","Richard D. Bedell - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Yeah, and it is Rich Bedell, Ed. There's two projects going in Catlettsburg, their project is a crude unit upgrade to recover more distillate in gas oil out of those crudes and Robinson has a unicracker or a hydrocracker project to produce more distillate.","Edward G. Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Do you have any rough numbers on what the EBITDA contribution might be in say \u2013 I know diesel is not doing great, but in say current conditions?","Richard D. Bedell - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","I don't have any right in front of me here right now.","Edward G. Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Thanks so much.","Operator","And the next question comes from Chi Chow from Tudor, Pickering. Please go ahead.","Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Great, thanks. This maybe a little bit of a na\u00efve question, but could you walk us through how processing incremental condensate volumes at Canton and Catlettsburg and eventually Robinson will impact refining operations? Is the upside based on yield improvements or higher gasoline blending volumes or is there some other factor? I'm just wondering how to quantify the impacts of the increased condensate you're running through the plants?","Richard D. Bedell - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","It is Rich Bedell again. The overall condensates, I mean, you've got everything from the light straight run material all the way into a distillate-type material. So by running those it gives us more blend stocks and feedstocks for the downstream units. And the Catlettsburg and Canton are pure condensate splitter-type projects. The project that will go in in Robinson is more of a light crude project and that's going in next year, and that will just give us more ability to process the lighter crude slates that are available.","Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Okay, Rich. So essentially you're going to get better yields coming out, is that kind of bottom line?","Richard D. Bedell - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Yes, yes.","Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Okay.","Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Well, Chi, it's both yield and it's a low cost feedstock. I mean, you will have a structural advantage to low cost feedstocks in the region via the condensates. And given the location we think that that's an enduring advantage to the business.","Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Right. Okay. Now, does that exasperate the situation you've got going on with the octane differential between premium\/regular gasoline? Does it make things worse I guess for them (17:59) or how do you think about that?","Richard D. Bedell - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Well, I mean we're pretty well-positioned with our reformer capacity to generate the octane to use the lighter blend stock. So I mean it all gets into optimizing the refinery.","Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","All right. Okay. And then one question on the MarkWest transaction. I'm not sure if you can answer but this, can you walk through any examples of growth projects that a combined MPLX\/MarkWest Energy can undertake but that each entity cannot do on its own?","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Well, the question you just asked, Chi \u2013 this is Gary \u2013 the question you just asked concerning octane is a great example. As you look at the feedstock that MarkWest has today, the \u2013 with the butane supply, butane is a great feedstock to put into an Appalachian unit and make octane. And we see going out to meet the CAFE standards of 2022 that the industry is going to be short octane. We have the ability to take this butane, marry it up with a possibly, and this is a conceptual project we have, but one we've been looking at for quite some time and then that is to manufacture octane right near the source. It makes more sense to do that than to distribute the butane to different markets, albeit the Gulf Coast or the harbor, New York Harbor and then manufacture it into a finish product. I think it makes more sense to manufacture it and then distribute that octane into the gasoline pool that is already in this market.","That's just one example. We have a number of other examples that we're looking at, possibly batching of refined products to the New York Harbor and when I look at MPC, the dropdowns that we have, some of the pipeline opportunities that we've been looking at, as well some of the terminal opportunities, you combine that volume with volume that MarkWest has I think it can make some feasible projects.","Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks.","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","And lastly, Chi, we've already announced the Cornerstone pipeline. And so again, you take the feedstock and the initiation station, if you will, of Cornerstone is going to be right at MarkWest Cadiz facility. So we're going to be able to marry up additional products there. Initially we are building this to be able to move condensates up to Canton and our Catlettsburg refinery.","You probably have recognized some of your E&P contacts how Marcellus and Utica are continuing to have some very strong results on some wells that have been drilled here recently. We believe that we can take some of those products, put them into Cornerstone and then go into the second phase of Cornerstone that we've talked about in the past, but the second phase to get us all the way back to the Chicago market and maybe even eventually tie-in with some pipelines that we have coming up from the North and considering reversing those getting back down to the Gulf Coast. So we have tremendous flexibility and tremendous options to be able to expand MarkWest and MPLX.","Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks for the color, Gary. On Cornerstone, does the linkup with MarkWest allow you to flow Cornerstone at full capacity?","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","We \u2013 well, it's really not being that we're linking up with MarkWest. It's all going to be about how the drill bit and how the producer continues to bring the stream on. That's why I brought up early. You noticed recently the significant progress and then some of the big wells have come on in the region. We certainly think this is going to help us.","Pam, do you have any more color?","Pamela K. M. Beall - MPLX LP","Well, I was just going to say, Chi, certainly the \u2013 as Gary mentioned \u2013 we're going to originate at the MarkWest Cadiz condensate stabilizer facility. We're also going to tie into their Hopedale fractionation operation. So we see the potential to move not just condensate but natural gasoline and butane and different grades as we're going to batch this system. And as Gary said, really we could \u2013 we believe we can deliver diluent into a pipeline that will end up going into Canada. We could reach the refineries in a Toledo, Lima, all the way back to our Robinson plant. And then, as Gary mentioned, there is even the potential to go north to Chicago and south to the Gulf Coast.","So as the volumes ramp up, that's \u2013 we'll be able to step into, kind of lag into the growth in the region. So the reason that we upsized Cornerstone from 12 inches to 16 inches was really to handle what we think will be a very large increase in natural gas liquids coming out of Utica, Marcellus. So we do see a lot of opportunities to leverage a lot of pipe we already have in the ground, a lot right of way that we can access to build out a distribution system from the Utica, Marcellus area, west, south and northwest, and as Gary mentioned, even enough (23:32).","Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Great. Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. Thanks for the comments, Pam. I appreciate it.","Operator","And our next question comes from Doug Terreson from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Douglas T. Terreson - Evercore ISI","Good morning, everybody.","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Hi, Doug.","Douglas T. Terreson - Evercore ISI","First, I wanted to see if Tim would repeat the compliance cost item that you highlighted for other gross margin in the quarter?","Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Sure, Doug. You're talking about the $46 million?","Douglas T. Terreson - Evercore ISI","Was it $46 million?","\nDouglas T. Terreson - Evercore ISI\nAnd what was it \u2013 and Tim, what was it for? I'm sorry.\nTimothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.\nWell, Doug, this is effectively at the end of May, we got the sort of the final proposed standards on renewable fuels, especially for biomass diesel.\nDouglas T. Terreson - Evercore ISI\nRight. Okay.\nTimothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.\nAnd so we sort of had built into what we expected that obligation to be. We found out at the end of May what it actually was going to be for calendar 2014 obligations, and so we were immediately in a position where we needed to acquire those RINs to satisfy that obligation. So that...\nDouglas T. Terreson - Evercore ISI\nOkay.\nTimothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.\n... that these are basically D4 and D5 RINs and there's basically about a $46 million cost in order for us to come current based on the standards released at the end of May.\nDouglas T. Terreson - Evercore ISI\nSure. Okay, thanks. Okay. And then second on Speedway, I wanted to see if we could get an update on integration of the Hess acquisition, specifically on the major areas of earnings opportunity that you guys have talked about meaning how is then its progress unfolding so far versus expectations on light products, supply and logistics, marketing enhancement, and SG&A cost? And also where were light product breakevens in the quarter, if you have them, and all they following at the rate that you thought that they would originally?\nGary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.\nOkay, Tony?\nAnthony R. Kenney - Speedway LLC\nYeah. On the color around the integration with the Hess assets, actually we're moving along at an accelerated pace in converting the brand to Speedway. We're little over 650 stores, more than halfway complete on that progress right now. But Doug, the important thing there is it's more than just the brand. What's going in inside the store is all of our technology that kind of is the platform for our marketing programs, primarily our loyalty program, all of our inventory management, other things that drives savings and synergies for us as we operate convenience stores.\nIn terms of the synergies itself, I mean the early opportunities have been to capture the savings on the light product supply and logistics part of the business, which as you know we've talked many times about, the integrated benefits of MPC's vast supply system and how we're able to take advantage and extract some value from that. I mean those are basically in place right now in terms supplying the stores.\nAnd then the other early opportunities have been to capture the operating expense savings and the G&A savings. So for the quarter and for the year, what we're really saying essentially is that we're expecting to be on pace with what we earlier indicated what the synergies would be in the business for 2015. And then down the road as we begin to bring on all of the marketing enhancements through the conversions inside the store that I described earlier, then we'll start to realize those benefits down the road.\nDouglas T. Terreson - Evercore ISI\nSure. Great. Thanks a lot, guys.\nOperator\nAnd your next question comes from Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nNeil S. Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.\nGood morning.\nGary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.\nHi, Neil.\nNeil S. Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.\nGary, I wonder if you could start off by talking about your capital allocation strategy? You raised the dividend by 28% yesterday. How are you weighing buybacks versus dividends at current levels? And how does MarkWest impact the way you think about capital allocation, if at all?\nGary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.\nSure. And Neil, you'll recall at our sell-side analyst dinner, when we were talking about MPLX, we had \u2013 we discussed some of these issues there that in fact we think it enhances things going forward. And let me have Tim go into the details.\nTimothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.\nYeah. So, Neil, the question of dividends versus buybacks is I think for us is a relative easy one. Dividends, despite their sort of tax inefficiency, we know are an important part of a lot of investors' thinking around a stock. And so our intention will be to maintain a strong and growing dividend for the long term. That is going to be the approach.\nI think the way we view the sort of what remains from a capital if there's excess capital or cash in the business is that share purchase is the most efficient way to get that back to shareholders. It has the nice benefit of sorting out the shareholder base and basically returning capital to those people that aren't going to be long in the stock anymore and allows for investors to pick their own liquidity window as opposed to pushing cash to shareholders who may not wish it in the form of a special dividend or other form.\nSo I think that's the way we approach it. I think you should expect to see continued focus on both of these. They are are both part of our overall thinking on the sacred trust that exists with investors, with regard to the capital and cash we've been entrusted with. And that's likely how we'll continue.\nThe addition of the MarkWest business and the combination of MPLX and MarkWest we think provides some very interesting dynamics. One of which we described on the announcement call itself, which is it is true that the GP cash flows are enhanced by the transaction. And the way we view that is that there really is a virtuous capital cycle here. As those GP cash flows come back into the C Corp. it becomes available for further investment in what will become ultimately investments of the partnership.\nAn important part to what we think makes sense around the transaction and we think has got a lot of power to it, is the fact that to the extent there are very nice investments, good, high returning investments available in the midstream that provide some strategic advantage, we have the ability to incubate those at the C Corp. and drop them into the partnership at the appropriate time.\nOne, just from a pure capital capacity, that the partnership may not be able to swallow it all at once, but also the timing issue that where capital gets spent and built and the time that it takes before those projects come fully on stream. MPC has got the capacity to sort of incubate them and basically put them in the partnership when they're at full run rate cash flow.\nSo again the financial flexibility afforded here we think is tremendous. And the capital allocation will follow form on where we think the investments need to be made, but we fully stand ready to make continued investments in the midstream and through this vehicle probably on an even more accelerated pace.\nNeil S. Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.\nThanks, Tim. And then a follow-up here on the macro, Gary. Of all the CEOs in the oil industry you've probably spent as much time in Saudi Arabia or dealing with the Saudis as anyone. What are your thoughts in terms of Saudi output and productive capacity?\nAnd then another question is I think last time we spoke you certainly seemed more constructive on oil than the forward curve and even our lower for longer views, I think investors could benefit from hearing your perspective on the flat price.\nGary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.\nYes, Neil. What I said earlier in the year, in fact, at your conference in January, has continued to prove out for the year. I've said I think investors should watch the amount of imports coming into the U.S., namely from the Middle East, not only Saudi Arabia, but others. And that has continued to bear fruit for refining. And as we look at the forward positions and how crude oil is positioned right now as imports into the Gulf Coast, we think this remains.\nAnd the other thing I had stated is we were expecting to have a second dip. We did not expect a V-shaped curve here, and it ended up being \u2013 I think it's going to be a more of W-shaped curve with the crude price, that we expected this second dip. And but we do expect strength going on down the calendar, end of the year probably into the second quarter of next year before you really I think start to see some strength.\nThe other thing is when I look at the volumes coming in through LOOP, the main oil line volumes continue to be strong, which again suggests strong imports coming into the U.S. And it really takes it back to the question of how is crude situated in the Midwest? And we've had this discussion many times, looking at the amount of sweet crude we run versus sour crude. We have the capacity to run somewhere between 65% and 70% sweet crude, and we're basically on the same number this quarter as second quarter of 2014 at around 54% sour. So that suggests we have a lot more room to run more sweet crude if it is priced right in the marketplace.\nSo I think you're going to continue to see light sweet crude coming in from Middle East producers, landing in the Gulf Coast and being available. And that really is going to come back and tie-in with where do we see the drill bit? Where do we see the production out of the Permian and Eagle Ford? We're not getting much Bakken down into the \u2013 into PADD 3 today, some, but not that much. But it's Permian. It's Eagle Ford to really see what's going to happen there.\nSo I think some of the same, Neil, going forward, and I expect to see the Middle East producers want to continue to maintain their market share.\nNeil S. Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.\nAll right, Gary. Thank you very much.\nGary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.\nYou're welcome.\nOperator\nAnd our next question comes from Paul Cheng from Barclays. Please go ahead.\nPaul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.\nHey, guys. Good morning.\nGary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.\nHey, Paul.\nPaul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.\nGary, I was wondering, there's a number of report talking about the tightness in the alkylate market and also at the high octane component. I think one of your competitors even said in the (33:59) talking about they may have difficulty that to produce output. I want to see that what is your view that how tight is the alkylate and high octane component right now in the marketplace? And how that impact that what you can see is on the gasoline supply and the corresponding crack?\nGary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.\nAs Rich said earlier, Paul, we're very balanced on the outlook because of our reforming capacity. So \u2013 but you are right. There have been some wide spreads between the New York Harbor and Chicago and the Gulf Coast on alkylate and therefore octane. We're very balanced at this point in time, but we really see this growing into the future. Again, as I say, getting out to meet the CAFE standard with higher compression engines going many years from now \u2013 not many years, but into the latter part of this decade, we're going to need to be able to have more octane in the system. And I think you're going to be able to see this grow over time, these spreads, and this is why we have this interest and why we think it's a natural benefit between MarkWest and MPC going forward.\nPaul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.\nWill you contemplate to build some new alkali unit in your refining system?\nGary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.\nAnd that's what I had said earlier, Paul, that and as \u2013 we're very balanced right now, but the \u2013 one of the very strong synergies, operational synergies, from a conceptual standpoint, I don't want anybody to think that we have FID'd an alkylate unit, but from a very conceptual standpoint, with MarkWest being long butane, the producers being long butane in a very strategic area of the country, I think it really tees it up well for us to consider additional alkylation manufacturing capacity. And we're looking at that very strongly. And then I think it makes sense to manufacture it within the region. Don't transport the feedstock to different markets, but rather manufacture it where you need it in order to be able to put it into the final blend stock.\nPaul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.\nGary, you have very heavy \u2013 I have to apologize, because I came in late, so you may already address it. In the third quarter, looking at your outlook, you have very heavy turnaround in the Midwest. I'm wondering can you share that \u2013 how is that outlook maybe for the fourth quarter? And also then in the third quarter is there heavy downtime? Is that primary in the front end of the refinery or the back end of the refinery?\nGary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.\nSure, let me have Rich cover that for you, Paul.\nRichard D. Bedell - Marathon Petroleum Corp.\nWell, Paul, the turnarounds we have in our Robinson refinery starting in August are really around our hydrocracker and reformer areas and not so much the crude. And then in Catlettsburg that's one of the crude units we'll be taking down to do modifications.\nPaul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.\nOkay. And then, how about in the fourth quarter, Rich? Are you going to expect that you have a pretty heavy downtime also or is that just going to be more similar to the first half of the year where you don't have a lot of maintenance?\nGary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.\nSay Paul, you know our history. We don't like to talk beyond what's going on right now as far as turnarounds. It's just too competitive to get into that going forward.\nPaul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.\nOkay, that's fair. A final one, maybe this for Tim. Tim any preliminary 2016 budget you can share?\nTimothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.\nWell, Paul, we would love to be able to give you a look at the year, but we're not in position do so and if we were, we probably wouldn't be sharing it at this point. We \u2013 I think as we get closer to the end of the year you can look to us to give some indication for \u2013 from some of the metrics, but as you know we're not going to give any sort of full-year guidance at this point.\nPaul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.\nCan you at least tell us that whether it's going to be more likely, going to be flat, up or down comparing to this year?\nTimothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.\nYeah, Paul, it's just too early to say, I think we'll \u2013 you will hopefully shortlist your invitation to our December Analyst conference, and if we provide any information it will be in that forum.\nPaul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.\nAll right. All right, we'll do it. Thank you.\nGary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.\nHey, Paul, let me back up to your question about butane and how it fits in with the market and the structure going forward. Don has talked about this when \u2013 Don's been on the road, and let me ask him to share as far as some of the producers and consumers.\nPaul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.\nThank you.\nDonald C. Templin - Marathon Petroleum Corp.\nYeah, Paul. I think Gary mentioned the benefits to MPC and having the opportunity to have alkylate and octane, the benefit to MPLX of a combined project with MarkWest around this. But I think it's also important to make sure that we're not forgetting about the producer customers of MarkWest or the MPLX combined entity because it is our objective to make sure that they are getting the highest netback that they possibly can get. So these kinds of projects as we think forward are opportunities to benefit the producer customers, opportunities to benefit MPLX, the combined entity and opportunities to benefit MPC the C Corp.\nPaul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.\nThank you.\nOperator\nAnd our next question comes from Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nBrad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC\nHey, Good morning, everyone.\nGary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.\nGood morning, Brad.\nBrad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC\nJust looking at yields during the quarter, I noticed that gasoline yield was the lowest I've seen, at least far back as my model goes. I would have thought that during the quarter you guys would have been running max gasoline. Was there any particular reason around that: Was it maintenance or turnaround-related and have you ramped up gasoline yield since then?\nTimothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.\nYeah, Brad, this is Tim, and Rich can certainly supplement. I mean I don't think there was any particular focus one way or another. As you know, we will \u2013 we run LPs every day and every month in terms of what optimizes the system with regard to product yields from a total value maximization perspective, and then we'll make those decisions as appropriate. We did \u2013 exports for the quarter were strong, and those are generally diesel-focused for the most part. So that there \u2013 those markets continue to be receptive and robust from a earnings opportunity perspective, but Rich, I don't know if you had any supplements?\nRichard D. Bedell - Marathon Petroleum Corp.\nI'm looking through. I don't have anything to add to that.\nDonald C. Templin - Marathon Petroleum Corp.\nHey, Brad, this is Don. I mean, exports were 330,000 barrels a day, so a super strong quarter from an export perspective, and as Tim mentioned about 70% of those exports were diesel or distillate. So there was a reason for \u2013 we were able to optimize the value in the netback of that diesel production.\nBrad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC\nOkay. That makes sense. Thanks for that. And then looking at Galveston Bay, I was wondering if you had any update on the synergies that have been achieved to-date, how much there is left to achieve, and then where we stand on the earn-out?\nGary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.\nBrad, I'll \u2013 this is Gary. In December this is going to be part of the centerpiece. We now have another centerpiece that we're going to talk about at the analyst meeting in December, being MarkWest. But Galveston Bay is going to be a big part of that. To really give you more detail, we're very pleased with where we stand. We're ahead of schedule on the synergies. We just made the second earn-out payment this year. So we paid out $369 million. We have $331 million left in the earn-out, and things are performing out very well this year.\nI'm very pleased to state that the strike that went on, it has been settled. We've had a great return to work, great productivity from our employees, and very pleased to welcome them back. So things are moving very well at Galveston Bay. But as I said, we will give you, along with Paul Cheng's question concerning the budget, we're going to give you more detail and where we see a lot of low hanging fruit going forward.\nBrad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC\nOkay I'll leave it there. Thank you.\nOperator\nAnd your next question comes from Doug Leggate from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nDoug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch\nThanks, good morning everyone. Good morning, Gary.\nGary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.\nGood morning, Doug. Where have you been? I haven't talked to you in a long time.\nDoug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch\nWell, let's just say we're working out of the Scottish office this week. But I got a couple of questions, if I may? First of all, I don't want to label the MarkWest deal too much, but to kind of get straight to the point, there seems to be some chatter in the market that the MarkWest side of the equation may not be terribly happy with the currency anymore. I'm just \u2013 I understand the commitment of both sides, but I'm just curious if you feel that there would be a need to change the terms somewhat in order to cement the transaction? And I know it's a tough question to answer, but I do have a follow-up as well please. Thank you.\nGary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.\nYes, Doug and Ed Westlake had the same question earlier on here, and as I've said it's \u2013 we believe we're \u2013 it's a very compelling transaction and you need to look beyond just MPLX. So we announced this the day after the Iranian nuclear accord was announced and there's been a lot of macro headwinds in the marketplace. And if you look at the large cap MLPs, gathering and processing MLPs, even the high drop-down MLPs, there's been tremendous volatility and headwinds on those. But if you combine the \u2013 where the units are trading for both MarkWest and MPLX and take into account the headwinds in the marketplace, we still think that we are in a very compelling business.\nThe relative performance, as I said, looking at MarkWest and look at those G&P units or the large cap units, if you take into account that that tough backdrop along with that, I think it further supports that this is a compelling transaction at this time. We're getting ready to \u2013 it won't be long that we'll have the HSR filed, and that'll be followed by the S-4. So there will be more details to come, and I think that's going to further support that this is a compelling transaction.\nDoug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch\nAs you know, Gary, we like the deferral of the refinery drop, so congratulations again on the deal. One follow-up if I may? It's really more a macro question. So there's two things seem to be kind of dominating the second half outlook. One is obviously strong gasoline demand and the other is the remarkable buildup of distillate. I'm just kind of curious as \u2013 because of your unique exposure on retail you tend to have a pretty good handle as to whether the 6% EIA gasoline demand growth is really translating on a same-store sales basis. So I wondered if you could comment on your view of sustainability of gasoline demand growth. And I guess the byproduct which is strong refinery runs means more distillate production going into winter and we seem to be starting from a fairly high level of inventory. So real more of a macro question. I'd just love to get your perspective on those two things and I'll leave it there, Gary. Thank you.\nGary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.\nSure, if you look at the overall gasoline demand and the 6% EIA, the last number I saw was 5.1% but maybe you have a new number from what I had yesterday, but and that's why we gave a little more color in Tim's presentation here on Speedway's gasoline being a market leader in many of the markets. With that, as we are trying to move these, as you recall, in the second quarter crude oil prices went up significantly over that period of time and with that trying to reflect that incremental cost to the Street is difficult. So that's why we gave more color this time to look at overall Speedway legacy assets versus \u2013 or legacy stores versus the new stores they acquired on the East.\nBut we think that we performed very well on incremental gasoline, and we're continuing to see that as Tim outlined here in \u2013 early in the third quarter. We're continuing to see that move forward and move up very nicely.\nOn distillate, as Mike Palmer and Tim spoke as well, our distillate exports continued to be very strong. And as I look at our book going into the third quarter they continue to be robust. So I think we're very well balanced on distillate. I think as the fall \u2013 you have two things, the fall harvest and secondly the fall turnaround schedule especially the ones that we've already talked about this morning, I think is going to soak up some of the distillate in the market. But the key, you're absolutely right Doug, the key to watch is how the exports continue forward on distillate.\nDoug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch\nThanks a lot, Gary. Appreciate the answers.\nGary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.\nYou're welcome.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Ryan Todd from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nIgor Grinman - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.\nHey, good morning, guys, it's actually Igor Grinman here.\nGary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.\nGood morning, Ryan.\nIgor Grinman - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.\nIt's Igor here chiming in for Ryan. Hi, Gary. Just a question on the refining side your \u2013 so the other gross margin bucket contributed, I think it was $19 million in the quarter or call it a little bit higher if you're adding back the RFS-related hit you called out, either way it's a bit of a drop-off versus recent quarterly levels. So just curious as \u2013 I know it's notoriously fairly volatile but \u2013 and there are lot of moving factors in there, just curious is there anything that you can kind of point to the drop-off?\nGary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.\nYeah, sure let me have Tim take that.\nTimothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.\nYeah, Igor, thanks. Certainly what we've seen on a run rate basis around this has been higher but we've had \u2013 we had a couple of things in the quarter that sort of are all part of that other gross margin. I think you're probably referring to the slide in the appendix that shows it as $19 million. But within the quarter we had, as I had mentioned in my comments, we had volumetric gains which were an impact on the quarter. That's frankly just the scale impact. Volumes were slightly lower, but just with lower absolute prices you're going to see a lower impact there. So that was a hit on the quarter.\nProduct price realizations again, as you said, we've picked up the 46. That's part of that. But we did see a little bit softer gas margins in the quarter, and frankly, just less favorable than where they were for second quarter last year. Second quarter last year was a very strong quarter. You've probably heard us say on multiple occasions that we really perform best in volatile environments. That's where we have the greatest opportunity to sort of optimize the system, and frankly, second quarter last year was a very good quarter on that basis.\nAnd then we had some impact to some of the incremental crude costs, some of which we've already described, and some that had an impact on the quarter. So those are probably the biggest drivers and I think the things we'll highlight, and we'll see how this is looking forward.\nIgor Grinman - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.\nGreat. Thanks, guys. Just one more, and apologies if this was discussed already, but on Speedway, fuel margins dropped off a good amount quarter-on-quarter. And I understand the crude price movement was upward and\/kind of stabilizing over the quarter, but anything else there that we should note? Or is this kind of a feeling (50:28) of a level more or less on the margin side?\nAnthony R. Kenney - Speedway LLC\nGary, let me answer that, please.\nGary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.\nAll right.\nAnthony R. Kenney - Speedway LLC\nYeah. I mean it goes back to Gary's comment he just made a little earlier. Crude ran up our wholesale cost increase, and that's kind of the pressure you're under when you're trying to pass on increasing cost. And that's what we saw in the second quarter. It's as simple as that.\nIgor Grinman - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.\nAll right. Great. Thanks, guys.\nOperator\nAnd our next question comes from Phil Gresh from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nPhilip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC\nHi. Good morning. First question, just any update on the cap line reversal analysis? I know it's something you had put a press release out a couple of quarters ago, so I was just looking for any recent thoughts?\nGary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.\nPhil, there's nothing new from what we've talked in the past. Still think it makes sense, but it takes a unanimous approval by all the owners but no update from the last time.\nPhilip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC\nSo is there a particular timeline on it or not really at this point in terms of trying to make a decision?\nGary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.\nI would say, as we said last fall I believe, that we did a study from an engineering standpoint of what it was going to take. But it \u2013 from an engineering perspective, it's \u2013 I won't say it's easy, but it's just kind of a normal engineering project to be able to reverse the pumps and be able to reverse the flow.\nThe biggest thing that I think you need to understand and the market needs to understand is where do you get the heavy crude supply into Patoka? In order to be able to reverse this you need a static heavy crude supply into Patoka so that you can have a good heavy supply and a ratable supply to the Eastern Gulf. And I would say that that is the issue, and with the downturn in crude prices and looking at the Canadian supply coming forward, I think the incremental Canadian supply is probably being pushed back a few years.\nPhilip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC\nSure, okay. And then just in terms of, I mean you've done the Hess deal, MWE, I mean is it fair to say that the organization at this point becomes kind of organically and inwardly focused in terms of execution in that further M&A anywhere across the portfolio is probably more limited likelihood?\nGary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.\nYeah, I would say we have a lot to say grace over right now.\nPhilip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC\nFair enough. Thanks.\nOperator\nAnd the next question comes from Roger Read from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nRoger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC\nYeah, good morning.\nGary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.\nHey, Roger.\nRoger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC\nGary, I'd like if we could be maybe the differential question, following up on the comments on the Canadian crude, and just the fact the differential is being narrower, kind of trimmed Q2 margins a little bit, any quantification you can give us or maybe just as we think Q2 to Q3 is especially WCS diffs have opened up, how that may impact realizations?\nGary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.\nYeah. Let me ask Mike to cover the current markets.\nC. Michael Palmer - Marathon Petroleum Corp.\nYeah Roger. I guess what I can tell you, and it's obviously market information, but the wildfires in the Coal Lake area are behind us. And in addition to that, when you look at the differentials today, the Canadian heavy dip is up around that $16 level. We've got \u2013 we do have some projects that are coming on in Canada that were sanctioned some time ago before oil prices fell. So we've got some additional supply coming on from several projects. In addition to that, when you look to this this fall period, we do have some heavy refineries that have turnaround. So this $16-ish kind of differential, this wider differential that we're seeing, is likely to be with us for a while. So it looks very positive.\nRoger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC\nOkay, thanks. And then Gary, you mentioned earlier on the question regarding diesel and the need to focus on exports, is it, as simple as we should just watch the arbs to the various international regions? Or is there something else where we will actually notice a change in volumes first and change in arbs second? I was just kind of curious, chicken or egg question there.\nGary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.\nSo I think you've got it right. That's chicken or the egg. And I wasn't saying that to give a hint on anything. It's just we have continued to see very strong and very robust demand on diesel into Latin America, Europe and South America with continued increases in the request for gasoline cargos. So I find both export products being very strong going into the third quarter and so I was just saying continue to watch that because I think that underpins the strength of refining going forward.\nRoger D.

Please go ahead.\nFaisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)\nHi, good morning. Thank you, guys.\nGary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.\nHi, Faisel.\nFaisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)\nHi, Gary. I'd sort of go back to some of the comments around octane. So are you saying that the octane market is getting \u2013 is it getting shorter just because we've had this big uptick in gasoline demand so we need to fill that gap? Or is it \u2013 you also talked about the CAFE standards having impacts on octane, but I would think about the CAFE standards is actually having a negative effect on gasoline demand and therefore having a negative effect on octane demand. But can you just sort of elaborate a little bit more on what your \u2013 on how you see the octane market over the next year or two, especially given where gasoline demand is today?\nGary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.\nLet me have Rich cover that and then I'll take the longer term strategy part of octane.\nRichard D. Bedell - Marathon Petroleum Corp.\nI think what we're seeing is as we run the lighter crudes and the crudes with the diluent you're using those light straight run materials to blend off your octane, and that's raising the overall cost of the octane. So it's a function of some of the lighter feed stocks that we're dealing with.\nFaisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)\nOkay.\nGary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.\nAnd what I was saying long term is it's not just \u2013 and it's going to \u2013 octane demand going forward is going to go with the changeover of the fleet. It's a changeover of the fleet and the manufacturers are starting to put out higher compression engines. So that will gradually grow with the changeover of the fleet that you're going to need higher octane as really the base gasoline to power these \u2013 the new cars coming off the line. So it's not going to be a drop in MPG that is going to hurt. It's going to be the incremental demand from the new fleet coming in with the higher compression engines.\nOperator\nI will now turn the call back over to Geri Ewing for closing comments.\nGeri Ewing - Marathon Petroleum Corp.\nThank you for joining us today, and thank you for your interest in Marathon Petroleum Corporation.

My name is Cliff, and I'll be your operator today. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Pam Beall. Ms. Beall, you may begin.","Pamela K. M. Beall","Yes. Good morning. Thank you, Cliff. Thanks for joining us today on Marathon Petroleum Corporation's 2013 third quarter earnings webcast and conference call. The synchronized slides that accompany this call can be found on our website.","On the call today are Gary Heminger, President and CEO; Garry Peiffer, Executive Vice President of Corporate Planning and Investor and Government Relations; Don Templin, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Rich Bedell, our Senior Vice President of Refining; Mike Palmer, Senior Vice President of Supply, Distribution and Planning.","Please read Slide 2. This is our Safe Harbor statement, and it is a reminder that we will be making forward-looking statements during the presentation and during the question-and-answer session. Our actual results may differ materially from what we expect today and factors that could cause actual results to differ are included here, as well as in our filings with the SEC.","Just as a reminder, we will be hosting an Analyst and Investor Day at the Saint Regis Hotel in New York on December 4. If you have not received an invitation and would like to attend, please contact me.","And now, I'll turn the call over to Gary Heminger for opening remarks.","Gary R. Heminger","Thank you, Pam, and good morning to everyone. Thank you for joining us today. The third quarter was challenging for MPC and the entire U.S. refining sector with declining frac spread's, narrowing crude oil differentials and backwardation in the crude market. We believe much of the pressure on industry fundamentals was due to high industry crude runs. Incremental inventories held within the U.S. during the hurricane season also contributed to excess transportation fuel inventories since there were no significant adverse weather impacts this year.","Our assets performed well during the third quarter, and we are pleased with the ongoing integration process at the Galveston Bay refinery. We continue to recognize synergies with Galveston Bay and our other refineries. In addition, we are evaluating further opportunities to unlock the earnings potential of this recently acquired asset.","Our Pipeline Transportation segment provided consistent results for the quarter. We continue to advance organic investments in our midstream businesses that are catalysts for significant growth in the future. In addition to our participation in the recently announced Southern Access Extension project, we are developing a new pipeline project in the Utica Shale region that will initially connect multiple production facilities in Eastern Ohio with our Canton refinery and other MPLX pipelines in the area. This project will complement the existing condensate and crude oil truck unloading facility at Canton and our truck to barge logistics operations at Wellsville, Ohio, that was brought online in October.","Speedway delivered strong performance for the quarter, resulting in more than a 34% increase in income from operations compared to the same quarter last year. This was driven in part as a result of an increase in same-store sales volumes and margins and cost control. Speedway continues its expansion in contiguous markets with construction of new stores in Pennsylvania and Tennessee, as well as its growth in commercial fueling locations for increasing sales of diesel fuel.","Despite the challenging market conditions in our Refining & Marketing segment, we returned $1.2 billion of capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in the 2013 third quarter. We remain confident in our ability to generate cash to continue our balanced approach to investing in value-enhancing investments in the business and returning capital to our shareholders. This confidence was underscored in September when our Board of Directors approved an additional $2 billion share repurchase authorization.","As of the end of September, we have repurchased 17% of our shares since its spinoff in June of 2011. As we look forward to 2014, we are optimistic industry fundamentals will improve. We are encouraged that EPA has acknowledged its renewable volume obligation for 2014 is unworkable. We remain cautiously optimistic that EPA will establish reasonable targets for 2014. We, along with others in the industry, continue to press Congress for a permanent legislative remedy to renewable fuel standards to provide the markets great certainty over future renewable fuel obligations.","Exports of gasoline and distillates continue to provide refiners incremental markets to distribute transportation fuels. Our exports reached a record 245,000 barrels per day for the quarter compared to 124,000 barrels per day during the same quarter last year. The low cost of natural gas and projected increase in supply of North American crude oil will continue to benefit U.S. refiners. In addition, U.S. refiners have the ability to produce a low sulfur refined products being increasingly required around the world. We believe these advantages will continue to provide U.S. Gulf Coast refiners with a global competitive advantage. And it should allow U.S. Gulf Coast refiners to capture growing share of demand for transportation fuels, particularly in Latin America and Europe.","With that, I will ask Don Templin to review the quarter results in more detail. Don?","Donald C. Templin","Thanks, Garry. Slide 4 provides earnings and adjusted earnings data both on an absolute and per-share basis. Our third quarter 2013 adjusted earnings were $183 million compared to $1.1 billion of adjusted earnings in the third quarter of 2012. Adjusted earnings per diluted share was $0.59 for the third quarter compared to an exceptionally strong $3.31 during the same period last year. The adjusted third quarter 2013 earnings excluded $23 million pretax for cumulative pension settlement expenses resulting from the level of employee lump-sum retirement distributions occurring in 2013. The adjusted third quarter 2012 earnings excluded $33 million of pretax pension settlement expenses and a $183 million pretax gain on the settlement of items relating to the sale of most of our Minnesota assets in 2010.","The earnings walk on Chart 5 -- on Slide 5, shows by segment, the change in adjusted earnings from the third quarter of 2012 to the third quarter of 2013. The primary driver for the change in our adjusted earnings was the decrease in income from our Refining & Marketing segment, partially offset by an increase in income from our Speedway and Pipeline Transportation segments and lower income taxes.","As shown on Slide 6, Refining & Marketing segment income from operations was $227 million in the third quarter of 2013, compared with just under $1.7 billion in the third quarter of 2012. We've expanded this chart to show both price and volume impasse. The change from 2012 was primarily due to lower crack spreads, narrower crude differentials and lower product price realizations, partially offset by increased volumes due in large part to the acquisition of the Galveston Bay refinery, along with operations at the Detroit refinery.","The unfavorable earnings impacts associated with the lower crack spreads and narrowing crude oil differentials are found in the price columns for the following 4 market metrics: LLS 6-3-2-1 crack, the sweet\/sour differential, the LLS to WTI differential and the LLS prompt versus delivered column. All of these indicators utilize spot market values. As a result, differences in our actual product price realizations and our actual crude cost quarter-to-quarter are reflected in the Other Gross Margin column.","So let me make a few comments about each of these items. First, our product price realizations compared to spot market values were lower in the third quarter of this year than in the third quarter of last year, due in part to the impact of renewable identification numbers or RINs. RIN prices averaged approximately $0.085 on a per E10 gallon basis for the third quarter 2013, compared to $0.015 per gallon in the third quarter of 2012. Our cash cost for the RINs we purchased to meet our RFS obligation was approximately $25 million per month for the third quarter of 2013.","We continue to believe that the traditional crack spreads using neat gasoline and distillate spot market values versus the biofuel blends that are actually sold likely overstate refiners' earnings due to the impact of RINs.","Second, our actual crude and feedstock acquisition cost compared to the market indicators were more favorable during the 2013 third quarter than they were in the comparable period last year.","The increase in direct operating costs quarter-over-quarter, is primarily due to the acquisition of the Galveston Bay refinery and is consistent with our guidance. On the next 2 slides, we provide earnings walks for each of our other operating segments.","Slide 7 show Speedway's income from operations was $102 million in the third quarter of 2013 compared with $76 million the third quarter of 2012. Speedway's light product gross margin was $27 million higher in the third quarter of 2013 compared with the third quarter of 2012. This increase was primarily due to a $0.03 per gallon higher gross margin.","Merchandise margin was $224 million in the third quarter of 2013 compared with $217 million during the same period last year. This $7 million increase was primarily due to margin expansion from increasing merchandise and food sales.","On a same-store basis, gasoline sales volumes were up 1% in the third quarter 2013 compared with 2012 third quarter. Speedway's same-store merchandise sales, excluding cigarettes, increased 5.6% over the third quarter last year, which is noteworthy, considering the third quarter last year was up 4.1% from the same quarter in 2011. Speedway's average retail gasoline price during the third quarter of 2013 was $3.44 compared to $3.62 in the same period last year.","Slide 8 shows changes in our Pipeline Transportation segment income. Income from operations was $54 million in the third quarter of 2013 compared with $52 million in the third quarter of 2012. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in transportation tariffs offset by higher operating expenses and depreciation. A portion of the increase in transportation tariffs is related to the formation of MPLX.","A number of items that made up the unfavorable operating expense variance, the largest of which were costs now incurred by MPLX as a standalone entity.","Slide 9 presents the significant drivers of changes in our cash flow for the third quarter of 2013. At September 30, 2013, our cash balance was just over $2 billion. Operating cash flow before changes in working capital was up $475 million source of cash. As shown on this slide, the primary driver of the reduction in cash balance for the third quarter is the over $1 billion of cash used for share repurchases that Gary Heminger highlighted earlier.","Slide 10 shows that at the end of the third quarter, we had just over $2 billion of cash and approximately $3.4 billion of debt. With EBITDA of almost $4.8 billion during the last 12 months, we continue to be in a very manageable debt position, with leverage of 0.7x EBITDA and a debt to total capital ratio of 23%.","Turning to Slide 11. During the last 12 months, we generated nearly $4.1 billion in cash from operations and $1.3 billion of free cash flow. Over that same period, we returned over $3.3 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. This was about 2.5x our free cash flow over that period. During the third quarter 2013, we purchased approximately 14 million shares for about $1 billion through open market repurchases. It is our intention to continue returning capital to our shareholders that is not currently needed in the business.","Slide 12 provides outlook information on key operating metrics for MPC for the fourth quarter of 2013. For competitive purposes, those same metrics for the fourth quarter of 2012 are also shown. As you can see, turnaround costs are expected to be substantial in the fourth quarter at approximately $350 million or just over $2 per barrel of total throughput.","Looking forward, we also expect significant turnaround costs in the first quarter of 2014, estimated to approximate $500 million. The October market data document will be published tomorrow on our investor website.","Our mission continues to be value creation for our shareholders. We are committed to pursuing opportunities to create near and long-term value and believe the returns to our shareholders reflect that focus. We will be balanced and disciplined in our approach to capital allocation as we continue to assess the opportunities in front of us.","And now, I will return the call back to Pam Beall.","Pamela K. M. Beall","Okay. Thank you, Don. [Operator Instructions] With that, I'll open up the call to questions. Cliff?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ed Westlake from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","My first comment is actually on the MLP, I don't know if you -- I'm sure you've seen the market response to the other transactions that we've seen in the MLP space. I'm thinking Devon and Crosstex being a little bit more aggressive in terms of bringing forward the value of the MLP. Does that change the way you're thinking about your sort of progressive drop-down strategy?","Garry L. Peiffer","Yes, Ed. This is Garry Peiffer. Sure, we're watching all those transactions and activities very closely and considering that, when we set our growth -- annual distribution growth targets, and I think you know in those cases, we just celebrated essentially today, our 1 year anniversary, so we've only been in the MLP space for a relatively short period of time but we watch them all. And that's why I think in the last quarter, we gave a little more definitive guidance to the market when we said that we're projecting annual distribution growth in the 15% to 20% range for at least the next several years, to give a little more specificity, if you will, to what we're expecting and how we're expecting to grow the MLP. So we're definitely watching, aware of and analyzing all those activities.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then a specific question on the data pack and the RIN distortions. Obviously RIN prices have pulled back thanks to what it seems like the EPA is looking to do. Have you started to see those distortions versus the data back on the pricing reduce?","Garry L. Peiffer","Yes. This is Garry, again. Yes, definitely. I think yesterday RINs we assessed maybe about $0.25 a gallon per RIN or about $0.025 per E10 gallon. In the third quarter, we averaged closer to about $0.85 or so and that was about the same in the second quarter. So the distortion that you saw in the second and third quarter is obviously less at $0.025 a gallon versus $0.085 a gallon so I think we're getting better clarity of what impact that has on the bottom line. And as you know, we've talked last time, it's really an impact whether you write a check to acquire RIN or you sell at the wholesale level, that effect really comes through financially, no matter which way you go about acquiring your RINs.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So your thought process is that the RIN has been driving these distortions, it's not other factors such as gasoline oversupply, et cetera?","Garry L. Peiffer","Well, I think that's obviously affecting the overall market but I think the distortion, when you try to translate the gross, neat, spot values into a bottom line profit after RINs, that's where the distortion comes in.","Operator","Our next question comes from Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Maybe a follow-up to Ed's question and on a longer-term basis, given your higher multiple MPLX, it translates to a lower yield, it all relates to the parent affiliation with MPC and the drop-down potential there. I mean, do you believe MPLX, over the longer term, is a natural consolidator within the midstream space?","Gary R. Heminger","Evan, this is Gary. Yes, we do and as we continue to follow MPLX and back to Ed's question, certainly, we're following everything that's in the marketplace and as we discussed many times with our logistics assets that we have inside of MPC, as well as the remaining ownership that we have, this -- not the drop-down yet, into MPLX from our initial start of the company, we have much flexibility in many avenues in which we can turn. On top of that, I think it's very important to understand, we're working on many organic opportunities. As we stated when we first started this company, this was not just going to be a drop-down story of MPC assets. We are working very hard and expect to be able to give you some more color when we're together in early December around that strategy. So again, it's not just around MPC, it's what we can do to grow this business and really tee it up for the long-term. And as I said, we'll give you more information on that when we're together in early December.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, perfect. Second question on capital allocation. That was an aggressive buyback in the quarter, as representing a much higher percentage of relative free cash flow. I mean, could you talk about that change? I mean are you making a statement that you believe weaker 3Q conditions are transitory and you're using associated weakness to retire shares? And in addition to the cash that remains on the balance sheet, do you also view MLP-able assets as another potential source of liquidity that could fund a lot of different things, including a buyback? [indiscernible]","Donald C. Templin","Yes. Evan, this is Don. I mean, we have consistently said that we are committed to returning cash that's in excess of the needs of our business and core liquidity needs to our investors, and we've discussed a number of times, our view around sort of our core liquidity needs, including the cash balance that needs to support that core liquidity needs. And the activity that we've been undertaking really in the last 12 to 18 months has been very focused at getting our cash balance down, working it down and returning that excess cash that isn't being deployed to the business to our shareholders. I do think that we have a lot of tools in the future that are available to allow us, in addition to sort of our strong earnings growth profile and what we think we continue to grow in the midstream, MPLX is a great tool and we can generate cash by dropping assets down to support return of capital to shareholders. We have LP units, as you know, that we can monetize if we need to. So I feel great about our ability, over the long term, to continue to return capital to our shareholders in a very disciplined way.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Great. One last, if I might. Just can you provide an update on turnarounds in the quarter? I believe Garry, it was your only asset currently in turnaround. Any update when you expect to exit there or what the -- more of the utilization impact in the quarter might be other than what you already gave as you said was a turnaround of events? I'll leave it there.","Donald C. Templin","With respect to the utilization impact, our outlook information, that includes the projected crude throughput at the refinery. So that data that we projected forward there includes the volumes or decrease in volumes arising from the turnaround. We don't give specific information on which refinery it is and how long the turnaround lasts.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Sankey from Deutsche Bank.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","We've done a little work over the past 3 years on crude discounts and I think we buy into the idea, obviously, of a structural discount of U.S. crude to international. Our concern is the product markets, in your case, particularly around Chicago and whether or not we may just end up with an oversupply of product in those internal markets. Gary, can you talk a bit more about how you can mitigate the risk of products oversupply inland U.S. as a way of maintaining excess profit and refining, as opposed to just cheap crudes simply leading to cheap gasoline?","Gary R. Heminger","Right. Well, that's a very delicate situation, as you outlined, Paul. What we could do to mitigate is really a strategy that we have employed for many years. Being one of the larger suppliers into the Midwest PADD II and having pipeline logistics that we can move from PADD III into PADD II and then using our barge system that we also can move products out of PADD II, we optimize every day and we are a big buyer of additional products in the Midwest, as well. And over the years, what we have done to mitigate that is to be able to take advantage of excess -- at times, excess product, mainly gasoline. Distillate is fairly balanced in PADD II, but mainly gasoline. If there's excess product available, we buy it for different turnaround cycles, different maintenance cycles and we can deploy that around the Midwest instead of shipping it up from the South. I'm sure that you have noticed over time that pipeline shipments from the South in various of the big common carrier systems has certainly declined over time and that's because of the way we have tried to resupply some of those markets by using that product in the Midwest. I will agree with you that when you look at the shoulder quarters and especially the inventory that was in place, as I said in my talk earlier, the inventory that was in place over the summer, building for hurricanes just don't build inventory in the Gulf Coast for hurricanes but in the form of either crude or refined products. We moved that up into some of the Midwest terminals, as well. So as that inventory was there and you reduce that inventory and use it up, it's -- I think that is what has caused some of the downturn in the crack spreads over this period of time. But those are the types of things that we have done to try to mitigate and be a leader in the marketplace.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes, I guess, it speaks to your integration strategy. The follow-on question which is beyond on the obvious question, which would be on product exports. Can you talk about the dynamics there? How much they're growing, how the outlook looks, and what you're doing to invest in increasing those exports?","Gary R. Heminger","Yes, let's have Mike Palmer talk about this.","C. Michael Palmer","Yes, Paul, and I know you've seen our numbers and obviously, we've been growing these exports considerably, probably more than anybody expected over the last couple of years. And I can tell you that we have no shortage of opportunities to export both distillate and gasoline. Things are looking real good in that area. We are doing things to debottleneck that allow us to export more over the docks. We have an export tank that's coming on at Garyville that will allow us to export gasoline more than we do today. We see this as a core part of our business and we would expect to continue to grow it.","Operator","This question comes from Paul Cheng from Barclays.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Real quick. If I'm looking at in the third quarter, comparing to the market data, it seems like sequential data, the second quarter, your margin capture rate actually is somewhat better. Is there any particular factors that we should be aware?","Garry L. Peiffer","Paul, this is Garry Peiffer. Nothing that strikes me off the top directly. I guess, the one thing that probably has happened is kind of like we talked about earlier in terms of the RINs. I think there's better -- a little bit better understanding of the RINs effect going on between the second quarter and the third quarter, which was similar and the value of those RINs were similar. So I think the market, as you know, it takes a while for it to get a little clarity when you have a sudden shock to the system like when the WTI LLS spreads collapsed or when these RINs kind of enter into the equation and everything takes a little bit of time to recalibrate itself and I think that's going on now. The people understand impact of RINs on spot market prices, on crack spreads and on people's bottom lines. So I think it's more's maybe the market is getting itself a little more acclimated and recalibrated to this new world of -- you have to consider RINs in the calculation of how much you charge and how much you make.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Garry, in the second quarter, one of the factor that you guys point out hurting your reseller stand [ph], rest of the Midwest region where your refinery locate, the porter prices did not move up as much as Chicago, so regional differences. And I think in the third quarter, that still have that issue. So what have you seen so far in the quarter? Have we start to see the reversal that the rest of the Midwest market catch up with the Chicago pricing?","Gary R. Heminger","Paul, this Gary. What we have seen -- and you're right, and I think it goes back to the discussion I had before about mitigating prices due to -- at times, excess supply in PADD II. As we go in now to PADD IV and just looking here at some of the terminal prices, we are seeing a rebound in both gas and distillate pricing so far here in the fourth quarter. And again, it's using up that inventory that was on hand for hurricane and other weather impacts, so we...","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Gary, I guess my question is more on that. Let's say if I'm looking at country [ph] or Ohio, is the port of pricing relative to Chicago return back to a more historical level now? Or that they are still being disadvantaged, as what we have seen in the second quarter and perhaps in the third quarter?","Gary R. Heminger","Go ahead, Mike.","C. Michael Palmer","Paul, we're trying to understand what you're asking. Are you asking about wholesale rack prices?","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Yes. I mean, what I'm saying is that in the second quarter then you guys pinpoint upon a -- or highlight one of the reason behind why you did not capture as much as what the market indicators suggest is that in the Midwest market, you think that Chicago porter pricing as a benchmark, but that the rest of the Midwest market in the second quarter did not rise up to the same extent. So that there's a regional basis different between the rest of the Midwest and the Chicago pricing. And my question is that the have we seen that trend be worse?","Gary R. Heminger","Yes. I'm sorry, Paul. We now understand your question.","Garry L. Peiffer","And I guess -- this is Garry, again. I guess, in the second quarter, we had pretty sudden increases in prices in the Midwest driven by some turnaround activity primarily, plus compounded by a bit of the confusion related to the RINs. So I think that has been mitigated in the third quarter. And I think as we've looked at the demand, we see demand as being relatively good for gasoline here in the last few months. So I think all those things are translating in a little bit better realization in terms of how much we put in our pocket at the end of the day versus those spot market values, unlike that sudden run-up in the second quarter for Chicago.","Operator","Our next question comes from Doug Leggate from Bank of America.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Garry Heminger, you were very early to share your thoughts about the structural discount on crude pricing. I wonder if could just ask you to bring us up-to-date with your latest thoughts and specifically, what I'm thinking is the view that you take as to how the discounts are crossing grades, particularly towards sour grades in the Gulf Coast and how that might perhaps change the way you think about your slate going forward.","Gary R. Heminger","Sure. And you're right, Doug. We've talked about this and maybe we're one of the early ones to come out and chat. Let me turn this over to Mike because Mike has a lot more detail in the crude markets right now. So Mike, if you'll take that question.","C. Michael Palmer","Okay, and Doug, I want to be sure I understand your question. Are you interested about sour spreads in the Gulf Coast?","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Basically. Because it's not just -- obviously, it appears that with LLS with a discount to Brent, that everything that typically trades on the Gulf Coast is not pricing off LLS. I just wanted to get your perspective as to how sustainable you think that may be and how it might change your views to keep yourself going forward.","C. Michael Palmer","Well, again, coming back to this whole LLS situation and I would throw Mars into the same package, I think. One of the things that's happening right now in the Gulf Coast, I mean obviously, you've seen these very wide LLS to Brent spreads. I mean, we're talking $10, $11. And that's -- we think that's pretty unusual right now. And the inventories on the Gulf Coast, the crude inventories are very high. There was a massive amount of turnaround activity that took place. I think there was something like 700,000 barrels a day of refining capacity that was off-line for a period here in October. And that's led to near record-high inventories on the Gulf and I think as a result of that, you've seen LLS spreads that have been extremely wide relative to Brent. We've said for some time that structurally, as the production of the shale plays continues, we've said for some time that we expect LLS to trade at a discount to Brent. And we still believe that and that should be several dollars. So we think that, that's going to be a benefit longer-term. It's probably something that, as these inventories start to come down, you'll probably see this $10, $11 spread start to come back together again. Now LLS and Mars -- and Mars obviously being the sour crude in the Gulf, those 2 have traded in a very similar trade differential over the last several months. It's been that $4.50 to $6.50 kind of level. It hasn't changed very much.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I appreciate your comments on that. Gary if I could use my follow-up to talk about -- something that doesn't get a lot of attention often as a retail business. As it relates to your growth plans, some time ago, you had mentioned that you were -- you saw a very competitive and attractive business in the Hess retail network. I don't want to be too specific here, but I'm just wondering, how are you feeling currently about expanding your retail business both organically or through acquisition? I'll leave it there.","Gary R. Heminger","Well, as I said earlier in my speech, Doug, we have expanded into both Tennessee and Western Pennsylvania. With our Canton refinery with Utica Shale and moving this product into Western Pennsylvania, especially as you see some of the logistics change from the East Coast that used to bring refined product back to Western Pennsylvania, we have seen a great opportunity to move into that market. And Speedway has done so, same as in Tennessee. So they're expanding those markets as well as continuing to fill in the flanks, if you will, in the current markets in which we have operated. More so with rebuilds stations than with new builds in those states. But we're going to continue to step out with Speedway. I doubt that we will do a leapfrog of several states unless we can do something that has some market density. Your question pertaining to Hess, my compliments to John Hess, he has developed, I think, one of the best looking retail chains across the eastern seaboard. And we'll just continue to see what plays out as they make their strategic decisions on that part. But as I say, my hats off to them. I think they have one of the best looking systems on the East Coast.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Good fit with Marathon, Gary?","Gary R. Heminger","I'm sorry?","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Would it be a good fit with Marathon?","Gary R. Heminger","I think it would be an excellent fit. We'd be an excellent fit with Speedway. Marathon is the upper side of our business whereas Speedway is the company-owned and operated side. So we'd be a good fit there.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chi Chow from Macquarie Capital.","Chi Chow - Macquarie Research","I got a question on Galveston Bay. Gary, you mentioned this in your remarks but can you talk more about specifics on the opportunities you're undertaking at the plant now that you've had it for 9 months? And in particular, I'm interested in what sort of crude changes you've made so far.","Gary R. Heminger","Sure, Chi. And that's a very fair question. And what we've decided to do, Chi, we have several things to talk about at Galveston Bay. Instead of using the conference or earnings call here to the talk about this, this is going to be one of the primary things we discuss at our meeting in December. So if I could ask your forgiveness to give me 6 weeks and we'll give you a lot more detail. Out of the synergies that we've been able to capture so far, the different crude runs we've been able to change and capture that Mike's group has done and then Rich's group on what some of the opportunities are as we see, to really capture additional, what we see, potential value. That's really going to be one of the centerpieces of our presentation in December.","Chi Chow - Macquarie Research","Okay. Gary, you're forgiven on that one. Let me try this one on Galveston Bay. Can you just, from a modeling standpoint, going forward here, how does Galveston Bay now impact the capture rate of your system relative to the historical pattern? Any comments on that end?","Gary R. Heminger","Well, as you know, we have not given individual refining information and our plan is competitively -- and I know there are several of you that -- and probably all of you, that will like us to give individual refining information going forward and we're not -- our plan is at this time, not to do that. I think Garry might have some comments about the capture rate itself.","Garry L. Peiffer","I guess, Chi -- this is Garry Peiffer. What we've given in the way of some market metrics in terms of some moves in crack spreads and sweet\/sours, we've incorporated in those calculations, our best estimates of what the Galveston Bay refinery impact is on those metrics. So we try to incorporate those into the metrics we've given already and when crack spreads change $1, we're saying that's roughly a $450 million or $425 million bottom-line effect. And so those all metrics, they all incorporate our best estimate of Galveston Bay.","Gary R. Heminger","And Chi, just a year ago, when we were outlining Galveston Bay and what our plans were, and then we closed that transaction February. I'll leave a little bit forward here and talk about -- we're very pleased with the operation of the plant and how it's performing on a volumetric basis. We've gone in and repaired and really brought this refinery up to our standards in many areas. As I said, this was not a dash that we were entering, this was going to be a journey and this was going to be a longer-term run here. And so that's why we're going to outline for you in December, what some of the opportunities are. But I would say, no surprises. We continue to gather synergies at a faster clip than we had expected and we're very pleased with the asset to date.","Chi Chow - Macquarie Research","Don, on the CapEx budget, are you still at -- I think it was a little over $1.6 billion for 2013, is that still accurate?","Donald C. Templin","Yes, Chi, that's an accurate budget and what we'll do at our December Investor Day, we'll plan to give you the '14 budget, as well, that we have a board meeting coming up where that gets approved and the timing of that meeting was scheduled so that we could communicate the '14 budget to you all.","Chi Chow - Macquarie Research","Okay. Well, that suggests a pretty high capital spend in the fourth quarter. Can you give any details on sort of the components of that spending in 4Q and...","Donald C. Templin","I guess, in terms of your -- I guess, I'd interpret your question, do you think you'll go over your $1.6 billion? I mean, we are not expecting to go over the $1.6 billion. We might come under that $1.6 billion, if that's your question.","Chi Chow - Macquarie Research","Well, no. I was just -- given the spending through third quarter here today, it's just suggesting a significant bump up in the fourth quarter from what I see, so I'm just wondering the components of that spending. And then, maybe if you can reminds us of what your minimum cash balance is that you're comfortable with, you may have mentioned that earlier though.","Donald C. Templin","Yes, in the minimum -- on the core liquidity, I think we've consistently said that we believe that the core liquidity for MPC is somewhere in the $4.5 billion to $5 billion range, and that's currently satisfied by the $2.5 billion revolver, the $1 billion AR securitization and then the cash balance makes up the rest of that commitment. So I think we've said $1 billion to $1.5 billion of cash is what we believe -- is sort of a core component of our balance sheet.","Garry L. Peiffer","And, Chi, this is Garry Peiffer. Regarding the capital, just by the way we've historically constructed things and being here in the Midwest with a lot of sea stores that we're building at the moment, it's fairly traditional that we tend to spend not necessarily half, but a good share of our budget in the fourth quarter finishing up projects that we don't necessarily start in a lot of cases till the second quarter. So I have every confidence that we will spend close to the $1.6 billion, barring some major issue that we're not aware of at this point.","Operator","Our next question comes from Doug Terreson from ISI.","Douglas Terreson - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Gary, this might be the same question that Chi just asked, but it's a little bit different but if you want to defer, that's fine. But when I think about Galveston Bay and the longer-term perspective there and I guess the questions' really about, has your perspective on the scoped had value longer-term changed? And I asked the question because you guys significantly surpassed everybody's expectations at Garyville during the past 4 or 5 years that [ph] on production growth and capital productivity. So the question is when you think about this longer term, do you sense that there may be a parallel -- I mean I know that the movement continues at Garyville today and performance is fantastic but might we see a similar type of outcome at Galveston Bay whether it be additional debottlenecking or petrochemicals that is over and above some of the things that you commonly talk about when you refer to synergies?","Gary R. Heminger","Well, Doug, that's a very fair question. Again, I want to be very careful that we don't lean too far forward here until we're ready to make a full, sum presentation on Galveston Bay. But let me ask Rich Bedell here to make a few comments.","Richard D. Bedell","Doug, just looking at Galveston Bay, it has a lot of the similarities in that it's got the size, it has the complexity, it has the logistical options, both for all the crudes that are coming into the area and also the logistical options to export products. So in that regard, it has a lot of the same qualities that Garyville has. And I think if we think long term, where we're thinking of having 2 powerhouse Gulf Coast refineries there with a lot of crude, a lot of upgrading capacity and a lot of export potential, and that's our vision.","Douglas Terreson - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's great. We'll look forward to seeing the details in December.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Dietert from Simmons.","Jeffrey A. Dietert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","I was hoping I could get you to talk a little bit about the rail strategy. You've obviously got a big logistical footprint existing but you haven't been as aggressive as some of the peers in buying new rail cars and announcing new rail unloading facilities. So your responses seem to be more muted. Are you less excited about the potential for rail than others in the industry or do you believe that people are underestimating the cost or could you talk a little bit about your rail strategy?","C. Michael Palmer","Yes, Jeff. This is Mike Palmer, I'd be happy to do that. We have spent a lot of time doing analysis and really looking at rails. It's not as if we haven't done that. In fact, I can tell you that we have -- we've even experimented with rail. We've brought in both North Dakota crude into the system, we've brought some heavy Canadian into the system by rail. So we've watched it, we've looked at the costs, but I can tell you that it is a high-cost transportation alternative. And maybe one of the reasons that we're a little different than others is that we are pretty well connected by pipeline. And I think that everybody in the industry would agree that with rail, it can't compete with pipe if you have pipe that's connected to your refining system and that's really where we're at. So we always look at it, we can continue to look at it to see if there's any opportunities. But by and large, we are well connected to pipelines and we're kind of committed to that strategy.","Gary R. Heminger","And Jeff, we've previously talked about the SAX extension. We've been public about that and things we're working on as to everyday is to provide a cheaper alternative. And if rail's a cheaper alternative, we certainly were to -- would be investing in that. But where our refineries are and the way we're situated, totally agree with Mike's comments. We're blessed with a very strong midstream system, continue to grow that midstream system and we'll more than likely do that with pipes and possibly barges rather than rail.","Operator","Our next question comes from Roger Read from Wells Fargo.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I guess maybe following up on the logistics question. Could you give us a little more of an idea maybe of, kind of the volumes you're starting to see in the Utica? I know you've talked historically about maybe being able to use about 30,000 barrels a day of condensate without additional investments in the units there. Are you seeing enough barrels now moving forward with this pipeline that we should expect to see some investments in the units to maybe, expand the number of barrels of condensate or very light oil?","C. Michael Palmer","Roger, this is Mike Palmer again. Yes, the answer is absolutely. We're still very optimistic about the Utica and I think as you know, there have been a lot more wells permitted and drilled and are actually producing and that's have been a result really, of the gas takeaway capacity. That's coming on so we have been ramping up. At Canton today at the truck rack, I think we're bringing in roughly 10,000 barrels a day of mostly condensate. If you look at Catlettsburg, we just brought in our first barge over the Wellsville dock and that will continue. So I think that what we expect is that over -- certainly over '14 and '15, as this gas infrastructure gets hooked up, these wells will come on and we will be ramping up the volume of condensate that we can process at these plants.","Donald C. Templin","And Roger, this is Don. In fact, we have 2 capital projects that we talked about. Condensate, splitters that both Canton and Catlettsburg that get our -- allow us to probably use up to 60,000 barrels a day of condensate. We staged them 1 for completion in '14 and 1 for completion in '15, really to be consistent with our expectations around the increase and the growth in that Utica production.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And could you probably go into a little more detail than you want to do, but if you could give us any idea maybe, of the advantage that you're able to achieve on condensate in that part of the country relative to say, other markers, WTI, Syncrude, something like that.","Donald C. Templin","Yes, Roger, we really don't get into the pricing on individual crudes. As you could expect, Utica is a WTI based kind of crude and being a condensate, you're going to get a discount. But we really don't want to share more than that.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And I guess my final question, you talked earlier about exports as much as you can or -- I don't remember the exact wording but I was curious, as you look out, say, 2 years, where you think your exports might be versus where your exports are today.","Gary R. Heminger","Well, the big thing, Roger, with our exports, when we built our GME project and started up in '09, we built a brand new dock. At the time, we thought that the dock had a capacity of about 75,000 barrels per day. We've been able to de-bottleneck, we've been able to add some incremental tankage. And in fact, Rich has a big gasoline tank that will done at the end of this year, early part of next year, to even provide us more flexibility. So what we have done is we've been able to de-bottleneck the Garyville docks, using the crude and other product dock space to be able to optimize way beyond what we thought. We have the same thing at Galveston Bay and we're continuing to optimize Galveston Bay and then we have a big study on how sort -- your question is asking number of years down the road. We have a big study on how we can optimize Galveston Bay's dock down the road to be able to get more capacity. So every quarter, the guys tell me we're at capacity and we find ways to get more out of the plants and over the docs. So we will continue to do that.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","If I missed it earlier, did you give an export number for this quarter?","Gary R. Heminger","Yes. We were 245,000 barrels per day for this quarter.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And the breakdown between gasoline and diesel?","Gary R. Heminger","We don't break that down.","Pamela K. M. Beall","Cliff, do we have another question?","Operator","We do have a question from Faisel Khan from Citigroup.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just given your expanded, sort of position in the Gulf Coast and your preference to use pipelines rather than rail, do you think that you need to expand, sort of your pipeline capacity portfolio, your lease capacity and even some of the investments you're making right now? Is there a need for expansion beyond kind of what you're doing or what you have right now?","Gary R. Heminger","Well, Faisel, there are many pipeline projects being talked about, especially in the Gulf Coast. A lot of people announced projects before they had done sometimes. A lot of competition for pipeline capacity coming out of the Eagle Ford. There's some pipeline reversals and some incremental pipelines being discussed in between LOOP and in the Houston ship channel. The SAX pipeline that we already talked about is going to give us that niche that is missing today to be able to get us to get to more crude eventually down into the Gulf Coast area. So there are many opportunities going, some that we're looking at being investors in through MPLX and some that might just be shipping on. And I'll ask Mike to -- maybe to add a little more color here.","C. Michael Palmer","Yes, Faisel, I guess what I would say too, is that if you look at the plans that various companies have for pipeline activity in the Gulf coast and you think about our Galveston Bay plant, certainly you've seen the pipelines that are being built from the Permian Basin into Houston. The Longhorn reversal, there's another pipeline called BridgeTex that will be coming on next year. There is a lot of capacity for us to utilize in order to bring, for example, the Permian Basin crude into Galveston Bay. The Eagle Ford infrastructure, there's a lot there already, as I'm sure you know, and then it's supplemented with vessels, with barges. And the other thing that you need to think about as well is for example, the big pipelines that are getting built from Canada to come down. Obviously, XL [ph] has not been approved yet. No one knows for sure if it will but Enbridge as a Gulf Coast access project where they're going to build a new piece of pipe from South Chicago down to Cushing. They're going to loop the Seaway line. It provides and a lot of additional capacity into that Houston, Galveston Bay area. And I'm sure that there will be smaller things that we need to do ourselves in the area. But there's some major assets that are being built.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. Fair enough. Last question for me, and it's just a little more of a controversial question I mean, with all this crude sort of hitting the Gulf Coast by pipeline and sort of production growth continuing to accelerate in the U.S., do you have any -- Gary, do you have any opinions on the crude oil export ban in the U.S. and whether you think there's any chance that something happens to that ban or do you just think that it just stays the same?","Gary R. Heminger","Well, there continues to be discussion, obviously, with the RIN issue and all the work that we've done inside of the beltway on the RIN issue. There's been some discussion at the same time about exporting crude. We'll see. We're really exporting crude today. It just happens to look like refined product and that is the mechanism to export crude today. We'll see where it goes. I think it's more than likely down the road that, that would even be considered. The second thing you look at is if you were to export crude, whether the markets that are really clamoring for types of light sweet crude that are available today. And I think Mike outlined it very well when he was talking about the number of the pipelines in the Eagle Ford to the Permian, trying to get this into the refining suite that uses these types of crudes is really what's going on right now. But we will wait and see what happens on the crude side. There's not a lot of discussion on it right now.","Operator","We have time for one more question. Our question comes from Allen Good from Morningstar.","Allen Good - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Just a quick one on the retail. Is there any way to gauge your appetite for increasing the size of Speedway. Whether it be a number of stores or percent of the shirt sales or anything along those lines we could sort of get an idea of how far you want to take the acquisition strategy and grow that business?","Gary R. Heminger","Well, Allen, what we have said about Speedway and the Marathon Brand also is that we think it's important to continue to increase the amount of -- our definition is called controlled volume. That's where we can use our pipeline assets, our terminal assets, our refining assets in order to be able to have a steady, gradable movement of that product into the marketplace. And we would like to grow that number, get it back up into the 70% or so range. We used to be at about 65% before we bought Galveston Bay. Granted, we got a number of retail stores or retail supply, I should say, to the Marathon Brand when we bought Galveston Bay. But that number is probably down in the high 50% to 60% type range today. So we have a strong appetite to continue to grow. We think Speedway continues to show very strong return on invested capital-type numbers and expect that into the future. And we think retail in the future is really going to be -- the winners in that market are the ones who are going to have the best back room and the best cost control. And I think Speedway ranks up there in both of those as a top-tier, best-in-class performer. But the amount of capital it's going to take, as I said earlier in my comments, be hard for us to leapfrog markets just to go buy a chain somewhere that does not give us synergies that we have today. But we do have a strong appetite to grow our retail.","Allen Good - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","And when you add incremental stores, are you gaining operating leverage as you add more stores to that business or it's just a case of adding incremental sales and earnings per store?","Gary R. Heminger","No, we're increasing operating leverage, as well. As long as it's contiguous to the operations we have today and that's why I say we find our economics -- it does not benefit us to leapfrog into a market that we don't have density in. So yes, we do get operating leverage and it's because we think we have a very sophisticated, low-cost backroom platform that manages inventory, manages the stores and Tony Kenney and his team have been, I think, have outperformed this market. When you look at a total margin per gallon or margin per merchandise dollars sold, I think that they stand at -- they're definitely a top-tier performer.","Allen Good - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","If I could just -- one quick one on exports. I believe previously you said or may have been last year, that exports are pretty evenly split between Europe and Latin America. Is that still the case or are you opening up new markets or has demand shifted from maybe Europe to Latin America or vice versa?","Gary R. Heminger","It's hard to say because the manifest that we have -- we're loading FOB Garyville or FOB Galveston Bay. In some cases, we're selling to the end-user in both markets but in some cases, we're selling to an aggregator who might be moving it into markets that we're not aware of. So I can't say right now what the split is.","Operator","I would now like to turn the call back over to Pam Beall for closing remarks.","Pamela K. M. Beall","Yes. Thank you, Cliff.

[Operator Instructions] Please note that the conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Pam Beall, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Beall, you may begin.","Pamela K. M. Beall","Thank you, Dawn. And welcome, everyone, to Marathon Petroleum Corporation's Second Quarter Conference Call. The synchronized slides that accompany this call can be found on our website, marathonpetroleum.com. On the call today are Gary Heminger, President and Chief Executive Officer; Garry Peiffer, Executive Vice President of Corporate Planning and Investor and Government Relations; Don Templin, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Mike Palmer, Senior Vice President of Supply, Distribution and Planning.","Please read the Safe Harbor statement you'll find on Slide 2. It's a reminder that we will be making forward-looking statements during the presentation and during the question-and-answer session. Actual results may differ materially from what we expect today, and factors that could cause actual results to differ are included here as well as in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","Now I'll turn the call over to Gary Heminger for opening remarks. Gary?","Gary R. Heminger","Thank you, Pam, and good morning to everyone.","The second quarter ended June 30 marked our 1-year anniversary as a standalone public company. During this first year, we have created significant value for our shareholders, and we continue to take steps to do so well into the future.","We had a strong second quarter in both our R&M and Speedway segments. Don will review the results in more detail, but I want to say that the strong results are no coincidence. Our geographic footprint and the logistics assets that connect our operations give us unique and significant operational flexibility to capture value wherever it exists throughout the value chain such as allowing us to access -- allowing us access to price-advantage crude. In addition, our Gulf Coast presence gives us the ability to make fuel sales into higher-value export markets where our sales increased 110,000 barrels per day in the second quarter. And we believe these are enduring advantages.","Since becoming a standalone company, our shareholder focus and perspective on capital allocation have been consistent. We will continue to carefully manage our projected capitalization and liquidity position to support our long-term strategic intent to maintain an investment grade credit profile and protect our business from volatility in the refining industry and the capital markets. We will also evaluate organic investment opportunities as well as selective acquisitions that complement our existing operations, leverage our knowledge of the markets in which we operate and provide appropriate returns, further enhancing the value proposition to our shareholders. We will continue to balance investments in our business with returning capital to shareholders.","We are very pleased that, over the past 12 months, we have returned over $1 billion of capital to shareholders, which represented over 3\/4 of our free cash flow. This was accomplished through a combination of a 25% increase to our base dividend last November and a share repurchase program announced in February. We recently completed an $850 million accelerated share repurchase program through which 20.4 million shares or 6% of our initial shares outstanding were acquired at a volume-weighted average price of $41.75 per share. This was the initial phase of our $2 billion share repurchase authorization, leaving us $1.15 billion available under our current authorization. Under this existing authorization, we expect to repurchase shares opportunistically in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions from time to time which are subject to market conditions, corporate, regulatory and other considerations.","Part of our capital allocation strategy is to establish a growing base dividend that's sustainable for the economic cycles. We also believe our competitive position, the market dynamics and steps we are taking to further unlock shareholder value will allow us to generate significant free cash flow. It is for these reasons we recently announced another increase in the base dividend, this time by 40%. Based on yesterday's closing share price, our annualized cash dividend yield is approximately 3% and the total annualized capital return to shareholders is nearly 9%.","On July 2, we took an important strategic step for MPC and its shareholders. We filed a registration statement in anticipation of our proposed initial public offering of common units of a master limited partnership for MPLX LP. MPLX LP was formed initially with a planned contribution of an interest in certain onshore common carrier pipeline assets located in the Midwest and Gulf Coast regions of the U.S., along with a butane storage cavern near our Catlettsburg refinery. As our own subsidiary, MPLX LP was formed to be MPC's primary vehicle to own, operate, develop and acquire hydrocarbon-based pipelines and other midstream assets. Since the initial filing is preliminary and it has not been reviewed by the SEC, our remarks about the MLP on this call will be limited.","One of the key elements of our capital allocation strategy is investing in the business through organic projects and acquisitions. Disciplined investments in the business over many years have positioned MPC with the ability to generate earnings and cash flow throughout economic cycles.","We have a number of ongoing investments that provide visibility on continuing growth in earnings and cash flow. The most significant current capital project is the upgrade for our Detroit refinery which was approximately 96% complete as of June 30. This project remains on budget and on schedule, with the completion of the construction phase anticipated in the third quarter. Immediately following completion, a planned 70-day turnaround will enable us to tie in the new units, and we expect that the upgraded and expanded refinery to be online by year end.","This investment is focused on enhancing margins by allowing us to process lower-cost crude stock and capturing value from crude oil differentials. We believe this project will enable us to process an incremental 80,000 barrels per day of heavy crude, including Canadian bitumen-type crudes. In addition, this project increases Detroit's crude oil refining capacity about 15% to 120,000 barrels per day. Based on the historical average, heavy Canadian crude differentials from 2006 to 2010 and the average for 2011, this upgrade could add $200 million to the $350 million of EBITDA per year.","As we recently announced, we are celebrating the turnaround in our Robinson refinery from July to June, and this turnaround is now complete. One of the benefits of this acceleration was to increase the amount of time available before beginning our Detroit turnaround this fall.","Our Speedway retail operations continued to deliver best-in-class results and national recognition. The 2012 Harris Poll EquiTrend survey has named Speedway the Highest Ranked Convenience Store Brand in the nation. Speedway has been honored as the category leader in the survey for the last 3 years. However, this year, the company has been named Convenience Store Brand of the Year. And this is particularly notable as Speedway operates in only 7 states.","This is a business we -- in which we intend to invest and grow through acquisitions. Speedway acquired 87 GasAmerica locations in the second quarter and 10 Road Ranger store locations in mid-July. Both of these acquisitions are in Speedway's current markets and will leverage its support infrastructure as well as our field distribution logistics network.","We believe global demand for gasoline and distillates will continue to provide an opportunity to sell products into higher-value export markets, including Europe and Latin and South America. The investments we are making should further increase our export capability for diesel and gasoline. As we look forward to the remainder of 2012 and beyond, we believe the U.S. refiners with access to attractively priced crude oil and natural gas will have competitive cost advantages in the global markets for some time to come.","And now, I will turn the call over to Don Templin to provide a more detailed financial update on the quarter.","Donald C. Templin","Thanks, Gary.","Slide 4 provides net income and adjusted net income data both on an absolute and per share basis. Our second quarter 2012 adjusted net income of $867 million reflects a 6% increase from the $819 million we earned in the second quarter of 2011. Adjusted earnings per diluted share was $2.53 for the second quarter 2012 compared to $2.29 during the same period last year.","The second quarter 2012 earnings included an $83 million pretax adjustment for cumulative pension settlement expenses resulting from the level of employee lump sum retirement distributions that occurred in 2012. The second quarter 2011 earnings included a $17 million adjustment for the unfavorable tax impact of certain income -- state income tax changes that were enacted in 2011.","The waterfall chart on Slide 5 shows by segment the change in adjusted net income from the second quarter of 2011 to the second quarter of 2012. The primary drivers for the increase in our adjusted net income were the increases in income from our Refining & Marketing segment and from our Speedway segment, partially offset by higher interest and other corporate expenses.","Before I move to a discussion of the results of our operating segments, I wanted to comment briefly on the change in interest and other expense. The $48 million quarter-over-quarter change in interest and other items primarily relates to the absence of related-party dividend income generated when we were part of Marathon Oil Corporation and higher corporate-related costs associated with being a standalone company.","As shown on Slide 6, Refining & Marketing segment income from operations was $1.325 billion in the second quarter of 2012 compared with $1.26 billion in the second quarter of 2011. The change was the result of higher Refining & Marketing gross margin. In explaining the key components of the Refining & Marketing gross margin, I will refer to the changes in market indicators applied to MPC actual volumes to arrive at the quarter-over-quarter variances.","First, the blended LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spread was $2.93 per barrel higher in the second quarter of 2012 than the second quarter of 2011, resulting in an estimated favorable variance of $341 million. While the Chicago crack spread was $1.73 per barrel higher than the second quarter of 2011, the Gulf Coast crack spread was substantially higher, up $4.31 per barrel. The sweet\/sour differential declined slightly from just over $11 per barrel in the second quarter of 2011 to $10.50 in the second quarter of 2012, resulting in an unfavorable variance of $30 million.","WTI price-based crudes accounted for approximately 28% of the crude we processed during the 2012 second quarter, 2 percentage points higher than the second quarter of 2011. This increase in volume more than offset the lower per-barrel LLS-WTI differential and resulted in an estimated $6 million favorable gross margin variance between the 2 quarters.","The first 3 market indicators I discussed are calculated by reference to an LLS prompt price. Rapid changes in crude prices can cause significant differences between the LLS prompt prices embedded in the market indicators and the actual amount we pay. On average, the delivered LLS crude cost was $4 per barrel higher than the prompt LLS price during the second quarter of 2012 when compared to the second quarter of 2011. This accounted for an estimated unfavorable variance of $79 million.","Market structure also had a quarter-over-quarter effect on our gross margin. It was $0.33 per barrel less contained over the NYMEX WTI market structure in the second quarter of 2012 compared to the second quarter 2011 with an estimated unfavorable impact of $30 million.","Direct operating costs had an unfavorable quarter-over-quarter effect of $43 million primarily due to higher turnaround costs in the second quarter of 2012 compared with the second quarter of 2011. The other gross margin column captures a number of other factors that need to be considered when reconciling the market-based metrics to the change in our gross margin. Such items include our actual realized prices, refinery yields and crudes slate variances compared to the market indicators. They also include other factors such as refinery volume metric gains, purchase for resale activity and primary transportation.","On the next 2 slides, we provide earnings walks for each of our other operating segments. Turning to Slide 7. Speedway's income from operations was $107 million in the second quarter of 2012 compared with $80 million in the second quarter of 2011. Speedway's light product gross margin was about $15 million higher in the second quarter of 2012 compared with the second quarter of 2011. The increase was primarily due to a nearly 1.4 cents per gallon higher gross margin for the second quarter of 2012.","Merchandise margin was $203 million in the second quarter of 2012 compared with $178 million during the same period last year. This $25 million increase was primarily due to margin expansion resulting from increasing merchandise and food sales. Same-store gasoline sales increased 2% and same-store merchandise sales also increased 2% in the second quarter 2012 compared with the 2011 second quarter.","Slide 8 shows changes in our Pipeline Transportation segment income. Income from operations was $50 million in the second quarter of 2012 compared with $54 million in the second quarter of 2011. This decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in earnings from pipeline affiliates.","Slide 9 presents the more significant drivers of changes in our cash flows for the second quarter of 2012. At June 30, 2012, our cash balance was just under $1.9 billion. Operating cash flow before changes in working capital was a nearly $1.4 billion source of cash. The use of cash related to working capital of almost $1.1 billion is primarily due to an increase in inventory levels as well as the effect of lower crude prices on our payables and receivables.","Inventory levels were higher in the second quarter due to seasonal crude inventory builds and additional product inventory due to the turnaround at our Robinson refinery. Capital expenditures and acquisitions during the quarter totaled $489 million primarily related to Speedway's acquisition of the GasAmerica locations and the continuing investment in our Detroit Heavy Oil Upgrade Project.","Slide 10 provides some summary financial statistics. At the end of the second quarter, we had almost $1.9 billion of cash and approximately $3.3 billion of debt. With EBITDA of almost $4.8 billion during our first 12 months as a standalone company, we continue to be in a very manageable debt position with a leverage of 0.7x EBITDA and a debt-to-total capital ratio of 24%.","On Slide 11, cash flows provided by operations is shown for the last 12 months. During MPC's first full year as a standalone company, we generated almost $3 billion in cash from operations and $1.5 billion of free cash flow. Consistent with our commitment to return capital to shareholders, we have distributed 76% of our free cash flow in the form of dividends and share repurchases during the past year. And we intend to be one of the leaders of our peer group in terms of total shareholder return going forward.","Slide 12 provides outlook information on key operating metrics for MPC for the third quarter of 2012. For comparative purposes, those same metrics for the third quarter of 2011 are also shown.","With respect to outlook information, I wanted to mention one other item. As you know, in May of this year, we entered into a settlement agreement with the buyers of our Minnesota assets to finalize a number of matters contained in the original sales agreement. That settlement agreement was contingent upon the buyers' completing a successful IPO. As a result of their recent IPO, we expect to record a gain in the third quarter of 2012. More information on this transaction can be found in our second quarter 10-Q to be filed next week. In addition to this outlook information, the July market data document will be published tomorrow on our investor website.","Our mission continues to be value creation for our shareholders. We are committed to pursuing opportunities to create near- and long-term value. Examples of that commitment include the return of capital through 2 increases in our base dividend of the last 9 months and our share repurchase program. We will be balanced in our approach to capital allocation as we continue to assess the opportunities in front of them.","Now I will turn the call back to Pam Beall.","Pamela K. M. Beall","[Operator Instructions] And with that, I'll turn the call over to Dawn to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Paul Cheng from Barclays.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Real quick, Don, can you give me, what is the working capital and the market value of inventory overall?","Donald C. Templin","Sure. Current assets were $10.7 billion, current liabilities were $7.6 billion for a working capital of $3.1 billion, and the excess of fair value of inventory was $5 billion.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And Don, and maybe this is the -- for Gary, and that -- you have a nice bump in your dividend just several weeks ago, but that absolute dividend payout comparing to your earning power, it seems like is still quite affordable. So question is that, with that in mind, is that -- with this increase that -- that means that the dividend in December we're not going to see, or is not being consider or for a potential increase? Or we should not read anything on that? And also from a cash flow standpoint, your second quarter, you have about $1.1 billion on the negative working capital usage of cash. Otherwise, that -- your cash is going to be, say, close to $3 billion. So is there any reason why that you didn't announce another share buyback or another actual program like what you did in the last quarter?","Donald C. Templin","Paul, I think you covered a number of subjects there about returning capital or repatriating capital to shareholders. I guess our commitment continues to be, to the extent that we have excess cash, we will return that to shareholders and we will look to the best form of doing that. We obviously did announce a dividend increase this quarter, and we will regularly review the dividend both with our board and with our management team. So I don't think you should read anything into a third quarter dividend. I mean, that's a quarterly evaluation that we do. With respect to share repurchase, we will continue to evaluate what the best opportunities are and what the best timing is for returning capital to shareholders, Paul, but I think our commitment remains steadfast in terms of returning excess cash.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I guess, looking at the filings, it may appear that you were interested in the Sunoco acquisition. Obviously, if I -- my math is correct, that's something like -- obviously a big transaction but something like 10x EBITDA. Could you maybe outline the levers which you think you would be able to use to create value from a large transaction of this type? And then I have a follow-on.","Garry L. Peiffer","Ed, this is Garry. [indiscernible], but obviously, we can't comment on what things we are or we are not looking at, but I think we've been pretty consistent in the past saying that, for us to pursue an acquisition, it would have to be some synergistic effect or leverage which we could have with our existing assets. So I think, from our perspective, when we look at any potential opportunity to enhance shareholder value, it's really driven by what we can leverage our existing assets and infrastructure to create more value which then allows us to be able to afford the price needed to pay the type of multiples that are being commanded, say, in the marketplace. So I think our consistent message is it's basically a synergistic effect with our existing asset base, is what we primarily focus on when we're looking at acquisitions or other investments in the business.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And in terms of the multiples, and maybe there are some synergies which lower those, but that presumably would mean that your own retail system probably is undervalued. You've seen the announcement this morning. Any thoughts about spinning out or crystallizing the value that you have in the retail business?","Garry L. Peiffer","I think -- this is Garry again, Ed. We're continuing to look at any way we can to increase value. I think what we've been also fairly consistent in saying, though, is we believe in the integrated approach to the downstream business. We happen to be at a point in the business cycle when refining is doing relatively well. That always isn't the case. And we like to have the advantage of having 2 or 3, in this case, 3 businesses -- the Pipeline Transportation, the Speedway and the R&M business -- to give us a very good complement of cash flows and assets to meet what our #1 objective is, and that is to have a investment-grade credit profile. So we're going to look at these things, we'll continue to look at these things. And I think, though, at the moment, our objective and our goal is still the integrated approach to how we run our business.","Operator","Our next question is from Paul Sankey from Deutsche Bank.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","If I could just follow up to Gary on the acquisition question. So you've been very consistent, firstly, in your message about what would interest you and, secondly, I guess, about the prioritization which has come through on this call of cash return to shareholders. I guess it's just notable that you've raised acquisitions on your opening slide, Gary, and I wondered if you could just talk a little bit more about why you did that. You said you're not interested in non-synergistic assets, which I think rules out Europe and I assume it rules out the West Coast. One obvious candidate which BP was talking about this morning is Texas City. Could you make any comments about, firstly, that specific asset and, secondly, what else comprises synergy? Because I'm aware that you're also referring to the potential for retail acquisitions.","Gary R. Heminger","Well, Paul, as we've always been consistent, when we look at our portfolio, acquisitions are a part of that portfolio, return of capital to shareholders is a part of that portfolio. And further as we look down, whether it's dividends, whether it's buying back shares, all those go into consideration. As we look at acquisitions and what we -- the result has been, we've made 2 -- in fact, 3 if we include the Gas City stores last summer, we've made 3 retail acquisitions. And we continue to look at those types of opportunities in the marketplace. So we just wanted to highlight that we look at everything that is available in the marketplace and we will continue to do that. But that is one of the possibilities that we have is to look at those acquisitions as we go forward. And then of course, I already outlined, and Don and I hope we're very clear in our message, that returning cash to -- or capital, I should say, not just cash but returning capital to the shareholders and exercising discipline in acquisitions will continue to be front and center.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes, I guess, with respect to this, that you've been through a major CapEx cycle that really isn't complete quite yet with Detroit but obviously with Garyville as well. And it would be -- I think it would be encouraging if the language on acquisitions was more -- less aggressive, if you like, than it seems to come across.","Gary R. Heminger","Well, that's fair enough, then. And I've stated several times on these calls that it is time to harvest on the acquisitions that we've made. I know that there was some conjecture at the time that we did Garyville and it has proven to be a very, very strong asset and cash flow provider. And we're just on the heels of -- to about complete Detroit and then we'll complete the turnaround and start it up late in this year. A $2.2 billion acquisition -- excuse me, $2.2 billion of capital expenditure that we've had on the books for some time, we don't believe that any of market has reflected the opportunity yet of that asset as it comes to market. So we would expect to see that as we finish up this year and get into early next year and have it fully operating. But I understand what you're saying, and we -- as I said, we will continue to exercise a very strong discipline around any CapEx.","Operator","Our next question comes from Arjun Murti from Goldman Sachs.","Arjun N. Murti - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Gary, one of the questions out there is all these pipelines are taking the shale oil to the Gulf Coast area where, of course, most of the refiners are more medium sour or heavy coking. Can you talk about how you see that dynamic playing out? And maybe specific to your assets, is there a practical limit on how much light sweet you can run, or at the right discount, could Garyville, as an example, run all light sweet if you so chose to?","Gary R. Heminger","All right, Mike Palmer will handle that.","C. Michael Palmer","Sure, be happy to. We constantly get questions that ask about how much sweet crude we can actually run at a particular refinery around our system. And it's a difficult question to answer because it really depends on pricing. But the answer is that we can run a lot of sweet light crude. I think we've estimated that, in our whole system, as a real rough ballpark number, it's something around 75% that we can run is very light crude. But it really does depend upon the market circumstances because, if the advantage is with this light sweet crude, then we can make adjustments to the refineries. Our engineers can do that such that we could even run more. So there's just a lot of flexibility.","Arjun N. Murti - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And is it your sense that your system is representative? Or you all have invested more over time to ensure you have this flexibility?","C. Michael Palmer","Well, no. And In fact, if you look at our -- especially at our Midwest system, I mean, we have been predominantly a light sweet refiner through time. Obviously, we've made a change to Detroit to give us the option of running heavy Canadian crude, which is the intent. But it's -- really, you have to think of it in terms of an option because if the light sweet crude is really the most attractive, that's what we'll run. And in fact, when you look at our operation right now at Garyville, we're running a lot more light sweet crude than we'd ever forecast in the past. So we have a lot of flexibility to go where we can earn the best margin.","Arjun N. Murti - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's terrific. And just to follow up on the retail spinoff question. Again, I don't mean to make you repeat yourself, but when we looked at Marathon over a long period of time, it seems like you have generated very good returns on capital by being integrated, whether it's the pipelines into the refineries and the gas stations, and that business model has served you well for a long period of time. I think you more or less were concurring with that type of sentiment, but just wanted to clarify that.","Garry L. Peiffer","This is Garry again. Yes, no, that's exactly right. And it's not to say that things don't change, either. I think we're continuously looking at the marketplace, looking at what makes the most sense from a optimization of operation standpoint. And as we said, when we talked about MLPs in the past, never say never, so -- but at the moment, we think the present configuration that we have of Refining & Marketing and pipelines is the best for us given our objectives in terms of shareholder -- creating shareholder value.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chi Chow from Macquarie Capital.","Chi Chow - Macquarie Research","I'd like to get your thoughts near term on the possible waiver of the RFS mandate for ethanol given the recent request from the livestock producers. Is that something you think will come through? What's the probability of that?","Garry L. Peiffer","Mike?","C. Michael Palmer","Yes. I guess, to be honest, our thought with that is that the -- we understand that the -- what the situation is with the expensive corn right now. And there are some ethanol plants that certainly have closed down. But honestly, I guess our thought is that it's very difficult to understand what the government might do with regard to any waiver on ethanol. And in fact, the EPA has stated that they're not interested in considering an RFS waiver. So I guess that would be our thought.","Chi Chow - Macquarie Research","And then, Don, maybe a couple of cash flow questions. What's the remaining CapEx on DHOUP at the end of the second quarter? And then do you expect additional builds in inventories in the third quarter for the DHOUP turnaround? Is that going to cause ongoing pull [ph] on working capital that's going to impact cash here in the third quarter?","Donald C. Templin","On the first question, Chi, $200 million is the remaining expenditures on DHOUP. And, I guess, with respect to working capital, but there's a lot of moving pieces around working capital. Yes, we will build some working capital related to DHOUP, but when Robinson came back online, that will have a positive effect in terms of reducing our working capital.","Operator","Our next question comes from Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Everybody, I appreciate the comments on cash returns and I applaud the selective buyback approach similar to HFC and OXY. And I also thought the approach for Sun [ph] looked smart relating to an MLP uplift potential. And then my question, my first question, really, is a follow-up on the dividend discussion. I mean, how do you analyze your maximum dividend commitment for dividend that you'd obviously rather never cut? I mean, do you run varied case margin scenarios, say, 2009 crack plus some more nominal crude spread through your current system that defines how high you could go on a longer-term supportable dividend? Or how do you analyze that level?","Garry L. Peiffer","Yes, Evan, this is Garry Peiffer. That's -- obviously, trying to forecast this business is a difficult process. And I'm not even sure -- if you look back to 2009, as a most recent example, it was a tough year for all refiners. So I think what we've obviously did last week in increasing our dividend to $0.35 a quarter, demonstrates, at least our opinion, that, through those cycles, that we think we can afford to continue that type of dividend pay to shareholders. So I don't think we can get -- we try to run all kind of models to estimate what is -- from a cash requirement standpoint, what is our minimum cash requirements. But I think that the 40% increase in regular dividend we announced last week is our demonstration of our belief that we can sustain that through the cycles. And as -- 2009 did not include Garyville, the impact of the benefit we've been able to enjoy from the Garyville expansion. And hopefully going forward, we'll have the benefit of DHOUP contributing substantially to our cash flows in the future as well. So those things all add on top of our confidence and why we did what we did last week in terms of increasing our dividend.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Great, that's helpful. Can you also provide an update on Utica crude runs, status of your infrastructure developments there? And really, I guess, whether you're -- I guess, you're blending the condensate there. And maybe kind of related to Arjun's question, what sort of theoretic run max, at least in the Ohio refineries, the 2 refineries based upon yield in Utica configuration?","Gary R. Heminger","Mike?","C. Michael Palmer","The Utica has probably progressed a little slower than some of the original production forecast would've led people to believe. But there's a lot of activity that's going on right now in terms of new permits and rigs that are running. We continue to process on the order of about 1,500 barrels a day of a mix of crude and condensate. We do expect that that will start to ramp up in the second half of the year, and then in '13 and '14, it'll start to ramp up even more. And we can, again, run a lot of this crude and condensate within our plants in the Midwest. We have the permanent truck rack that is now complete at Canton. It has a capacity of 12,000 barrels a day right now. We've got a truck rack at Catlettsburg and it's got a capacity, I think, of about 18,000 barrels a day. We have opportunities to expand those. We're working on a truck-to-barge operation that we've talked to you guys about before. And I guess I would make the same comment with regard to the volume that we can actually refine that I did before. We have a lot of flexibility in these plants to run both the condensate and the crude oil, again depending upon -- on how it's priced. So it's going to be quite some time before the Utica production actually catches up to a point where we're going to have difficulty running it in the plants.","Operator","Our next question comes from Doug Terreson from ISI Group.","Douglas Terreson - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Most of my questions were answered, and I apologize if I missed this, but I just wanted to get the update on when the Detroit turnaround began and also how long you expect that to last in the second half.","Garry L. Peiffer","Yes, Doug, this is Garry Peiffer. We're expecting the turnaround to start shortly after Labor Day. And we would expect it to last about 70 days, so that puts you into early November 'til it'd be complete. So that's the present plan. Now I think, for modeling purposes, we've been pretty consistent all along that we wouldn't expect to see any contribution -- or any major contribution to our bottom line 'til next year from a cash or earnings standpoint. So the goal is to get everything online by the end of the year and operational, up in a safe and efficient manner.","Operator","Our next question comes from Roger Read from Wells Fargo.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Quick question I guess I had, kind of following on with the questions on the light sweet crude. As you ramp up the volumes of light sweet, or if you're able to ramp up the volumes of light sweet, what are -- how should we think about the impact on volumes? I mean, generally, I would expect they'd come in a little bit. Is that the right way to think about it? Is there any sort of rule of thumb we can use?","Gary R. Heminger","Mike?","Garry L. Peiffer","So this is Garry here. I guess -- unless we get to the beyond 75% range that Mike referred to, I guess we wouldn't expect to see any major impact on total volumes. Now if the price became so attractive that all of Garyville's throughputs were light sweet crude, then there would be an impact on probably what we would be able to run in total. But that's going to be a long way down the road, I think, because we would try to balance the slate with heavy crudes as well as the light crudes such that we would hopefully have a fairly minimal impact on total inputs and outputs. But to have any input, there's got to be a lot of light sweet crude before we'd have any total output impact.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And then the only other question I had, on the export side. If I heard correctly, I think you said it was up 110,000 barrels a day, Q2.","Garry L. Peiffer","It was up to 110,000 barrels a day in Q2.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Where do you think that can go over the next several years? Or what's your goal on that front?","Garry L. Peiffer","Well, that is pretty much stretching the system. All the stars were aligned for us to be able to do that in the second quarter. I think, our previous best month -- or quarter, excuse me, quarter, was somewhere in the 80,000 barrel a day range. So we're making investments now at Garyville that will probably not increase the total throughput capacity much beyond that 110,000 barrel a day range but will allow us additional tankage such that we can sell different products, principally gasoline. So we're making investments at Garyville to allow us to sell additional products, but probably the total isn't going to change much, at least in the near term.","Operator","Our next question comes from Blake Fernandez from Howard Weil.","Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","A couple of questions for you. One, I wanted to go back on the buybacks. If I recall, when the program was originally authorized, it was $2 billion over a 2-year period. Obviously, you've exhausted the accelerated portion, but I'm just trying to understand the mindset on the balance, the $1.15 billion. If things were to stay where they are today, should we assume that you'd plan to fully execute that $2 billion over the next 1.5 years?","Donald C. Templin","I think, Blake, what -- this is Don. I think what we have said and we as a management team and board believe is that, to the extent that we have excess cash, we want to return it to, and we expect to return it to, our shareholders in one form or another. We will make evaluations around our current authorization and we have discussions regularly with our board about that. So it's hard to know what the cash position will be and forecast it out every quarter out for the next 1.5 years. But I think our track record over the last year, 12 months, has demonstrated that, to the extent there is excess cash, we will look for ways to repatriate it back to our shareholders.","Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","Don, the second one, for you. This may be premature, but I was just hoping for CapEx potentially into '13. Any broad strokes on where you see that shaking out compared to this year?","Donald C. Templin","We have not provided that information, Blake. But I guess, in terms of thinking about capital expenditures, we've consistently said that our maintenance CapEx is somewhere in the $600 million to $800 million range per year. And that is really focused on maintaining our assets at their current cash-generation capabilities. So that would be -- in a Speedway example, that would include rebuilds and remodels. We've also said that, at any point in time, we have probably a portfolio of projects in the $200 million to $500 million range that we believe are easy to implement. They're under our control, they have high rates of return. And if you think about even sort of our profile in 2012, how we spend capital, our capital expenditure budget was $1.4 billion and that included roughly $350 million for DHOUP, so the remainder really fit nicely in the -- kind of that range, $600 million to $800 million for maintenance CapEx, $200 million to $500 million for growth projects.","Operator","Our next question comes from Faisel Khan from Citigroup.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","On the 110,000 barrels a day of exports, which I believe is an uptick from the first quarter, what kind of pricing uplift do you get on that -- on those products vis-\u00e0-vis what we see in the Gulf Coast? And then I have a follow-up on crude oil.","Garry L. Peiffer","This is Garry Peiffer. We don't really want to disclose what type of uptick we get. But we do obviously get a better price than we would otherwise get, and our next best alternative is in the spot market. So we're able to achieve returns better than the smart -- spot market values, net of all the other considerations we have to go to through, whether it be time, value or money and what-have-you. So it is a benefit to running an overall alternative to the spot market.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then on the crude oil side, can you give us an idea of how much WCS you ran across your entire system? And there were some reports that Canadian bitumen was being railed down to the Gulf Coast, and if that's something you'd be running through your system, too?","Garry L. Peiffer","We -- Mike Palmer can confirm this. We don't -- we haven't railed any Canadian bitumen. We have been running somewhere around 50,000 barrels a day from the Patoka, north of St. Louis area down to Garyville. So our major Gulf Coast WCS is that 50,000 barrels a day or so of WCS we put on the barge and shipped from Patoka to Garyville.","Operator","Our next question comes from Cory Garcia from Raymond James.","Cory J. Garcia - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","I apologize if I missed this earlier. But clearly, your same-store sales in your Speedway system is improving [ph] pretty strong, I think, up 2%, you guys, in the prior quarter. Just wondering what it looked like through July, particularly in light of the recent run-up in prices? I think that the DOE data is showing down just slightly, so I'm wondering if you guys could reconcile that for me.","Gary R. Heminger","Well, in fact -- this is Gary. Cory, July has been a little soft because of the run-up in price and we have seen demand fall a little bit here in July. But again, we're comparing against one of the difficult things when you're looking at same-store sales, I guess, same month last year. This year, Fourth of July was midweek. Last year, it attached to a weekend. So July was much better for that point last year. And this year, the extreme hot weather, we think, has curtailed some driving as well. So on a same-store basis, it's more difficult to be able to put in some of those concerns. But I would say it's a little bit of soft this year as we start July than we saw in June.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Dietert from Simmons & Company.","Jeffrey A. Dietert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","My question is related to Detroit. I expected to see maybe a tick-up in turnaround expenses in the third quarter when we got a quick look at the guidance slide, but it didn't appear to be there. Is that mainly going to fall in the fourth quarter as far as the increase in turnaround cost?","Donald C. Templin","Jeff, we'll have turnaround costs in both third quarter and fourth quarter. And the guidance information that we did provide, the outlook information, includes the costs related to the Detroit turnaround that will be incurred in the third quarter. So the $1.15 that we have in our outlook information includes that. If you look at the comparative period last year, it was only $0.36, so there's some heavy activity in this third quarter.","Operator","We have a follow-up from Paul Cheng from Barclays.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Actually, 2 quick ones. One, there's a interesting one, one of your old refinery now that is a MLP. Have you guys looked at that and think whether that this is something you could be interested?","Garry L. Peiffer","Yes, Paul, this is Garry Peiffer. I think, as you know, we try to keep our eye on what's ever new and different going on out there, but I guess our focus at the moment obviously is MPLX and what we can do there to increase shareholder value. But we look at everything and we're -- but at the moment, though, we're focused on MPLX.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I understand that, Garry. And I guess my question is more that, fundamentally, do you guys object to have your refinery to be in an MLP and you are concerned losing control or that after your study in the MLP for the pipeline that you don't really have that fundamental concern?","Garry L. Peiffer","Well, I think this is a fairly new idea or a fairly new mode they're going about to create an MLP. So I think we just have to understand what it means not only in maybe the good part of the cycle but also what it could mean in the bad part of the cycle. So we -- it's fairly new. We're starting it and we're watching it closely. So I think we -- at this point, we're just trying to understand the benefits of any type of opportunity to increase shareholder value.","Operator","We have a follow-up question from Paul Sankey from Deutsche Bank.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Guys, I just wanted to ask you about product trade and the dynamics that we're seeing there. Is there any kind of a shift going on between who's buying all the products? Can you just remind us how much you're exporting and where the major destinations are?","C. Michael Palmer","Yes, Paul. This is Mike Palmer. A lot of what we export out of Garyville, we sell FOB Garyville. So there's a lot of the cargoes that we can't be certain where they go. I mean, it is a mix between South America, Latin America and Europe, and it changes from time to time depending upon what the arbitrages look like.","Operator","We have a follow-up from Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I was -- I apologize for traveling last call [ph], so I'll ask another question. Just on the MLP, obviously, you've disclosed EBITDA, sorry, and the assets for MPLX, so I won't ask about that. But you've obviously got a massive chunk of assets still within the MPC umbrella. If I look at those assets, I mean, is it fair to say that we can just gross up sort of EBITDA in terms of the capacity? Or are there some other things that we should be thinking about when we're trying to forecast the EBITDA for your overall logistics footprint?","Garry L. Peiffer","I think -- this is Garry Peiffer, Ed. I think we're obviously into the quiet period with our S-1 here so we really can't comment on what is the remainder of the assets. We gave a high-level summary of our MPC assets in the S-1, and to this point, that's really all we can go, we can really talk about regarding the other assets that we have that are qualified for an MLP.","Operator","Our last question comes from Faisel Khan from Citigroup.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just a follow-up on the same-store gasoline sales volumes being up 2% -- or 2.1% in the quarter. Can you go -- can you elaborate a little bit more what drove that, you think, in the quarter? Because the economy was still kind of sluggish and so seeing the 2% sort of same-store sales growth seems a little bit less intuitive given what we saw in the economy in the second quarter.","Gary R. Heminger","Well, in our market, Faisel, what we've continued to see is some increases. I believe the -- early in the second quarter, the weather was very, very positive in PADD II, and our same store is really around Speedway and as well PADD II. So the weather was generally very good. Early part of the second quarter that helped us, as I said. As we got into late June and early July, the weather seemed to be a bit of a detriment. But -- and prices came down in the second quarter in a couple of different time frames. So therefore, you didn't have to push the increased crude oil price. You didn't have to push it back into the marketplace as much as we've seen early here in the third quarter. But I would say those would be the -- probably the key themes. Again, very difficult to be able to chart each component and what happens in markets and what happens in regions and markets on a same-store basis.","Operator","Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Gary Heminger for final remarks.","Gary R. Heminger","Well, thank you, Dawn. And as we complete today, I just wanted to emphasize one more time that all the questions that pertain to our capital allocation, how we may or may not repatriate capital, what our investment posture might be, we will continue to be very disciplined as we consider those opportunities going forward. And I think, as Don and Garry and I alluded in many of our questions -- or answers to questions here, capital repatriation and having the confidence to continue such repatriation in the future is first and foremost in our mind.","So I thank you, Dawn, for your help today. And thanks, everyone on the call.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."],"14340":["Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC) Q2 2019 Earnings Conference Call August  1, 2019  9:30 AM ET","Company Participants","Kristina Kazarian - Vice President, Investor Relations","Gary Heminger - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Mike Hennigan - President , MPLX","Don Templin - Chief Financial Officer","Ray Brooks - Executive Vice President, Refining","Rick Hessling - Senior Vice President, Crude Oil Supply & Logistics","Dave Whikehart - Senior Vice President, Light Products, Supply & Logistics","Tim Griffith - President, Speedway LLC","Conference Call Participants","Doug Terreson - Evercore","Manav Gupta - Credit Suisse","Benny Wong - Morgan Stanley","Roger Reed - Wells Fargo","Paul Cheng - Scotia Howard Weil","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs","Phil Gresh - JPMorgan","Operator","Welcome to the MPC's Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. My name is Amber, and I'll be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","I will now turn the call over to Kristina Kazarian. Kristina, you may begin.","Kristina Kazarian","Sounds, great. Welcome to Marathon Petroleum second quarter 2019 earnings conference call. The slides that accompany this call can be found on our website at marathonpetroleum.com under the Investors tab. On the call today are, Gary Heminger, Chairman and CEO; Greg Goff, Executive Vice Chairman; Don Templin, CFO; Mike Hennigan, President of MPLX; as well as other members of the executive team.","We invite you to read the Safe Harbor statements on slide 2. It's a reminder that we will be making forward-looking statements during the call and during the question-and-answer session. Actual results may differ materially from what we expect today. Factors that could cause results to differ are included there as well as in our filings with the SEC.","Now I will turn the call over to Gary Heminger for some opening remarks and highlights on slide 3.","Gary Heminger","Thanks, Kristina, and good morning and thank you for joining our call. Earlier today, we reported adjusted net income of $1.1 billion or $1.73 per diluted share. This quarter, we executed across all aspects of our integrated business and delivered solid results, generating $2.8 billion of cash from operations.","Our impressive cash generation allowed us to return roughly $850 million to our shareholders this quarter, while also funding many key strategic investments, which we expect will continue to enhance our long-term earnings profile.","Our team's execution this quarter led to strong synergy capture. Combined with our first-quarter results, we have realized $403 million of synergies year-to-date. Our progress, gives us great confidence in achieving our target of up to $600 million of annual gross run-rate synergies by year end 2019 and $1.4 billion by the end of 2021. Don will provide a detailed update around synergy capture later on the call.","Our retail business had an exceptional quarter and demonstrated its ability to capture value. Strong results this quarter reflect the tremendous focus by our team and management of the day-to-day business in conjunction with the integration of the new stores. We have converted over 400 stores since the combination, putting us well on track to achieve our goal of 700 stores by the end of this year.","In Midstream, we simplified our structure into one public company to high-grade commercial opportunities and progressed an impressive slate of high return projects that are expected to enhance integration across our system. Mike will speak to our execution around new projects, as well as provide an update on our overall midstream strategy shortly.","In refining, we achieved strong 97% utilization, executed plant turnaround activity at our Los Angeles and Martinez refineries ahead of schedule and under budget and advanced strategic initiatives to prepare our system for upcoming IMO 2020 regulations.","During the quarter we progressed the completion of the Garyville crude revamp and Coker drum replacement projects. Coker project is expected to increase unit capacity by approximately 14% and remains on track to be completed in two phases; the fourth quarter of 2019 and first quarter of 2020. We also finalized plans to optimize our Coker feed and resid processing capabilities between refineries and ensured readiness of our blending and storage capabilities near our key coastal export facilities.","As we look to the second half of the year. Global gasoline and diesel inventories are below their five-year averages. Gasoline demand remains close to last year's levels, and we expect demand to remain flat throughout the remainder of the year given the strong U.S. economy and low unemployment levels.","On differentials, medium and heavy crude remain compressed from supply constraints and Iranian and Venezuelan sanctions, but we believe that refineries with operational flexibility like ours are best suited to manage these dynamics. Investors often ask about the timeframe for that expected pricing uplift from IMO regulations.","We continue to believe impacts will emerge in the second half of the year and are starting to see some early indications in the market. First, low-sulfur fuel oil markets are showing signs of significant strengthening, low-sulfur to high-sulfur spreads are currently at $60 per barrel and forward pricing indicators are moving toward $30 per barrel, as we approach year end. This is corroborated by the low-sulfur fuel oil retail bunker agreements we have contracted in the Pacific Northwest and are negotiating along-beach for the fourth quarter. Additionally, we are obtaining significant upgrades for our low-sulfur slurry volumes contractor for the third quarter.","Second, high-sulfur fuel oil values are weakening and the market is highly backwardated through year-end with Europe -- U.S. Gulf Coast down to $11 per barrel as Singapore indicating down $18 per barrel. While this is not necessarily a bullish factor for the market, it does show that IMO impacts are becoming more imminent.","We continue to anticipate 1 million to 2 million barrels per day of increased distillate demand globally for the IMO spec change even considering recent global economic data, which we believe will support an expansion in diesel cracks by $2 to $5 per barrel and Coker margins improving roughly $10 per barrel, as the industry prepares for low-sulfur bunker regulations.","After nearly a year as a combined business, we have identified opportunities to streamline our business and potentially divest assets to enhance the strength of our overall integrated portfolio and remain disciplined stewards of capital.","Proceeds from any divestitures would be used for general purposes such as investments in high-return projects as well as debt reduction. As this process develops, we intend to provide updates to the market. But much of it will be contingent upon market demand and appropriate pricing for these potential divestitures.","Putting this all together as we look forward to the remainder of 2019. We expect improving industry dynamics and the benefits of our past investments to support our growing cash flow outlook and our team remains focused on operational excellence, achieving synergies and creating long-term shareholder value.","Now let me turn the call over to Mike Hennigan, who will provide a strategy update for our Midstream segment. Mike?","Mike Hennigan","Thanks, Gary. Turning to slide 4. We are pleased to have successfully combined MPLX and Andeavor Logistics into a single entity, creating a leading large-scale diversified midstream company anchored by fee-based cash flows.","As is often overlooked, our business mix has evolved to a more stable, long-dated cash flow profile. Logistics and storage makes up approximately 60% of the cash flows for MPLX and our incremental capital programs, predominantly focused on building out our integrated crude oil and natural gas logistics systems, particularly in the Permian.","In addition, we continue to move our capital investments toward the L&S side of the business. At MPLX in 2018, 85% of our capital was directed to the G&P business, in 2019 we move that ratio to about 50\/50 and our expectation in 2020 is to spend the majority of our capital in the L&S business.","When we think about building out our logistics systems, one of our core objective is to invest in projects that enhance MPC's integrated value. During the quarter, three examples of projects that advance this integrated strategy are Whistler, Capline and Wink-to-Webster pipelines.","On Whistler, MPLX announced a final investment decision on this natural gas pipeline into securing sufficient, firm transportation agreements with shippers. This joint venture project is being designed to transport approximately 2 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas from the Permian Basin to the Agua Dulce area, in South Texas.","We expect the Whistler system to eventually provide low-cost natural gas to our Galveston Bay refinery. Natural gas is a key input at our refineries and this project creates a compelling industry solution, as well as lowering the overall cost of our system where we are currently utilizing third-party infrastructure.","We are also pleased to have completed a successful open season for the reversal of the Capline pipeline system. We have sufficient commitments to proceed with this project, and the mainline product is expected to begin later this quarter. Once reversed, Capline will be capable of supplying discounted Mid-Continent and Canadian crude to St James, Louisiana, which has a direct connection to our Garyville refinery. Capline is expected to begin light crude service in late 2020 with heavy crude service plan for 2022.","On the Wink-to-Webster crude pipeline, MPLX recently signed definitive agreements; 36-inch diameter pipeline will originate in Wink and Midland and have destination points in the Houston market including our Galveston Bay refinery. The pipeline is expected to be in service in early 2021.","There are several other partners in the project that have chosen not to disclose their participation at this point, but we expect that disclosure to occur very shortly. The combination of all the partners has made this project highly committed with a very strong return.","Expanding third-party business is another way to enhance MPC's enterprise value. Recently, we advanced our JV, partnership on the Gray Oak pipeline, which is expected to enhance the stability of our cash flow by pulling in third-party revenue into the enterprise. ","The Gray Oak Pipeline, in which MPC has a 25% equity interest, is another pipeline that will move Permian crude to the Gulf Coast. This project is expected to be placed in service by the end of the year.","As we begin our planning process for 2020, we expect to streamline and optimize our capital expenditures. Prior to the combination, the stand-alone growth CapEx for MPLX was targeted at around $2 billion while ANDX's stand-alone CapEx target was $600 million. We will target spending less than the combined $2.6 billion as we focus toward the highest return projects across the combined portfolio.","Lastly, we anticipate continuing our focus on asset optimization which could include asset divestitures. With a disciplined approach to capital investing focus on streamlining and high grading our portfolio, we believe the Midstream business will further enhance the cash flow stability of MPC's integrated system.","I'll now turn the call over to Don who will provide a walk-through of our financial results.","Don Templin","Thanks Mike. Slide 5 provides a summary of our second quarter financial highlights. Adjusted EBITDA, which excludes turnaround cost was $3.2 billion for the quarter. Operating cash flow before working capital was approximately $2.8 billion. We returned $852 million to shareholders through $352 million of dividends and $500 million of share repurchases. We ended the quarter with $660 million shares outstanding. And for the year, we returned over $2 billion to shareholders.","Based on investor feedback, we have reformatted some of our materials. The most notable changes include a focus on adjusted EBITDA, regional trend highlights, capture rates, sequential comparisons, enhanced guidance and incremental market metrics. We trust that you will find these helpful. To support continuity, we've also maintained previous materials in the appendix for reference.","Slide 6 shows the $1.6 billion of sequential growth in adjusted EBITDA from first quarter to second quarter and also a reconciliation to net income. The increase was largely driven by higher retail and refining earnings. Before reviewing the details of each segment. I would like to discuss our synergy capture for the quarter.","As shown on slide 7, our team's impressive execution led to strong synergy capture with $270 million of realized synergies in the second quarter. The majority of our synergies were in the Refining and Marketing segment and if it's in the quarter included approximately $60 million for the L.A turnaround as cost came in significantly under budget and we were able to bring the plant back up eight days ahead of schedule.","At the St. Paul and Martinez refineries, we began using lower-cost regenerated catalysts, we were able to take used catalyst from other refineries within our system and redirect them to St Paul and Martinez resulting in cost savings for these refineries. Additionally, we started utilizing different catalyst formulations in order to produce higher-value products at several of our refineries. Examples, where we began realizing benefits in the second quarter, include the hydrocracker at Robinson and the cat cracker at Los Angeles.","We have also improved gasoline blending capabilities across our refining system to optimize octane specifications and avoid over blending of higher value components. In retail, we are starting to see benefits from economies of scale, as well as leveraging back-office systems across our newly converted stores. This has led to optimization of labor hours and reduced operating costs. The $39 million in corporate synergies represents continued cost eliminations including headcount reductions and contract renegotiations made possible by the combination.","Continuing to synergies, on slide 8, we have now realized over $400 million of synergies through the first six months of 2019. Over half of the synergies have been driven by cost reductions across the business. We have also reduced our capital spend by approximately $24 million. As Gary mentioned earlier, our execution through the first half of the year gives us confidence in achieving the up to $600 million of annual gross run-rate synergies that we outlined for 2019.","Moving to our segment results slide 9 shows the change in our Midstream EBITDA versus the first quarter 2019. MPLX EBITDA decreased $16 million versus the first quarter. The decrease was primarily due to weather-related unplanned outages such as the Ozark crude oil pipeline, planned maintenance work at the Javelina facility and declining NGL prices.","During the second half of the year, MPLX plans to bring on 600 million cubic feet per day of processing capacity. The Plants are being developed on a just-in-time basis to align with expected natural gas volume growth in these regions. Andeavor Logistics EBITDA increased by $7 million versus the first quarter of 2019. The increase was primarily driven by higher volumes on the Conan Gathering System, which recently surpassed 200,000 barrels per day of throughput.","Slide 10 provides an overview of our retail segment, second quarter EBITDA was $623 million, an increase of $327 million versus the first quarter. Retail fuel margins were nearly $0.27 per gallon in the second quarter, reflecting a favorable commodity market and our team's ability to optimize margin dollars. Same-store merchandise sales increased 6.3%, continuing the positive trend we have seen over the last 12 months.","Speedway continues to execute its brand expansion strategy through store conversions. As of June 30, we had converted 237 sites in 2019, bringing the total number of conversions since the combination with endeavor to 407. We remain on track to reach 700 total cumulative store conversions by the end of 2019 including locations in the Southwest and on the West Coast.","In July, Speedway closed on its acquisition of 33 NACCO Express convenience stores in the Buffalo, New York area. The acquisition further expands Speedway's brand presence in this region. While supporting MPC's Midwest product placement strategy and it builds upon prior investments to maximize refinery utilization.","Slide 11 provides an overview of our Refining & Marketing segment. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA was $1.6 billion, an increase of nearly $1.3 billion versus the first quarter. Margins were up quarter-over-quarter, primarily due to improved crack spreads in all three of our regions. These benefits were partially offset by narrower crude differentials and product realizations.","Our Mid-term margin improved by nearly $5 to $20 and $0.21 per barrel for the second quarter, our Gulf Coast margin was $9.32 per barrel in the second quarter, while the West Coast also saw a significant increase to $17.77 per barrel for the quarter.","Capture for the quarter was 82% versus our historical average of approximately 90%. Plant maintenance activity at several refineries on the West Coast and the run-up of gasoline prices versus non-transportation fuels impacted our overall result.","Please refer to page 18 in the appendix for some additional details on our capture for the quarter. Refining operating costs, which includes major maintenance improved by $25 million versus the first quarter, distribution costs which are primarily related to transportation and marketing of refined products, including fees paid to MPLX and ANDX were down $13 million quarter-over-quarter.","Page 19 of the appendix provides a more detailed walk-through of the internal and external fee components included in this cost category.","Slide 12 presents the elements of change in our consolidated cash position for the second quarter. Cash at the end of the quarter was approximately $1.2 billion, operating cash flow before changes in working capital was a $2.8 billion source of cash in the quarter. Working capital was a $201 million use of cash in the quarter, largely due to the effects of falling commodity prices and the shorter payment terms on refined products compared to crude oil.","Return of capital to MPC shareholders via share repurchases and dividends totaled $852 million, with $500 million worth of shares acquired in the quarter. Distributions to public unitholders of MPLX and ANDX were $315 million for the quarter. We remain committed to our long-term goal of returning at least 50% of discretionary free cash flow to investors. At quarter-end, we had approximately $28.4 billion of total consolidated debt including 14 billion of debt at MPLX and 5.2 billion of debt at ANDX.","Total debt represented 2.6 times last 12 months adjusted EBITDA on a consolidated basis, or 1.1 times EBITDA, excluding the debt and EBITDA of the MLPs, but including the distributions received from MPLX and ANDX.","On slide 13, we provide our third-quarter outlook. We expect total throughput volumes of just under 3.1 million barrels per day. Our operating costs including major maintenance are projected to be $5.90 per barrel. Distribution costs are projected to be $1.3 billion, which is consistent with prior quarter guidance. Plant turnaround costs are projected to be $155 million as we have limited activity during the quarter, but we do have some planned maintenance at Gallop and St Paul.","Depreciation and amortization expense is forecasted at $420 million for the quarter. Corporate and other unallocated items are projected to be $190 million for the quarter. This figure includes approximately $40 million in corporate depreciation.","Lastly, I would like to highlight that we have provided outlook information for the retail segment this quarter, including ranges for fuel volume and merchandise sales. We also plan on providing actual fuel margins on a one-month lag as a part of the market data that gets posted on our website at the beginning of each month.","Kristina and the rest of the Investor Relations team will be available after the call to help run through any questions you may have. Including the incremental information, we have provided. I also remind you that information in the prior format remains in the appendix.","With that, let me turn the call back over to Kristina.","Kristina Kazarian","Thanks, Don. As we open the call for your questions. As a courtesy to all participants, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up, if time permits we will re-prompt for additional questions.","With that, we will now open the call to questions. Operator?","Question-And-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Doug Terreson of Evercore. Your line is open.","Doug Terreson","Good morning, everybody and congratulations on solid results.","Gary Heminger","Thank you, Doug.","Doug Terreson","Yeah. First, my first question is execution and synergy capture seem to be improving especially in Refining and Speedway and returns on capital appear to be headed back to the historical trend. And this is all good news. And on this point, my question regards the opportunity set going forward. And specifically, while I realize we're only two quarters into the program, how would you characterize integration opportunities that you've seen so far. Do you sense that they're going to become stronger over time? And if so, in what areas?","Mike Hennigan","Yeah, Doug. I\u2019ll let Don talk about specific synergies, Doug. But, let me just talk overall about the synergy -- excuse me, about integration. We're very pleased where we stand on integration to date, and specifically when you look through the segments on refining just listening to Don's presentation here of the turnaround activity we had at Los Angeles and at Martinez, we have some work coming up in St Paul. But what we're seeing across the refining complex is very strong integration. We're developing our team. We've transferred of people from Marathon into some of the legacy Andeavor plants and vice versa.","So we see that integration and the communication between the refining coming along very strong. One of the things that we have talked about in the prior quarter, and I've talked to many investors about this, we saw this opportunity with the cat cracker at LA that we could bring in a new catalyst, a new technology and it really improve the output in yield of that plant. Don, can go into a more detail down the road here. But, that is really coming to fruition and as we're capturing -- and this was a synergy that we had not identified prior to the transaction. So I think it's just illustrates, Doug, how well, things are coming along on the integration.","We just presented to our Board yesterday, a very big project. We have now defined how we're going to go forward with our SAP system at the end of the day, but how we're going to integrate all of the accounting and financial data, a big project, but we've completed. We've identified that, and we're now moving forward to be able to get that implemented here over the next 18 months to two years and will bring it on in different cycles.","I mentioned retail, again, a very strong story at retail, and to have 400 stores complete to date and very much on target to hit the 700 by the end of the year. We're starting to see the improvement in the stores in the Southwest that we have already converted. We're seeing improvement in the stores up at Minnesota Wisconsin that we\u2019ve converted. So those things are that that integration, but more so, being able to bring in one common platform that manages the stores is a big help in managing your operating costs.","And then lastly on the Midstream side, it was really a big milestone to close the transaction between ANDX. Mike Hennigan has already outlined the team that they have in place a very strong team. And I congratulate Don Sorensen who is the President of ANDX, who really did an outstanding job. I would like to have kept Mike with the team. But he wanted to move on to do some other things. But they did a great job as we proceeded in being able to put this transaction together. So let me ask Don to go into some of the synergies in more detail.","Doug Terreson","Okay.","Don Templin","Yeah, Doug, as I said, we were really pleased with the performance of the team around synergies to 270 million this quarter. We did highlight a couple of one-time synergies. And when I think about one-time synergies, the way we've defined that is synergies that we're capturing in 2019, but are unlikely to continue into 2020 or beyond. And so, that $30 million or so is primarily around optimizing Tier 3 gasoline credits, and so that won't continue past this year.","On the other -- in the refining sector, we did highlight turnaround cost savings during the quarter of about $60 million, obviously, that won't continue every quarter, but we're going to have turnarounds over the next three years, and we're very confident that our management of those turnarounds will allow us to continue to be able to deliver them on time and on budget.","So, if I think about the $270 million for the quarter, I take out the one-time, the $30 million that gets needs. And then I think about sort of the 60 million that doesn't recur every quarter, that's a $180 million for the third quarter, $60 million a month, if you will. If I annualize that $60 million a month, that's why we get really excited about and have conviction around our view that we will get to the synergy target that we communicated at our earnings call.","Doug Terreson","Sure, looks like it, Don.","Don Templin","At our Investor Day.","Doug Terreson","Yeah. Okay. And then also Marathon Petroleum is clearly an asset-rich company, especially post the Andeavor transaction, which suggests that divestitures could expedite streamlining and optimization of the portfolio, and this could go on for years to come as well. So, my question is, while Gary you talked about this in your comments, could you expand on how you think about this opportunity. Are there areas that are likely to become non-strategic that might not have been before? And how significant could proceeds from divestitures be if you chose to pull that lever in coming years.","Gary Heminger","Sure Doug. And we announced you need to be careful when you announce asset divestitures until you have a fully baked, I would say, but this has been part of our strategy ever since we are though even before we close the transaction with Andeavor to be able to look at assets as you said, that may be non-strategic and we're looking at across the entire portfolio. It's not just one segment versus another.","We are looking at across the portfolio, we have identified some assets across the portfolio. And this isn\u2019t just a one year or a short-term thing that we're going to do, this was part of our plan all along. So, we will provide more data to the investors as we go forward.","We've already proceeded with a couple of our packages on some assets, it's private at this time, but we will continue on, but this is not a short-term thing, Doug, and your question certainly pieced it up correctly. We are an asset-rich company. We look at some assets that probably have more value at somebody else's portfolio than ours and I proceed accordingly.","Doug Terreson","Okay. Thanks a lot guys.","Gary Heminger","All right Doug.","Operator","Our next question comes from Manav Gupta with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Manav Gupta","First Garry, Don, Mike in the rest of the team, thanks a lot for tons of more disclosures in reporting format. They're really helpful to the investment community, adjusted EBITDA, Slide 9 on distribution cost exactly what we needed for modeling MPC better. So, thank you for that.","Gary Heminger","You're welcome.","Manav Gupta","I have two quick questions are Gary due to the lack of heavies specifically on the Gulf Coast, what we're seeing is a trend toward running more light sweet crude. But what that is also doing is creating lot more NAFTA in NGLs, which in turn is hitting the capital rate.","Your results showed relative installation from the trend, but we are seeing it in the industry. I'm trying to understand your view on this if the industry continues to run more and more light crude, will the capture to take a hit because of it?","Gary Heminger","Sure Manav and thank you for your comments on the additional disclosure information that we provided. We're going to ask Ray to -- Ray Brooks runs refining to take this question as he optimizes our all our crude slate. Ray?","Ray Brooks","Sure, Gary. Manav, we fill our crude slate to optimize our process units and when we talk about light crude, this really pulls of reformers into play and so we get ranges on our abilities to run light and heavy crude and this is all based on what the capacity of our reformers as in that regard.","Now, having said that, Marathon is a net buyer across the 16 plants up NAFTA and another light component natural gasoline. The reason for this as we have really two octane generating machines across our system in Garyville and our Robinson refinery because we have multiple high-quality reformers at those facilities. So, I don't look at light crude as an obstacle. I look at it as an opportunity for us.","Manav Gupta","That's very good to hear. And one quick further question, couple of days ago. A European refinery has indicated that reduced demand for high sulfur fuel oil due to IMO won't necessarily weigh on the prices of high sulfur crudes. In MPC's view, is it possible that high sulfur fuel oil price crushers and it has no impact on Maya and WCS pricing?","Ray Brooks","I'm going to start off answering that question too and then I'm going to allow Rick Hessling to add on that. In refining, when we evaluate our crudebales [ph], we do that based on the offered price and the value of the crude in our processes.","So, the crude has a lot of sour bottoms, which is HSFO that absolutely comes into our valuation and how we -- what we're willing to pay for the crude. So, Rick, do you want to elaborate on a little bit more on the crude side?","Rick Hessling","Sure. Hi, Manav I would say it will have an impact on crude prices, especially like Maya and WCS. When you look at the world and even though I would say that it's somewhat offset by the lack of Iranian and Venezuelan barrels and OPEC barrels coming in, I will tell you that high sulfur fuel oil is not directly -- if it's not directly priced into the Maya formula, it has to be accounted for indirectly when we look at the crude makeup of Maya.","So, I think you will see a shift in prices there. And I would also say the same is true for WCS. We'll value that crude based on its dispositions and its crude qualities and I think you will see that differential move as well, Manav, because it has to be accounted for.","Manav Gupta","Thanks, guys and congrats on a great quarter.","Gary Heminger","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Benny Wong with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Benny Wong","Hi guys, thanks for taking my question. My first one is really on the West Coast, which we recently saw had opportunity to host a tour and visit refineries there. It was impressive to see the level integration and talent you guys have on the ground.","I really want to ask about your outlook of the margin environment for rest of the year, which has been pretty soft recently. I was also hoping you'd be able to talk about your key execution focuses on the West Coast and I think, you kind of initially touched on the cracker opportunity in that way earlier.","Mike Hennigan","Right. Let me have Ray take that, Benny. Let me start off so both but talk about. If you look at the West Coast crack spreads and how the market has fluctuated, there had been some downtime in some refineries early in the second quarter, which are resolved in a lot of imports coming in that ended up having too much inventory in the West Coast, we see that being a run down and the inventory situation coming back more into balance now. So, we think that was a temporary lull in the early part of the second quarter. But specifically, your question, Ray will talk about some of the things that we're doing.","Ray Brooks","Okay. Benny it was, it was really great to spend some time with you and some of our other investors showing -- showcasing some of our Los Angeles assets. Gary did a good job at that. Talking about the margin environment, I want to focus on the refinery. Specifically, we mentioned several times now about the catalyst opportunity on the cat cracker. But we want to make sure we optimize the asset down in California, whether it's Los Angeles or Martinez. The early indications from the cat starting up in Los Angeles look very promising versus what we were expecting.","As far as areas of execution, there's two words I want to focus on reliability and cost. From a cost standpoint, we've done a lot of work in the first nine months at both Los Angeles and Martinez doing some planned maintenance work. We're very proud of our teams on how we were able to pull that ahead of schedule and under budget. Both which have cost impacts.","Now the focus is on reliability, we've got that kind of a clear plan with low maintenance ahead for California and we want to focus on delivering reliable performance about those assets, so reliability and cost is what we're focused on.","Benny Wong","Great. That's great detail guys. My follow-up is really on the demand side, we've seen gasoline consumption kind of has those slow start beginning to summer rebound strongly and then at recently became soft again. Just wondering, if you can provide some thoughts on what you're seeing and what you expect given your unique perspective from refinery down to the retail pump. And if you can add any thoughts on the distillate side as well, which has been pretty weak lately as well, that'd be great.","Gary Heminger","Sure, Benny. Let's take gasoline first and you said it right, at the beginning of the summer and you recall that the entire Mid-Con was having a very, very wet early, late spring early part of the summer. It's only been kind of a last month that things are finally drive up and business getting back to normal. So, we lost a lot of the kind of front end, if you will, discretionary driving that families do across the Mid-Con early in the vacation season.","But you're right, we have seen that it will be stronger until tropical storm Berry came about and dumped off a lot of weather up the Mid-Con and a little bit into the southeast. Today, we're seeing improvement in gasoline demand and as I said earlier in my comments, we think gasoline demand is going to be flat for the balance of the year.","The distillate was pretty much the same story. If you look from Iowa, all the way through Ohio, on average, probably only 50% of the agricultural demand came about as because of the farmers just could not get in the fields and again about 50% of the planting, and then you have cultivating and then eventually harvesting is going to, I think continue to put some pressure, but you look at overall distillate inventories they're at the lower end. If you look at distillate inventories by exports at the lower end of the five-year average, which we believe, continues to be a positive point for our business going forward.","And I think as we went to -- indicated that we're starting to see some early contributors to IMO with the incremental demand that we're expecting to see, we still think that distillate in the second half of the year is going to be strong.","Benny Wong","That's great thoughts guys. Thank you very much.","Operator","And next we'll go to Roger Reed with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Roger Reed","Yeah. Thank you and good morning. And well, not one of my questions. I do want to say, thanks for the detail on the synergies and congratulations on the progress so far. I'd like to kind of ask you though about Tier 3. Obviously, we've heard some comments from other companies about issues with naphtha and given its low octane component, difficult to get rid of in this market. So I'm just kind of curious, how you believe you set up with Tier 3 if to the extent that you can offer it maybe how that compares to the industry and then what you might be able to do in 2020 and beyond in terms of taking advantage of your own system to make more octane or acquire octane cost-effectively.","Greg Goff","Hey, Roger, this is Greg. And I'll talk about that. First, we're very well positioned with regards to Tier 3 and I am going to talk on 2019 standpoint when we came together with Endeavor, we had the flexibility from a sulfur credit standpoint to optimize that across our 16 plant system and really for this year has allowed us to run a couple of refineries more aggressively with regards to octane and sulfur standpoint.","Additionally, we have two capital projects, one at Mandan, one at Galveston Bay that will be completing in the next couple of months that give us the capability going forward to meet to the Tier 3 demand for 2020.","Now, your question on octane in the previous question, I mentioned that we have a lot of octane generation capacity. So we will continue to use that. We feel good with our plan for Tier 3 and don't see an octane imbalance at this point.","Roger Reed","Okay, great, thanks. And then changing gears a little bit, crude differentials all the issues, globally we could point on the heavy side and then what we've had out of Alberta as well. Just wondering what your outlook for really mostly the heavy crude, but if there is any sort of additional thoughts to add on the WTI side of it as well.","Just the outlook for the back half of 2019 and I guess a little bit tie into -- I believe it was Manav's question about the impacts of IMO in terms of heavy versus light or sweet versus sour, as we go into the beginning of 2020.","Rick Hessling","Hi, Roger, this is Rick Hessling I guess I'll start with heavy crudes on the Canadian side as a reference, we ran approximately 600,000 barrels a day combined heavy and light Canadian crude and that's somewhat consistent with what we've planned in the past.","When you look at us versus our competitors, I think you'll see that we have incredible pipeline capabilities and we're not married to any one crude. And so we didn't really have a significant shift change. I would tell you looking forward from a Canadian perspective, we're bullish here recently within the last week, the mandate again was reduced another 25 a day.","You have the potential assignment of the rail contracts, which we believe may be married up with the deals with producers that could allow them the flexibility to produce more crude.","And then if you look at the increase in rail movements month over month and the dropping of the Canadian inventories all this is a positive sign certainly, for differentials reaching that $20 a barrel mark on the heavy side.","On the WTI side, what I would tell you is, you're seeing a little bit of dislocation between WTI and WTI light. We're a buyer of the light, that's a discounted crude that we're running at Galveston Bay and in then throughout our PADD II system. So we continue to see that dislocation happen.","Certainly, I think it's been well-publicized at the end of this year, you're going to see a lot of volatility as increased pipes come online and the dock capacity struggles to keep up. So we'll be watching that volatility as well.","Roger Reed","Thanks. Maybe just one little add on to that, in terms of moving crude out of the U.S., is there any update on your project? I guess it's \u2013 I can't remember the exact little place and Louisiana, but down the Peninsula there, any timing updates there?","Mike Hennigan","Hey, Roger is Mike Hennigan. Yeah. So we continue to progress, LOOP is the name you were looking for. It's Louisiana Offshore Oil Port and we're trying to get more information into the market that explains LOOPs capabilities. It is the only VLCC capable port in the U.S. today. It has terrific capabilities. We've talked about the capability to load several VLCCs within a week. So we anticipate more and more opportunity there going forward and the LOOP people are trying to get the message out as to what our capabilities are. ","Roger Reed","Great, thank you.","Operator","Our next call comes from Paul Cheng of Scotia Howard Weil. Your line is open.","Paul Cheng","Hey guys, good morning.","Mike Hennigan ","Hey, Paul, welcome back. ","Paul Cheng","Thank you. Two question, one relates the IMO the one related to the Philadelphia energy solution shutdown in your impact. On the IMO 1, Gary and Ray, wondering if you can talk about how easy or that how much is your capability to run the high sulfur fuel oil as a feed directly into your coker and what is the pricing need to be in order to make that economic?","And also if you can talk about your post Tier 2 brand into the VLSFO as you would you intend to use primarily to VGO or are you trying to attempt directly branding the high sulfur fuel oil? And then along on that you probably have seen the pattern from Exxon and Shell and just curious is that when your legal team that how they look at and how easy or difficult just for the industry to be able to brand their compliance fee while you are finishing those pendants?","Mike Hennigan","Okay. Sure, sure Paul, I'm going to turn this over to Ray. But I am glad to see you haven't changed, you were able to get six questions in your first question. ","Paul Cheng","It's just three.","Mike Hennigan","I'll turn to Ray to answer.","Raymond Brooks","Okay. Paul, I'm going to start off with the patent portion of your question, we are continually monitoring the existing patents in the space and we are applying the appropriate and intellectual property analysis and strategies to protect our interest and facilities where we anticipate selling low-sulfur fuel oil products.","Now having said that, what I want to emphasize is that this is a small part of our IMO strategy and you really hit on it with the first part of your question where you asked about high sulfur fuel oil into our Coker. It's -- for us IMO strategy, our base plan is resid destruction and asphalt sales and we've invested a lot of money in both of those systems and we look to take advantage of that.","As far as high sulfur fuel oil, though we had put infrastructure in several of our refineries to not just process, our own internal material at that refinery, but some of the other material from our refineries and then third party material and to give you an example, we put receiving logistics infrastructure and a Garyville so that we can take Catlettsburg, Rougeunit pitch down and process and the Garyville Coker, similarly with our California refineries. We want to have the capability and will have the capability to process material from Anacortes and from Kenai refinery. So feel real good about that our goal is not to have to sell on a steady state basis, high sulfur fuel oil components.","Now there's been a lot of discussion about how the low-sulfur fuel oil will play out, whether it will be low-sulfur vacuum gas oil blending or ULSD end of the pool. A lot of opinions out there certainly from the sulfur blending standpoint if we get -- we'll get more bang for our buck with ULSD, because it's a much lower sulfur.","Having said that, we will do what the market tells us to do. We have the capability to make a lot of ULSD, we also have the capability to pivot and pull LVGO, sweet LVGO out of our cat crackers at the market says that and apply that supply that to the market.","Paul Cheng","Thank you. And that the second one Gary for Philadelphia Energy Solution bandwidth see and how that may impact how you run or plan for your Midwest operation?","Raymond Brooks","Sure. Well, let me turn this over to Dave. We just had a big discussion internally yesterday about this is, as we look at our, we have many different supply wheels and as we look at the European ORB versus the Gulf Coast ORB and how that is really changing some of the flow of the barrel. So I'll turn this over to Dave Whikecart, he can get into more detail.","Dave Whikehart","Yeah. This is Dave Whikehart. It appears that the ORB has been opened from Europe and we've seen the import volumes on gasoline come into the East Coast and July might actually turn out to be a high as import volume numbers probably for the last couple of years. So that seems to be the way that the markets are responding at this time.","Interestingly, what we've seen in terms of impacts to our supplier situation is we've seen demands on the Gulf Coast actually increase. We think it's because of these barrels have been directed to the East Coast and that's really freed up some opportunities for us to use our system to export more out of the Gulf Coast.","Paul Cheng","Dave, do you have more capability or capacity in the Colonial pipeline to do it, and does it in any share will form impacting the pending there?","Dave Whikehart","Yeah. On colonial just a comment there, initially you saw the line space increase in value. I think that with the imports coming in, it's attempt that down a bit, but you would think that the shorter position in the Northeast would pull up the line space value and we would benefit from that given our position there.","And just a general response Gary concerning our daily activities of trying to assess the opportunities to connect our refineries to markets, looking for those infrastructure investments that will enhance the return back to the refineries and put those supply options in position and that's an everyday activity for us and this opportunity is no different.","Paul Cheng","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Neil Mehta, Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Neil Mehta","Thank you, everyone, and appreciate the incremental disclosure it goes a long way and congrats on a good quarter here. The first question I had was just on Speedway is really good quarter at Speedway and so I guess the big picture strategic question is, how is the operational integration going with the West Coast retail assets that you picked up and getting them to same EBITDA per store level as your East Coast footprint.","And then the more tactical question around Speedway is should we expect a strong financial performance that you saw in Q2 to carry on here in Q3. Given what we've seen with crude prices?","Tim Griffith","Thanks, Neil, its Tim. On the integration side, things are going along nicely. You've heard about the progress on the conversions and we will probably in fourth quarter really get out on the West Coast for the conversion.","The EBITDA per store per month metric is -- we'll certainly watch it, for a lot of the locations in the West Coast, they are a little bit different footprints than what we have had in Midwest. So there could be some variance to what we've seen in the Midwest as we go, but will be a big focus. I think a lot of those locations were really built and designed for fuel volumes, less so for merchandise and for store footprints. But we'll certainly evaluate those opportunities, and see where they exist and where we may want to make investments to expand that as we go forward.","In terms of performance, quarter-to-quarter, obviously, second quarter benefited from fuel margins, we saw in late in the second quarter, a little bit of softness in crude prices and as you know, the retail prices are a little bit sticky and you saw a little bit of capture in that environment.","It will really be a function of what that price environment and commodity prices look like into third, certainly from an operating and from a merchandising perspective, we'd expect performance as good or better, obviously, the synergy capture we reported for the quarter over 30 million and that's going to continue to ramp.","I mean, a lot of the conversions correctly enable that synergy capture. So I think we'd expect performance to be as good or better on that front. Fuel margins, we'll see what the commodity price environment affords and what we're able to capture over the course of the quarter.","Dave Whikehart","Neil as you remember, the way we put the synergy capture together, Retail is really going to lag. Some of the other segments just because the time it takes us to get the stores converted and re-merchandised. But again, we're -- as Don illustrated, we're ahead of our plan within Speedway, but we expect it to have a much stronger cadence here starting in the fourth quarter.","Neil Mehta","I appreciate it. Look, the follow-up question is as it relates to the Northeast part of the mark, the legacy MarkWest assets and your MPLX business, there are a lot of questions that we're getting about the health of your customers out there and the challenges around NGL prices. So can you help again frame the commodity risk that we're thinking about as we think about this midstream business and how we should get comfortable around some of those risks that might exist out there?","Mike Hennigan","Hey Neil, this is Mike. Yeah. First off, we\u2019re keenly aware of all the rhetoric around the Northeast Appalachia situation. What I think you're seeing from the producers, however, is a response that is positive and moving toward staying within cash flows to make sure that they have a strong financial position.","A couple of our largest customers have come out and released our earnings and they're showing that they are directionally moving toward that mode. I mean, what that means for us, however, is a little slower volume up there, but that kind of fits what we're trying to accomplish.","One of our goals is to diversify our asset base, very much like our Northeast position, but we're trying to diversify, a little bit more into the Permian and some other assets on the O&M side of the business, the long-haul pipelines that we've talked about previously.","So to the extent that the Northeast producers live within cash flow, blow down capital a little bit, which is a little slower growth that's been there in the past that kind of fits what we're trying to accomplish. So that we can redeploy capital in another area and still enjoy strong free cash flow generation out of the Northeast. We've been putting a lot of capital to work up in that area and the fact that if it slows a little bit will put us in a free cash flow generation position. So harvesting cash out of the Northeast and deploying it in other areas, it's fitting the strategy that we want to accomplish.","Neil Mehta","Thanks everyone.","Dave Whikehart","You're welcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from Phil Gresh JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Phil Gresh","Yes, hi, good morning. The first question, just following up on some of the discussion around the streamlining asset sale opportunities, the opportunities to trim capital spending, how do you think about Gary, the right long-term level of financial leverage on the balance sheet, obviously, a lot of your debt is at the MLP level, but talking -- going back to the Analyst Day, thinking about the $2.5 billion of buybacks that you have committed to and clearly executing on year-to-date, do you think that there should be some balance sheet priority at all for any potential future capital allocation? Thanks.","Gary Heminger","Sure. I will ask Don to cover that. But one of the things, Phil on -- when you look, as Don mentioned in his comments today. We think the appropriate way to look at the balance sheet leverage for both MPC and MPLX is to bring the distributions, take account of those distributions back into to MPC. Don remarked on that in his comments. And let me ask Don to go into more detail here on the leverage.","Don Templin","Yeah, so Phil, I think both on the MLP side, in that the corporate level, we're going to defend our investment-grade credit profile and when we think about defending our investment-grade credit profile. What we really look at is the risk around the cash flows and the volatility of those cash flows and the consistency that you have. So as we think about that informs our decision about how much leverage we want to have as we think about the Midstream to date, sort of that four times debt to EBITDA leverage has been one that we think is appropriate and continues to support an investment-grade credit profile and if we take a view that the risk has changes in the future. I think that will inform our view about how much leverage we want at the MLP.","And the same thing as we think about what's going on at a corporate level, and I think it's appropriate to really look at MPC and think about sort of the $9 billion of debt. It's responsible for that it's not responsible for the debt of the MLPs and when I think about that $9 billion of debt and our cash flow generation capability, if you think \u2013 if you take the distributions that we get from the MLP back, it's sort of a 1.1 times kind of leverage metric, we feel very comfortable with that, especially, given the really strong performance of Speedway more than $600 million of EBITDA in the quarter. So the cash flow profile, the risk that we think is attendant to that part of the business is what's going to really influence where our leverage goes and how we manage it.","Phil Gresh","Okay.","Dave Whikecart","And Phil, a couple more comments I stated in my remarks earlier that as we look at optimizing assets, Mike Hennigan has talked about several key projects of high-grade his portfolio, we have the opportunity to use some of the proceeds to invest in those high-return projects. We certainly can reduce some debt, if that makes sense in either side of the business. So we have many options and many triggers that we can pull as we look at our capital plan going forward.","Phil Gresh","Okay. I appreciate that. My final question, Gary, I think the \u2013 a lot of the questions around the macro environment has been demand-related, there has been some cautious commentary from one of your European peers talking more kind of supply related, more refineries coming back from turnaround in the second half to perhaps some capacity additions, the offset here.","Obviously, we had the situation with [indiscernible] just curious how you think about the supply side, the dynamics and then if I could just quickly layer in that the capture rate that you had in the second quarter, I guess this is for Don the 82% number and the normalized 90% that you've talked about with the lower level of turnarounds for yourself in the second half, is there any reason to think you shouldn't be able to kind of get back to that normalized run rate? Thank you.","Dave Whikecart","Right. And just an outlook on the market, you know the West Coast markets the day and so far, here are \u2013 well, I really should talk about the latter part of July, have been our recovering is probably the proper word stated earlier, there were some imports on the West Coast that kind of put some pressure on margins, that seems to be cleaning up and margins are improving on the West Coast in the Mid-Con the same thing there are a lot of barrels that moved into the Mid-Con due to some turnarounds as the Mid-Con margins have improved here recently.","The area that has been really lagging this year has been the Gulf Coast and across the entire industry, and we're in that period of time that you're going to probably see some dislocations, as storms go through. And you have tropical depression and so on so forth. So, I think third quarter generally, gets it's stronger in the Gulf Coast. And as Dave just mentioned, with our PES closure, how some of the supply wheel is changing, is going to take some more barrels from the Gulf Coast, capture rate into the Northeast as well as some more export volume that's going to go wild. So, I would say, all in all, from a macro standpoint. I see margins being slightly positive, where they were in July. And Don is going to cover your next question.","Don Templin","Yeah, Phil, with respect to capture rate, you're right to point out that in the second quarter, there was turnaround. And that obviously impact of that. The other thing that just to remind you is that, the correlation between gas prices, gasoline prices and some of the other products that we sell.","So, you know the propanes and the specialties and everything else that also impacts capture rate. So, assuming we get back to sort of a normal correlation between those, then we would expect that our capture rate will be very consistent with our historical rates.","If gasoline, cracks run-up, that's good for our business, and if the capture -- if the other commodities don't keep pace with that, I'm not bothered by that, because the gasoline cracks have been running up.","So, capture is important, but we are looking to try to maximize the value from all of the products that we sell. And to the extent that we see something that impacts that we will try to highlight it to you and communicated to you in advance.","Phil Gresh","Okay, thanks.","Kristina Kazarian","Great, well, we passed a little bit past the operator, hour mark, So, Operator. All right, well, thank you for your interest in Marathon Petroleum Corporation, should you have any additional questions or would you like clarification on topics discussed this morning, we will be able to take your calls.","Thank you for joining us today.","Operator","Thank you.

My name is Amber, and I'll be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Kristina Kazarian. Kristina, you may begin.","Kristina Kazarian","Welcome to the Marathon Petroleum Corporation\u2019s third quarter 2019 earnings conference call. The slides that accompany this call can be found on our website at marathonpetroleum.com, under the Investors tab.","On the call today are Gary Heminger, Chairman and CEO; Don Templin, CFO; Mike Hennigan, President of MPLX; Jim Moore, Lead Independent Director of MPC's Board as well other members of the executive team.","We invite you to read the Safe Harbor statements on Slide 2 and 3. It's a reminder that we will be making forward-looking statements during the call and during the question-and-answer session. Actual results may differ materially from what we expect today. Factors that could cause results to differ are included there as well as in our filings with the SEC.","Now, I will turn the call over to Gary Heminger.","Gary Heminger","Thanks, Kristina. And good morning and thank you for joining our call. MPC has demonstrated a history of transformative actions to drive shareholder value. We separated from Marathon Oil in 2011, and since that time, shareholder returns have significantly outperform our peer group as well as the S&P.","Over the same period of time, we have returned nearly $21 billion of capital to shareholders, including a dividend that has grown at a 23% compound annual growth rate.","Now, I'll turn to Slide 5. On today's call, we plan to provide an update on our integration and execution successes from the past year and discuss our next steps to create shareholder value. We will close the call with a review of our third quarter financial results.","Moving on to Slide 6. Over the past year, our primarily \u2013 primary operational focus has been integrating our two businesses, enabling us to execute and achieve our targeted synergies. Consistent with our continuous focus on transforming our business to deliver shareholder value, beginning in January this year, we embarked upon a strategic review process to identify the next steps in our value creation process. This review included Board involvement and engagement with multiple financial and other advisers.","Throughout the process, we engaged with our shareholders to understand their perspectives on the company and incorporated their feedback in that review. As a result of that review, today, we announced our most recent step to create shareholder value, and that is our intent to separate Speedway into an independent company. The Board and our management are fully committed to pursuing the path that maximizes shareholder value, and we believe this separation will create two strong industry-leading companies, well positioned for long-term growth and success.","So now I'll turn to Slide 7 please. The new Speedway will consist all of MPC's company-owned and company-operated retail stores, which collectively generates approximately 1.5 of annual EBITDA. We believe this business has significant growth potential, fueled by a strong loyal customer base. The direct dealer business, which primarily operates on the West Coast, will remain with MPC. This is a separately managed business within our Retail segment, which is only fuel supply with no merchandise sales.","Moving on to Slide 8. As we look ahead, we are truly excited about the opportunity the separation presents to each company and will lock value and drive total shareholder return. We believe that this transaction has significant benefits for both MPC and future Speedway shareholders and has the potential to create an enterprise value at approximately $15 billion to $18 billion.","On Slide 9, one of the most important aspects that drove our decision to separate Speedway today is how much we have grown the scale and earning powers \u2013 earnings power of the business. The number of stores has nearly tripled since 2011 to roughly 4,000 and the membership within our Speedway loyalty program has nearly doubled. These successes have helped grow Speedway's EBITDA from approximately $380 million in 2011 to approximately $1.5 billion this year, a nearly fourfold increase. The impressive growth of this business within MPC has created a position we are in today and our ability to unlock significant value for shareholders.","Turning to Slide 10. Speedway has consistently been a top-tier performer in the convenience store industry. Historically, Speedway has had industry-leading same-store merchandise growth and fuel margins. On a profitability per-store basis, Speedway has consistently led the industry. And Speedway has built a platform positioned to deliver a strong earnings growth trajectory and exceptional free cash flow conversion which will support continued investment as a standalone company.","On Slide 10, the new Speedway will be the largest U.S.-listed convenience store operator, boasting a coast-to-coast retail network and a nationally recognized brand. The platform will continue its industry \u2013 will continue to leverage its industry-leading customer loyalty program to help adapt to consumer buying trends with increased focus on digital engagement with our customers.","Given the expansion of market multiples and growing size of the business, we believe any dis-synergies will now be outweighed by the potential value uplift of the separation. With the continued focus on synergies and the benefits from continuous store conversions, the new Speedway will be thriving standalone business capable of delivering strong, consistent cash generation and growth.","On slide 12. Turning to the specifics of the transaction's next steps. We expect to accomplish the separation through a tax-free distribution of Speedway shares to MPC shareholders. An important step in the process is establishing a long-term market-based supply agreement between MPC and Speedway. We expect Speedway to raise new debt and pay a dividend to MPC as part of the separation process. MPC would utilize these proceeds to reduce debt. We plan to target a capital structure to maximize valuation for both sets of shareholders and position Speedway for growth. We expect the transaction to be completed prior to year-end 2020, subject to Board approval and customary closing conditions.","On Slide 13, in addition to our Speedway announcement, we continue to evaluate midstream alternatives to enhance value for both our shareholders and MPLX unitholders. Unlocking value within midstream is more complex than the separation of Speedway. We have evaluated over 25 different scenarios to optimize MPLX' structure, including asset and business divestitures that we discussed on our second quarter earnings call as well as potential separation alternatives for MPLX, including the creation of an Up-C or conversion to a C Corp., among other structures.","We also appreciate and consider the feedback we have received from many shareholders and unitholders over the past few months. Today, we announced the formation of a special committee of the MPC Board as the next step in our continuing process to determine the best path forward.","On Slide 14, our goal has been and continues to be maximizing shareholder value over the long term. We have a track record of making bold, transformative change to drive value, and today's announcement is another step in that journey in that journey.","Over the coming months, we expect to execute the separation of the Speedway business into a publicly traded company, continue optimizing MPC, progress the realization of synergies and continue evaluating opportunities to further unlock value in the midstream business. We believe these actions will result in strong, nimble and efficient businesses that are positioned for long-term growth and success.","The new MPC will continue to be a best-in-class energy business, continuing our history of operational excellence with a strong financial profile that provides a compelling value proposition for shareholders.","On Slide 15, let me turn to our earnings discussion. Before we get to our financial results, I would like to share some thoughts on the macro environment. Distillate inventory levels are meaningfully below the five-year average, setting the market up for strong momentum as we approach the implementation of IMO regulations.","Gasoline inventories are also materially below last year's levels on the days of supply basis. U.S. turnaround activity for the fourth quarter appears in line with prior years, further supporting a positive forward outlook. ","On differentials, the heavy Canadian market continues to move in our direction. The WTI to WCS spread, which averaged just over $12 in the third quarter, has widened to around $17 per barrel. Given the potential for government rail credits and easing of mandated production cuts, we expect continuing \u2013 continued widening of this differential.","On the product side, the ULSD to high sulfur fuel oil spread has now widened to $38 per barrel, providing a significant tailwind for coking economics. MPC is well positioned to capture this opportunity across our major coastal refineries. At our Garyville facility, the coker upgrade project, which is occurring this quarter, is expected to increase our resid destruction capacity by 14%.","As part of our ongoing preparations for the IMO fuel spec change, we have established a new retail bunker operation in the Los Angeles area to complement our operation in the Pacific Northwest. We made our first deliveries of IMO-compliant fuel from those facilities in October. Both locations are prepared to offer a variety of fuels to meet market requirements. The focus of the first year of our combination was execution to unlock realized value.","We have made significant, observable progress, improving mechanical availability and operational integrity at our acquired refineries, expanding our commercial capabilities across the value chain and reducing costs. This, combined with our high-quality asset base, positions the company to be nimble and thrive in any business environment.","I would like to take this time to congratulate Greg Goff for the announcement of his retirement from the company, and his 38 years in the industry have been quite impressive. Also, I want to congratulate Mike Hennigan on his promotion to President and CEO of MPLX, effective tomorrow. Mike has a deep background in all aspects of Marathon and MPLX portfolio, and we welcome his guidance as we go forward.","Now I will turn the call over to Don Templin to discuss the third quarter highlights.","Don Templin","Thanks, Gary. Slide 16 provides a summary of our third quarter financial results. Earlier today, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.63. Adjusted EBITDA, which excludes $164 million of turnaround costs, was $3.1 billion for the quarter.","Operating cash flow before working capital was approximately $2.6 billion. We returned $848 million to shareholders this quarter. And through the first nine months of the year, we have returned approximately $3 billion to shareholders.","Slide 17 shows the sequential change in adjusted EBITDA from second quarter to third quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was relatively flat quarter-over-quarter with slightly lower earnings in the Retail and Refining & Marketing segments, partially offset by higher earnings in the Midstream segment.","Before reviewing the details of each segment, I would like to discuss our synergy capture for the quarter. As shown on Slide 18, we realized $283 million of synergies in the third quarter. $210 million of our synergies were in the Refining & Marketing segment. Benefits in the quarter included unit optimizations that improved distillate recovery. We also saw improvements in cat cracker yields and throughput and continued crude supply and refined product distribution optimization.","In Retail, we continue to see benefits from economies of scale, our labor model and enhancement of the merchandise model across our newly converted stores. This has contributed to higher merchandise sales and margin at these locations. The $34 million in corporate synergies represents continued cost eliminations, including headcount reductions and contract renegotiations made possible by the combination.","Through the first nine months of the year, we have realized $686 million of synergies, including $89 million of onetime synergies. Our execution through the first nine months gives us great confidence that we will exceed the upper end of our $600 million of gross run rate synergies targeted for 2019.","Slide 19 provides additional insight into our synergy capture since the combination with Andeavor. Synergies improved capture by approximately 1.5% for the quarter. We have also delivered reductions in operating costs and overall SG&A expenses. Although these expenses may fluctuate somewhat from period to period, our team is executing on the commitment to reduce costs.","Moving to segment results. Slide 20 shows the change in our Midstream EBITDA versus the second quarter 2019. MPLX EBITDA increased $31 million versus the second quarter. This increase was driven by growth across MPLX' business, which included delivering record gathered, processed and fractionated volumes. We also continued to progress the reversal of the Capline pipeline with a purge of the mainline initiated in October. In Texas, the Gray Oak pipeline is nearing completion and is expected to be placed to service by the end of the year.","Slide 21 provides an overview of our Retail segment. Third quarter EBITDA was $555 million. Retail fuel margins were nearly $0.25 per gallon in the third quarter. Same-store merchandise sales increased 5.2% year-over-year, continuing the positive trend we have seen over the last year.","Operating expenses increased by $47 million in the third quarter, primarily due to usual summertime seasonality. Speedway continues to execute its brand expansion strategy through store conversions. We converted 142 sites in the third quarter bringing the total number of conversions since the combination with Andeavor to approximately 550.","We remain on track to reach 700 total cumulative store conversions by the end of 2019 including locations on the West Coast and in the Southwest.","Slide 22 provides an overview of our Refining and Marketing segment. This segment performed very well despite declines in crack spreads in the Mid-Con and West Coast regions. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $1.4 billion, a decrease of approximately $110 million versus the second quarter, despite an approximately $5 per barrel decrease in the Chicago WTI 3:2:1 crack spread, Mid-Con margin only decreased by approximately $3 to $17.42 per barrel for the quarter.","Our Gulf Coast margin was $11.26 per barrel in the third quarter, an improvement of nearly $2 per barrel versus the second quarter. Our West Coast margin decreased by approximately $2 to $15.85 per barrel for the quarter, primarily due to a $4 per barrel decrease in the West Coast ANS 3:2:1 crack spread. Capture for the quarter was an impressive 94%, a significant increase versus the second quarter. The increased capture was driven by enhanced margins through realized synergies as well as favorable price realizations.","Page 30 of the appendix provides additional details on our capture for the quarter. Earlier this month, we completed turnaround work at our St. Paul Park and Gallup facilities. The Gallup turnaround was completed following a seven-year operating run, which is longer than the average five-year to six-year cycle we typically follow.","As a result, during the Gallup turnaround, it was necessary to remediate numerous issues to bring the facility up to Marathon's safety and operational standards. During the St. Paul Park FCC turnaround, the refinery was able to maintain maximum crude rates by exporting gas oil, much of it to our Garyville refinery. This is the first time St. Paul Park has been able to export to this magnitude, yet another example of our commercial team's ability to leverage our larger system.","Slide 23 presents the elements of change in our consolidated cash position for the third quarter. Cash at the end of the quarter was approximately $1.5 billion. Operating cash flow before changes in working capital was a $1.6 billion source of cash in the quarter. Working capital was $168 million source of cash in the quarter largely due to higher payable values, which were partially offset by higher inventory levels.","Return of capital to MPC shareholders via share repurchases and dividends totaled $848 million with $500 million worth of shares acquired in the quarter. Distributions to public unitholders of MPLX were $310 million for the quarter.","As shown on Slide 24, we have a strong track record of maintaining through-cycle financial discipline. At quarter end, we had approximately $28.8 billion of total consolidated debt, including $19.7 billion of debt at MPLX, which is nonrecourse to MPC. MPC's parent level debt of approximately $9.1 billion represents 1.1 times the last 12 months of MPC's stand-alone EBITDA. This ratio excludes the debt and EBITDA of MPLX, but includes the distributions MPLX paid to MPC.","On Slide 25, we provide our fourth quarter outlook. We expect total throughput volumes of just under 3 million barrels per day. Planned turnaround costs are projected to be $185 million. We have planned turnaround activity at the Garyville refinery in coordination with our crude revamp and coker drum replacement projects. The project work and turnaround activities are aligned to optimize total plant downtime. We also have project work on the coker at our Los Angeles refinery. As a result, we expect higher operating cost for the Gulf Coast and West Coast in the fourth quarter for these project-related expenses.","Total operating costs, including major maintenance, are projected to be $6.10 per barrel. Distribution costs are projected to be $1.3 billion, which is consistent with prior quarter guidance.","For the Retail segment, we expect fuel volumes of approximately 2.5 billion to 2.6 billion gallons, and merchandise sales in the range of $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion. With that, let me turn the call back over to Kristina.","Kristina Kazarian","Thanks, Don. [Operator Instructions] With that, we will now open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Roger Read","Well, thank you. Good morning and Gary, congratulations on, I mean, what's been a great run across the board here. I know bumpy at times, but what you've been able to do in terms of putting this company together, given how well the Q3 results turned out and all. And then I think, setting up a really interesting strategic move here at the end, it's pretty phenomenal. I want to just say congratulations on that front.","Gary Heminger","Thanks, Roger.","Roger Read","And then could jump into the question side. I guess, really, what I'd like to talk about first is the strategic review, which I imagine was a component of the merger, but you started this at the beginning of the year, now we get the announcement on the retail front and potentially on the Midstream business as well. Just how did the whole thing come together? And I know we've had a lot of public pressure here in the last 30 days, but I can't imagine you decided to spin Retail just in the month of October. So maybe a little background on how the whole review process went?","Gary Heminger","Sure, Roger. And you're very astute in your thinking. As part of any integration process, and when we made this acquisition, it was evident as we try to bring these different business segments together and the operational components that we've talked often about the synergies. But as we go through month by month, though, working on the synergies, there's a much bigger picture that, of course, we've been looking at, and that is how do you take these assets, bring them together and how do you drive value beyond just one plus one?","And so I'd say, going back, as Don commented and I commented in my remarks as well, if you go back to the early part of the year, that was just natural for us, working with the Board. Every Board meeting and in between Board meetings we would update our Board on how we were coming on a project that we call project uplift on looking at the various segments of our business and to determine the values. And we recognized, obviously, the widening of the market multiples within the retail class of trade, and we've been watching this for some time.","But I think what's most important, and we recognized this very carefully in our due diligence process when we were looking at the acquisition of Andeavor that the retail component within Andeavor was set in many different modes and did not have a singular focus on how to drive value in that retail component. And we thought that, that was the first component that really made sense for us to combine the \u2013 into the Speedway brand quickly and then be able to drive synergies beyond that. And I think we are in a good way down the road in being able to accomplish that through Tony Kenney's, back when we first did the acquisition, and now Tim Griffith, carrying these synergies further, it just became evident and a compelling story that now is the time. You really look at it, Roger, since 2011, we took the EBITDA of Speedway from $381 million to about $1.5 billion, a tremendous story \u2013 tremendous execution story by all the members of Speedway.","Roger Read","No. Definitely impressive there. And another thing, kind of thinking about when you made the acquisition of Andeavor, the view here on the refining side was that Marathon was a much better overall operator refining, at least here in the third quarter, that seemed to come through. So I was just sort of curious if you could kind of help us understand a much better quarter than peers, I would say, in terms of utilization, in terms of capture here. And how much of that is something that you would say is now part of the sustainable model versus \u2013 you have maintenance one quarter, you don't have another, that always has an impact on sort of top line performance. But op costs looked a lot better, and again, capture looked a lot better. Just kind of help us understand how that process worked through.","Gary Heminger","Right. And I'll have Ray and Don go into a little more detail. I think what you're seeing is we've been asked many times by you and others, show us where the synergies are, where are the synergies showing up across the board? And I've said for the last couple of quarters, you just have to give us time. As we grow that through our integration, and you'll see that we will start to distance ourselves from the competition. That is showing up this quarter. I almost probably remiss after the first quarter and not stating, we had to go in and clean up a lot of refineries, particularly the old western refineries that needed some repair and integrity work completed, and we got that done. And so now I think that our refineries are going to be running very, very well. Let me ask Ray to go into some more of the details.","Ray Brooks","Roger, you kind of touched on the key drivers in your question. If I had to say two of them, they're high utilization and reliability of our assets during the quarter. We commented a year ago at the Analyst Day that reliability would be a key focus in our integration. If we go back to 2013 when we bought the Galveston Bay refinery, that was a key focus, and we're following that exact same game plan across all 16 refineries in our portfolio.","Just to give you one example for the quarter, in the second quarter, we invested in a turnaround at the Los Angeles refinery in the cat and in the gas oil hydrotreater, but we just didn't do a turnaround. We invested in improving the reliability of the unit, and then we also invested, and we've talked about this in changing the catalyst formulation to give us better yields on the cat cracker and improve our gasoline production performance. That has worked out well for us, and into the third quarter, late in the third quarter, that really paid off handsomely for us.","Roger Read","Okay. Great. And once again, Gary, congratulations. We're going to miss you and hope everything rolls out fine for you in a, what I'm sure, will be a glorious retirement. Thanks.","Gary Heminger","Well, thank you, Roger. But you're going to have put up with me for another quarter.","Roger Read","Well, we'll suffer that. I'm just kidding. We look forward to that, and we'll definitely enjoy watching you ride on out. ","Gary Heminger","All right. Thank you, Roger. Very kind of you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Doug Legate with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Doug Legate","Yes. Thank you. Good morning, everybody. Gary, let me echo the congratulations that Roger laid out. I was kind of hoping you and I would get a chance to do another supermarket launch in the U.K., but I guess, we'll have to leave out for another time. But for all the things that have gone on with the company in the last little while, you've put it together. And whatever value at least people think are going to come out of it, it really comes down to the vision you had when you started this whole thing. So true congratulations, Gary. And again, wish you all the very best in retirement. And with that \u2013 go on, Gary. Sorry, go ahead.","Gary Heminger","Thank you.","Doug Legate","Well deserved. Let me just ask a couple of questions, if I may, on the Midstream. I think Roger touched on it, but I don't think we've got into the weeds. You've obviously mentioned the committee without giving a lot of details. I'm just wondering if there's anything you can tell us at this early stage on how you might think about what that process looks like. What are you focusing on specifically if there's any one issue or several issues to how you think that might play out?","Gary Heminger","Sure, Doug. As I outlined in my comments, we have cases numbering 25 or more that we've looked at, many different scenarios. And Mike has really led \u2013 Mike Hannigan, has really led the analysis in and around the Midstream. And let me ask Mike to go into a little more detail here, then I can talk some more about what the committee will do going forward. So Mike?","Mike Hannigan","Hey, Doug. We're always looking at challenging ourselves on ways to create value. And just to let you know, we stated publicly back in the summer that we had been engaged for quite some time with multiple external advisers as well as our internal team on ways to unlock value in Midstream for both MPLX and MPC. Gary mentioned, we've analyzed over 25 different cases. We've looked at different structures, cash flow impacts, balance sheet impacts, tax considerations, transaction costs, liquidity and credit ratings, restructuring implications, synergies, dis-synergies, C Corp, no C Corp.","All of those things play an important role in the analysis that we've done. And to date \u2013 Doug, the bottom line to date is we have not found the silver bullet to act on that would create value, and like I said, that's why we haven't announced any activity in this regard. We obviously support the Board's special committee to continue to evaluate options and look for ways to create value. But like I said, up until this point, we have not found the silver bullet.","Gary Heminger","And Doug, the committee that's going to be led by Mike Stice, who you know has a significant amount of Midstream experience, and Frank Semple, again, a lot of midstream experience and some other members of our Board, will continue to work on \u2013 work with management, but they will really drive this to a conclusion. And our goal, of course, is to come to conclusion sooner rather than later.","Doug Legate","I appreciate that answer. I understand it's early days, but I wonder if I could just follow-up with a related question. Obviously, the Midstream business was established by some pretty significant drop-downs from the Refining business. And one could argue that, that cost base increase for Refining has potentially left it somewhat volatile as a stand-alone company if you did separate out the Midstream. ","So I'm just curious if you could kind of address that issue directly. Is a potential buy-in of at least part of at least part of the legacy Refining assets on the table as one of the potential options? I'm just curious how you address that residual volatility of a stand-alone Refining business. And I'll leave it there. And again, Gary, many congratulations. ","Gary Heminger","Thank you much Doug. And I\u2019ll ask Mike to go into more detail. But you're right, and I remember discussing with you when we dropped the Refining logistics and the fuels distribution piece into the MLP. As we do this analysis, Michael will go into detail here that has been kind of a centerpiece of our analysis. So Mike?","Mike Hennigan","Hey Doug you are right on. That is one of the implications that are looked at in all these cases. As Gary mentioned, Refining logistics and fuels distribution was a major drop. We're looking at about $1.4 billion of EBITDA, and that comes into play when we look at how we would restructure to try and create value. So you're right on that, that's one of the implications. But like I mentioned previously, there's a lot of other implications that also come into play. That's one very important one that you're pointing out. ","But as I mentioned, and I'm not going to repeat myself, but all those other things come into play too. No one single item was driving any of the analysis, but when you looked at everything on a whole, that's where we have come to not finding a silver bullet that would create value. And like I said, that's why we haven't announced.","One thing I would say to you, though, in the midstream space, our strategic review continues to be driving the portfolio more towards the L&S segment. If you saw in our announcement, we've high graded the portfolio. And now that we've combined with ANDX, what was a $2.8 billion growth program, we've brought down to a $2 billion growth program with a lot of concentration on return on invested capital. And we are high grading the portfolio and diversifying it much more towards the L&S business and less towards the G&P business as part of our ongoing strategy.","Doug Legate","Understand. I appreciate the answers guys. Gary, if you're around for one more quarter, I hope to see you at our conference in New York in March. Good luck. Talk to you later.","Gary Heminger","Thank you for inviting me.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Cheng of Scotia Howard Weil. Your line is open.","Paul Cheng","Hey guys good morning. Let me add my congratulations to Gary, Greg and also Mike for your new appointment. Gary, I think I perhaps know you longer than most people. Still remember that back in 1997 when you set up the Ashland and Marathon joint venture. I don't think anyone could even remotely look back, say, at the time of the super refiner that we see today. So congratulations. And also that, thank you for all the years, all the help.","Gary Heminger","Thank you.","Paul Cheng","With that, maybe then I have two questions. One, Gary, in the post-IMO world, if the economic is there, how much is the high sulfur we see or the major components that you guys can run in your system as a feedstock in your coker or the mixing with oil for the distillation tower? And when you do that, is there any economic loss or efficiency loss that you expect? Or that you essentially will be able to just replace \u2013 displacing the heavy oil by running the recede? And what kind of ratio we may be talking about? Then I have a second part question.","Gary Heminger","Well, that was kind of a three-parter there, Paul. But anyway, let me turn it to Ray Brooks. Ray has a lot of good details of what we've done to invest in our refineries. We mentioned we have the Garyville coker expansion going on right now. So let me have Ray go into these components of your question.","Ray Brooks","Sure. I'll do Gary. Paul at our coastal refineries we have the ability \u2013 the capability to bring in high sulfur fuel oil into our facilities and run it through our cokers. And when I say capability, we have both the process capability, the coking and resid upgrading and then we also have the infrastructure, the ability to receive it. So just to give you a flavor for capability on the infrastructure across our four coastal refineries with resid destruction, we have 50,000 barrels a day of capacity to resid.","Now what I don't want you to do is assume that we're going to do that and just back out crude. That will all depend on the relative economics of the resid stocks that are out there and available and then in what we can do alternatively running crude oil. Now this is something that we're not just looking at, we are actually doing some of this today. Gary talked in the macro about the coker spread currently is $38 a barrel. So we're taking some of our cut resid from our Anacortes refinery, we're running it down to Martinez, running it through the coker and backing out some crude. So, it's something we have the capability to do and we're doing it today. Primarily, though, we do that through our delayed cokers.","Paul Cheng","Okay. Ray, does it make any difference between using delayed coker or fluid cooker? Hello.","Ray Brooks","Yes Paul, as far as delayed coker and fluid cokers the yield pattern we would expect to be roughly similar. What I will tell you is we don't have any \u2013 we have totally delayed cokers at our facilities, we don't have any fluid cokers. Our Martinez refinery, going back a decade ago, they did, but they actually replaced it with delayed coker and not so much for any kind of yield improvement, but from a reliability standpoint. So that's our prime mechanism for resid destruction. At Galveston Bay, we actually \u2013 I think you know this, we have a resid hydrocracker that can run 70,000 barrels a day. But primarily we'll feed that through back resid from our crude slate. ","Paul Cheng","Final question though, on the medium sour, we have seen them widening. And on the last couple of months that I think we have seen ASCI discounters are somewhat wider Mars. And so when will you guys purchase? Is it modeling to Mars or modeling to ASCI in your Gulf Coast system? ","Rick Hessling","Hi Paul. This is Rick Hessling. You're absolutely right. We're seeing the same widening you are in fact over the last couple of months we've seen a $2 or better widening. And if you look at the forward curve that continues to widen as we look out into 2020. I would tell you we feel part of that as IMO-driven. And I would also tell you that we're very bullish on the numbers and the forecasts that we're getting with the medium sour Gulf of Mexico production. So all good for MPC. Specifically to your question, I would tell you the majority of the ASCI crude and the Mars that we're running in the Gulf Coast is tied to ASCI. So that's very positive to us as we move forward, especially into 2020 and here at the end of the fourth quarter.","Paul Cheng","Do you guys run only Maya?","Rick Hessling","Right now we are balanced with our Maya receipts. Paul, we look at Maya next to our alternative, which is heavy Canadian. And we have great access to heavy Canadian. And right now we are very balanced with what we're receiving versus the optionality of the heavy Canadian that we have.","Gary Heminger","And Paul we have the ability, we could run more Maya. But every day, we're looking at what drives the best and maximizes our profitability. And due to the way our refineries are set up, we find alternatives that are better. And Ray can give you some more detail.","Ray Brooks","Yes, I just want to jump in here a little bit Paul. When we're looking at sourcing our crude, and I'm going to stick to the U.S. Gulf Coast where we have two powerhouse refineries in Galveston Bay and Garyville. We're not just looking at filling the coker, but we\u2019re looking at filling the whole downstream suite of units. And specifically those two refineries we have a lot of reforming capacity, almost a quarter of our crude capacity is reforming at both Galveston Bay and Garyville. So we're looking for a crude slate that doesn't just fill the cokers, but it also fills the reformers. So we're looking at naphtha base \u2013 naphtha-rich crudes and resid-based crudes.","Paul Cheng","Thank you very much. And congratulations to Gary, Greg and Mike. And Gary, if you are going to be in New York, please let me know I want to take you out from dinner. Thank you.","Gary Heminger","All right. All right, I like that Paul. Thank you.","Operator","Next we'll go to Manav Gupta with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Manav Gupta","Hey Gary, you talked about the shareholder returns since you spun off. One thing you did not talk about is the share price performance. I remember back in 2012 when I started covering MPC, you are a $30 stock. So from there to $130 [ph] adjusting for the stock split, it's a very strong run.","Gary Heminger","Well, thank you. Our team is very proud of us, and this is a team sport. ","Manav Gupta","Two quick questions, Gary. We have seen a material improvement on the capture on the West Coast. You kind of highlighted some parts of it. But if you can run us through what has changed since you acquired these refineries to this point where you are seeing a material improvement in operational and commercial operations on the West Coast, any initiatives that you have executed, which is allowing you to capture this higher margin?","Gary Heminger","Sure. Let me have Ray go into some of the operational highlights. And then I'll have Don talk about some of the synergies and how we're starting to really build our synergies quarter-on-quarter?","Ray Brooks","Sure. I'll start it off with the first few quarters of our integration, we were really focused at Martinez and Los Angeles on doing turnaround and project work, turnaround \u2013 cycle-ending turnarounds and also projects to improve our reliability. So the fourth quarter last year and the first two quarters of this year we had significant work and cost associated with that. In the third quarter we got to focus on running our assets, reaping the benefits of the reliability and the improvements that we made.","So I really think that's what we're saying at Los Angeles and Martinez, we're seeing a good high utilization and reliability at both those facilities.","Don Templin","And I would say on the commercial side one of the things that we've been focused on is making sure that we, this is Don, that we maximize or optimize the system. And so a good example would be recently with the crack spreads and the economics on the West Coast have been very strong. And as we have historically supplied our growing Mexican \u2013 our growing Mexican needs from the West Coast. But we know we have the optionality and are executing on the optionality and are executing on the optionality to actually supply Mexico, the ARCO stations and the other supply that we're providing there from the Gulf Coast, so that we can optimize the realization in the California market \u2013 or West Coast market.","So I think the combination of the Refining operations and the ability to have flexibility and optionality around the placement of our refined products we're really seeing some of the benefits that we anticipated that we would see and that were a driving force behind the combination.","Manav Gupta","Thanks for that. On Speedway, you have grown the business from $350 million to almost $1.5 billion now. And as you look at this business going ahead, what's the growth path here? And what can it do on a standalone basis?","Don Templin","Okay, let me turn that over to Tim, as he looks at this business.","Tim Griffith","Manav great question. I think, we think the opportunity set is very strong here. Conversion and synergy capture are certainly the near term priorities in terms of the locations on the West Coast and bringing them into the system. Introducing the Speedway model both from labor, from merchandise, food service and everything, that makes sense in the markets we're operating in. And once we're through that \u2013 and again we expect that we're going to be largely ramped up probably by mid next year on a lot of those synergies. We'll continue to watch for organic opportunities. There likely will continue to be some new to industry builds in some selected markets where we think we've got nice advantage, as well as be mindful of what may be available in the marketplace. This is still a relatively fragmented industry that we're bringing scale and size can really make a difference. So we think the opportunity set is tremendous here.","Don Templin","And one of the other things Manav if you look at Speedway we're just in the early innings of our capturing synergies in and around Speedway. And that just follows the re-identification and bringing the company-owned, company-operated stores under one brand. But as we ramp up here, we're on the cusp of really having a strong really acceleration in our synergy capture. And we're starting to see that the stores that we converted first were the stores up in Minnesota that we converted in the fourth quarter of last year.","And it takes a while, but now we're seeing those sales increases mainly inside the store. We're bringing volume back out in the front court, but we're seeing those merchandise sales starting to come up outside. We're also seeing the same thing of the southwest stores that we've rebranded and brought into the Speedway family.","So, not only growth, but the capital is already invested. And now you're going to see Tim your synergies to date have been how much?","Tim Griffith","Just for the quarter as Don talked about we are on track to be well over $100 million for this year.","Don Templin","And Manav so, to take my point further, we expect to grow synergies upwards of $300 million. And that's what the investment basically done. So, over the next 12 to, I'd say, 18 months, you're going to see a rapid growth in synergies with really no incremental investment, which will be a big help in organic growth for Speedway.","Manav Gupta","Yes thank you so much guys for taking my question and congrats.","Operator","Next we'll go to Benny Wong with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Benny Wong","Hi, good morning. I also want to say congrats to Gary and Greg. I've really enjoyed working with both of you. And I for one who has definitely benefited from the wisdom you've shared. My first question is on IMO 2020, which we're hearing a lot more about in the market and appreciate the helpful prepared remarks. Just wanted to dig a little deeper on what you guys are seeing in the market, particularly on the demand side, especially given a lot of other worries around a broader recession we've had for most of this year.","Gary Heminger","Yes, so let me ask Dave Whikehart \u2013 and Brian Partee. Brian runs all of our marketing, and Dave runs all of our really IMO-related logistics and planning phase. So let me have them jump in here and give you some details.","Dave Whikehart","Well, this is Dave Whikehart here. I mean, we\u2019re certainly seeing in the last three, four months, we've seen ULSD inventories in the U.S. be drawn down probably 20 million barrels, maybe somewhere around five days of forward cover. And at the same time really firming of the diesel cracks and \u2013 which is likely to continue. Also in the Gulf Coast, we've seen our suite VGO prices increase above gasoline prices, which may open other opportunities. I mean the market is doing what it's doing. They're trying to efficiently supply this product.","I think what's more interesting is maybe what Ray and Brian have to say about what we're doing about is it to capture those opportunities.","Brian Partee","Yes, thanks Dave. This is Brian Partee. Just a couple of comments. As we think about IML, I feel like the market is moving through kind of a three-step action reaction process around pricing. So the first step in that process, we saw pan out in the third quarter and it's still where we're at today is really on the fuel oil itself. As you think about the low software to high software spread moved out to about $250 a metric ton or about $38 a barrel. I mean looking ahead to the future's market, it's is very supportive to arrange very tight to that $250 metric ton range. So it feels like the bunkering market has found its footing there, which has had carry-on implications to the yield of sulfur fuel oil spread that Dave indicated, which is a core supporting coker economics, et cetera.","On the inventory side, what's notable is we're not only low on this border ULSP, we're also low on fuel oil in the U.S. So both are at outside of the five-year ban. What's most interesting \u2013 and particularly in the Midwest, I'll kind of shift to diesel, we anticipated a pretty lackluster demand given a very wet spring we've had. The demand has been very resilient. Here in the third quarter as we progress to the fourth quarter, we have seen very resilient demand on the distillate side. And with lower inventory positions to support it through actually higher capture on the wholesale marketing side from a margin perspective. So it\u2019s a strong indication of having low volume and margins the same time.","And the third part of the action reaction is really on the heavy oil, high sulfur crude spreads. And those of course are widening out as well. So I think the market we're really at the operational threshold of progressing through IMO specification. I don't know that we're at peak IMO. I think we're just starting to understand that as a marketplace. But all indications are very favorable, and we feel like we're in a great spot to capture IMO.","Ray talked a little bit about our operating capabilities to run heavy fuel oil. We've got the meaningful coastal refining exposure. We've got the retail bunkering business that we've continued to expand that gives us transparency to the full value chain. And lastly, we have a really strong commercial team that we've put together to manage that side of our business.","Benny Wong","Great. I appreciate those thoughts very helpful. My second question is a little more nuanced just around the timing of the Speedway spin. Just wondering if you can maybe talk about the sign post and hurdles we should keep an eye out for that process from now until the expected close at year end?","Gary Heminger","Sure, Benny. I don't know if I call them hurdles, but obviously we have a lot of work to do. We'll have to prepare the Form-10. One of the biggest things as a long-term supply agreement with \u2013 between Speedway and MPC. MPC has supplied over eight billion gallons of supply into the Speedway network. As we've talked often the integrated value of having Speedway gives that assured volume back to the Refining side of the business.","So, we'll put together a supply agreement to be able to capture that over time. We will go through different financing and credit ratings, reviews, negotiate some other commercial agreements around trucking, so on and so forth. But I think the biggest part done other than the Form-10, I think that's the biggest part from a preparation standpoint.","Don Templin","Well that's an important commercial \u2013 that's a important commercial arrangement. But then that will ultimately feed we want this to be obviously a tax free spin. And so that will likely feed a private letter ruling process that does take our experiences, it does take some time. So you'll need the fuel supply arrangement as an integral part of that process around the PLR.","Benny Wong","Great. Thank you very much guys.","Don Templin","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from Phil Gresh your line is open.","Phil Gresh","Yes, hi. Good morning. And Gary, I just wanted to echo everybody else's sentiments, congratulations on a great career. First question here just as we think about Speedway, versus Refining and the potential capital structure, I know maybe still some thought needs to be given here, but we and others, I think, have tried to run analyses about proper capital structures given the variability or lack thereof EBITDA at the different entities. It seems like you'd be able to maybe take Speedway to three times leverage. And I believe, with Refining, you might even have some asset sales in the next here. If you could comment on that? It seems like you could have pretty low leverage at the Refining company. So any color you might be able to share it would be helpful.","Gary Heminger","Sure.","Don Templin","Phil this is Don. I think we indicated in Gary's comments that we want to make sure that we position both companies spun Speedway and MPC, to be \u2013 that have optimal value following the separation. So we want to be able to position Speedway so that it can compete with the industry consolidators that are out there right now. So we want to make sure that they have capacity in their balance sheet to be able to do that. But we will also defend our investment grade credit profile at MPC. So, our expectation is there would be leverage on Speedway. We would pursue a capital structure that will allow them to have a high valuation in growth, that there would be a dividend from then Speedway up to MPC.","And our expectations is that we would use that cash to either maintain or enhance our core liquidity and to pay down debt, so manage our leverage. So those are the things that we would expect around a transaction with the separation. But those are details, the market will continue to evolve over the next number of months, and those are details that we'll refine as we go through the process.","Phil Gresh","Okay.","Gary Heminger","Yes and to the balance of your question in and around asset divestitures or whether that's on the Refining, Midstream or Speedway side. In fact Tim just closed or was just in the process of closing some small divestitures inside the Speedway of stores that fit in a Marathon-branded model going down the road. We continue to look at some Speedway \u2013 excuse me, in some midstream assets. Mike covered those in his comments earlier. We continue to look at those, but it's obvious in and around the G&P segments right now. Some of the G&P assets are not garnering the, what I would consider to be market value, full market value for those at this point in time.","We continue to look at our refining system. We're very pleased with the footprint of our refining system. But as we go down the road here, we will look at what makes the most long-term strategic sense for us as well.","Phil Gresh","Okay. Second question would just be as you think about in an ex-Speedway scenario how do you contemplate the right return of capital to shareholders? Is there a right formula to think about for the \u2013 I'm sorry, for the Refining business, the remain co? Obviously, I presume that would depend a lot on how things play out with the MPLX side? But just any thoughts you might share there would be interesting? Thanks.","Don Templin","Yes Phil, this is Dawn again. Yes, I think there's enough moving pieces that it would be hard to sort of articulate a particular strategy. What I can say is that we have a track record we think of being very good capital allocators. We've invested in our business to grow our business, but we've also been an industry leader around return of capital to shareholders. We think that's an important tenant around being an investor in MPC. And so we would expect that that commitment would continue into the future.","Phil Gresh","Okay. I appreciate it. Thank you.","Operator","And next we'll go to Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Neil Mehta","Yes congrats Gary, Greg and Mike on all the announcements. And Gary in particular, we're going to miss your big predictions at the conference every year, always something we looked forward to. I guess the one question I had around Speedway is just sort of going back a couple of years ago we had talked about the potential dis-synergies associated with the spinning off Speedway. I think market conditions have certainly changed given the multiple expansion. But Gary, maybe you can just talk a little bit about what has changed in the calculus to make it accretive now?","Gary Heminger","Right well, Neil there are still synergies. Of course, when you supply eight billion gallons of product to a company on a ratable basis, and I would say, the dis-synergy still is on the working capital side. But what we stated is that where we see the market multiples today and the tremendous growth that we've had within Speedway over the last few years. Just today, it fully dwarfs the value, the compelling value, dwarfs that synergy value as compared to the way we reviewed it a couple of years ago. So yes, we still \u2013 we'll have some dis-synergies. But again, I say it becomes a very compelling equation today as we looked at this business and feel that, that's the right thing to do.","And with the supply agreement I talked about earlier, we have done a lot of work around the supply agreement, and we're confident that we will have a supply agreement that has to be good for both parties. The supply agreement, I would anticipate it to look a mirror image, basically, of how we've been supplying Speedway over the last couple of years. And I think that in and of itself, pretty much will encapsulate the synergies that we've talked about.","Neil Mehta","That's great. And my final question is for Mike on the MPLX side, your 2020 CapEx, you did take it down pretty significantly, and I think it's a good show of capital efficiency. Can you just talk about some of the moving pieces around capital spend as we look into last year and into next year? ","Mike Hennigan","Yes sure Neil. One of the highest priorities we had when we combined the MLPs was to get a combined capital portfolio for the single MPLX that survived. So our first order of business, I'll say, in the first month that we did that, we looked at both portfolios of capital and stand-alone MLPs were about $2 billion on the MPLX side and about $600 million on the ANDX side. And as we looked on it, we thought we had a nice opportunity to high grade, take the best return as we prioritize ROIC as a top priority. So that was one thing that was driving us.","The second thing that was driving us is over the last couple of years we've been strategically trying to move the portfolio much more towards L&S and less towards the G&P business. So a lot of the change that you're seeing there from about $2.8 billion of capital down to about $2 billion of capital was related to that strategy. I remind people that in 2018 we spend about 85% of our capital in the G&P business. And by 2020 we'll be targeting for about 75% in the L&S business as opposed to the G&P business.","So bringing the capital expenditure from that $2.6 billion back down to $2.0 billion, I think, is a good first step. We're going to continue to look at how we can high-grade and put ourselves in a position where we are generating more free cash flow going forward.","Neil Mehta","Great, guys. Congrats again.","Operator","I'll now turn the meeting back over to Kristina Kazarian. Thank you.","Kristina Kazarian","Thank you for your interest in Marathon Petroleum Corporation. Should you have additional questions, or would you like clarification on topics discussed this morning, we'll be available to take your call. And with that, thank you, operator.","Operator","That concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."],"14355":["Marathon Petroleum Corp.

My name is Christine, and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Lisa Wilson, Director, Investor Relations. You may begin.","Lisa Wilson - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Thank you, Christine. Welcome to Marathon Petroleum's First Quarter 2017 earnings webcast and conference call. The synchronized slides that accompany this call can be found on our website at marathonpetroleum.com under the Investor Center tab. On the call today are Gary Heminger, Chairman, President and CEO; Tim Griffith, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and other members of MPC's executive team.","We invite you to read the Safe Harbor statements on slide 2. It's a reminder that we will be making forward-looking statements during the call and during the question-and-answer session. Actual results may differ materially from what we expect today. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included there, as well as in our filings with the SEC.","Now, I will turn the call over to Gary Heminger for opening remarks and highlights. Gary?","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Thanks, Lisa, and good morning and thank you for joining us. Let me begin with some highlights on slide 3. This morning, we reported first quarter earnings of $30 million, or $0.06 per diluted share. First quarter results reflect substantial turnaround activity at our three Gulf Coast refineries. In April, we successfully completed this turnaround activity ahead of schedule, under budget and with exemplary environmental and safety performance.","I'm especially pleased with our refinery team's focus on safety with no lost-time injuries incurred in almost 3.5 million man-hours worked during the turnarounds. This marked the first set of turnarounds for the Garyville Major Expansion process units since they came online in late 2009, completing an outstanding seven-plus-year run. During the turnaround, we took the opportunity to upgrade process units such as the hydrocracker at Garyville, which can now operate at 121,000 barrels per day, a 73% increase from its original capacity.","Turnaround work at our Galveston Bay refinery included the second of the refinery's two crude units. Both crude units have now been through a Marathon-conducted turnaround and are consistently processing over 500,000 barrels per day, highlighting the operational improvement we continue to pursue at the facility since we acquired it in 2013.","Market conditions during the first quarter were challenging for Refining & Marketing. While crack spreads and sweet\/sour crude differentials were favorable, these benefits were offset by weak product price realizations. Market dynamics, including higher inventory levels and seasonally weak demand, were both factors contributing to this weakness. That said, we have seen notable signs of improvement, including declining U.S. petroleum inventories and strong underlying economic activity.","With our substantial Gulf Coast turnaround activity behind us, we are well positioned to drive continued top-tier operational, safety and environmental performance and take advantage of increasing refinery margins, favorable crude oil and refinery feedstock purchase cost, and seasonal improvement in our consumer demand for our products.","Turning to Speedway, despite experiencing a slight decline in year-over-year operating results, we are encouraged by improving market conditions seen late in the quarter, with strengthening gasoline and distillate demand, and remain optimistic as we enter the summer driving season. We continue to be enthusiastic about the growth in our Midstream segment, supported by MPLX's strong financial and operational results in the quarter. First quarter segment income increased over last year due to growth in processing and fractionation activity in the Northeast and the Southwest, as well as contributions from our logistics and storage assets.","On the growth front, MPLX completed several organic projects and strategic transactions during the quarter, further diversifying its asset base and strengthening the partnership's position as the largest processor and fractionator in the prolific Marcellus and Utica shales. In March, we completed the first of several planned dropdowns to MPLX as outlined in our strategic plan, and began funding a substantial return of capital to our shareholders.","I'm pleased to report, work is on schedule to prepare the remaining assets slated for dropdown to MPLX. We also look forward to the exchange of our general partner economic interest for newly issued MPLX common units in conjunction with the completion of the dropdowns. All transactions are subject to market and other conditions, as well as requisite approvals.","These actions are designed to unlock the value inherent in our midstream platform and to provide substantial ongoing return of capital to shareholders in a manner consistent with maintaining investment-grade credit profiles at both MPC and MPLX. Additionally, a special committee of the board and its independent advisor expect to complete the ongoing review of Speedway by mid-2017. We are enthusiastic about the future for MPC and MPLX, and remain focused on driving long-term value for our shareholders.","With that, let me turn the call over to Tim to walk you through the financial results for the first quarter. Tim?","Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Thanks, Gary. Slide 4 provides earnings on both an absolute and per share basis. For the first quarter of 2017, MPC reported earnings of $30 million, or $0.6 per diluted share compared to last year's $1 million, or less than $0.01 per diluted share. Recall that first quarter 2016 earnings included a goodwill impairment charge of $0.04 per diluted share and an LCM charge of $0.02 per diluted share.","The chart on slide 5 shows the change in earnings over the first quarter last (06:29). Before I get into absolute results, I wanted to highlight a change in segment reporting as a result of our March 1 dropdown of terminal, pipeline and storage assets to MPLX. The results from these assets are now shown in the Midstream segment. Previously, these results were part of the Refining & Marketing segment and that shift is reflected in the earnings walk.","Segment results show this reporting change from the date these assets were considered to be a business for accounting purposes: January 1, 2015 for pipeline and storage assets, and April 1, 2016 for the terminal assets. Accordingly, the terminal assets are reflected in R&M for the first quarter of 2016 and in the Midstream segment for the first quarter of 2017.","For the year-over-year comparison, the walk highlights two increases for the quarter. First, Midstream reported an increase of $120 million, primarily driven by increased processing and fractionation activity and the earnings from equity investments in a new and existing pipeline and marine operations, as well as the change in reporting for the results of the terminal assets I just discussed. Second, the absence of impairment expenses in 2017 resulted in a favorable year-over-year effect of $129 million.","These increases for the quarter were offset primarily by a $32 million decrease in Speedway earnings and a $150 million unfavorable variance in income loss attributed to noncontrolling interests. This $150 million variance largely reflects the year-over-year increase in MPLX's net income and its allocation to the public unitholders of MPLX, as compared to the partnership's net loss in the first quarter of 2016, driven primarily by the goodwill impairment charge last year.","Moving to slide 6, our Refining & Marketing segment reported a loss from operations of $70 million in the first quarter compared to an $86 million loss in the same quarter last year. Before I review the segment results, I want to highlight the changes we've made in this walk aimed at providing additional insight into R&M income from operations.","We've recently added a RIN\/CBOB adjustment to the market data (08:29) to the walk to the right of the LLS 6-3-2-1 crack. This impact was previously captured in other gross margin on the walk. As this amount has been carved out of other gross margin, we've also provided a further breakdown of that category, highlighting how much relates to crude, products and volumetric gains in the period. We believe the renewable fuel obligation, otherwise known as the RVO. or RIN, is embedded in the refinery gate price of (08:59) gasoline and diesel, and the LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spread reflects this cost.","For obligated products, the RVO, like other costs, is incorporated into our trading and pricing decision and ultimately recovered and passed on to consumers. This perspective that RIN cost is reflected in the crack underpins our belief that moving the point of obligation has no real economic effect on refining profitability nor an impact on the viability of any specific refinery. We think this is a short-term look that is ultimately a distraction to the more fundamental changes that need to be pursued with Renewable Fuel Standard and the way it's been administered.","As to the absolute Refining & Marketing results for the quarter, increased crack spreads in both Chicago and the Gulf Coast created a favorable impact of $441 million compared to the first quarter of 2016. The blended crack spread increased from $4.62 per barrel in 2016 to $7.72 per barrel in 2017. Also, a decline in RIN prices produced a $27 million favorable RIN\/CBOB crack adjustment. As discussed, this benefit was considered in our pricing decision and passed on to consumers, thus an equivalent offset resides in the product portion of other gross margin.","Several factors offset these favorable impacts during the quarter. First, a narrowing contango effect, shown in the market structure column of the walk, resulted in a $110 million unfavorable variance as the difference between the prompt crude prices narrowed in relation to the benchmark LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spread, as we adjust the market metrics to reflect actual crude acquisition costs.","Second, a decrease in other gross margin had a $162 million unfavorable impact to segment results, mainly due to weak gasoline and non-transportation product price realizations reflected in the $325 million negative product impact versus the first quarter last year. Third, we had an increase in direct operating cost of $144 million, primarily related to higher turnaround activity at our Gulf Coast refineries. As Gary mentioned, we successfully completed substantial turnaround activity at Texas City, Galveston Bay, and Garyville refineries during the quarter.","While higher than last year, our direct operating costs of $9.45 per barrel in the quarter were about $0.60 per barrel better than what we expected in the quarter, due to strong cost management of the turnarounds. As we mentioned last quarter, we expect full year planned turnaround and major maintenance cost across our refining system to be similar to full year 2016 levels. (11:36) million unfavorable variance categorized as other in the walk relates to the March 1 dropdown and associated changes in segment reporting from Refining & Marketing to Midstream for the terminal assets that I referenced earlier.","Moving forward to the other segments, slide 7 provides the Speedway segment results walk for the first quarter. Speedway segment income was $135 million in the first quarter of 2017 compared to $167 million in the same period of 2016. Comparability of Speedway's results to prior year's first quarter was affected by the transfer of Speedway's travel centers into the newly formed joint venture with Pilot Flying J called PFJ Southeast LLC in the fourth quarter of 2016.","Speedway's share of the results of operations from the joint venture is reflected in income from equity method investments and is shown in the other column on the walk, while prior quarter activity remains in light product margin, merchandise margin and the other bars. Speedway's change in segment income, a decrease from light product gross margin, had a $31 million unfavorable impact as margins averaged $0.157 per gallon in the first quarter of 2017, down from $0.168 in the first quarter of 2016. The decrease in margin is primarily due to the lower margin per gallon and the absence of contributions from the travel centers for the quarter.","Similarly, a decrease in merchandise margin of $10 million was due to the absence of contributions from the travel centers. Without this impact, merchandise gross margin would have increased over last year. Income was also lower compared to last year, given the $24 million gain on a location sale in the first quarter of 2016 compared to a $3 million gain in 2017.","Partially offsetting these unfavorable variances is a $30 million favorable variance in the other segment income, which reflects the decrease in operating expenses due to the absence of the travel centers in 2017 and Speedway's share of the results of the new joint venture. In April, we've seen a roughly 2.3% decrease in same-store gasoline sales compared to last April. Speedway's same-store gasoline sales was impacted by higher retail prices versus last year and is in line with EIA published industry data.","Slide 8 provides the changes in the Midstream segment income of $120 million quarter-over-quarter. The $86 million favorable variance for MPLX was primarily due to higher processing and fractionation prices and volumes, and income from the terminal assets acquired from MPC. As mentioned earlier, the Midstream segment income for the first quarter of 2016 does not reflect any results from these terminal assets since they were not considered a business for accounting purposes until April 1, 2016.","The absence of financial results for the terminal assets in the first quarter of 2016 represents almost half of this favorable variance. Earnings from equity investments in new and existing pipeline and marine operations also contributed (14:41).","Slide 9 presents the significant elements of changes in our consolidated cash position for the first quarter. Cash at the end of the quarter was nearly $2.2 billion, an increase of approximately $1.3 billion from year-end 2016. Core operating cash flow before changes in working capital was a $703 million source of cash. Working capital was a $410 million source of cash for the quarter, due primarily to a decrease in current receivables and inventories, partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities.","Additionally, consolidated cash flows impacted by debt borrowing and repayments including MPLX's $2.2 billion debt issuance and MPC's repayment of the remaining $200 million under the term loan. Cash flow also reflects net proceeds of $148 million from opportunistic equity issuances by MPLX through its ATM to fund its organic capital program.","Return of capital to shareholders via (15:46) $610 million in the quarter. After the dropdown closed on March 1, we executed $420 million of share repurchases in March and ended the month with an additional $60 million of share repurchases commitments that were settled in April. We would expect this activity to resume once we're out of blackout following the quarter.","Going forward, we expect cash proceeds from the dropdown and ongoing LP distributions to fund substantial ongoing return of capital to shareholders, all conducted with a continued focus on maintaining an investment-grade credit profile at both MPC and MPLX. Finally, cash associated with the MPLX and Antero Midstream joint ventures, purchase of noncontrolling interest in a fractionation capacity at our Hopedale complex was the primary contributor to the $170 million source reflected in the other category on the walk.","Slide 10 provides an overview of our capitalization and financial profile at the end of the quarter. We had $12.6 billion of total consolidated debt, including $6.7 billion of debt at MPLX. Total consolidated debt-to-book capitalization was about 38% and represented 2.8 times last 12-months adjusted EBITDA on a consolidated basis or about 2 times, excluding MPLX. We continue to show debt-to-EBITDA, excluding MPLX, as we think it is more useful to show the independent capital structures given the effect of relatively higher leverage of the growing partnership on MPC's consolidated metrics and our approach to managing capitalization separately.","Slide 11 provides updated outlook information on key operating metrics for MPC for the second quarter of 2017. We're expecting throughput volumes of 1.975 million barrels per day, up from second quarter 2016, primarily due to increased crude processing capabilities at Galveston Bay and Robinson. Total direct operating costs are expected to be $6.80 per barrel. Other manufacturing cost (17:47) higher primarily due to higher forecasted natural gas prices than the same period last year.","We expect to see an advantage from processing sour crude as reflected in our expectation that it will make about 61% of crude oil throughput in the second quarter. Estimated percentage of WTI-priced crude is expected to be about 20%. Projected second quarter corporate and other unallocated items are estimated at $80 million for the second quarter.","With that, let me turn the call back over to Lisa. Lisa?","Lisa Wilson - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Thanks, Tim. As we open the call for your questions, as a courtesy to all participants, we ask that you limit yourself to one question plus a follow-up. If time permits, we will re-prompt for additional questions.","With that, we will now open the call to questions. Christine?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question is from Chi Chow of Tudor, Pickering & Holt. Please go ahead.","Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Hey. Thanks. Good morning.","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Good morning, Chi.","Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Gary, you \u2013 good morning. Yeah. Gary, you mentioned in your remarks that you're currently seeing more favorable feedstock costs. But it looks like to us that crude differentials relative to Brent have really tightened across almost all grades outside of Permian, in particular, for medium and heavy barrels. How do you reconcile your statement to what we're seeing on these market prices?","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Sure. And let me have Mike Palmer who, of course, is in charge of buying 2 million barrels a day. Let me have Mike get into the details here.","Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Hi, Mike.","C. Michael Palmer - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Yeah, Chi. I guess we're fairly optimistic about differentials really. We think that if you look \u2013 start with the Brent-WTI spread, I guess we know it's been trading between $2 and $2.85. We think it's going to move toward the upper end of that range. That'll be favorable. We believe that if you look at the heavy market, for example, it has been influenced, obviously, by the Syncrude plant fire and explosion.","Those differentials are now starting to come back to normal. So we think that will be attractive in the second half of the year. And, frankly, we've been seeing plenty of spot opportunities generally on the harder-to-process kind of crude oils, heavy sour, sometimes high acid. So, we still see plenty of opportunities.","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","And, Chi, the other thing is, we've talked about this before with you and other analysts, we have the ability to run two-thirds sweet or two-thirds sour. And so, we have tremendous flexibility. Here in the first quarter, we almost topped out at close to two-thirds, probably can run a little bit more of sour, but it just shows the tremendous flexibility we have to go back and forth and take advantage of whichever crude gives us the best economics; and we answer that question every day. So, I think that flexibility, along with Mike's comments, is really what gives us some optimism.","Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Okay. I guess on the Canadian situation, how is that impacting your crude supply strategy here in the second quarter in the Midwest? And then, I guess just more broadly, the OPEC cuts and the production declines we're seeing in Mexico, Colombia, Venezuela are very steep, and it just seems like this may be a longer-term issue on tightening this. But, do you have any concerns long term on these issues?","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Mike?","C. Michael Palmer - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Chi, I guess what I would say is that we do believe that there's a lot of OPEC resolve to bring the market back in balance. So, we do think in the second half of the year, that's certainly going to be a factor. I think from our standpoint, what I would tell you is kind of what Gary already has. We have a lot of flexibility within our system both in terms of running sweet crude, running very heavy, high (22:27) crude. We have a lot of logistics opportunities and flexibility. So, I don't think it's going to be a problem finding crude oil to run. And I think that we're in a position where we can find the most cost-advantaged crude to run as well.","With regard to your question on Syncrude and how that's going to affect the second quarter, again, it kind of comes back to the same story. We have a lot of flexibility to process synthetic crude oil in our plants, but when we see something like the Syncrude explosion that takes place, to us it's an opportunity. And that means when Syncrude gets expensive, we'll sell off the Syncrude and we'll bring in another crude. We've got the flexibility to do that. So, that's kind of how we see it as we move forward.","Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","You bring barrels up Capline and do you slack the coker at Detroit because of the heavy dose type unit? I'll leave it there.","C. Michael Palmer - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","No. We haven't seen a need to slack the coker at Detroit, no.","Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Okay. Okay. Thanks, Mike. Appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Neil Mehta of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good morning, Gary.","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Neil, how are you?","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Doing well. The first question is around share repurchases. We had a nice number here in the first quarter, supported by the dropdown. Gary, can you just talk about your strategy around share repurchases and how aggressive you think you can get around reducing your share count in 2017?","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Sure. And I'll have Tim help me here. But this is clear, from our January 3 announcement, what our plans were and this is right on with our strategy of returning capital to shareholders. So, we were very aggressive here in the first quarter. We've elected to use our internal sources versus an ASR. We just think it's better for us, better for the economics of the share repurchases to do it internally than to go out and do one block. But our plans are \u2013 we did $420 million here, really $480 million if you look at what wasn't settled, kind of overlapping the end of the quarter. But we expect to continue to be very aggressive in share repurchases.","Tim, you want to add into that?","Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Gary, I think that's right. I mean, ultimately, our activity was bounded to March for the first quarter, but we expect this activity is going to resume into second quarter. And I think you could expect to see similar pacing as we go forward and utilize the drop proceeds.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","That's great, guys. And the follow-up is on Speedway, and it's a two-part question. I guess the first is, Tim, can you read out that demand number again or retail sales number for April? I just want to make sure I got it. And just, in general, what you're seeing in terms of volumes going through the system?","And then, Gary, I recognize we are still going through the process here. But, how are you thinking about the latest in terms of what to do around Speedway from a corporate structure perspective?","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Sure.","Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Yeah. Neil, the...","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Tim or Tony, you want to handle the first part?","Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Yeah. Sure. Neil, for April same-store, so far we've seen about 2.3% decline on year-over-year for April and I'll hand it over to Tony for his comments.","Anthony R. Kenney - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Yeah. And, Tim, that's really reflective of the market conditions so far that we've seen. So, actually, Speedway, the U.S. market demand data suggests it's down slightly more than Speedway, so we're tracking that. One of the factors in there is the average retail prices are up year-over-year as well. So, that's part of it.","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","And, Neil, if you look at, average retail is up $0.40 to $0.50 over same period last year. I go back and looked at the first quarter and we're early here in April. This number here of 2.3% was just for April. But if you look at first quarter, we were down 1%, so we outperformed the overall market significantly, Speedway did in the first quarter. But with our position in the market and needing to get this increase in the wholesale price and crude cost to the market, I think that's what has had a temporary lull in demand.","As far as our study, our full and thorough review, as we've stated on Speedway, it continues to clip along at a very good pace. The special committee is very engaged. Our outside advisors are engaged and by mid-year, the definition of mid-year will be sometime summer or late summer, we will have a conclusion of the direction we're going. So, we continue to move along rapidly in this study.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","All right. Thanks, Gary. We'll stay tuned.","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Edward Westlake of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Edward Westlake - Credit Suisse","Yeah. Good morning, Gary, and congrats on getting a big maintenance schedule behind you.","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Thank you.","Edward Westlake - Credit Suisse","I guess just on that maintenance schedule quickly, I mean there was some self-help going to be coming through an Analyst Day from a few years ago, I think $350 million. And that was up from $175 million last year. Are these turnarounds going to deliver some of that improvement in the assets that was behind some of those Analyst Day slides?","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Yes, Ed. In fact, in my comments I talked about the hydrocracker. When we first built Garyville, that hydrocracker was rated at, I don't know, 70,000 to 72,000 barrels per day. And now, we have the hydrocracker only with improved technology, very little incremental capital. We have it up to, I think, the second largest hydrocracker in the world at 121,000 barrels per day.","We're seeing the same thing at Galveston Bay. Now that we've been through both crude units, improved the technology, improved the operations and really been through Marathon-style turnarounds, we have that plant now up, running 500,000 barrels per day. The same thing at Robinson where we upgraded some systems at Robinson.","So, the systems, the technology is in place. And that's what's important here in our comments is that we didn't go out and build new units. We improve the technology, improve the \u2013 some of the operating and mechanical performance of the process units in order to be able to increase the throughput. So, I think we're right on schedule. Of course, everything is a result of how margins are.","But, the other thing that I think is important \u2013 I was talking to Tom Kelley who runs our Marketing group. We're expecting a strong year in asphalt. And as \u2013 a question we had earlier on can we \u2013 would we slack a coker, well, we have the flexibility to even make more asphalt if the market requires, and we're starting out the first quarter here, as we start into the asphalt season, a very strong demand, up over 6% versus same period last year. And I think that flexibility is going to help us as well. So, all of these things should deliver. We have the opportunity to deliver the incremental economics that we've talked about in the past.","Edward Westlake - Credit Suisse","And then switching, I mean so many things to talk about to MPLX. I mean, one of the things that was going to be a result of the merger was the synergistic investments. There's the Alky, there's NGL long-haul pipes, NGL exports, Centennial, some of the infrastructure you have. Maybe any comments as to how far we are along in terms of some of those decisions?","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Sure. Don?","Donald C. Templin - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Yeah. Sure, Ed. As you probably saw in the MPLX update, as well as the MPC one, we are working very hard and focused on growing our organic backlog. And, in fact, our guidance for organic growth capital has increased up to the top end of the range as $2 billion this year and we are continuing to identify a lot of those opportunities. So, we're very optimistic about the outlook. We are very optimistic about sort of what our producer customers are experiencing, particularly in the Marcellus, and also in the Southwest we have some exciting opportunities in the Delaware Basin supporting our producer customers there.","You asked specifically, I think, about the Alky project. We have done a lot of analysis around that. As you recall, the driver of that was driven \u2013 the economics were being driven by the differential between butane and sort of octane value. Currently, that differential isn't strong enough in our view to go forward with that project, but there's been a lot of engineering done around that and to the extent that there are the market factors and the economics would support that project, that one can be revisited and accelerated in terms of implementation.","Edward Westlake - Credit Suisse","So, to summarize, most of the pull that you're seeing on organic CapEx is sort of gathering, processing, closer to the upstream wellhead?","Donald C. Templin - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Yeah. I would say that and there are opportunities and we're continuing to explore opportunities at around pipelines, in general. I mean, clearly there's a lot of build-out in the Permian generally and to the extent that you can get product to the water and provide producer customers alternatives to just the domestic market, people are very interested in projects that would allow them to do that and we're continuing to explore those types of projects.","Edward Westlake - Credit Suisse","Okay. Thank you.","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","And, Ed, to your question on Centennial. Centennial still can be a resolution to be able to get incremental propane, butane, maybe even ethane to the Gulf Coast and it's \u2013 we continue to work with our partner on this project. However, the producers who are looking for that additional route and additional market are still analyzing which direction they want to go. And we're not ready to pull the trigger on this project yet, as we continue to work with the producers to get their commitment on whether or not that reversal goes forward. So, we're working it hard, but the producers have to make the decision if they want a second market.","Edward Westlake - Credit Suisse","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Cheng of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey guys. Good morning.","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Hey, Paul.","Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Good morning, Paul.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Gary or maybe this is for Tim. Tim, if we're looking excluding MPLX on a pro forma after you finish all the job and the exchange of the GP, where is the sweet spot for you from MPC standpoint, the net debt-to-EBITDA or net debt-to-capital of those ratios? And how those ratios may change that if you have decided to spin off Speedway?","Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Well, I think for how we view things today, we sort of view the \u2013 around 2 times on a net of MPLX basis is probably an appropriate area. Again, we've focused on maintaining an investment-grade credit profile, we'll continue to do so. Again, the prospects of any change to Speedway is something we'll have to assess as we go. It's certainly been an important part of the cash profile of the business.","And if that were not a part of the business, I think we'd need to reassess and understand what that impact would be. It may very well support a even lower leverage than that. But that's clearly all part of the overall analysis and assessment that we're going through, and that will clearly be an important part of our consideration, so.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And from an accounting standpoint, when we go for the dropdown, the remaining of the dropdown, the EBITDA loss from the refining, are they going to come out from the gross margin or they're just for the gross margin realization or they're just going to be all increased in the refining expense line?","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Well, again, depending on exactly how it's structured, for what we've got contemplated for fuels distribution, for instance, or for the refinery assets, that would be earnings that would have an impact on gross margin.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","When you do the dropdown, will you be able to just maybe, at the time, give us some idea so that we know how to model?","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Yeah. I think we can probably provide some framework around what that could look like. The important part, from an MPC perspective, is that for a lot of the earnings that could have an impact on the R&M metrics, we're effectively turning it into a distribution stream that's coming from the partnership. So, again, we've continued to view this as sort of an enterprise-level initiative, but we certainly can provide some frameworks around the best way to think about things on a more segmented basis.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","That would be really appreciated. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Brad Heffern of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Good morning, everyone. Gary, I was wondering if you could put some more flesh on the bone on sort of your macro comments to start the call. It sounds like, at least, in your retail system, you're seeing headwinds on the gasoline side. I think your guidance is for a record throughput in the second quarter. The rest of the industry has been running at record levels over the past few weeks. So, is there a concern that whatever demand growth we are seeing is just going to be offset by people running so well post such a heavy turnaround season?","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Well, Brad, I think the key ingredient to your question is where we see exports going and we see exports while we were a little over 200,000 barrels a day, we export 226,000 in the first quarter. But our book going forward gets us back into the historical range of 300,000 barrels a day, plus or minus a little. So, the export book continues to be strong.","It looks like we're \u2013 from a macro level, we're fairly \u2013 I would say, it's evident that we're kind of teeing up to be in the same position of last year. Inventory share in the first quarter from the gasoline side, especially pads 2 and 3, are on the gasoline, distillate inventory, are pretty much in check what they were last year. First quarter inventories and the market seem to take a pause yesterday on why gasoline inventory built in PAD 1 here last week, but that's all of the timing of cycles coming through Colonial, some cycles possibly from Plantation Pipeline, but \u2013 or maybe just the \u2013 when some imports hit the New York Harbor.","But, all in all, it's early in April and Tony talked about a slight pullback in demand, but that's because we're up $0.40 to $0.50. So, from a macro standpoint, I think the crude market is going to continue to have strong resolve in trying to get crude prices up. I think that's going to help in differentials over the same period. But I believe as long as we stay in this range, we're kind of ranged $2.25 to $2.50 in gasoline right now. I would expect demand to be about the same as this period last year. And I think everything \u2013 the flywheel is going to be the exports. And export demand continues to be strong. So, I think we should be okay.","Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thanks for that, Gary. And then I was wondering if there's any update on the fuels distribution private letter ruling, is that still being pursued and where are we in the process?","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Sure. Tim?","Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Sure, Brad. So, with regard to the strategic plan, I mean, I'll give a broader update that we're very much on track with all of the sort of remaining drops and putting the company in position to proceed with those. With regard to the fuels distribution specifically, again, we were obviously very pleased to see the new QI regs issued in January and made part of the Federal Register. Based on our reading of them, it looks like it'll be supportive of our model.","They do have an effective date of January 1, 2018, and right now it would be tough for us to rely for activity in 2017 on that, but we'll pursue every angle. Again, I think the net result is that we're still very encouraged by the prospects and having everything ready to go, and we'll evaluate any and all alternatives to sort of accelerate that, but we feel pretty good about the path forward right now.","Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","And, I'm sorry. Christine, I just wanted \u2013 Paul, your question with regard to the drops and the impact on the refinery piece, I want to just clarify. The impact on segment income for R&M will certainly be there. But it more likely will get picked up in sort of other cost. It'll be sort of an operating cost imposed within the refining system as a service contract. So, I'd indicated part of R&M gross margin, but actually it will be picked up in sort of other elements of operating expense within R&M. Nonetheless, when we get to that point where it can be helpful, we'll certainly try to provide some framework around it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Sankey of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah. Hi. Good morning, everyone. It's really a follow-up to all the above questions. If you could just step back and give us the overall timeline. Is the next event going to be the independent committee? And then, would it be the private letter ruling? And is the best guess that the whole process of restructuring is completed by end of the year? Thanks, guys.","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Well, Paul, it's good to talk to you. Haven't heard from you in a long time.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Hey, man. Hi, Gary.","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Yeah. Yeah. To go through the \u2013 the next step would be, more than likely, as we had outlined earlier, we would expect to have late second quarter, early third quarter another drop. And then the drop we're looking at, we think, would have minimal tax impact based on the tax reform discussions that are public at this point in time.","One thing that I think we all need to be cognizant of, and I know many of the investors that we've talked with, who have asked us questions, is to ensure that we're keeping a close eye on how tax reform might affect, whether it's a 12 \u2013 a December dropdown or whether it's a January, early 2018 dropdown, depending on how whatever tax changes might go into effect. And, of course, we're continuing to work and be very diligent in what that tax planning might be.","So, the next thing would be a dropdown sometime mid to late summer. Secondly, we will follow through with the study of Speedway through the special committee. And then, lastly, and we're proceeding on, we will have all of the drops ready from an accounting, finance, tax, administrative standpoint. We're pursuing and working very, very quickly to get all of those drops ready. Tim just explained the PLR process, which is positive. So, everything will be ready to go, but I think everybody would conclude that we need to be as tax efficient as possible.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Understood, Gary. And then speaking of having not spoken for a while, when we last spoke, it was before the inauguration, 100 days of this presidency shortly coming up. How have things changed? I mean, of course, border tax is a huge issue and we last spoke \u2013 what's your latest perspective on what's happening in DC? Thanks.","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Yes. Then that's a very good segue into this tax reform. If you noticed what the President, Secretary of Treasury and Mr. Cohn announced yesterday, you didn't hear the words border tax anywhere in that preview. And so, I think the work that not only we have done, but the entire business community continues to work on is that border tax just doesn't seem to work going forward. So, that's very positive and I recall speaking at your conference. That was a big issue.","And as I said, we had a lot of work to do and, so far, I think we've been successful in outlining and trying to educate what that meant for companies such as ours in our industry. So, our work, we continue to be very, very positive with this administration and the President and his outlook on the energy industry, his outlook on where we think some positive steps can be taken on renewable fuels. And, obviously, with the pipeline permits that have been approved that helped get DAPL up and going and we expect mid-May for the first deliveries to come out of DAPL, that is certainly going to be a positive for us in our Midwest refineries. So, all in all, very, very positive with this administration.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Thank you very much, Gary.","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Phil Gresh of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, good morning. I guess I'm going to ask one more tax question just as a follow-up to your comments about the next drop. I believe all in, it's a question for Tim, you had expected a roughly, I think, $1 billion tax implication from this entire plan. I'm wondering if there's any update to that, kind of ignoring what might change here.","And then secondarily on tax, do you expect the consolidated tax rate to come down at all as more income flows to MPLX? I know the first quarter was a bit below the trend of last year. So, I'm just wondering how that might progress.","Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Yeah. I think, Phil, I guess, to answer the question, two parts. One is, what the cash tax impact would be on the drops, I think, and ultimately the guidance we provided around that of roughly 20% over the course of the full drops we think is still appropriate. The effective tax rate for the corporation will be impacted over time as the drops are commenced, given the NCI impact and the amount of allocated income that will go to unitholders. So, there will be sort of an evolution over the course of the drops that will very likely drive down the effective tax rate over the course of the next couple of years. And, again, as we get closer to that and we can provide a little bit more clarity, we'll try to do so.","Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then, just a second question. You had given a wide range, I think, around potential valuations for the GP-LP swap. I think it was around $9 billion to $12 billion type of range a while back. I'm wondering if you've dialed in on that any more at this point. Any additional color you might be able to provide?","Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Yeah. Phil, again, I think the range that we gave at the time we thought was an appropriate range, I don't know that there'd be any updates. The valuation of the GP interest is clearly going to be part of a comprehensive process that we will do an assessment. We will make a suggestion as to what we think that value is worth. We'll work through with the MPLX board and its conflicts committee and ultimately land on evaluation. So, I don't know that there's any more color or adjustment to a range that we'd provide at this point. Again, this is a process that's out in front of us and I think the range that we've given is one that we still think would be appropriate.","Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Last question, just on the product-related component of the other gross margin, it was definitely softer than any quarter of last year and you made some opening remarks on this. Just wondering if any of that was perhaps one-time in nature. I think there have been some other publicly-traded retailers that have talked about some wholesale headwinds in the quarter. And I'm just curious, has that, in any way, influenced the product-related component of the margins this quarter?","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Mike, do you have any comments?","C. Michael Palmer - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","I guess, I'm not clear on what this one-time issue was, Phil. Could you explain that further?","Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","There are some wholesale headwinds called out, in particular, Colonial line spacing values and things like that, that other companies have talked about. I wasn't sure if that in any way \u2013 I believe wholesale is still in your refining business, your refining segment, but I didn't know if there were...","C. Michael Palmer - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Yes, it is.","Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Any particular headwinds there that you think influenced you, that might have been temporary in nature?","C. Michael Palmer - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","We have seen \u2013 certainly in January and February early on, we saw specific weakness in some of our markets. And I think that's improved somewhat in March and April. But in terms of one-time events, no, I don't \u2013 I can't think of anything.","Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Right. Yeah. Okay. That's good. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Corey Goldman of Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Corey Goldman - Jefferies LLC","Hey, guys. Good morning. Just a quick follow-up, Gary, to your comments regarding Centennial. Just to go the other way towards the east. So, with SXL formally moving forward with the expansion on ME2, which allows a little bit more than 0.5 million barrels a day move west to east. Just wondering since that pipe will be capable to move refined products, can you comment on MPC's appetite to move some gasoline or diesel to the East Coast and what would be needed from MPC to make that possible?","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Sure. And I'll let Mike talk about that since he manages all of our movements.","C. Michael Palmer - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Yeah. That's certainly something that we're interested in and watching. In our Midwest refining system, we do have further capacity that could be used. And certainly it's seasonally during the year we need further markets. We've talked about this before. So, we're interested in moving additional product outside of the Midwest, and we'll look at that over time.","Corey Goldman - Jefferies LLC","Got you. And then were there any impact to Speedway if you were to start moving product towards the East Coast?","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","No. That wouldn't have any impact to Speedway at all.","Corey Goldman - Jefferies LLC","Okay. And then just a last question from me. Presumably, the dropdowns to your point about timeline won't be completed before the Speedway strategy is announced. So, just wondering, how does the committee look at a Speedway strategy if the MPLX portion is kind of yet to be completed? In other words, we won't have a view on really the value of those IDRs until after the Speedway committee kind of came to a conclusion. So, I was wondering how they view the changes at MPLX and the value proposition there and what that means for Speedway within MPC.","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","I would say, Corey, that those are two different matters that, the value of the IDRs will really have no impact on the decision of Speedway one way or the other. Speedway is already \u2013 the volume that goes through Speedway is already implicit in MPLX, and the amount of volume that we're moving through MPLX today. But I would say that it really wouldn't be a determinant either way.","Corey Goldman - Jefferies LLC","Isn't the committee looking at whether or not Speedway is valued properly in MPC though?","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Oh, absolutely. What I'm saying is, you asked a question on how Speedway in or out of MPC would affect the MPLX \u2013 the drops of MPLX. I'm saying that doesn't matter either way. We still have the volume that's already inside of MPLX and would expect \u2013 and that's one of the big questions is, can you have a supply agreement attached to \u2013 if you decide to go a spin route, can you have a supply agreement attached to that spin in order to be able to maintain the volume that goes through? That's yet to be determined, but what I'm saying, I don't see the volume. We would expect that we would have a supply agreement either way. So, that really is not going to have an effect, but absolutely, the committee is looking at the value.","Corey Goldman - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Understood. Thanks, Gary.","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Spiro Dounis of UBS Securities. Please go ahead.","Spiro M. Dounis - UBS Securities LLC","Hi, everyone. Thanks for squeezing me in here. Just two quick ones. Gary mentioned the strength or potential strength in asphalt this year. Just curious on when you think that can really start to impact the capture rate and product realizations as we kind of go through the second quarter. And then just along those lines, maybe just give us more color on, I guess, why you think there's going to be that much strength this year versus last year.","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Well, you just look at the backlog of projects and the inventories of asphalt that we came out of the end of last year, the inventories that are available of asphalt. So, that's why I make that statement, but I think it's the infrastructure that's required in the U.S., this administration is very bullish on infrastructure and improving roads, bridges, and so we expect that we're going to have a strong asphalt season, Q2, Q3, mainly because of the inventory that we came out of last year. So, being up 6% early in the asphalt season, I think, is a good indicator and with our flexibility of going through the cokers or making asphalt, that gives us another real strength versus some of our competition.","Spiro M. Dounis - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. Okay. And, once again, Gary, you've been pretty open before on just, I guess, providing some views around OPEC and potential decisions. Just curious, I guess, we're about a month out now on the next meeting, just your thoughts around that and what might happen around the oil price.","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Yes. Mike Palmer was \u2013 in his comments earlier, illustrated the strength and the resolve that we believe is in OPEC. As we look at OPEC, I stated early in the year that we expect to end this year in the $60 to $65 range. I still think that that is still in line with where we see the crude markets going. The resolve of OPEC, and you will continue to see that, I think, in the inventory numbers going forward, that there is a very strong resolve to get worldwide inventories in check. It certainly appears as though there would be an extension of the OPEC agreement into the second half of the year.","I believe as the oil minister Khalid al-Falih stated that he thinks that is important to continue to get global inventories in check. And with that, I think it's going to have a double-prong effect. I think it's going to bring worldwide inventories closer to balance. And secondly, it's going to be a win for the U.S. producers, because as the price continues to go north of even $50, but if we get up in the $55 to $60 range and with the efficiency and reduced cost that the U.S. producers are seeing, it's going to be a strength for the Permian, Eagle Ford, Bakken areas in their production. And I think that's going to certainly help us with our acquisition of the Ozark Pipeline. It's going to give us that ability to move barrels through Cushing into the Midwest, bring barrels down from the Bakken. And I think it should help differentials over time.","Spiro M.

On the call today are Gary Heminger, Chairman and CEO; Don Templin, President; Tim Griffith, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Mike Hennigan, President of the general partner of MPLX and other members of MPC's executive team.","We invite you to read the Safe Harbor statements on slide 2. It's a reminder that we will be making forward-looking statements during the call and during the question-and-answer session. Actual results may differ materially from what we expect today. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included there, as well as in our filings with the SEC.","Now, I will turn the call over to Gary Heminger for opening remarks.","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Thank you, Lisa, and good morning to everyone. If you please turn to slide 3. Earlier today, we reported strong financial and operational performance across the business with third quarter earnings of $903 million, illustrating the substantial earnings power of our integrated business model. An important part of our success this quarter was our employees and their dedication to operate our facilities safely and reliably throughout the quarter, and notably under the extremely challenging weather conditions during the recent hurricanes. This focus enabled us to meet the needs of our customers and the market at a critical time.","During Hurricane Harvey, our system did not experience material flooding or damage, but we did operate at a reduced rate at our Galveston Bay Refinery for a few days to enable pipelines, marine vessels and other logistics assets to resume normal operation.","After the storm passed, our team resumed normal refinery production rates rapidly and restarted critical logistics infrastructure, positioning MPC as the first to resume dock shipments to a market in need of supply for recovery efforts.","Also to help supply the markets' needs, we temporarily delayed turnaround activity at our Catlettsburg, Garyville and Robinson refineries. Shortly after Harvey, we were preparing for the landfall of Hurricane Irma. In preparation for the evacuation of Florida's residents, our logistics team focused on transporting as much fuel as possible to Speedway and Marathon brand locations along the evacuation route, utilizing our trucks, barges, as well as additional third-party assets.","We staged fuel for resupply in strategic locations and we were well-positioned to supply the Florida market as soon it was safe to operate. Within three days of the storm's passing, 98% of our approximately 240 stores \u2013 Speedway stores in Florida were operating as were all four of our live product terminals.","We were pleased to be recognized by the state and government officials for our efforts in getting supply into these critical markets. In both hurricanes, our response and recovery efforts went beyond our fence line.","MPC along with our employees donated to local municipalities and charities in both Texas and Florida to aid with storm recovery. MPC volunteers also spent countless hours helping their fellow employees and other flood victims.","To our employees, I'm grateful for your contributions to this critical work, and I'm proud of our role in manufacturing and transporting and marketing fuels and other products that millions of people use to make their lives better every day.","Turning to our strategic actions designed to further enhance shareholder value, we have been sharply focused on executing our plan. Since the beginning of the year, including the third quarter dropdown, we have contributed assets to MPLX with a combined transaction value of $3.065 billion, resulting in consideration of $1.7 billion in after-tax cash proceeds and 32 million MPLX units. In total for the year, we have returned $2.2 billion to our shareholders, including buybacks and dividends. We expect to repurchase at least $550 million of shares in the fourth quarter.","As part of the strategic actions, a full thorough review of Speedway was completed. As we reported in early September, our board was unanimous in its conclusion that the greatest long-term value for shareholders is optimized with Speedway remaining a fully integrated business within MPC. Having a strong retail business in Speedway is a valuable differentiator for MPC, and we see significant opportunities for maximizing value creation at Speedway. This will be done by continuing to deliver on past organic investment and through additional investments to grow the business.","Looking forward, our strategic plan remains on track. We have offered the remaining identified dropdown to MPLX and the offer is currently under review by the board's independent conflicts committee. This last dropdown includes refining logistics assets and fuels distribution services, which are projected to generate $1 billion in annual EBITDA. We expect this dropdown to close in the first quarter of 2018, and we expect additional return of capital to shareholders with the after-tax cash proceeds, consistent with maintaining our investment grade credit profile.","Once the terms of the dropdown are finalized, MPC will immediately initiate the offer of its GP economic interests, including its IDR rights to the partnership in exchange for newly issued LP common units. Both transactions would then close in the first quarter. The GP transaction will provide a clear valuation for MPC's GP economic interest and is intended to reduce MPLX's cost of capital for the long term. All transactions are subject to market and other conditions, as well as requisite approvals.","In summary, we remain committed to driving shareholder value through execution of our strategic actions and are confident that our value creation plan, combined with our proven operational excellence will further drive substantial long-term shareholder value.","With that, let me turn the call over to Don to cover additional highlights for the third quarter.","Donald C. Templin - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Thanks, Gary. We reported third quarter earnings of $903 million or $1.77 per diluted share, with solid operational and financial performance across the business despite the tough operating conditions Gary mentioned earlier. Our Midstream segment, which largely reflects the financial results of MPLX, reported record third quarter earnings.","The outstanding performance in the quarter and the increase over the third quarter of last year was primarily driven by record gathered, processed, and fractionated volumes. MPLX continues to build on its strong footprint in the Marcellus, Permian, and STACK shale plays. Since the beginning of this year, the partnership has increased its processing capacity in the Northeast by 7%, bringing our total capacity in this region to approximately 5.8 billion cubic feet per day. The partnership expects to add approximately 1.5 billion cubic feet per day of processing capacity in 2018, with approximately 1.2 billion in the Northeast, and approximately 300 million in the Southwest.","With visibility to strong growth opportunities through a robust portfolio of organic projects and strong distribution coverage, MPLX is well-positioned to be a source of significant long-term value for our investors. Our partnership's value proposition will be further enhanced once the exchange of MPC's GP economic interest is complete. I would encourage you to listen in on the MPLX call at 11:00 A.M. this morning to hear additional color on the performance and opportunities for the partnership.","On the retail side, Speedway continued to deliver top-tier operational and financial results in the quarter, driven by solid light product and merchandise gross margins. This was despite the challenging weather conditions Gary mentioned earlier. Speedway's new joint venture with Pilot Flying J also favorably impacted results in the quarter. Speedway's performance and its contribution to MPC is further validation of Speedway's importance to our integrated model, and its ability to generate substantial returns for our shareholders. We will continue to focus resources and capital to Speedway to drive additional value over the long term.","Turning to Refining & Marketing, we operated exceptionally well during the quarter, and we were able to capture strong crack spreads while meeting the needs of our customers and the market during the challenging weather conditions. Refinery throughputs exceeded 2 million barrels per day for the second consecutive quarter. Additionally, we set multiple refinery production records during the quarter, including record crude throughput in the month of August.","I'm also pleased to report that demand for exports continued to be strong in the third quarter. Between Galveston Bay and Garyville, our exports averaged 331,000 barrels per day, up from second quarter of this year and third quarter of 2016. Exports remain a fundamental component in our refined products distribution and we continue to invest to support additional export capacity in our system. We are encouraged by improving market fundamentals and prospects for a more balanced supply and demand environment going forward.","U.S. demand remains robust in the fourth quarter and into 2018, led by distillate demand growth and a healthy U.S. economic environment. On a days of supply including exports basis, U.S. gasoline and distillate inventories are now below their five-year averages, and should remain supportive for MPC's refining system as we look into next year.","Meanwhile, global oil inventories have declined by more than 300 million barrels in 2017, and we see further progress toward rebalancing continuing into 2018. With our fully integrated and flexible system, strategically located assets that provide excellent optionality, and a focus on operational excellence, we believe we have a sustainable long-term competitive advantage that drives real value for shareholders over the long term.","With that, let me turn the call over to Tim to walk you through the financial results for the third quarter.","Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Thanks, Don. Slide 5 provides earnings on both an absolute and per share basis. For the third quarter of 2017, MPC reported earnings of $903 million or $1.77 per diluted share compared to last year's $145 million or $0.27 per diluted share. Third quarter 2016 earnings included a $267 million impairment charge or $0.31 per diluted share related to our investment in the canceled Sandpiper Pipeline project.","The bridge on slide 6 shows the change in earnings by segment over the third quarter last year. The walk highlights the significant increase in Refining & Marketing, driven by higher LLS-based blended crack spreads and the ability to maintain high utilization rates. The benefits were partially offset by less favorable product price realizations versus the spot prices in the benchmark crack spread.","Speedway's results were comparable to last year and represented one of the best third quarters in Speedway's history, and I'll provide some additional color on that shortly. The $45 million favorable Midstream variance was primarily due to MPLX's record gathered, processed, and fractionated volumes as compared to last year. The $251 million favorable variance shown in items not allocated on the walk is due to the absence of the non-cash impairment charge I referenced earlier related to Sandpiper. Quarterly results were also impacted by $340 million of higher income taxes due to higher earnings and $27 million of allocation of higher MPLX earnings to the publicly held units in the partnership, shown here as a negative variance in non-controlling interests.","Moving to slide 7, our Refining & Marketing segment reported earnings of $1.1 billion in the third quarter, an $845 million increase compared to the same quarter last year. Looking at our key market metrics, an increase in the LLS-based blended crack spread had a $923 million favorable impact to segment results, primarily due to higher crack spreads and the ability to maintain high refinery utilization rates. The LLS-based blended crack spread was $4.61 higher at $12.69 per barrel in the third quarter.","Strong crack spreads in the quarter were slightly offset by a $73 million unfavorable RIN\/CBOB crack adjustment as a result of higher RIN prices. This increase in costs was considered in our pricing decisions and is reflected in the price paid by consumers. As a result, there's an offset in the product portion of other gross margin.","As a reminder and consistent with this treatment, we view the LLS crack and RIN\/CBOB crack adjustment together as an effective realized crack spread. We could have simply reflected an $850 million positive crack spread, but are showing them here separately, given the desire to provide visibility to both factors. Also, partially offsetting the strong crack spreads was the $207 million unfavorable product variance, as shown as a component of the other gross margin bar on the walk. This was primarily due to less favorable product price realizations versus the spot prices in the benchmark LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spread than was true in the third quarter last year.","Moving forward to the other segments, slide 8 provides the Speedway segment results walk compared to the same period last year. As Gary and Don mentioned, Speedway delivered strong earnings of $209 million and performed exceptionally well during and after Hurricane Irma to supply fuel, food and supplies to those in need.","As a reminder, comparability of Speedway's results to prior-year third quarter is also affected by the transfer of Speedway's travel centers into the newly formed joint venture with Pilot Flying J called PFJ Southeast LLC in the fourth quarter of 2016. Speedway's share of the results from operations from the joint venture is reflected as income from equity method investments and is shown in the other column of this walk, while prior quarter activity remains in light product margin, merchandise margin and other categories.","During the quarter, a decrease in light product gross margin had a $20 million unfavorable impact. While Speedway sold nearly 1.5 billion gallons during the quarter, the volumes were down from 2016. Light product gross margin was $0.177 per gallon, a solid result amidst rising crude oil prices during the quarter.","Merchandise gross margin also contributed a $12 million unfavorable impact to segment income. Light product and merchandise gross margin on favorable variances are higher than they would have been due to the absence of contributions from the travel centers in 2017, as I already mentioned. If the travel centers were still in, the net impact would be close to a push for the quarter.","The increase of $32 million shown in the other column of the walk includes Speedway's share of results from the joint venture with Pilot Flying J, as well as lower operating expenses due to the absence of operating expenses in 2017 from the contributed travel centers. So far in October, we've seen a roughly 1.3% decrease in same-store gasoline sales volumes compared to last October. As a reminder, we continuously endeavor to optimize total gasoline contributions between volume and margin as market conditions adjust. So, we generally do not focus too much on either factor in isolation.","Slide 9 provides the changes in the Midstream segment income quarter-over-quarter. The $53 million favorable variance for MPLX was primarily due to record gathered, processed, and fractionated volumes as compared to last year. MPLX results were also favorably impacted by earnings from its recently acquired Ozark Pipeline system and the first full quarter of its indirect interest in the Bakken Pipeline System. The unfavorable variance of $13 million in equity and other affiliates reflects the decline in earnings from pipeline equity investments, primarily related to favorable inventory adjustment recorded in 2016. As Don mentioned, we would encourage you to listen in on the MPLX call at 11:00 to get more color on the partnership's strong performance in the quarter.","Slide 10 presents significant elements of changes to our consolidated cash position in the third quarter. Cash at the end of the quarter was nearly $2.1 billion, an increase of approximately $600 million from the end of the second quarter. Core operating cash flow before changes to working capital was approximately $1.6 billion source of cash. Working capital was a $320 million source of cash, primarily due to an increase in crude and refined products prices and the impact of the payment terms differentials. Net debt was $156 million source of cash, which reflects MPLX's use of its revolver during the quarter.","Cash flow reflects net proceeds of $39 million from MPLX's second quarter commitments through its ATM program that settled in the third quarter. No additional common units were issued in this program in the third quarter. Looking forward, higher earnings and cash flow, combined with a disciplined approach to capital investments, have increased the partnership's capacity to fund organic growth with debt and retained cash and it substantially reduced the need to access the public markets.","Return of capital to shareholders via share repurchase and dividends was $654 million in the quarter. As Gary referenced, after-tax cash proceeds from this year's dropdowns have been substantially returned via share repurchase activity, including the $452 million of share repurchases in the quarter, and the over $1.6 billion since the beginning of the year. In the fourth quarter, we expect share repurchases of at least $550 million. Looking forward, we expect cash proceeds from the remaining dropdown to fund substantial return of capital to shareholders, all conducted with a continued focus on maintaining an investment grade credit profile at both MPC and MPLX.","Slide 11 provides an overview of our capitalization and financial profile at the end of the quarter. We had nearly $12.8 billion of total consolidated debt, including approximately $6.8 billion of debt owed by MPLX. Total consolidated debt represented 2.4 times last 12 months adjusted EBITDA on a consolidated basis, or about 1.6 times excluding MPLX. We continue to show debt-to-EBITDA excluding MPLX as we think it is more useful to show the independent capital structures given the effect of the relatively higher leverage of the growing partnership on MPC's consolidated metrics and our approach to managing capitalization separately.","Going forward, we'll also provide debt-to-last 12's EBITDA adjusted excluding MPLX with credit for MPLX, MPLX's distribution to MPC, which we think are an appropriate component of MPC's debt service capabilities. For the third quarter, the ratio on this basis was 1.4 times, although the difference between that ratio without the LP credit is going to grow as the drops are completed. The dropdowns are effectively converting EBITDA into MPLX LP distributions. Given our control as the general partner, we believe these distributions are highly probable with very low risk of interruption. Over time, MPLX distribution to MPC will provide substantial and fundamental funding to MPC and an important component of MPC's discretionary free cash flow.","Slide 12 provides updated outlook information on key operating metrics for MPC for the fourth quarter of 2017. We are expecting throughput volumes of 1.925 million barrels per day with planned maintenance in the Midwest.","Total direct operating costs are expected to be $7.35 per barrel. We also expect to see an advantage to process lighter crudes in the fourth quarter driven by narrower sweet\/sour differentials. Sour crude is estimated to make up 54% of our crude oil throughput for the quarter. The estimated percentage of WTI-priced crude is 26%. Projected fourth quarter corporate and other unallocated items is estimated at $80 million.","With that, let me turn the call back over to Lisa. Lisa?","Lisa Wilson - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Thanks, Tim. As we open the call for your questions, as a courtesy to all participants, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and a follow-up. If time permits, we will re-prompt for additional questions. With that, we will now open the call to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question today is from Phil Gresh from JPMorgan.","Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, good morning.","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Good morning.","Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","First question is just on capital allocation. We've actually seen some additional C-store assets coming to market recently of decent size, I'm wondering is M&A something you would consider at this point, particularly on the retail side? And operationally, with where you're at, with the Hess integration and things like that, is this something that you'd think about?","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Yes, Phil. This is Gary. We of course think about it and we will do our homework on such opportunities. We've looked at some in the past until we've completed our thorough review of Speedway, we really were not going to act on anything, but it \u2013 retail, Midstream continues to be a very strong focus in our path going forward.","Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","So if you were to look at something of a decent size, would that in any way influence your use of proceeds from the dropdowns, or, Tim, with the balance sheet, as you were describing, I mean, it does feel like there's room to be able to do both? Just curious how you think about that?","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Well, first of all, we've always said, we will always maintain an investment grade credit profile. And then, it just depends on if something makes sense, how big it is \u2013 we illustrated that we certainly have the competency to be able to leapfrog markets like we did when we bought Hess when we went to the East Coast and we've been able to integrate the Hess assets very, very well into our system and exceed the synergies that we have planned. So, it just depends, Phil, on what the size would be. But I don't expect that we will deviate from buying back shares that we've discussed in the past.","Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. Okay. And Gary, if I could just ask one last one, the Capline reversal, I was a bit surprised that the timing that it would take five years and that the capacity would only be 25% of the current northbound capacity, could you talk about that?","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Well, as you know, we have three owners in the system. And this was a \u2013 we're very pleased that we were able to get this open season out into the market, we're receiving very, very strong inbounds on consideration for this pipeline. From an engineering and construction to reverse this pipeline, you are correct, it will not take five years, it's more from a commercial standpoint that the three owners are looking at this. And timing from, as I say, from a commercial side that we've put the open season out in the manner in which we did.","Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Chi Chow from Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Company.","Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Great, thanks. Good morning. I guess couple of more questions on Capline. Maybe it's obvious, but does floating the open season suggest that all three owners are in agreement at this point on repurposing the line? And could you just talk about the strategic rationale for the reversal from MPC standpoint? Are you focused primarily on incremental growth for Midstream or is this developing crude optionality for Garyville?","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Well, Chi, it's both. As you know, this pipeline flowing south to north has the capability depending on the crude slate of running 1 million to 1.2 million barrels per day. Has not \u2013 recently been running anywhere near that level. But if you look at the Eastern Gulf, so everywhere from Baton Rouge refineries through Garyville, I think over to Mississippi, there is a strong desire to have a steady source of heavy crude. And so, the Eastern Gulf does not have that steady source coming down today. So, from a commercial standpoint, it's very important to MPC.","Secondly, it provides a good Midstream source as well and that, as you know, Capline is not yet a part of our MLP, and that's just because the commerciality of that pipeline as it sits today is certainly \u2013 is not at a level \u2013 at the value level that it should be. So, as this is reversed down the road, we think that, that pipeline is going to be much more valuable, and then it will be an asset that will be considered for MPLX.","Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Okay. To get incremental heavy Canadian barrel to Patoka, would you, MPC, consider locking up line space all the way down from Alberta on one of the trunk lines coming down either Enbridge or maybe KXL...?","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Yeah, let me ask Mike Palmer to handle that, Chi.","Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Okay.","C. Michael Palmer - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Yeah, Chi. We don't think that there is going to be any sort of a problem in supplying a reverse Capline. Enbridge has numerous projects, for example, that will get completed in the not too distant future and we think that, that will certainly allow for supply into Capline. And not only that, I mean, the Keystone base system can be used in order to supply heavy Canadian into reverse Capline as well. So, we \u2013 again, we think there's plenty of opportunities to move the heavy Canadian down Capline.","Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, Mike. And maybe one final question here, does the Capline reversal tie into the potential of converting LOOP for exports, and what would be the targeted export capacity at LOOP that you've talked about in the past?","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Chi, I was just waiting for Mike to finish, and I was going to add in that you've got to think about Capline going beyond just St. James, that it eventually could go all the way back out to LOOP and it could reverse VLCCs out of loop. That study is underway. Today, we have a capacity of around 800,000 barrels a day of unloading capacity, but that's off of \u2013 we have three buoys, and I think we're going to unload two ships simultaneously. But we're \u2013 we do not have that study complete yet on \u2013 and presumably, it would be heavy crude that we would be looking at exporting. So when we get that study complete, Chi, we'll be able to share with you \u2013 we just don't have all of the engineering done.","Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Okay.","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","But certainly would be the long-term plan, which it would be very positive for the Canadian producers, it'd be very positive for the midstream players, and also for all of the Eastern Gulf refiners to be able to have that crude source, and then some to even be able to export if they wished.","Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Yeah. It's an interesting development. Great. Thanks, Gary. I appreciate it.","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Cheng from Barclays.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Good morning, Paul.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","That is a very impressive result on the Refining. So, congratulation on that.","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Thank you.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Just to \u2013 on the \u2013 with the IMO 2020, do you plan to make any large refining CapEx related to that? I think at one point several years ago you were contemplating about resid hydrocrack, and then of course that being shared (31:09), just curious there, should we look at any large capital outlay?","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Ray?","Raymond L. Brooks - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Yeah, this is Ray Brooks. I'll take that question. As far as IMO, yes, we are looking at strategic opportunities for resid upgrading primarily at our Gulf Coast refineries where we've got the STAR project that we've talked about before. The big part of that is upgrading our resid, we've done some of that. We have some more planned with our resid hydrocracker expansion there. And then at Garyville, you ask about the resid hydrocracker there, we have no plans to pursue that, but we're looking at some opportunistic and quick-hit projects to expand our coking capacity at Garyville. So, yeah, the IMO is on the horizon for us and we think we've got a couple of good-looking opportunities.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. The second one, just curious that in the first quarter when you got the (32:17) $1 billion EBITDA to the MPLX, $600 million is the wholesale-related margin. I presume that's coming out from the Refining segment. Is that coming now from the margin side or it's going to be under (32:34) on the other costs? And also that the remaining $400 million, is that already in the Transportation segment or it's also coming now from the Refining?","Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Yeah, Paul, this is Tim. I mean, both are effectively in the R&M segment currently. Let's talk about each of them individually. The refining logistics asset is really going to be structured as a sort of a fee-for-capacity arrangement within refining. So that's going to be sort of a charge that will flow back to for Refining. So that's a straight charge out of the R&M segment that will show up in MPLX once the drops complete.","For the fuels distribution, similarly this is a service contract, a giant service contract that will exist between the parties and elements of it will be in margin, elements will be below the line (33:23) in terms of how it gets reflected, actually I think most of it will actually show up below the line in terms of where it shows up. So, it'll be out of margin, but part of the movement between the segments of R&M and into MPLX.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","So, I get that from a simple modeling standpoint, we should not assume the margin capture being changed that much, but that your segment where (33:47) you sell from refining would drop, but not necessarily in the margin?","Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","And that's right. It should not have an impact on gross margin, but it will have an impact on the segment.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thanks.","Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","And I think \u2013 Paul, I had mentioned even on the last call that heading into these drops, we'll try to provide some framework about how that will look pro forma for the transactions to sort of help guide your thinking around how best to model it.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Brad Heffern from RBC Capital Markets.","Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Good morning, all. I'll start with another macro question. Just thinking about Brent, WTI at this point, it looks like at least in the Midwest you guys are planning to run a lot more WTI in the fourth quarter. Any thoughts around sort of the sustainability of these $5, $6 spreads going forward and maybe are we at the limit of what you guys can run in terms of WTI in the system?","C. Michael Palmer - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Yeah, Brad, this is Mike Palmer. With the Brent and WTI spread now in this $5.50 to kind of $6 area, certainly that has encouraged a lot of U.S. exports to take place, as I'm sure you know. We expect that we'll continue to see a positive Brent TI spread going forward. But with all the exports taking place, I guess I would believe that we'll start to see that spread come in over the next months.","When the spread is wide like it is, what we want to do is, we want to be in a position where we can take in as much of the WTI-based crude as we possibly can, and that's what we do in our optimization process. So, we're trying to capitalize on all of the WTI-priced crude that we possibly can in the system today. And as we move forward in the future and we get our Ozark expansion completed, that'll open up a considerable amount of additional optionality that we don't have today.","Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay, great. Thanks for that color. And then maybe for Tim. Just on CapEx, you guys haven't revised the budget at this point, but I think it implies like a $1.6 billion spend in the fourth quarter. Is there any reason to think that you guys are actually going to spend that or is there some sort of big expense that's included in that budget that is in the fourth quarter?","Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Well, we're probably a little bit behind what we expected by the end of the third quarter, but we suspect that there will be some catch-up that will occur in the fourth quarter. So again, we're not going to re-guide the capital, but I think you should expect to see some catch-ups that will occur into the end of the year here.","Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Faisel Khan from Citigroup.","Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi. Thank you. Good morning. Just a follow-up on the IMO regulations. So when all this sort of high-sulfur fuel oil ends up back in the market and as companies marine buyer (36:53) substitute out that fuel, I mean, where is the stuff going to end up? Can it end up as a feed into your plants as a coker feed, or how do you guys look at that as I guess a feedstock or a product that's trying to get a big discount in the market?","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Ray?","Raymond L. Brooks - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Yeah. This is Ray. I'll take a first stab at that. Our goal every day is to fill up our resid processing capabilities. And we can do that via couple of different ways, having up the crude slate to take advantage of that, or looking at shrinking our lower-valued sales. What I will say is, even ahead of IMO, we've taken a lot of steps to reduce our residual fuel sales by increasing our process \u2013 existing processing today through our cokers and resid the asphalting units.","Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay.","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Mike, do you want to add anything on that or...?","C. Michael Palmer - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","No. The only other thing I guess that I would add is that, again, we're -we're well set up to look at various opportunities in the world for any resid that's surplus to our system. So, as part of our continuing optimization process, that's exactly what we'll do.","Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. So my follow-up question is on exports for gasoline and distillate. Were those numbers lower just simply because of the hurricane impact and the need to sort of keep more barrels at home versus export those volumes?","Raymond L. Brooks - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Faisel, the 331,000 barrels a day is one of the highest rates that we've ever had. So we are finding the export market to be very attractive and we are moving product to the export market when that is the better alternative than placing it in the domestic market. But we are \u2013 we believe the export market is attractive, we believe we're well situated given our Gulf Coast refineries. And as you well know, we're continuing to invest in upgrading or enhancing the capacity of our exports. And by 2020, we should be able to have a capacity of over 500,000 barrels a day from those two refineries, Galveston Bay and Garyville.","Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay.","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Faisel, if you really look at the macro view here, I want to make sure investors understand this. If you look at gasoline and distillate days of supply, we're at the low end for both products on a five-year average \u2013 the low-end of that five-year average on a days supply. I think that's going to continue to provide momentum for light product exports. It's going to continue to provide balance for domestic inventories. And I think we're really teed up versus \u2013 I'll take you back to the same period in 2016 and same period in 2015, when we were mid-fourth quarter with very high inventories coming into the lower demand part of the season, and that was a drag on margins. Here, days of supply are really strong across \u2013 it should be really strong for inventory across both gasoline and distillate, and I think should continue to show strength finishing up the fourth quarter.","Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. Thanks, Gary. Appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Corey Goldman from Jefferies.","Corey Goldman - Jefferies LLC","Hey, guys. Just a quick question on the MidCon fleet during the quarter. Obviously, DAPL, it's still ramping; can you just tell us how that impacted if at all the MidCon refineries in 3Q?","C. Michael Palmer - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Yeah, Corey, it's Mike Palmer here. DAPL became operational in June. And obviously what that does for us is it does give us the conduit into Patoka for the North Dakota Light crude. And over the third quarter, I can tell you that we've been ramping up the volumes of North Dakota Light as it has been attractive relative to the alternatives. So it's \u2013 again, it gave us the optionality we needed to take advantage of a well-priced feedstock.","Corey Goldman - Jefferies LLC","Got you. And when \u2013 sorry \u2013 would you expect that ramping to be more I guess ratable? Is that a 4Q event or a 2018 event?","C. Michael Palmer - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Well, it's \u2013 the pipeline itself is fully operational. So shippers can ship into Patoka or they can ship down to the Gulf Coast, either one. The amount of North Dakota Light that we'll want to bring into our system ourselves will depend upon how it's being priced. So that volume will come up and down depending upon the marketplace and how we optimize.","Corey Goldman - Jefferies LLC","Understood. Okay. And maybe just as a follow-up question, given that it's so difficult to track these things with different contract rolls, is there anything that you can talk about from a third-party contract perspective that perhaps could be rolling sometime in 2018 or late 2017 that could find its way toward the MPLX bucket that maybe can put some earnings upside? Just \u2013 we don't see a lot of that information in the marketplace, I don't know if there's anything there that you can provide for us.","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","And, Corey, I just want to make sure I understand that, when you say contracts that are rolling, are you meaning contracts to provide further throughput and pipelines or can you be more definitive on your question?","Corey Goldman - Jefferies LLC","Sorry. Just to the extent you had third-party contracts with other midstream or downstream service providers, is there anything that is expiring in the near term that could perhaps be funneled towards the MPLX bucket?","Donald C. Templin - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","I guess \u2013 this is Don, Corey. I mean, what we're always doing is, we're looking for opportunities to \u2013 if there is a \u2013 if we're using a third party to supply MPC and we have an opportunity to supply or move it ourselves, we're always looking to those opportunities. So I think we've historically been looking at that and certainly Mike Hennigan and his team have been very focused on understanding what are the opportunities to source more of the movements from third parties to MPC-owned \u2013 or MPLX-owned logistics.","Corey Goldman - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thanks, guys.","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Yeah.","Operator","And your next question is from Paul Sankey from Wolfe Research.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Good morning, all. [Technical Difficulty] (43:39-43:49)","Operator","I apologize. We are having technical difficulties with that line. We'll move on to the next one. Our next caller is Doug Leggate from Bank of America.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America \u2013 Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good morning.","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Hi, Doug.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America \u2013 Merrill Lynch","Sorry, I was clearing my throat. Good morning. How is everybody doing? Gary, the comment in the release about the after-tax proceeds from the drop, can you give us an idea of what you think the cost basis of the drop next year would be assuming the $1 billion gets done?","Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Doug, it's Tim. We had said even on the announcements in January that using a roughly \u2013 sort of 20% tax rate on the drops was probably appropriate. I'm not sure we guide any differently at this point. So you can think about it in those terms, somewhere between there and sort of statutory. So that's probably the range.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America \u2013 Merrill Lynch","Okay. And maybe just related to that, can you offer some color on the pace of how you would redeploy that cash in terms of buybacks? I guess it wouldn't all be instantaneous, so how would you expect the buybacks to be ratable over next period?","Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Well, we'll manage it in a way that we think optimizes our ability to access to market without influencing the price. Again, we'll \u2013 this is certainly going to be a big slug of proceeds all at once, so I think we'll evaluate more accelerated forms to see if those make sense. We've been very successful in open market repurchases and really delivering at or below daily view apps (45:16), so we'll take a look at what makes the more sense at the time.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America \u2013 Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks. My last one, guys, is I guess a little more convoluted because it relates to some of the GP drops that have been done by some of your peers. I think in the past you've talked about a kind of target range multiple perhaps something in the 15 \u2013 20 range, the recent drops or the recent conversions have been done a little bit lower than that. I'm just wondering if you could offer a perspective on that.","And related, and Gary, I know, we've talked about this in the past, but it does give a lot of transparency to your ownership of MPLX going forward. But obviously, as you take distributions, your tax basis there would essentially ultimately go to zero over time. So how should we think about the after-tax value at the MPC level for what is a tax-free entity and as it relates to the public market quote? And I'll leave it there. Thanks.","Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Sure, Doug. It's Tim. Let me try to take both of those. Your first question with regard to maybe precedent transactions or other GP transactions we see in the marketplace, for one thing, our 15 to 20 that we provided in January was really illustrative. And frankly, that's not where we started on multiples. We really looked at what would be the appropriate premium of cash flow pro forma for the transactions vis-\u00e0-vis what the GP cash flow would have looked like otherwise. We turned it into a multiple because we know everyone loves to talk about multiples, but the \u2013 I guess the thing that is worth pointing out is that the situation that both of the recent transactions that have been done, the situation of the GP and the situation that MPLX's GP finds itself are very different.","And so, it's I think very difficult to compare two transactions and say those multiples should be about the same because it's really not an apples-to-apples comparison. You really have to assess what the cash flow growth profile of those GP distributions will look like on their own sort of at the point the transaction's conducted.","So, again, we're not going to re-guide to ranges or what the value is, I mean that's a process that's in front of us. We'll have all the appropriate dialog with the conflicts committee and the MPLX board. As we've stressed on multiple occasions and maybe worth repeating again this morning, pro forma for these transactions, MPC will be a substantial holder of LP units. And really striking a balance on the GP buy-in to make sure that it both illuminates value of the GP and provides an affordable and sensible transaction for the partnership becomes very important, because any action that MPC takes that harms the partnership hurts no one more than MPC. So, I think we \u2013 again, we'll be very careful about striking an appropriate balance on the transaction. And again, we'll share our color on valuation at the appropriate time. I don't think we want to get in front of a process just now.","Your second question if I understood, it was really \u2013 relates to the tax basis and the distribution that come back. There is certainly a tax advantage of LP distributions versus GP distributions which are fully taxable from an MPC perspective. So MPC although it will not be afforded the full benefit of the return of capital that LP holders will, is going to get a tax benefit on LP distributions vis-\u00e0-vis what would have been available otherwise. So again, I think as we get closer, we're certainly happy to share some more color around it. We certainly understand the desire and interest in understanding exactly how much of those distributions will be taxable and we'll share some color with you once we get through that transaction and are in a position to give you that guidance.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America \u2013 Merrill Lynch","And that would be really helpful. Thanks, Tim. I appreciate your time. Thanks, guys.","Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Sankey from Wolfe Research.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi guys, can you hear me?","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Hey, Paul, that's much better.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Good, good. I just want to assure you that I was not listening, I didn't bunk off to listen to the Suncor call; I was hanging on your every word.","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","I thought you were in Australia sipping something good and...","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","You figured I was in Australia sipping something good, well, I don't know about that. I'm in midtown and I'm drinking coffee. Gary, to look back just to go over the not spinning Speedway. It was interesting that you guys gave a \u2013 I think it was a synergy number, but there was a sort of a benefit number associated with retaining Speedway. Long term, I think you've absolutely made the right decision to do what I think other companies are doing in terms of retaining control of gasoline distribution. Could you just talk a little bit more about that number that you gave, how the committee came up with that, and what goes into it? That was question one.","Question two is a bit of a follow-up to Doug's, but I was wondering if you could \u2013 you're relatively very quickly going to get through this dropdown process, where do you see MPC going strategically from that point? One thing that you could talk a little bit about maybe is 2018 CapEx, but also where you see the long-term strategy development from this newly-shaped company? Thank you.","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Right, Paul. And if you go back to Speedway, and you're right, we did publish a number of $270 million to $390 million per year, and then \u2013 that range is what we see as the integration value.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Right.","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","And we continue to illustrate it very, very well here. Again, in this quarter, Speedway had one of the best quarters \u2013 I think top three quarters that they've ever had. But, that makes up all the ratable movement that we go through our refining system in the Speedway, the value in certain markets that we can glean out of Speedway. So all-in-all, as we look at Speedway again as borne out in this quarter, very, very strong segment for us, and we continue to see that going forward.","Asking as we complete this drop, where do we see things going? And I I've answered this a little bit earlier that retail and growth in our Midstream is going to continue to be front and center in our strategy. We think our base refining system is in very, very good shape, and as Ray mentioned, I think we're in very good shape to be able to handle the IMO and be a strong margin taker when this IMO comes to play. But we look at the organic side of MPLX as being a strong growth element, as well as we look at Speedway as being a strong growth element for our business.","And if you look at MPLX historically, and now that we're coming to the end of the dropdowns, we have a very strong inventory of organic projects, but we're really \u2013 I've charged Mike with really increasing our third party business. And for MPLX not to be dependent on just the business coming from MPC, but other third party business. You look at the linkage that we have between Refining and Midstream and through MPLX, it's great linkage.","I look at the assets that are now part of MPLX that were MarkWest and the linkage that we have there, we have great opportunities to be able to move the Northeast NGLs I think to the East Coast eventually. We have opportunities we believe when Buckeye reverses the Laurel Pipeline to be able to make some movements that will lower cost to consumers in the Pennsylvania and Eastern markets. That movement is all about lowering cost to consumers, which I think can be supplied from PAD 2. So, we have many opportunities that we're looking at with a very, very strong refining base underlying all of those opportunities.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Right. So I mean, I think in the past you've been skeptical about the attraction of East Coast and West Coast refining. So it sounds like the refining base is going to be around where it is today give or take, and the growth is going to be as logistics play through the MLP?","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Well, Paul, I believe two things \u2013 really three things there, if you look at three segments. There's definitely going to be further consolidation in refining, there's going to be further consolidation in midstream and we're seeing the consolidation happening in retail. So, there are going to be opportunities across. I'm not discounting that there may not be some opportunity in refining some day. Being upfront here that I don't see anything immediately on the horizon from a consolidation standpoint in refining. But certainly there's a lot of movement going on in midstream and in retail right now.","And I think we have the ability, we've been able to show certainly that big acquisitions \u2013 we can execute on acquisitions and we can execute on delivering synergy. So \u2013 well, everything has to be at the right price that will be value generating to MPC.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Understood. Thank you, Gary. I'll let someone else have a go. Thank you.","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Thanks, Paul.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Spiro Dounis from UBS Securities.","Spiro M. Dounis - UBS Securities LLC","Hey. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to tag on to one of Brad's questions from earlier on differentials. How should we think about the WCS discount widening out from here with I guess Canadian production ramping up later this year? And just more broadly how you're thinking about heavy differentials in 2018 with potential for OPEC maybe ease up on the production cut?","C. Michael Palmer - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Yeah, Spiro. Mike Palmer.","Spiro M. Dounis - UBS Securities LLC","Hi, Mike.","C. Michael Palmer - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Yeah. We're obviously watching the same thing and I think you've probably seen that \u2013 well, certainly during 2017, the heavy Canadian differentials have been fairly narrow and there's been \u2013 there still has been a lot of demand in the Gulf Coast for those barrels that's helping to drive that differential in. But with the increase in production that's coming on late this year and into next year, we've already seen those differentials that have started to widen. And again, MPC is in tremendous shape in order to take advantage of that additional supply, both in our Midwest system as well as on the Gulf Coast. So we do expect to see better heavy crude diffs in 2018 than we did in 2017.","From the \u2013 when you start looking at the medium sours, generally the OPEC crudes, it's fairly clear that the Saudis and OPEC are working hard to bring the global petroleum back into balance. That's happening, inventories are coming down. We would expect to see continued pressure on the sour diffs until we get to the point where OPEC starts to put more crude into the market. And as that is the case, then we'll optimize, as we talked about earlier, with sweeter crudes. But the opportunity in 2018 right now \u2013 early on certainly looks to be with heavier crudes.","Spiro M. Dounis - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks, Mike. And then just follow up once again, sort of as you're approaching the end of this accelerated dropdown strategy and IDR exchange, just wondering if you could remind us again how you view at the general partner level \u2013 is there any \u2013 are there any options on the table to monetizing \u2013 I guess it will be a considerable ownership in MPLX? I think at one point, there was discussion of a potential GP spin-out. Is that something that's still on the table or are you kind of view that as off the table right now?","Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Yeah, it's Tim. I'm happy to answer that. I mean, I think, as we've talked even in the fall of last year, we were really evaluating all of the paths we could take with the GP. And I think where we landed was that ultimately buying of the GP's economic interest by the partnership in exchange for units was the best path for the partnership. So I'd say \u2013 I guess we always keep an open mind. I think it's highly unlikely we're going to proceed down a different path with regard to that value realization. We think ultimately the exchange for units is the best path there in terms of sort of retaining it.","Now, your second piece of that I think was around liquidation of the units, and I'll tell you that ultimately these units coming back \u2013 again, we are effectively taking a pretty big slug of refining earnings and converting it into LP distributions. And those are fundamental to the system. I mean, those LP distributions-backed MPC will be a very big piece of MPC's discretionary free cash flow. And I don't think we have any intention at any point to liquidate these units. They are a fundamental part of the cash flow of the enterprise. And we would expect to hang on to these units for as long as we can imagine.","Spiro M. Dounis - UBS Securities LLC","Understood. Appreciate the color. Thanks, Tim.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Justin Jenkins from Raymond James.","Justin S. Jenkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. Just one from me today, and I think it piggybacks on your recent comment for MPLX, Gary. I guess with the, let's call it, carnage in the broader midstream space lately, if larger scale M&A opportunities emerge, would MPC be willing to consider waiving the IDRs ahead of the buying, if that were the case?","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","I'm not sure I heard the last part of your question correctly. Waiving the IDRs...","Justin S. Jenkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Sorry. If there was an MPLX acquisition opportunity and it was large enough that equity were to be involved, would MPC be willing to waive the IDRs that could be associated with that transaction, not saying that one is out there, but just opportunistically.","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Okay. I'm sorry, I just didn't hear it properly. That will be a case-by-case basis and we'll review that when the case comes. A very important point that \u2013 I'm glad you asked that question \u2013 that we really need to emphasize here. Where we set an MPLX and I use the word carnage in the midstream, we do not believe that \u2013 and in fact our numbers will illustrate that we are in a completely different position. We have outstanding coverage and we have outstanding growth targets and opportunities in front of us. So, we are in a very good shape and a strong balance sheet investment grade. So, we are in very good shape. We continue to have strong coverage and to have very strong growth as we go into the future. So if there are some opportunities, certainly we're going to take a look at those and see what fits best for our system and fits best for the growth of our unitholders and to continue to build that inventory that certainly supports the coverage in the MLPs.","Justin S. Jenkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Perfect. Agree with you 100%, Gary. Thanks for the response.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question today is from Ryan Todd from Deutsche Bank.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great, thanks. Maybe just a couple of quick ones. On DAPL, can you remind us on expectations for distributions from the JV and maybe perhaps provide some color around recent Bakken differentials and your thoughts on go-forward sustainability?","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","So, Ryan, this is Don. We have not given information on the distributions from DAPL, but I can say that to-date it is performing at least as well as the economic expectations that we had when we sanctioned the project and took it to the board. We're very pleased with the results so far.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. And Bakken diffs, any thoughts on how those sustain going forward?","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Bakken diffs, Bakken differentials.","Donald C. Templin - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Yeah. The Bakken diffs are something they trade every day at Clearbrook. And you can probably \u2013 you can probably find that somewhere in the trade press, Ryan. We continue to buy at Clearbrook, we're buying those at Patoka. I don't think you'll generally find those diffs at Patoka, and I'm not going to share those with you today, but they move around.","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","And, Ryan, maybe the important point to be made is that the system that we operate has got so much flexibility and optionality that as \u2013 if those differentials open up, we'll run more and have got lots of options with regard to our crude system. So that's \u2013 I mean, I think that's probably the point where you want to focus is that we've got the flexibility and optionality every day to sort of identify those best sources of crude for our system, and we'll take action appropriately.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. And maybe just a quick \u2013 a follow-up. You mentioned that you're trending 1.3% down year-on-year same-store sales in October on gasoline. I know domestic gas demand has been a bit of a conversation all year, but as we reach towards the end of 2017 here, can you give us some thoughts on what you think you're seeing on U.S. gasoline demand and maybe expectations as you look into 2018?","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","You know, Ryan, it's very hard to take gasoline demand off of one month \u2013 yeah, we are trending down 1.3% for the month of October, but you have to take into context where crude prices have gone. And being a leader in most of the markets in which we have \u2013 which Speedway operates, we are the leader trying to get the incremental cost to the street. And when that happens, it costs some volume, but then we generally pick that volume up. I would say if you look at the same period last year, yes we're down a little bit, but last year was a very strong year, and we're continuing to hold on to most of that volume increase that came out of 2016 and through 2017.","There's certainly some noise in the third quarter Speedway numbers because of all the storms. And one of the biggest things is people fill up when they have storms come, and they fill up and top all their tanks off with extra storage, wherever they can put it at their homes. And then you have a law to make up for that. So you're going to see some choppiness and noise over a period of time. So here in October's numbers, I would kind of take those with a grain of salt, just because there's been so much choppiness in the weather patterns in the country. But I think looking into next year, I think on gasoline demand, I think it's going to be probably flat with 2017, maybe slightly up depending \u2013 it's all going to be on where is the ultimate crude price going to be and what that takes the gasoline price to. But I think we would expect to see gasoline up just a little bit next year versus 2017.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks. Very helpful, Gary.","Lisa Wilson - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Okay. Thank you for joining us today.

As part of these turnarounds, we commissioned the light crude upgrade project at our Robinson, Illinois, refinery to increase light crude processing and overall crude capacity. This upgrade will improve the refinery's flexibility to optimize its crude slate and product yields in a variety of market conditions.","We also implemented additional process improvements and synergy projects at our Galveston Bay refinery in Texas City in an ongoing initiative to enhance margins at that complex. Even with the challenging market conditions in the first two months of the year, we remain encouraged by the strengthening of frac spreads late in the quarter, as gasoline inventories declined and refiners responded to market conditions.","In addition, we're also encouraged by the supply and price competitiveness of sour crude oil as we enter into the summer asphalt season. Heavy Canadian crude oil is still growing, and it's attractive for both our Midwest and U.S. Gulf Coast refineries. Medium sour crude also looks very promising. U.S. Gulf of Mexico sour production is growing, and we are seeing more foreign sour cargo opportunities than we have for some time, as OPEC competes for market share.","MPC can capitalize on these opportunities, since we can process even the very heavy high-asset and high-sulfur crude oil at both our Galveston Bay and Garyville refineries. We are also well- positioned to take advantage of the expected strength in gasoline demand, given our high gasoline yield and pure leading alkylation and reforming capacity.","We reported strong financial results from our Speedway and Midstream segments, which underscored the value of our ongoing strategic objective to grow the more stable cash flow segments of our business. Speedway continued its exceptional performance in the first quarter. In addition to higher light product sales volume, Speedway's merchandise margin increased in the quarter, reflecting progress toward our goal to generate two-thirds of our profitability from merchandise sales. This approximates the earnings contributions of merchandise sales prior to the acquisition of East Coast and Southeast locations at the end of September of 2014.","We are focusing on the significant marketing enhancement opportunities at our recently converted retail locations, further optimizing the value of these assets and building out the earnings power of the entire Speedway business. We are also pleased with our Midstream segment, including MPLX's financial and operational results this quarter. MPLX completed several key operational projects this quarter, while generating strong, distributable cash flow for the partnership. Despite the challenging environment from midstream MLPs, we remain enthusiastic about the quality of the partnership's gathering and processing assets and the diversified customer base they support, particularly at the prolific Marcellus and Utica Shale regions. We believe the partnership is very well positioned to take advantage of the continued volume growth as NGL prices improve.","Over one-third of the total U.S. gas rigs currently in service are in the rich and dry gas areas where MPLX operates and enjoys acreage dedications. Over the last year, the partnership commissioned almost 1.5 billion cubic feet per day of processing capacity to support its customers' growth plans. This year, MPLX anticipates its processing facilities in the Marcellus and Utica to average approximately 80% utilization, as it expects its overall processed gas volumes from this region to increase by approximately 15%, a notable increase in light of the current commodity environment.","At the end of the quarter, we completed the contribution of our Inland Marine business to MPLX at a supportive valuation in exchange for additional MPLX equity. Our near-term support of the partnership in this challenging environment for MLPs is intended to contribute to the long-term value MPLX creates for our shareholders through our limited partner and general partner distributions, dropdown proceeds and the overall value of our equity interest in MPLX.","We continue to believe the addition of the MarkWest business will be a powerful value driver for MPC and its shareholders over the long term. We will continue our disciplined investment strategy across all segments of the business, balancing value-enhancing investments with returning capital to shareholders over the long term. We also remain committed to strong liquidity and an investment-grade credit profile through all cycles.","In the first quarter, we returned $244 million of capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and announced a significant reduction of nearly 30% of our 2016 capital expenditure plan. MPLX announced yesterday its $1 billion private placement of convertible preferred securities with third-party investors. The partnership elected to take advantage of very strong investor interest in convertible preferred securities by privately placing $1 billion with a select group of investors. Originally contemplated as a transaction with MPC, the private placement provides an attractive funding source for the partnership, while preserving MPC's capital and financial flexibility.","The combination of some opportunistic ATM issuances in the first quarter, combined with this private placement, provides for the partnership's anticipated funding needs for the remainder of 2016 and into 2017, therefore enabling MPLX to continue its execution of attractive organic growth projects that will contribute to distributable cash flow and long-term value for the partnership. The transaction is expected to close in early May.","MPC is well-positioned to benefit as market conditions improve. In addition to our financial strength, we have a sustained competitive advantage from our refining system, premier retail assets and an enhanced logistics and storage network, with the addition of the MarkWest assets to MPLX. We remain bullish about the prospects for the enterprise as we go forward this year and beyond.","And with that, let me turn the call over to Tim, who will walk through the financial results for the quarter.","Timothy T. Griffith - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Gary. Slide four provides earnings on both an absolute and per share basis. MPC had $1 million of earnings for the first quarter of 2016 compared to $891 million in the first quarter of last year. As Gary mentioned, first quarter earnings included charges of $0.06 per diluted share to impair a portion of the goodwill recorded in connection with the acquisition of MarkWest, as well as the lower cost or market inventory charge. The impact of the goodwill impairment charge on diluted earnings per share only includes the impact of our then 21% equity interest in MPLX.","The chart on slide five shows by segment the changes in earnings from the first quarter last year. The primary drivers for the change were the $1.4 billion decrease in refining and marketing income and the $129 million goodwill impairment charge, partially offset by lower income taxes and higher income from our Midstream segment, which reflects the first full quarter of results from the combination of MPLX and MarkWest.","Turning to slide six, our Refining and Marketing segment reported a $62 million loss in the first quarter of 2016, compared with income of operations of $1.3 billion in the same quarter last year. The decrease was primarily due to weaker crack spreads in both Chicago and Gulf Coast, higher cost related to the turnaround activity at Robinson and Galveston Bay, and a narrower LLS-WTI differential. In addition, we had less favorable crude oil and feedstock acquisition costs relative to our market indicators, resulting from narrow crude differentials, which is included in the $199 million of other gross margin negative impact highlighted on the slide.","The lower blended crack spread had a negative impact on earnings of approximately $869 million. The blended crack spread was over $5 per barrel lower at $4.62 per barrel in the first quarter of 2016 compared to $9.69 per barrel for the same period last year. The LLS-WTI differential narrowed $2.57 per barrel from $4.23 per barrel in the first quarter of 2015 to $1.66 per barrel in the first quarter of 2016. This had an approximate $81 million negative impact on earnings based on the WTI-linked crudes in our slate.","The $231 million year-over-year increase in direct operating costs related primarily to higher turnaround activity during the first quarter. Turnaround and major maintenance costs increased $1.64 per barrel or about $260 million compared to the first quarter of 2015. The higher turnaround activity also impacted throughputs, which were 78,000 barrels per day lower than the first quarter last year. Partially offsetting these negative impacts was favorable market structure during the quarter. This contango effect is reflected in the $117 million favorable difference on the walks and relates to the difference between the prompt crude prices we use for market metrics and the actual crude acquisition costs.","Moving forward to the other segments, slide seven provides a Speedway segment earnings walk compared to the first quarter of last year. Speedway's income from operations was consistent with last year's first quarter at about $167 million. Last year was a record first quarter for our Speedway business, even before including the retail assets acquired along the East Coast and Southeast. So we are very pleased to see the continuing strong performance in the first quarter of this year.","Gasoline and distillate margins were about $0.03 lower than the first quarter of 2015. This was offset by higher merchandise margins, higher gasoline and distillate sales volumes and a $24 million gain from the sale of a retail location in the quarter. Gasoline and distillate margins averaged $0.168 in the first quarter of 2016 compared to $0.197 in the first quarter of 2015. This decline reflects some the stickiness in price at the retail level, when crude prices move rapidly, as we experienced later in the first quarter. On a same-store basis, gasoline sales volumes increased 1% over the same period last year.","Merchandise margins were $19 million higher than the first quarter of 2015, due to overall higher merchandise sales and the higher margins realized on those sales. Merchandise sales in the quarter excluding cigarettes increased 3.1% on a same-store, year-over-year basis, reflecting some of the progress we're making in merchandising across the entire business. In April, we've seen an increase in demand with approximately 1.4% increase in same-store gasoline sales volumes compared to last April.","Slide eight provides changes in the Midstream segment income versus the first quarter last year. Please note that we changed our operating segment presentation this quarter in connection with the contribution of our Inland Marine business to MPLX. Previously, the Inland Marine business and our investment in Crowley Ocean Partners were included in our Refining and Marketing segment. First quarter and going forward, we include all of the marine related businesses in the Midstream segment.","The $90 million shown here for the first quarter of 2015 has also been adjusted for comparability between periods. The $77 million increase quarter-over-quarter was primarily due to the combination with MarkWest at the end of last year, which contributed $72 million of incremental segment income to the first quarter. The remaining increase of $5 million was primarily due to an increase in income from our equity affiliates and higher transportation revenues, partially offset by higher operating expenses versus last year.","Slide nine presents the significant elements of changes in our consolidated cash position for the first quarter. Cash at the end of the first quarter was $308 million. Core operating cash flow was a $604 million source of cash. The $277 million use of working capital noted on the slide primarily relates to a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, partially offset by decreases in accounts receivable and inventory. The decreases in these accounts were primarily due to the drop in crude oil and refined product prices during the quarter versus the fourth quarter of 2015, which led to the net use of cash, given the generally longer terms on the crude purchases.","Net debt repayments resulted in a $372 million use of cash during the quarter. This net reduction resulted from some opportunistic ATM issuances at MPLX in the quarter, generating equity proceeds of about $315 million. These funds were used to pay down a portion of MPLX's then outstanding revolver balance. The equity proceeds are also reflected as part of the $281 million of other cash flows in the quarter shown on the walk.","We continued delivering on our commitment to returning cash to our shareholders. We repurchased 75 million of shares and paid $169 million of dividends in the first quarter. While the share repurchase activity may vary based on the needs and the cash flow characteristics of the business in any particular period, our commitment to continue returning capital remains a fundamental element of our strategy and an important part of the value proposition for our investors.","Share count at the end of the quarter was approximately 530 million shares, reflecting repurchasing activity of about $7.3 billion, retiring about 28% of the then outstanding shares since the spin. In addition, the $0.32 per share dividend announcement by our board yesterday contributes to the 28% compound annual growth rate in our dividend since the spin.","Slide 10 provides an overview of our capitalization and financial profile at the end of the quarter. We had $11.6 billion of total consolidated debt, including $4.7 billion of debt at MPLX. Total consolidated debt-to-book capitalization was about 37% and represented a manageable 2.1 times last 12 months adjusted EBITDA of close to $5.6 billion. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $604 million before reflecting the $277 million use of cash for working capital in the quarter.","Slide 11 provides updated outlook information on key operating metrics for MPC for the second quarter this year. We are expecting second quarter throughput volumes to be down slightly compared to second quarter 2015 due to more planned maintenance in the quarter. Total direct operating costs are expected to be about $6.75 per barrel on total throughputs of 1.875 million barrels per day, which reflects the impact of higher turnaround activity. Our projected second quarter corporate and other unallocated items will be about $75 million.","With that, let me turn the call back over to Lisa.","Lisa Wilson - Director, Investor Relations","Thank you, Tim. As we open the call for your questions, we ask that you limit yourself to one question plus a follow-up. You may re-prompt for additional questions as time permits. With that, we will now open the call to questions. Katie?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And our first question comes from Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys.","Gary R. Heminger - President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Evan.","Timothy T. Griffith - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Good morning, Evan.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Gary, my first question, I know you've been constructive on the refining margin outlook and curious you've got any updates there, particularly on Mid-con for the balance of the year, and then diesel? And somewhat related, I mean is your system currently at a maximum gasoline versus distillate yield?","Gary R. Heminger - President & Chief Executive Officer","I will let Ray talk about whether or not we're maximum gasoline, and diesel, I believe we are. But I'll let Ray Brooks talk about this. But let me speak to the overall Refining segment first within the industry, Evan. I guess I step back and look at it from an inventory position and this week's inventories for the first time, you see \u2013 and as I said in my script, I'm very pleased how the industry really has, I think, put (20:41) into balance. If you look at Pad 2, we are now spot on the same inventory levels as we were same time last year across Pad 2. The zero increase in gasoline and zero increase in ultra low sulfur diesel same periods. So I see that as very positive from where we were coming into the year. And I think that is really \u2013 should provide for strength, as we go into the gasoline season here at the end of Q2 and Q3.","Secondly, the Gulf Coast, while gasoline is still little bit up, there's still some turnarounds being finished in the Gulf Coast, and with the exports, I think the Gulf Coast can get into as we go into the summer grade gasoline, they will get into balance very quickly.","Lastly, the thing to really watch is the significant demand in asphalt across the country. And specifically, we're the largest manufacturer of asphalt in the refining system, and we're expecting a big asphalt season. And with our ability to run a lot of sour crude oil, and what we've been seeing widen out the Mars spreads, and not only Mars, but if you look at several cargo opportunities, the sour crudes have really started to improve here in the second quarter. And we see that as very positive going into the balance of the second quarter and Q3.","So Ray, do you want to talk about max gas versus max diesel?","Raymond L. Brooks - Senior Vice President-Refining, Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Sure, Gary. We've completed all of our planned turnaround work, which was heavy in the first quarter, and we're back up running all our refineries at plan and at maximum. And our swing streams right now are directed to the gasoline stream. We have the capability to swing about 10% between gasoline to diesel, and that's all pointed to gasoline right now.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. That's very helpful. I'll keep my second question to the macro, just shift it to maybe your NGL outlook, where I know you've got significant direct exposure now, and there's what, six new ethane crackers starting up in 2017 and 2018, it's almost 550,000 barrels a day of ethane demand exports in the third quarter. New propane exports have lowered the inventories there in line with the 5-year average. I mean any thoughts on the NGL outlook? Where things look to be improving? And as you think about sensitivities at the MPLX level, I'd appreciate it.","Gary R. Heminger - President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Don, do you want to it please?","Donald C. Templin - President & Director","Sure. Evan, we do see improving pricing around NGLs, and we are optimistic and look favorably upon what's happening in the market. I think as it relates specifically to MPLX and our producer customers particularly in the Marcellus and Utica, absolute prices are important, but so is basis differential. And one of the challenges that they had particularly last summer was there were discounts from other markets. And so, our goal right now and the activities that we are undertaking are really focused on relieving the excess volumes in the Basin and allowing them to get to markets that are either more liquid or international markets.","So, our projects like rail to the East Coast, our projects like \u2013 and this will be a little bit longer-term, but a consideration of butane to alkylate, our efforts to load unit trains, are the positive news about ethane being shipped from the Basin over to the East Coast and making its way onto an international shipment. Those are all very positive in our view for the producer customers that we have a regular interaction with and that impact our business the most.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hey. Good morning. And I guess a broader care question to begin with. Obviously you've made a lot of strategic changes and the quarter was quite tough because of maintenance and then some of the environment issues, you end up with $300 million of cash. Can you just talk about what you think are the main levers that you're going to pull to rebuild that cash balance? Clearly the summer may be good, but we're 7 years into a business cycle.","Gary R. Heminger - President & Chief Executive Officer","Ed, let me have \u2013 Tim will cover the balance sheet part, but let me talk about our strategy. And you're right, we have \u2013 since we spoke at your conference, in fact in February, we've rolled out our plans to reduce capital this year. We made a significant headway in reducing capital. We are making tremendous headway in self help and reducing operating expenses across all segments of our business, and that's going to happen, and we're going to continue to do good job of that.","But as we go forward to release any distraction within our businesses, as you recognized yesterday, we announced the convertible preferred, I thought it was important, the whole team thought it was important, that we get any distraction, as I outlined at your conference when I spoke, to get any distraction between MPC and MPLX off the table and we've accomplished that with the billion dollars of convertible preferreds that will take care of the capital budget of MPLX into 2017.","Secondly, as we continue to digest this acquisition, Tony and his team have done a tremendous job in being able to digest the Hess acquisition, is that we are going to get into a mode and into a rhythm of being able to harvest the cash from these businesses and build up that stockpile of cash, and clearly intend to get back into a more robust share repurchase program as we go down the road. Tim?","Timothy T. Griffith - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. With regard to the cash balances, as you may recall for the Analyst Day last year, we highlighted the fact that as we go through our core liquidity analysis and how much we need to support the business and protect for all the potential contingencies, there's a number of elements of that analysis that are a function of absolute crude prices, and the amount of core liquidity in the form of cash that we would keep at $100, $80, $60 oil is much higher than where it is at oil between $30 and $40 and $45. So, I think we are very comfortable at the $308 million number. We expect it's going to be anywhere between sort of zero and $0.5 billion. And with the committed capacity we have on the facilities and the sort of tools we have available to us with working capital and otherwise, I think we are very comfortable that if these absolute price levels that we're at appropriate levels to protect the business on a going forward basis. So there's \u2013 I don't think there's a notion, at least at these crude prices, that we necessarily need to build cash balances back. I think we're comfortable with where we're at. But as Gary said, a lot of opportunity for sort of earnings enhancement as we go forward. And we'll certainly have those levers available to us, so.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Second question, briefly. We'll ask your customers too in MarkWest how they're feeling. But are you \u2013 with oil having picked up a little bit and perhaps the fears of (28:54) having receded, are you seeing any appetite to move forward any quicker on the upstream side of the MarkWest business?","Gary R. Heminger - President & Chief Executive Officer","Don?","Donald C. Templin - President & Director","When you say move forward more quickly at, and I guess a little bit of clarification there?","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Oh sorry, in terms of upstream customers wanting to get back in terms of activity and you know your just-in-time approach therefore needing to be speeded up a little bit.","Donald C. Templin - President & Director","Okay. Yeah. I would say that we are monitoring and are in regular constant dialogue with our producer customers. I do think, obviously, the uptick in pricing is a very positive sign for them. Our capital budget that we have currently, the billion-dollar capital budget, I think is reflective of what we believe our current drilling plans for our customers, our producer customers. We obviously \u2013 we think there is some flex there. But I don't anticipate that there would be any significant movement from the number that we've publicly quoted.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Brad Heffern from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Good morning, everyone.","Gary R. Heminger - President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Brad.","Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Gary, I guess previously you sort of touched on this. But I was hoping you could provide a little more color. I'm just curious the billion-dollar private placement, MPLX, how that frees up MPC. And the extent to which that reduces the support that maybe you thought you might have to provide to MPLX. And I'm thinking about specifically in the context of are we going to continue to see drops at very advantageous multiples for MPLX? And does it take some of the things like maybe IDR givebacks off the table?","Gary R. Heminger - President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, Brad, as you know, this is a \u2013 well, the MLP markets, the way they are today, it's a very dynamic situation. And it's \u2013 my answer has to be \u2013 address those dynamic cases. But certainly that is our expectation and our goal. As we did the drop of the Inland Marine system, it was at a very supportive drop and that was to be able to bridge MPLX over this time of challenge within the MLP market. MPLX has responded very, very well since early February, and very pleased with the support and the improvement in the yield since that point in time.","Secondly, as I said in my prepared remarks, we thought it was very important to get this distraction at any overhang. Your question is spot on. In order to be able to be supportive to the MLP, what did the sponsor need to do? You're right. We dropped at a supportive multiple. We certainly don't expect to be dropping at those type of multiples going forward. And that was a bridge to get to where we are today. The same thing with the convertible preferred here. A very strong support for MPLX, but it takes that overhang and takes that distraction outside of MPC. And I believe as we go forward and look at any next drops, I think where we're situated now, we don't need to make anymore drops in 2016. We'll see how far out into 2017 before we would need to consider that. But our plan is as MPLX continues to improve and the yields continue to improve, which I'm confident they're going to, I think we're going to be able to cure this bridge or trying to rebuild this bridge that we've been working on for the last three months or four months. Tim, you want to add anything to that?","Timothy T. Griffith - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","No. I would just reiterate the notion that, Brad, I think as we assess things, the convertible preferred provides a very efficient form of equity capital in a market that's been sort of volatile with elevated yields. Obviously, through the first quarter you saw common unit yields, which were extraordinarily high. And I think we were careful thinking about exactly what that could mean for the partnership on a long-term basis. So, with the amount of inventor interest around these securities and structuring of securities that we think makes sense it, as Gary said, provides a fantastic funding source. It takes 2016 off the table right into 2017.","And again, allows the focus on the business to be the continued growth in production, the organic projects and positions the partnership well. What this will mean for sponsor support, I think MPC stands ready in all of its varying forms and all the varying tools to step in to help support the partnership. When there is efficient capital available in the marketplace, we'll avail ourselves of that. And when that's not available, MPC will stand ready.","So we're pleased with getting this security done. As Gary said, there was some thought that MPC would provide this funding. MPC is still prepared to do so, but with the third-party money available, at terms that we found attractive, we thought that was a very good decision to move forward on.","Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. That's great color. Thanks for that. And then as my follow-up, I'd like to touch on Speedway. I was curious, you had a very good quarter in terms of growth, both in terms of volumes and in terms of merchandise sales. Is there a breakdown that you can provide of that for the legacy stores versus the Hess stores? I'm just curious if one side of that is driving the growth, or another, or if it looks broadly similar across the portfolio.","Gary R. Heminger - President & Chief Executive Officer","Tony?","Anthony R. Kenney - President, Speedway LLC","Yeah. Brad, as we've moved through the integration of the two businesses and the focus on capturing synergies, we've stopped keeping track separately of the two businesses. As you integrate all the functions of the business, I mean, the difficulty and the challenge to keep separate books on each is tremendous. So, we do not have a breakdown as to where the contributions are coming specifically.","Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. I'll leave it there. Thank you.","Gary R. Heminger - President & Chief Executive Officer","And Brad, I'll \u2013 Brad, let me just say, while we don't report individual segments from inside Speedway, Tony's team did a tremendous job and they now have re-ID'd all of the stores that were going through re-ID; way ahead of schedule on the synergies. We're way ahead of the schedule on the cash flow that we expected from this acquisition. But at the same time, their legacy assets performed very, very well. So, both sides I would say are running on all cylinders.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Paul Cheng from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Gary R. Heminger - President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Paul.","Operator","Paul, if you're on mute, please un-mute yourself. Okay. We'll go to the next question. We have Neil Mehta on the line from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Morning, Gary.","Gary R. Heminger - President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Neil. How are you?","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Doing great here. So, Gary, want to touch \u2013 start off on retail and the right structure for it to be in. I know I've asked you this in the past. But what do you think about doing a retail spinoff? We just keep on seeing these marks out there of these retail C-Corps that are trading at 11 times, 12 times EBITDA. Does that make sense to monetize that asset?","Gary R. Heminger - President & Chief Executive Officer","Neil, and you're right, we have talked about this before. And as we look at that question, the answer has to be what \u2013 how do we think shareholders are valuing Speedway inside of MPC today, and therefore what is the delta? When I step back and really look at the delta that may be available, it certainly is not a number that I think gives credence to separating from the long-term strategic value that we see in having Speedway under the control of \u2013 or I should say not under the control, but inside the value system and inside the supply chain system of Marathon. It's always been one of our key value quotients with inside Marathon.","We've gone back and done a lot of work on some other transactions that have happened historically where companies spun off their retail and it appeared to be a pretty small bump in share value that can be eroded for many different reasons across the value chain. With all that said, we continue to look at it. We continue to analyze it. And I clearly, as you and I have spoken, I clearly see what the values that are being garnered inside the retail-only space. And, as always, we will continue to analyze this as we go down the road.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I appreciate that. And then, Gary, just wanted your perspective on the crude markets on two different fronts, first, on your views on the differentials which continue to be tight, certainly for these inland differentials, but favorable on the light heavies and the medium sours. And then also just on the flat price, I know you were in Saudi Arabia a couple of weeks ago. Just any thoughts in terms of how you think OPEC acts through the balance of the year.","Gary R. Heminger - President & Chief Executive Officer","Right. Neil, as I spoke at your conference earlier in the year, Neil, I made a prediction that crude would be somewhere mid-$50s to $60 by the end of the year. Brent topped $47 yesterday and looks to have a momentum going into today. And I still believe that crude will continue. And what's so important is that this inches up slowly. You do not want to spike on a very short-term basis, because I think the pain on a spike and then coming off that spike would have longer lasting effects on the marketplace. So you want to have a very slow, gradual move. And we're seeing that happening. And I still stand by our thoughts that the crude is going to continue to move. And I think that's beneficial across the entire energy sector. I think that it improves demand. If you get prices up and get people back working in the oil fields, I think it's important, again, for the entire worldwide global demand sector.","What I said in my remarks that \u2013 I'm glad you brought it up, is that we're starting to see the medium sours, the Mars, and some other cargos of Mars, medium, and other lookalike type barrels over the last month or so, we're starting to see that Mars spread, that medium sours spreads widen out. And I think that is very supportive to the industry, very supportive to those refiners who have the ability to run this medium sour crude and have the residual processing capability to handle (41:14) and us being the largest manufacturer of asphalt in the country, it really helps us as we went to the asphalt season.","So I see crude continuing to move up for the balance of the year. I think it's very good for the medium and heavy sour refiners. And at the same time, we'll see what happens. I would expect that there's going to be another meeting of the OPEC numbers here in May. And at that time, I would expect to see these freezes put into place. And if that happens, I think it'll continue to have some pressure on the LLS grades as far as any spreads. But I think it will continue to benefit the medium sour players.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks, Gary.","Operator","And our next question comes from Doug Terreson from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Douglas Terreson - Evercore ISI","Hi, everybody.","Gary R. Heminger - President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Doug.","Timothy T. Griffith - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Good morning, Doug.","Douglas Terreson - Evercore ISI","Guys, distillate consumption has been weak so far this year, even considering weather effects. And so I wanted to see if you could provide some color on the commercial or on-road aspect of this demand that you're seeing this year, and whether or not improvement's likely later on in the year?","Gary R. Heminger - President & Chief Executive Officer","Tony, you want to cover that, please?","Anthony R. Kenney - President, Speedway LLC","Yeah. Distillate demand is down. It's just a combination of a number of things when we look at the overall numbers that we're looking at on diesel. The over-the-road component is soft. It's probably down in the neighborhood of about 2%. That's the large 18-wheel freight business. And then some of the regional business is down a little less than that, probably in the 1% area. And there're some other factors that are affecting overall distillate as well. Demand for U.S., for example, all the shale production that was shut in, there were some large consumption on distillate for that activity, which has obviously slowed down significantly.","Douglas Terreson - Evercore ISI","The negative numbers like that historically correlate to a particular GDP figure? And if so, what would be the read through to the U.S. economy? Or do you guys not take it quite that far?","Gary R. Heminger - President & Chief Executive Officer","Doug, we've always \u2013 you've heard me say many times that over-the-road diesel is a, I think, a precursor to the overall economy.","Douglas Terreson - Evercore ISI","Yeah.","Gary R. Heminger - President & Chief Executive Officer","Due to some of the \u2013 if you go back to the first quarter, we just analyzed our diesel demand, over-the-road diesel demand in the first quarter. And there were times across the Eastern Seaboard, we lost four days and five days of diesel demand because of severe weather. But...","Douglas Terreson - Evercore ISI","Okay.","Gary R. Heminger - President & Chief Executive Officer","...you have severe weather in different pockets of the country every year. But it seem to be more severe in the markets in which we operate today. But you're right. It has always historically been somewhat of a predictor of the overall economy. I look at some of our big, big customers on the diesel side and they're down probably 2% to 3% on a same-store basis on diesel demand. Yet in talking to a lot of the big trucking companies, the trucking companies' books, they say looks strong going into Q2 and for the summer months. So, it remains to be seen. I expect that diesel, I don't think for the year, we're going to be down 3%. But we may \u2013 as you know, we've had tremendous growth in diesel the last three years or four years. And I think some of that is just leveling off of what the demand has been. But we still \u2013 if you go back and look the last three years or four years, probably in total up around 10%. So, when you average this out, I think the market's still fairly good.","Douglas Terreson - Evercore ISI","Okay. Let's just hope it's a soft patch. And then also, condition seem to be worsening in Venezuela, although it's unclear as to whether it's affected refined product flows based on the data that we've seen. And so, I want to see if you can provide insight into that market if you have any? And also the outlook for exports into the other possible export markets in the Atlantic Basin this year?","Gary R. Heminger - President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Mike Palmer handles all of our exports. So, Mike?","C. Michael Palmer - Senior VP-Supply, Distribution & Planning","Yeah, Doug, I don't know that we have any particular insight into the troubles that Venezuela is seeing right now other than you do.","Douglas Terreson - Evercore ISI","Okay.","C. Michael Palmer - Senior VP-Supply, Distribution & Planning","I can tell you that it is difficult doing business with them. They have a lot of trouble trying to keep their upgraders, for example, going. And there hasn't been a lot of spot opportunities from Venezuela for us so far this year. So, that's certainly been difficult.","Douglas Terreson - Evercore ISI","And just the overall thing on export markets? Yeah?","Gary R. Heminger - President & Chief Executive Officer","But the other thing, Doug, due to the export markets, our export markets, as Tim said in his remarks, of course, we had turnarounds in the first quarter that will have dropped our export volume. But we've come back strong, and the book looks good throughout the balance of the second quarter, up over 300,000 barrels per day in exports, which would suggest that Venezuela continues to struggle.","Douglas Terreson - Evercore ISI","Okay. Great. Thanks a lot, everybody.","Operator","And our next question comes from Chi Chow from Tudor Pickering, Holt. Please go ahead.","Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning. Tim, it looks like you've repurchased around $75 million worth of shares in the quarter. Do you have a buyback target for the share?","Timothy T. Griffith - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Well, Chi, I don't know that there's a hard target. Again, this is something that we'll sort of assess as we go. Obviously, a relatively weak quarter on the earnings side and the resulting cash flows. So I think you'd expect that the activity would have been lower in first quarter. But again, I think our focus is that, we've talked about 100% of free cash flow through cycle as the business generates cash and we're sort of carefully looking at capital. We expect that the activity is going to vary based on any given quarter. So, I wouldn't say that it's a hard target, but a continued long-term focus on making that an important part of our overall capital plans.","Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. You talked about the Robinson crude project in the release. I guess in addition to the crude slate flexibility, is there going to be a corresponding increase in the production capacity of light products out of the plant?","Gary R. Heminger - President & Chief Executive Officer","Ray?","Raymond L. Brooks - Senior Vice President-Refining, Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Yeah. With the Robinson turnaround, we completed the project to increase our light crude processing capability. And what that allow us to do is increase our handling of light crude by 30,000 barrels a day on a stream day basis, and at the same time, that gives us an overall increase in total crude throughput of about 20,000 barrels a day at that refinery. So significant improvement in that refinery.","Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Can you talk about the yield impact on the product side?","Raymond L. Brooks - Senior Vice President-Refining, Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Well, the yield impact would just basically follow our normal distribution of about between gasoline and diesel there. There wouldn't be a large change there, overall. One thing that we've done at that refinery too at the end of last year is we increased our hydrocracker capacity by about 10,000 barrels a day. So this plays along with that too.","Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","I guess along those lines, it just seems like a lot of your current refining projects are focused on increasing ULSG production. And maybe this is back to Doug's question, with demands soft, how concerned are you about not only your increases on ULSG capacity, but just the broader global increase that we've seen over the last couple years? And how do you think that's going to play out on the cracks for diesel going forward here over next maybe even couple years?","Gary R. Heminger - President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, Chi, I would say that if you go back and look at our exports and look at the exports of the industry, still about 2 to 1 the global demand for diesel in the export market is what we're seeing. As I said earlier, we're back to all the diesel inventories across Pad 2 are balanced to where we were same period last year. Still up about seven million barrels of inventory in Pad 3. I think that can be cleared relatively easy as we go into the balance of the quarter. It's all going to come back to the question Doug had on, what is overall the over-the-road diesel demand equation? What happens to that in the near-term?","But as we see \u2013 and it's always been our position. We work very hard to always balance the diesel inventory in Pad 2. Pad 3 diesel inventory moves into Pad 1, moves into Pad 2 with the demand and any dislocation that may happen in the marketplace. But most importantly is the export demands for diesel.","Going back to Doug's question about Venezuela, and I think some other markets, we're continuing to see very strong demand. But we're also seeing improvement in gasoline demand at some of those export markets as well.","So, I understand your question, and I think the entire industry is continuing to assess and be very careful in any incremental diesel projects. But as you know, Chi, you don't do one of these projects overnight. They're long-term in the planning and long-term that generally these small upgrades or creep that you get in that supply commonly do have a major turnaround cycle plan. So, it's all going from back down to the balance of over-the-road demand and the balance of export demand going forward.","Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Yeah. I think we're all trying to figure out how that's going to go here. But thanks for the comments, Gary. Appreciate it.","Operator","And our next question comes from Paul Sankey from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi, guys. Gary, I had a question on...","Gary R. Heminger - President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Paul.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi. I had a question on MPC that I want to come back to, but just briefly you mentioned somewhat casually in passing that you thought OPEC was going to meet in May and set a freeze. I don't know if that was kind of a throw-away comment or if you could just expand on that a little bit. And then I'd like to come back on the subject of CapEx, please. Thanks.","Gary R. Heminger - President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, no, it wasn't a throw-away comment. It's just \u2013 you read the same things I do. But I go back in history and look at how all these discussions play out. There's a tremendous amount of disappointment in a number of the OPEC members that this wasn't solved at the April 17 meeting. And the expectation is, there'll be another meeting here in May. And this goes along with my entire thesis of where we think crude prices are going to go. I, of course, don't have any inside knowledge of whether there will or will not be. But it certainly comes from my years of experience that I would expect that you'll see another meeting.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Thanks for the clarification, Gary. Gary, you talked several times about the (53:57-53:59) CapEx. Could you talk about the outlook for MPC CapEx? Update us on the major projects that you're undertaking? And you mentioned that you're hoping to bring CapEx down further. And I think fairly strongly said that you were going to be prioritizing cash return to shareholders. So if you could give us the CapEx side of that balance outlook for MPC, I'd be grateful. Thank you.","Gary R. Heminger - President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure, Paul. And we stated in early February, we reduced the capital \u2013 that we've reduced the capital budget around $1 billion across both MPLX and MPC side of the equation. Our major projects, we are just embarking on very, very early stages of the Big Star project. And that goes out six years for the South Texas asset redevelopment project. So that goes out for a number of years, and we do not have any large projects or large capital expenditures in any individual project all at once. We will continue to look at the capital.","Don has done a very good job in being able to squeeze capital out of the midstream side, as well as Tony has on the retail side to be very efficient and probably to backload some projects where we saw was opportunistic to reduce some of our capital spend. And we continue to look at that every month as we close our books.","My comments on capital deployment and getting back into share repurchases was that, as we went through this big acquisition at Speedway, now a year-and-a-half ago, and that's, as I said earlier, we're way ahead of schedule on the EBITDA that it is generating. And MPLX, I believe that we really have that going in the right direction that our plan is, as conditions improve, and Tim just answered the question from Chi on share repurchases. We do not have a month-by-month plan on what we're going to do. But our strategy \u2013 or I mean we know what we want to do, but not a plan on exactly any share buybacks and when that might happen. But we want to get back into a rhythm as we log into the next few years of being able to harvest from these businesses that we've acquired and really set this company up very, very strong across all three segments of the business that we will be able to harvest and get back into a strong share buyback program over the long term.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Thank you, sir.","Gary R. Heminger - President & Chief Executive Officer","Yep.","Operator","And our next question comes from Phil Gresh from JPMorgan. Go ahead.","Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey. Good morning. My first question is actually just a follow-up to what Paul was just asking. At the \u2013 in the December Analyst Day, you had talked about something around a $3 billion growth investment target for 2017. And obviously, you've been aggressive on 2016. A decent chunk of that's at MPLX. But as you noted, there's some increased spend in refining as well. So, could you just talk about maybe the level of flex capital embedded within that $3 billion growth number? And just are we thinking about the same level of flexibility as what you saw this year looking ahead?","Gary R. Heminger - President & Chief Executive Officer","Tim, you want to cover that?","Timothy T. Griffith - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Sure. Phil, obviously, as Gary indicated, we have and will continue to look very carefully at capital. There's a certain portion of the capital budget at MPC that is, what we'll probably describe as a little bit more maintenance in nature, a little bit more sort of regulatory pieces. But for all the pieces, and certainly when we think about some of the investments in Speedway, in T&L, obviously the Star project we announced, we've sort of extended that and pushed it out. There are elements and good pockets within the capital budget that probably would continue to have flex capability to them, depending on how things go. I mean there are a number of things that we can sort of set up and pursue more rapidly if conditions improve and we see the earnings and cash flows that could support the investments there, or frankly, defer further, defer into 2017 and potentially beyond as the needs of the business sort of migrate over time. So there is, I think, with any refining business, you'll see an element of capital that maybe has a little bit less flexibility to it. But we still have significant elements that we'll continue to look at over the course of this year and into next in terms of where we may want to make some adjustments.","Donald C. Templin - President & Director","And Phil, this is Don. On the MPLX side, or Midstream side, our budget this year has been reduced or we're going to manage it down to something closer to $1 billion. Of that, probably 60%-ish or so was G&P and 40% was logistics and storage. And in that 40% were a couple projects that were underway that we are going to complete this year, that won't continue on into next year, to give us some flexibility. So, for example, the Cornerstone project will be completed by the \u2013 we're projecting that it will be completed by the fourth quarter of this year. And that was roughly half of the budget that we had for the L&S business.","On the G&P side of the business, this year, in our budget, about 60% of the total year budget was around gathering, and 40% was sort of processing and fractionation. The remainder of the year it's actually a higher proportion of gathering than processing and fractionation. We've essentially completed the major projects that we were undertaking. So, we have the ability to flex that capital next year, really dependent upon how our producer customers and what they're planning to do and how quickly they continue to grow their volumes. So, I believe there's a lot of flex. I believe that the \u2013 on the MPLX side, particularly, capital is probably closer to a number that we had this year. But we'll continue to manage that as the year progresses.","Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks. That's very helpful. The second question is just around on the refining side, Tim, probably your favorite topic. On an absolute basis, the other gross margin was only about $15 million in the quarter. You mentioned crude differentials as a key variance factor year-over-year. I was just wondering, was there anything else maybe one-time in the quarter because it was a big downturn quarter? Obviously it was a weak margin quarter to begin with. But if there's any additional color there, that might be useful. Thanks.","Donald C. Templin - President & Director","Yeah. So I don't know that there's any very unique one-timers. I mean again, a lot of what we've seen on the other gross margin sort of as it's tracked over time, has really been a function of where absolute crude prices are, because obviously at lower crude prices, you'll see things like volumetric gains decline in terms of the value ascribed to the gain within the refining system as absolute refined product prices are lower.","You'll see with a lot of the differentials having come in, you also see a lot of the benefits that we had seen historically on the blend stock and feedstock into the system. Those spreads relative to L&S have come in as well. There is a little bit less opportunity, again, at these absolute levels to garner the benefits of feedstocks and blend stocks into the system as well.","So, again, a lot of that has been trending that way just at the absolute levels and with some of the differentials coming off. And those are probably the biggest drivers of it. There's nothing in first quarter that was particularly unusual relative to the trends that we've seen really over the course of the last year.","Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay.

Welcome to Marathon Petroleum Corporation's second quarter 2017 earnings webcast and conference call. The synchronized slides that accompany this call can be found on our website at marathonpetroleum.com under the Investor Center tab. On the call today are Gary Heminger, Chairman and CEO; Don Templin, President; Tim Griffith, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and other members of MPC's executive team.","We invite you to read the Safe Harbor statements on slide 2. It's a reminder that we will be making forward-looking statements during the call and during the question-and-answer session. Actual results may differ materially from what we expect today. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included there, as well as in our filings with the SEC.","Now, I will turn the call over to Gary Heminger for opening remarks and highlights. Gary?","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Thank you, Lisa, and good morning to everyone. If you please turn to slide 3. Before I begin, let me take the moment to highlight recent changes to our executive team. Don Templin, previously President of MPLX is named President of Marathon Petroleum Corporation, overseeing our refining, supply, distribution and planning and marketing operations. He also continues to serve as a Director on the MPLX board. Don has been an extraordinary asset to our company and shareholder since we became an independent publicly traded company in 2011, and we look to forward to his continued leadership as president of MPC. We're delighted to welcome Mike Hennigan, who has joined as MPLX president. Mike has replaced Don and comes to the role of 35 years of industry experience, most recently as President and CEO of Sunoco Logistics Partners, a role he held since 2012. He brings a tremendous depth of experience having led by most successful growth oriented massive limited partnerships in the market. We are very enthusiastic about Mike's joining and believe his appointment speaks to our commitment to grow our industry leading Midstream platform in MPLX, and drive long-term value for our investors.","Moving to our second quarter highlights on slide 4. We are executing the strategic actions announced earlier this year to further enhance shareholder value. Following the completion of the first of several planned dropdowns in the first quarter, we used substantially all after tax cash proceeds from the transaction, to repurchase shares including $750 million in the second quarter. We are targeting the dropdown of joint interest ownership in certain pipelines and storage for several of these to MPLX in the third quarter with the proposed transaction currently under evaluation by the MPLX board and as independent complex committee. These assets are projected to generate approximately about $135 million of annual adjusted EBITDA.","Work is also on schedule to prepare the remaining assets for dropdown to MPLX. This is expected to occur no later than the end of the first quarter of 2018. In conjunction with the completion of the dropdowns, we expect to exchange our general partner economic interest with newly issued MPLX common units. All transactions are subject to market and other conditions as well as requisite approvals. Additionally, a special committee of the board and its independent advisor are continuing to work through the assessment of Speedway and expect to complete this review and recommendation by the end of the third quarter.","Turning to our results for the second quarter. This morning, we reported second quarter earnings of $515 million or $1 per diluted share, including a net charge of $0.03 per diluted share related to estimated losses for litigation matters, partially offset by Sandpiper asset liquidation gains.","We delivered strong operational and financial performance across all segments of the business in the second quarter. Speedway continues to perform very well, reporting its third best quarter ever. Speedway delivered record second quarter segment income from operations of $239 million, surpassing the previous record set last year by $71 million on a normalized basis. Speedway's exceptional results were driven primarily by higher life products and merchandise gross margins and the outstanding expense control. Tim will provide some additional color on Speedway's performance shortly.","We continue to focus on delivering top tier performance and expect continued growth in Speedway earnings, as we drive marketing enhancement opportunities, build new stores, remodel stores, and rebuild existing locations across our footprint. We continue to be very encouraged by the attractive investment opportunities that are available to us.","Our Midstream segment, which includes the financial results of MPLX, also delivered outstanding performance in the quarter. MPLX reported record second quarter earnings, primarily driven by record process and fractionation volumes. This includes a 14% increase in processing volume and a 20% increase in fractionation volumes versus prior year. Investment in the partnership's Utica build-out projects, including the newly constructed Harpster-to-Lima pipeline, became fully operational in July. MPLX expanded the capacity of our East Sparta to Heath and Heath to Harpster pipelines. In combination with the cornerstone pipeline, these projects create additional fee-based revenue for the partnership and new access for Utica and Marcellus shale producers by moving condensate and natural gasoline through the Midwest.","The partnership is currently constructing additional connectivity and expanding pipelines to provide more optionality for Midwest refiners. In addition to continuing expansion in the Marcellus and Utica, the partnership continues construction of the Argo gas processing plant in the Delaware basin. In July, the partnership also began construction of an additional gas processing plant to support growth in the STACK shale play of Oklahoma. The new facility, named the Omega plant, is expected to enter service in mid-2018.","MPLX has continued strong financial and operational performance and robust set of growth opportunities clearly demonstrate the substantial and growing value the partnership represents to the total enterprise. We remain confident in MPLX's compelling value proposition to our investors. I would encourage you to listen in on the MPLX call at 11 o'clock this morning to hear additional color on the performance and opportunities for MPLX.","Turning to refining and marketing, we reported solid quarterly results and continue to drive further process and cost efficiencies with the combination of our Galveston Bay and Texas City refineries. These refineries are now being operated and managed as a single combined refinery and will continue to be a critical part of our world-class Gulf Coast refining capacity.","Moving forward, we will simply refer to this complex as the Galveston Bay refinery. Second quarter results were driven by record crude throughput of approximately 1.9 million barrels per day. After completing turnaround activity in the first quarter our Garyville and the combined Galveston Bay refinery complexes have each demonstrated crude unit run rate capacity of nearly 600,000 barrels per day.","I'm also pleased to report that our Canton refinery has received the VPP Star certification from OSHA, joining in an elite group of companies that demonstrate exemplary occupational safety and health protection.","Canton joins MPC's other certified VPP Star Sites including Garyville, Robinson, Detroit and Texas City refineries. And underscores our unshakable commitment to health, safety and environmental stewardship throughout our operations.","As we enter the second half of the year, I also want to provide some observations of the macro environment impacting the business. We believe the global and U.S. macro picture remains solid and expect the good underlying economic growth will continue to support strong demand for our products, as inventory levels are worked down in the second half of this year and into 2018.","Export markets, which have been important to the high utilization of our refineries are expected to remain robust. Exports remain a fundamental component in our refined products distribution and we continue to invest our support additional export capacity in our system. We think the prospects for more balanced supply and demand environment going forward will be supported what the global refined product markets we serve.","With that, let me turn the call over to Tim to walk through the financial results for the first quarter.","Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Thanks, Gary. Slide 5 provides earnings on both an absolute and per share basis. For the second quarter of 2017, MPC reported earnings of $515 million or $1 per diluted share. As Gary mentioned, results included net charge of $0.03 per diluted share related to estimated losses for litigation matters, partially offset by Sandpiper asset liquidation gains. The $515 million compares to last year's $801 million or a $1.51 per diluted share, which included a net benefit of $0.44 per diluted share related to the reversal of the lower cost or market inventory valuation reserve offset by an impairment of one of MPLX's equity investments.","The bridge on slide 6 shows the change in earnings by segment over the second quarter last year. The walk highlights the decrease in Refining & Marketing offset to some extent by increases in earnings from Speedway and Midstream. The variance for both Refining & Marketing and Speedway segments include the absence of the $385 million pre-tax benefit to reverse the company's lower cost-to-market inventory valuation reserve reflected in the second quarter of 2016.","$360 million of this benefit in 2016 was included in the Refining & Marketing segment, and $25 million was reflected in the Speedway segment. The $79 million favorable Midstream variance was primarily due to MPLX's record processing and fractionation volumes as compared to last year. The $51 million favorable variance shown in the items not allocated segments bar on the walk is due to the absence of an impairment of the equity method investment recorded in the second quarter of 2016, and our share of the gain on asset liquidations related to our investment in the cancelled Sandpiper pipeline project, offset by estimated losses related to ongoing litigation matters.","Quarterly results were also impacted by $131 million of lower income taxes and $109 million of increased allocation of higher MPLX earnings to the publicly held units in the partnership; shown here is the negative variance in non-controlling interest.","Moving to slide 7. Our Refining & Marketing segment reported earnings of $562 million in the second quarter compared to approximately $1 billion in the same quarter last year. Looking at our key market metrics, an increase in the LLS-based blended crack spread had a $374 million favorable impact to segment results primarily due to higher U.S. Gulf Coast crack spread. The LLS-based blended crack spread increased from $7.66 per barrel in 2016 to $9.18 per barrel in the second quarter of this year. This increase was offset by several unfavorable impacts during the quarter. First, higher RIN prices produced a $70 million unfavorable RIN\/CBOB crack adjustment. This increase in cost was considered in our pricing decision and passed on to consumers, thus an equivalent offset resides in the product portion of our other gross margin.","As a reminder and consistent with this treatment, we view the LLS crack and RIN\/CBOB crack adjustment together as an effective realized crack spread. We could have simply reflected a $304 million positive crack spread, but are showing them separately here given the desire to provide visibility to both factors on an absolute basis. Second, a narrowing sweet\/sour differential had a negative impact on earnings of approximately $93 million versus last year. The differential tightened from $691 per barrel in the second quarter of 2016 to $548 per barrel in 2017.","Third, a narrowing contango effect, shown in the market structure column of the walk, resulted in the $115 million unfavorable variance. This is effectively a smaller adjustment of the crude acquisition costs versus the prompt crude prices used in the benchmark crack.","Lastly, we experienced a decrease of $223 million in other gross margin in the segment. Higher actual crude oil and feedstock acquisition costs versus our benchmark basket resulted in a $169 million negative crude variance in addition to a $65 million negative impact, primarily related to lower non-transportation product price realizations and higher purchase RIN costs in the quarter.","Moving forward to the other segments. Slide 8 provides Speedway segment results walk for the second quarter. As Gary mentioned, Speedway delivered record second quarter earnings of $239 million, up about $71 million after excluding the $21 million benefit from the LCM reversal in the second quarter I mentioned just a minute ago. An increase in light product gross margin had a $31 million favorable impact as margins averaged $0.184 per gallon in the second quarter of 2017, up from $0.155 in 2016 on the nearly 1.5 billion gallons sold in the quarter. Merchandise margin also contributed $2 million favorable impact to segment income.","As a reminder, comparability of Speedway's results to prior year's second quarter was also affected by the transfer of Speedway's travel centers into the newly formed joined venture with Pilot called PFJ Southeast LLC in the fourth quarter of 2016.","Speedway's share of the results of operations from the joint venture is reflected in income from equity method investments and is shown in the other column of this walk, while prior quarter activity remains in light product margin, merchandise margin and other categories. On a comparable basis, excluding the contribution of these travel centers, improvement in both light product margin and merchandise margin were higher than what is shown in the table.","Similarly, an increase in other income of $38 million includes Speedway's share of the results of the joint venture with Pilot Flying J as well as lower direct operating expenses resulting from the contribution of the centers.","So far in July, we have seen a roughly 2.1% decrease in same-store gasoline sales compared to last July as we continuously strive to optimize total gasoline contributions between volume and margin as market conditions adjust.","Slide 9 provides the changes in the Midstream segment of $79 million year-over-year. The $62 million favorable variance for MPLX was primarily due to record processing and fractionation volumes as compared to last year. Results were also favorably impacted by changes in natural gas and NGL prices, earnings from the recently acquired Ozark Pipeline system, as well as increased earnings from pipeline equity method investments.","Slide 10 provides a significant elements of changes in our consolidated cash position for the second quarter. Cash at the end of the quarter was nearly $1.5 billion, a decrease of approximately $700 million from the end of the first quarter. Core operating cash flow before changes in working capital was about $1 billion source of cash. Working capital was a $141 million use of cash in the quarter, primarily due to an increase in crude inventories and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities.","Cash flow reflects net proceeds of $286 million from organic equity issuances by MPLX through its ATM program to fund its organic capital program.","Return of capital to shareholders via dividends and share purchases was $936 million in the quarter. As Gary referenced, after tax cash proceeds from the first quarter dropdown had been substantially returned via share repurchase activity including the 750 million of share purchase in the quarter during the year-to-date total to $1.2 billion.","Yesterday, the MPC Board of Directors announced an 11% increase in the quarterly dividend up to $0.40 per share. With this increase, MPC has achieved a 26% annual compound growth rate in the dividend since becoming an independent company six years ago demonstrating continued confidence in the long-term cash generation of the business.","Going forward, we expect cash proceeds from the dropdowns and ongoing LP distributions to fund substantial ongoing return of capital to shareholders, all conducted with the continued focus on maintaining an investment grade credit profile at both MPC and MPLX.","Slide 11 provides an overview of our capitalization and financial profile at the end of the quarter. We had $12.6 billion of total consolidated debt including $6.7 billion of debt at MPLX. Total consolidated debt-to-book capitalization was about 38% and represented 2.8 times last 12 months adjusted EBITDA on a consolidated basis or about two times when excluding MPLX.","We continue to show debt to EBITDA excluding MPLX as we think it's more useful to show the independent capital structures given the effect of the relatively higher leverage of the growing partnership on MPC's consolidated metrics and our approach to managing capitalization separately.","We're also pleased that in July, the complete replaced its existing bank revolving credit facilities expiring in July 2020 with a new five-year $2.5 billion bank revolving credit facility expiring in July 2022 and a new 364-day $1 billion bank revolving credit facility expiring in July of 2018.","Slide 12 provides updated outlook information on key operating metrics for MPC for the third quarter of 2017. We're expecting throughput volumes of 1.925 million barrels per day with some planned maintenance in the Midwest.","Total direct operating costs are expected to be $7.10 per barrel. Other manufacturing cost on a per barrel basis are expected to be slightly higher than 2016, primarily due to higher forecast and natural gas prices in the same period last year. We expect to see an advantage to process lighter crudes in the third quarter driven by nearly 3,000 differentials. Sour crude is expected to make up 54% of our crude oil throughput in the third quarter. Projected third quarter \u2013 I'm sorry \u2013 estimated percentage of WTI price crude will be 24%. Projected third quarter corporate and other unallocated items are estimated to be at about \u20ac80 million.","With that, let me turn the call back to Lisa.","Lisa Wilson - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Thanks, Tim. As we open the call for questions, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and a follow-up. If time permits, we will re-prompt for additional questions.","With that, we will now open the call to questions. Elon?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question today is from Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good morning, team.","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Hi, Neil.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Gary, why don't you start off with your latest thinking around the wholesale segment, and just the MLP eligibility of those assets whether PLR is required, and any comments there?","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Yes. We've -- I think pretty well exhausted the work on that question. We're still waiting on a well opinion, but we've become comfortable that we do not need a PLR from the IRS now going forward. Tim, you have anything else to add to that.","Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Yeah. No. I think that's right, Neil. I think the only other comment is just that the new treasury regulations, which we've been through pretty extensively and with outside counsel all suggested that, our structure works as Gary said, with the caveat that those regulations don't go effective until January 1, 2018. But as Gary said, our comfort level is high that the structure we have contemplated is going to work in all the qualifying income for the partnership.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","That's great. Follow-up question and this is for both you, Tim and Gary, it's just thoughts on other gross margin, it's always a tricky thing to model, but any thoughts in terms of the key drivers in the quarter? And a related question is just on the sweet\/sour differential. Gary, any thoughts you have there in terms of whether this is going to be sustainably lower or to how you see that playing out over the next six months to a year?","Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Well, Neil, the \u2013 we've tried to provide a little bit more color with regard to what the impacts have been in an actual space, so I think trying to get into a forecasting or predictive mode with regard to what we're going to see on product price realizations is very difficult, depending on the markets. As we highlighted here for second quarter, big driver was non-transportation fuels in terms of the product realizations and on the crude side, again some higher crude costs than what we see in the benchmark, but I'm not sure we can give any clear guidance as to exactly what will impact that on a going-forward basis.","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Yes, I'm going to have Mike Palmer here, Neil, to talk about the sweet\/sour differential.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay.","C. Michael Palmer - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Yeah, Neil. I guess what I would say on that is obviously we've talked about this narrowing sweet\/sour differential, if you watch the LLS March spread, that it's been coming together for some months now. And I think in the short term that we would expect to see \u2013 to continue to see the sweet\/sour differential narrow. But on the other side, I think that we do believe that rebalancing is occurring already, and as that does occur, I think we are going to see more foreign sour come back into the market, which again will allow the sweet\/sour to widen.","The other thing I would say is that, if you've been watching the Canadian heavy closely, the Canadian heavy was impacted a little earlier by planned maintenance, unplanned maintenance in the fields. It was also impacted by the Syncrude plant that had a fire that reduced the amount of synthetic available for blending, and it hurt the synthetic. But as we look forward toward the end of the year, or perhaps early in 2018, there is additional heavy production coming online of the Four Hills project. So we think there will be additional heavy Canadian that will help the spreads as well. So a little longer term, we're pretty constructive on the sweet\/sour spreads.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Brad Heffern from RBC Capital Markets.","Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Good morning, everyone. Gary, I was just wondering if you could \u2013 Hi. I was just wondering if you could give a little more color on the Speedway review process, I think the original guidance was around mid-year for the results, and then it became late summer, and now it's by the end of the third quarter. Is there anything that's taking longer as part of that review process?","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Not really, Brad, in fact, I look at late summer and the third quarter has been pretty close to being equal. But anyway, this is not just a simple question on \u2013 I've had a lot of questions on the IRS, the PLR, if that's the gating item. The analysis goes much, much deeper than the IRS question and the supply agreement.","We continue to make a very good progress and very detailed analysis, but you have to have a vision where, how the company can compete and what its balance sheet would look like with further steps down the road. So we're being very methodical in our review and we believe that combined with our board strategic session in September, really will be the combination of that analysis and we'll report then.","Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thanks for that. And then, there have been some press reports talking about a potential reversal of LOOP or not necessarily a reversal but just allowing exports through LOOP. Is that something that you guys are willing to comment on and is that a meaningful EBITDA potential for MPC?","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Mike?","C. Michael Palmer - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Yeah, yes, Brad. It has got some trade press of late. And certainly, from an export standpoint, LOOP does have a unique opportunity and that there are a deepwater port, they've got plenty of storage. They have relatively low investment to allow exports to actually occur, so they are very interested in moving forward with that.","You know, MPC is the shipper, I guess the one thing that we would say is that we recognize the opportunity. The one thing that we're \u2013 that we want to watch is that again the primary responsibility of LOOP is to be an import facility and that's extremely important for us in our refineries. So while we see this opportunity, what we want to do is, we want to work with LOOP to make sure that there is no conflict between its responsibility as an import facility and one as an export facility.","Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the Paul Cheng from Barclays.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys, good morning.","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Hey, Paul.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I think, this is for both \u2013 for Tim. Tim, on a going-forward basis upon the completion of the job done and whatever you decide on Speedway, how will it impact your thinking of the balance sheet and liquidity requirement? Is that changing given altogether that you will have job close to about $2 billion of the EBITDA into the MPLX, so how that may impact one way or the other in terms of your balance sheet and liquidity thinking?","Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Well, I think both developments would be certainly important to how we think about capitalization and the amount of leverage and liquidity that the business needs to maintain. We've certainly been actively involved in the planning around what things will look like sort of pro forma for all the drops, the amount of leverage that MPC would sustain. And we've talked about, I mentioned even as part of my remarks that we really view the capital structures independently and think that the consolidated metrics become less useful, but that becomes very important as the drop-downs play out and obviously a lot of earnings move over to the partnership, which is going to be more leverage. So, there is undoubtedly consideration of what the capital structure looks like with regard to the drop themselves.","On the Speedway considerations, as Gary said, there is a multitude of considerations on not only what a spun entity looks like, what the remaining MPC would like, and it's hard to imagine that if there were some separation there that there wouldn't be some adjustment to the amount of leverage that MPC would sustain. But that is very clearly part of the overall analysis and assessment that's going on. I can't tell you exactly where we would target it, but I think it's pretty clear that the amount of leverage that the business without Speedway would be lower than what we could sustain in its current configuration.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Sure. Just wondering if there is any range of rates or any metric that you can provide preliminary?","Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Again, not at this time. I think, as Gary said, as the special committee completes its work, makes its recommendation to the Board, to the extent that it's helpful for people to understand how we thought about it, we will share any and all thoughts about what things could look like. But I don't think there is anything at this point that I think would be particularly instructive.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","The second question in on the second quarter, are we funding margin capture rate? Should we assume that is a reasonable quarter as a baseline or that has some unique circumstances that we need to adjust on a going forward basis? Because I was maybe surprised given that from the first to the second quarter, (31:05) has come down a lot. So I would have thought your margin capture rate comparing to their first quarter will improve a lot, but it doesn't seems that has been the case.","Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Yeah, Paul. Again, and I think this is comparable to the question that Neil had asked on sort of other gross margin and product price realizations. Again, also in the second quarter from \u2013 on a sequential basis we are about flat. I don't know that there's anything unique around realizations or effective capture in second quarter that we'd highlight necessarily. So at the same time, I'm not sure I want to call it a normalized quarter either. But nothing I think that we would call out specifically that is an unusual item that occurred in the second quarter that we would not expect on a run rate basis.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Chi Chow from Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Company.","Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Great. Thank you. Gary, just wondering if you had any thoughts on the situation in Venezuela and do you believe that U.S. ought to place sanctions on PDVSA, and what impact could that have on the company's crude imports or probably more importantly product export markets?","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Well, let me first ask Mike to comment on what he sees as far as the flow of crude from Venezuela and then I'll comment on the sanctions question.","C. Michael Palmer - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Yes, Chi. So, obviously the Venezuelan crude coming into the Gulf Coast is important. We participate in that; we certainly buy heavy spot cargos from Venezuela during most months. So, yeah, if that crude was no longer available because of sanctions then we would have to replace that crude from somewhere else. And while we've had no difficulty replacing the crude that we've lost, that OPEC has cut, again, as we pointed out, I mean the sour crude there's not as much coming into the Gulf as there had been prior to the OPEC cuts, so it would not be favorable.","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","And this is very hard, Chi, for us to comment on whether or not the government might put sanctions on Venezuela; I don't want to speculate on that. I'll just share that it appears to us that there's tremendous upset and turmoil in the country. We're concerned about the overall heavy supply. And when you look at the macro in the world, the global supply demand balance and the rapid retreat of inventory here from the first quarter to the second quarter, it appears as though there's going to continue to be some swings of where this crude ends up \u2013 its final destination is in the world.","So if there were sanctions by the U.S., I think clearly this crude is going to find the home in other parts of the world, and probably some other heavy crudes would make its way back into the U.S., but more than likely they would be a little more expensive in doing so. But I don't want to speculate on sanctions of Venezuela.","Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Okay. So I guess Gary what you're saying is that the maybe the heavier crude differential specifically in the U.S. would tighten further, but you still have \u2013 but that may not be the case globally outside the U.S.?","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","It may not be the case, I mean, it's taking back the last two years we saw very little heavy crude coming out of Middle East into the U.S. and some of that is changing here recently as different grades are being made available to into different parts of the world. So it's \u2013 their crude will find a home, if there is \u2013 if there are sanctions put on them, it will find a home. And I would say if there is any change in the spreads, it is probably going to be short-lived.","Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Okay. The second question here, it looks like this PAD 2 to PAD 1 product flow starting to take shape here in the Laurel Pipeline reversal is gaining some clarity, can you discuss anything regarding your volume commitment on that line and whether the company is also pursuing delivering batch product volumes on Mariner East II?","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Yes. We don't want to get in Chi into any commitments if any that we are going to make on Laurel at this time. We think it makes a tremendous sense to reverse that pipeline and to head east, but at this time we can't speak to any commitments.","Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Are you have anything specific on Mariner East II batching products as well as NGLs in that line?","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Mike Hennigan is here, let me ask Mike to \u2013 he would able to answer that on batching product?","Michael J. Hennigan - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Yeah. One of the things that energy transport did when they offered Mariner East II was to provide a suite of options as far as shippers to evaluate. The main focus has always been the NGL side of the bucket, but they have offered refined product activity as well. So that's something that we'll have to evaluate going forward as well as some of our other options.","Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. Thanks, Mike. Welcome to the board by the way.","Michael J. Hennigan - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Phil Gresh from JPMorgan.","Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, good morning. I'll start with a question on Speedway. Tim, you talked about the volumes in July, down 2%, Wondering how that would compare to the overall market, just trying to get an assessment of what we are really seeing out there. And then secondarily, very strong merchandise margins in the quarter, and wondering what drove that, and how you think about the sustainability?","Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Well, Phil, we'll have Tony answer the merchandise. Just let me say while we are down 2% here in this month, what you have to set back and look at is, Speedway and mainly the markets in which they operate, they are the leader in the market. We've had an upswing in product cost, because of the increase in food cost, therefore it's our responsibility to get that price to the market you know and they lead the market to be able to try to recover those incremental cost.","So in terms of a rapid increase in food prices, which we have seen over the last few weeks, you know, you're going to see an immediate response of the street, as we try to move that cost to the street. But you know once things equalize that volume comes back to us, because we clearly are the consumer's choice, first choice to buy our products in a normal market. But let me have Tony talk about merchandise and the merchandise margins.","Anthony R. Kenney - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Yeah, there is really a couple of things that's happening inside the store. One is, you know, we continue to focus on high growth, high margin opportunities in the store like food service, like a lot of our general merchandise categories, things that you'd buy in the cold walls. And so that definitely has a positive effect as we grow our sales we're going to be growing our merchandise margin right along with it. The other factor is that cigarettes continue to be in decline, and cigarettes carry the lowest gross margin inside of our stores. So you're getting a \u2013 we're getting a benefit also from the decline, the overall weighting in margin from the decline in cigarettes and the growth in the higher margin other items that I mentioned.","Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. Okay. Second question is just the commentary on the buyback. So I just want to clarify. So, it sounds like the buybacks that were completed in the first half of the year largely tie out with the proceeds from the dropdowns that have occurred. So as we look at the second half of the year and the timing and the amount of the dropdowns being a bit smaller and more pushed likely into early 2018 that we should see probably commensurate slowing the buybacks, really just a timing thing, but just clarify.","Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Yeah. Phil, I mean, certainly for the $1.2 billion that's been bought back so far this year, I mean you can sort of draw the line between that and the after-tax proceeds from the drop. So, I think dropdowns will continue, as it has been the case for since we spun the company, we are always looking at what the liquidity position of the company is, and again to the extent that we've got cash flow beyond the needs to support the investment and working capital and short-term needs of the business, our first inclination is to return in the form of share purchase. So share purchase will continue, they will flex and flow based on the needs of the business at the time, but you will expect to see more, and the pace will adjust as we go forward.","Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And Tim, just to clarify maybe with Paul's question. The current level of leverage around 2.0 at the parent. I mean, that that's generally your comfort level, is that correct, or would you be willing to go higher in the current state?","Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Yeah. In think in the current configuration, we're about where we think is appropriate given our desire to maintain investment grade credit profile. So we're -- it's I think we're within the ballpark of where we think an appropriate leverage should be for how we sit today.","Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","You're welcome.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Good morning, everyone and good morning, Gary.","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Doug, I've not talked to you for ages, where've you been?","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Nice to talk to you Gary. So my question is kind of going about to the post dropdown outlook for the refining business. And what I'm really thinking here is given the scale of the EBITDA drop when you're done, I have to assume that the sustaining capital for the refining business dropped somewhat as well as those obligations move to the MLP. Can you give us some idea what that change in sustaining capital is going to look like in terms of the as we think about the free cash flow coming out of refining business? And I've got a follow-up, please.","Donald C. Templin - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","So, Doug, this is Don, you're right. There will be some sustaining capital or maintenance capital that will flow to MPLX versus being in the refining business. So if you think about our forecast this year for MPLX that maintenance capital number is about $150 million, some of that is due to new acquisition, so we acquired the Ozark Pipeline that has a component, but a big proportion of that $150 million would be coming out of the refining business and going into MPLX.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","That's the number I was looking for. Thank you, Don. Gary, my follow-up, if I may and I realize this is a little sensitive given the timing but I think you've personally been pretty clear about your views on how you saw Speedway and again I apologize for this one, because it is a bit sensitive, but obviously the activist is going to reduce their position a bit as far as we can tell. It looks like maybe your review had won the day, but I'm just curious if you could give us your updated thoughts. Do you still feel that the benefits of integration of Speedway outweigh the potential benefits of separation? Again, I realize, you might be limited in what you can say, and I'll leave it there. Thanks.","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Yes, Doug. I understand your question very clearly, but I'm going to leave the answer to that to \u2013 in September, when we finish the work and we will announce to the market, we will call a meeting and announce to the market what our decision is. But it's too early to provide any direction either way. We've been very clear in all the presentations we've made, all the investor presentations that this is a very fulsome review. And when we make that decision, we don't want any investor to lean one way or the other. And I certainly am not going to provide any direction one way or the other until we finish up. As I said, we continue to meet with the special committee, they've asked us for some more work to complete that analysis. And we feel very comfortable here at late summer that we'll have that work done and we'll provide our conclusion.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I fully respect your position Gary, I understand the sensitivity. So maybe just clarify one thing for me. I think there may have been some confusion in the market on this. Are you pursuing a PLR on Speedway as well?","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Tim can handle that.","Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Yeah, Doug. We are \u2013 I mean, this is again part of the information that is important in terms of the overall assessment. So we are in the process, we've had some information request back and forth. And again that will be a component of the overall assessment, the nature of the relationship, they could be maintained between the entities and certainly an important part that we want to understand what the book ends are. So we'll continue to do that process, and the feedback learned, and garnered from that process will help to inform the view. But again, as Gary mentioned earlier, that's not the hinge points, that's an important consideration for sure, but there is multitude of factors that going to the assessment. But we are in a process to answer the question, and an active process of that, again there is we've had information sharing and request back and forth, and that will become part of the overall analysis and set made as the special committee completes its work and makes its recommendation to the full board.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Appreciate the answers, guys. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Spiro Dounis from UBS.","Spiro M. Dounis - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to ask about the product mix, specifically around gasoline, it looks like last quarter percentage of gasoline as part of the total came down a bit. Just wondering, if that's how we should model it going forward, if this is a one-time thing? And generally, as you look out to the industry, do you think other refiners are doing the same thing, which maybe explain why we're seeing some pretty good gasoline drops?","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Ray, do you have any comment on that?","Raymond L. Brooks - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Well, as far as the gasoline ratio of our production, we continue to look at the price at daily, weekly and adjust accordingly. We're configured the swing between gasoline and distillate?","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Spiro, I'd look at gasoline, I'm glad you asked the question, because I want to get this comment out. If you look at bulk light products gasoline and distillate days of supply, we are now very comfortably within the five-year average, and in both coming close to the low end of the five-year average. And if you look at it globally, the refined products globally are pretty much at the lower end of the five-year average. Whereas in crude, you've seen a tremendous drop first quarter to second quarter, 50 million-barrel drop in crude, and we expect that to continue. We have pretty good optics of where the crude market is going over the next 60 days to 90 days, and we're expecting to continue to see those inventories drop. As those inventories drop on the crude side, I think it's also going to affect the make on the refined products side. The key I think refined product to watch is the distillate days of supply.","As we come into the third quarter, the distillate days of supply last year were very high in the industry, and we are at one of the lower tranches of inventory right now, and I think that is going to bolster both distillate and should drag gasoline along with it, albeit gasoline is at pretty close to the low end of the five-year average as well. So, as Ray said, every day we make that decision every day on whether we maximize gasoline, maximize distillate. We can move in the range of about 8% has generally been our history, one product to the other, and we'll just see where inventories by region stand.","And the other thing, the question I had earlier on Venezuela and exports, the gasoline export market continues to pick up, which is helping the gasoline inventory as we export it into other regions of the world; and all those things we take into discussion when we go forward.","Spiro M. Dounis - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. And actually that segues into my next question. Just in terms of the export market, you've obviously highlighted pretty substantial export capacity in the past. But just wondering if there's any interest in maybe moving beyond the U.S. border either via retail or wholesale. Obviously, it's in the headline that some of your peers are doing that. Just if there's a first-mover advantage there, or it's just sort of fine where you're at for now?","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Yeah. Where we're positioned in our Galveston Bay refinery, it gives us a great position to be able to supply the new market that is very positive of course as the supply into Mexico. We do not have any logistics advantage to the western side of the country of Mexico, but we certainly do coming in from the Gulf side.","Yes, we are looking at should we get into the wholesale distribution, and whether or not we should even take some of our retail marks down into Mexico, we're considering that very strongly. And as we go forward right now, we think our best investment has been to export into the Gulf side of Mexico, and we've been very successful in doing that. And the margins that we've been able to pick up certainly have been a benefit to the other areas in the world where we sell our product.","Spiro M. Dounis - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. Really appreciate the color. Thanks, everyone.","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Faisel Khan from Citigroup.","Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks, good morning. Just a couple of follow-ups.","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Hey, Faisel.","Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi, Gary. On exports, can you just \u2013 I think you guys have mentioned off late, I didn't see the numbers, but in terms of gasoline and diesel, what did you do and sort of where is the primary strength in terms of the exports when you guys push that product out of the country?","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Well, Mike can answer that.","C. Michael Palmer - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Yeah. I think the number that we mentioned, Faisel, was the 313,000 barrels a day of total exports. And, yeah, we continue to see very robust demand for both gasoline and for diesel fuel. Latin America tends to be the biggest market for us; that's where the gasoline goes. Mexico, as Gary had mentioned early, Mexico has been buying a lot of gasoline. In fact, they had a refinery problem that even increased the volume that they needed to bring in. But we've also been successful in exporting diesel fuel to Europe. And many times this is on larger ships that gives them a bit of an advantage. So, yeah, the export market continues to be very robust.","Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Great. And then just on the buyback program. How much is remaining under your current buyback program and you guys have to go back to the board to re-up that number at some point in time?","Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Yeah, Faisel, we actually did and we announced in May that we had gotten additional $3 billion reauthorized from the board, so we're well over $4 billion of board authorization to do buybacks. And again, that was done, we shared this at the time that we announced it really to just enable us to execute the plan that's been laid out without need of going back to the board. So we've got all the capacity we need there.","Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Justin Jenkins from Raymond James.","Justin S. Jenkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. Thanks. Good morning, everybody. I guess maybe starting with the follow up to Brad's question on LOOP, but does adding export capability there bring any other opportunity for organic pipeline growth? And does it do anything to change the equation and all with the Capline?","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Well, LOOP, if you go south to north, that is the main artery that feeds Capline, and it makes a lot of sense long term to be able to reverse Capline and be able to take other cruise down into, down to LOOP and possibly for export down the road. I think before you look at export, if you'd ever reverse Capline, the first thing that we do, we'll supply the Eastern Gulf refineries from Capline, if you would ever reverse it, that would be the first and most important thing to us.","If you look at what LOOP is considering, basically, it's a very low investment to be able to reverse that pipeline, a few valves, and a few incremental attachments to the buoys to import hoses to be able to put export facilities on the buoys to be able to end up loaded ships. But I don't see anything at this time as far as incremental pipelines other than the possibilities someday to reverse Capline.","Justin S. Jenkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. I appreciate that, Gary. And then maybe on the capital allocation front, as my follow-up. With the dividend increase yesterday things like the plans, healthy and ratable yearly increase, but is there a scenario where some big distribution number coming back from MPLX into MPC, starting in 2018, especially, is there a scenario where we could maybe match the MPC total payout with what's received from MPLX?","Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Well, Justin, clearly, we're going to reevaluate dividend policy relative to all of the cash flows that would be available to MPC at any point in time. So I mean, upon completion of the GP economic interest sale to MPLX and the take back of units, you're looking at an LP distribution stream back in MPC that is clearly going to factor into our thinking around sustainable growth to the MPC-based dividend. So that, I think the quick answer to your question is, it is undeniably going to be part of our overall assessment and we'll take a look at that at the appropriate time.","Justin S. Jenkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Perfect, I appreciate it guys.","Operator","Thank you and we do have time for one final question. Our last question today is from Corey Goldman from Jefferies.","Corey Goldman - Jefferies LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in here, and I will keep it just a one question here. So it's kind of just a follow-up to Doug's question on Speedway. And I think last call, Gary you were talking about how the drops in the IDR exchange to MPLX were being viewed kind of as a separate matter, pertaining to a possible Speedway separation. So I was just hoping to get some color in terms of how we're finding this view in that process. And with that the insight about $1.2 billion of turnaround of maintenance expense has occurred over the trailing 12 months. So I don't know if you can comment whether or not that review is taken to consideration, just the accounting treatment and the differences between MPC and some of its peers, any commentary on that will be appreciated?","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","I'm sorry, Corey, but I don't understand your question.","Corey Goldman - Jefferies LLC","When looking at kind of a possible Speedway separation, do you view this stub refining business, if Speedway were to be separated, as inclusive or exclusive of turnaround and maintenance expense, just given how that treatment in accounting kind of throws off MPC's EBITDA versus its peers, I just don't know how that committee or you guys were viewing that.","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Well, if we were to spin-off Speedway, the RemainCo would be refining in midstream and refining would still have to have turnaround on maintenance cost and that would be definitely within the refining side of the business.","Corey Goldman - Jefferies LLC","Do you view that like the multiple of that?","Donald C. Templin - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Corey, this is Don, I mean. I think that yeah, we are primarily focused on cash flow versus sort of the accounting treatment. We believe that there are some of our competitors that capitalize cost versus we expense those cost, but at the end of the day, the analysis is being done by us by the special committee. There is a focus on the cash flow generation capability of the entities, all the entities involved in MPC and the different scenarios that Mike developed if there were a Speedway separation or other actions taken. So, I would say we are not focused sort of on a EBITDA multiple, because one EBITDA has turnaround cost on it, one does not, we're much more focused on sort of the cash flow generation, the capabilities, the leverage metrics that you'd want to maintain that type of thing.","Corey Goldman - Jefferies LLC","Well that's it, that's really helpful guys. Thanks so much.","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Thank you, Corey.","Operator","Thank you. And now, I'll turn the call back to Lisa for closing remarks.","Lisa Wilson - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Thank you for your interest in Marathon Petroleum Corporation. Should you have additional questions or would like clarification on the topics discussed this morning, Denice Myers, Doug Wendt and I will be available to take your calls. Thank you for joining us this morning. Have a great day.","Operator","Thank you. And this does conclude today's conference.

My name is Cliff, and I will be your operator today. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Pam Beall. Ms. Beall, you may begin.","Pamela K. M. Beall","All right. Thank you, Cliff, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter 2013 earnings webcast and conference call. You can find the synchronized slides that accompany the call on our website. And on the call today are Gary Heminger, President and CEO; Garry Peiffer, Executive Vice President of Corporate Planning and Investor and Government Relations; Don Templin, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Rich Bedell, our Senior Vice President of Refining; Tom Kelly, our Senior Vice President of Marketing; and Mike Palmer, our Senior Vice President of Supply, Distribution and Planning.","If you turn to Slide 2, please read the Safe Harbor statement on this slide. It is a reminder that we will be making forward-looking statements during the presentation, as well as the question-and-answer session. Actual results may differ materially from what we expect today. And factors that could cause actual results to differ are included here, as well as in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","And now, I'll turn the call over to Gary Heminger for our opening remarks.","Gary R. Heminger","Thank you, Pam, and good morning to everyone. Thanks for joining us today.","If you'd please turn to Slide 3. MPC had a strong operating quarter. At our Detroit refinery, our upgraded units ran well, and we continue to be pleased with these operations, where we were able to process additional volumes of lower-priced Canadian heavy oil.","We are also pleased with the integration process of the Galveston Bay refinery, and the plant there is operating well. Light product exports from our Garyville and Galveston Bay refineries increased significantly to 190,000 barrels per day during the second quarter of 2013, which is the highest level of exports we have achieved.","Speedway posted strong financial results, primarily due to an increase in the fuel and merchandise gross margins. In May, MPLX, the master limited partnership we formed last year, acquired an additional 5% equity interest in MPLX Pipe Line Holdings, LP. MPLX also increased its second quarter distribution 4.6%. We remain committed to positioning MPLX among the top MLPs, and we are targeting a distribution growth rate of 15% to 20% for, at least, the next several years. We will continue to pursue opportunities that support that intent.","Several developments resulted in lower earnings for our second quarter of 2013 compared to a very strong quarter we achieved a year ago. During the second quarter of 2013, the industry experienced refinery crude runs that were higher than both the last year and the 5-year average, with much of the increase in PADD III. This contributed to a drawdown of crude inventories to meet refining demand and a narrowing of crude spreads.","In addition, gasoline inventories were higher than last year and the 5-year average. As a result, the U.S. Gulf Coast market was weaker, and cracks were lower compared to the second quarter of last year. The Chicago market experienced greater-than-usual volatility during the quarter, primarily due to significant maintenance at area refineries. When the Chicago refinery -- Chicago area refineries came back online, a short supply situation in the Midwest quickly reversed into a long supply situation. Rapid movement in spot prices in the market are not always reflected immediately, as wholesale racks -- at wholesale racks or on the street.","We believe another factor impacting the market realizations was the rapid rise in the price of RINs, or renewable identification numbers. Our product price realizations, when compared to spot market values, were lower in the second quarter of this year than in the second quarter of last year.","In the meantime, we, along with the rest of the industry, are urging the EPA, the administration and members of Congress, to address this unworkable Renewable Fuel Standard to avert potentially a significant harm to consumers and the economy in both the short term and long term.","Now going forward, we expect 2013 demand to remain flat for gasoline, but up approximately 3.2% for diesel, Brent-WTI crude spreads to revert to quality and transportation cost differentials and indicators of a forward curve would suggest the spread will be in the $7 to $8 range. However, we expect continued volatility. We expect the market to fully recover the cost of compliance with the Renewable Fuel Standard in the long term.","For MPC, our ongoing commitment to returning capital to our shareholders was demonstrated by the nearly $1 billion MPC returned to its investors through dividend payments and share repurchases during the second quarter. Our confidence in the cash flow prospects of MPC's business was further underscored by the 20% increase in the regular quarterly dividend announced yesterday. Disciplined investing in MPC's business and regular return of capital to our shareholders will continue to be critical elements of our business model.","And now, I'll turn the call over to Don Templin to review the financial results for the second quarter. Don?","Donald C. Templin","Thanks, Gary. Slide 4 provides earnings and adjusted earnings data, both on an absolute and per share basis. Our second quarter 2013 adjusted earnings were $632 million compared to $867 million of adjusted earnings in the second quarter of 2012.","Adjusted earnings per diluted share were $1.95 for the second quarter of 2013 compared to $2.53 during the same period last year. The second quarter 2013 earnings included a $60 million pre-tax adjustment for cumulative pension settlement expenses resulting from the level of employee lump-sum retirement distributions occurring in 2013. The second quarter 2012 earnings included a similar $83 million pre-tax pension settlement adjustment.","The earnings lock chart on Slide 5 shows, by segment, the change in adjusted earnings from the second quarter of 2012 to the second quarter of 2013. The primary driver for the change in our adjusted earnings was the decrease in income from our Refining & Marketing segment, partially offset by an increase in income from Speedway and the Pipeline Transportation segments and lower income taxes.","As shown on Slide 6, Refining & Marketing segment income from operations was $903 million in the second quarter of 2013 compared with just over $1.3 billion in the second quarter of 2012. The change was primarily due to narrower crude oil differentials and lower product price realizations relative to benchmark neat fuels. The unfavorable earnings impacts associated with the narrowing crude oil differentials are found in the sweet\/sour, LLS to WTI and prompt versus delivered margin indicators on the slide.","Since all of these indicators utilize spot market values, any change in our actual product realizations quarter-to-quarter are reflected in the other gross margin column also shown here.","Our product price realizations compared to spot market values were lower in the second quarter of this year than in the second quarter of last year due to a number of factors, 2 of which are worth noting.","First, about 40% of our refining capacity and almost all of our purchase for resale activity is in PADD II. The Chicago refined product spot market experienced significant volatility in the second quarter of 2013, primarily due to refinery maintenance activities in the Greater Chicago area. As a result of that volatility, our actual product price realizations relative to spot market prices were lower quarter-to-quarter.","The second factor affecting our product price realizations was the impact of the increase in the price of renewable identification numbers, or RINs. When the cost of a RIN was less than $0.01 for E10 gallon, the relative impact of RINs on spot market values and on wholesale product price realizations was immaterial. Therefore, the only RINs impact we discussed previously was the financial impact of the RINs we purchased from third parties to cover our needs as an obligated party.","Our cash cost for RINs was approximately $20 million per month for the second quarter of 2013. In addition, we believe our product price realizations relative to spot market prices were also impacted by the dramatic increase in RIN prices.","During the quarter we believe that the prices of ethanol-blended fuels, exported fuels and other transportation fuels that do not trade our RIN obligation were generally lower than spot market values. We believe this occurred because non-obligated blenders and retailers could make an acceptable margin discounting to some degree the RIN value from the cost of the renewable fuel.","As you know, we utilized an LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spread that includes neat gasoline and diesel fuel spot market values for approximately 5\/6 of the product value. We believe the traditional crack spreads using neat gasoline and distillate spot market values versus the biofuel blends that are actually sold could overstate refiners' earnings due to the impact of RINs.","The increase in direct operating costs quarter-over-quarter is primarily due to the acquisition of the Galveston Bay refinery and is consistent with our guidance. The Galveston Bay refinery did contribute positive earnings during the second quarter.","On the next 2 slides, we provide earnings walks for each of our other operating segments. On Slide 7, Speedway's income from operations was $123 million in the second quarter of 2013 compared with $107 million in the second quarter of 2012. Speedway's light product gross margin was about $12 million higher in the second quarter of 2013 compared with the second quarter of 2012. The increase was primarily due to a $0.01 per gallon higher gross margin for the second quarter of 2013 compared with the second quarter of last year.","Merchandise margin was $212 million in the second quarter of 2013 compared with $203 million during the same period last year. This $9 million increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of convenience stores we operated last quarter.","On a same-store basis, gasoline sales volumes were flat in the second quarter of 2013 compared with the 2012 second quarter. Speedway's same-store merchandise sales, excluding cigarettes, increased 4.5% over the second quarter last year, which is noteworthy, considering the second quarter last year was up 10.1% from the same quarter in 2011. Speedway's average retail gasoline price during the second quarter of 2013 was nearly the same as the second quarter of last year.","Slide 8 shows changes in our Pipeline Transportation segment income. Income from operations was $58 million in the second quarter of 2013 compared with $50 million in the second quarter of 2012. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in transportation tariffs, offset by higher operating expenses and depreciation. A portion of the increase in transportation tariffs was related to the formation of MPLX. A number of items made up the unfavorable operating expense variance, the largest of which were costs now incurred by MPLX following its IPO in October 2012.","Slide 9 presents the more significant drivers of changes in our cash flow for the second quarter of 2013. At June 30, our cash balance was just over $3 billion. Operating cash flow before changes in working capital was a nearly $900 million source of cash. The working capital use of cash of almost $1.3 billion noted on the slide primarily relates to the timing of receipts and mix of crude and feedstock volumes as of the close of the second quarter of 2013. In addition, we had a decrease in the crude taxes payable due to the timing of estimated tax payments. Also, as shown on the slide, is the $882 million of cash used in the second quarter share repurchases that Gary highlighted earlier.","Slide 10 shows that, at the end of the second quarter, we had just over $3 billion of cash and approximately $3.4 billion of debt. With EBITDA of over $6.3 billion during the last 12 months, we continue to be in a very manageable debt position, with leverage of 0.5x EBITDA and a debt to total capital ratio of 22%. This strong liquidity position enables us to support our core liquidity requirements and continue our focus on capital return to shareholders.","Turning to Slide 11. During the last 12 months, we generated over $5.5 billion in cash from operations and $2.8 billion of free cash flow. Over this period, we've returned 81% of this free cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. During the 2013 second quarter, we returned nearly $1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. This exceeded the free cash flow in the quarter. We purchased approximately 11 million shares for $882 million through open market repurchases, and we continued to repurchase shares into July. In July, we repurchased approximately 3.9 million shares for about $273 million. It is our intention to continue returning capital beyond the needs of the business to our shareholders.","Slide 12 provides outlook information on key operating metrics for MPC for the third quarter of 2013. For comparative purposes, those same metrics for the third quarter of 2012 are also shown. The July market data document will be published later today on our Investor website. We will continue to work to identify market metrics that enhance visibility to MPC's earnings in light of the recent volatility in RINs, just like we did in early 2012 when we first experienced the big difference between crude oil prompt and delivered prices.","Our mission continues to be value creation for our shareholders. We are committed to pursuing opportunities to create near- and long-term value and believe the returns to our shareholders will reflect that focus. We will be balanced and disciplined in our approach to capital allocation, as we continue to assess the opportunities in front of us.","Now I'd like to turn the call back to Pam Beall.","Pamela K. M. Beall","Thanks, Don. [Operator Instructions] And with that, now, Cliff, I'd like to open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ed Westlake from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Thanks for the waterfall chart on the Refining & Marketing Q-over-Q. One question on the $313 million other gross margin. You said that include RINs, $60 million, for 2Q, leaving $250 million left over. How much -- how would you separate that between being short product in the Chicago area and having that spike? And how much do you think, if you had to guess, would be this difference between product pricing that we see on the screen versus actual product prices as you sell it out of the refinery? That would be helpful.","Garry L. Peiffer","Hello, Ed. This is Garry Peiffer. Well, as you've heard from others, it's very difficult to try to separate out the impact of -- fundamental supply and demand impacts from the RIN impact on our relative price realizations. But what Don was trying to describe in his remarks was the fact that, in addition to that $65-or-so million that we actually expended to buy RINs from third parties, there's also other effects that go on in terms of our product price realizations at the wholesale level, if you will. So we would say that the majority of that amount, the $313-or-so million, was impacted by the spike in crack spreads and product prices in the Chicago market and the effect that RINs had on our product realizations and costs in the second quarter.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And, I guess the...","Garry L. Peiffer","Compared to spot -- that's compared to spot, Ed. So we're comparing it to spot values.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And so, as that spike is unwounded in the third quarter, spot should be a bit more relevant, but RINs will still be an issue?","Garry L. Peiffer","That would be correct, assuming they stay at the high levels also.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then, the other comment, you said Galveston Bay was still profitable. Would you be able to give us a sort of a run rate of EBITDA in the third quarter -- in the second quarter as you did for the first quarter?","Gary R. Heminger","Ed, this is Gary. What we've decided, as you know, we gave you that number at the end of the first quarter. We've just operated it for 2 months. But for competitive reasons, and as you know, we have never broken our refineries out individually. We gave that because it was just after starting up Detroit and just after acquiring Galveston Bay. For separate competitive reasons, we're not going to give out the numbers individually going forward.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Would you give a Gulf versus Mid-Con split?","Gary R. Heminger","Not at this time.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Sankey from Deutsche Bank.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Gary, one of the big positives out there is the export number that you spoke about. Could you just remind us where you were in Q1? You said -- I think you said 190,000 barrels a day in Q2. Could you give us an indication firstly of the split between gasoline and distillate there; and, secondly, where that product is going and how much more you think you can grow that number?","Gary R. Heminger","Right. Yes, we had 190,000 barrels per day here in the second quarter. It's 151,000 barrels per day in the first quarter. And, Garry, do you have the breakdown of...","Garry L. Peiffer","It's primary diesel fuel, what we're exporting. Roughly, 170,000 to 190,000 was diesel fuel. And I guess, as a practical limit, I think we're pretty close to a capacity, although every time we seem to say that, our schedulers and engineers find a way to eke a little more out. But at 190,000 barrels a day, that compares to second quarter last year of 121,000. But obviously, we have Galveston Bay in there as well that's accounting for some of that difference. So roughly, that's probably our practical limit in that neighborhood of 190,000 to 200,000 barrels a day.","Gary R. Heminger","And the other thing, Paul, that we're doing is -- you've heard us talk about this before, both at Galveston -- excuse me, at Garyville where we're doing some capital expenditures in order to be able to improve on our gasoline exports. Today, you need to be able to let the gasoline settle out. And so, the way we operate today is basically online and straight through the tanks. But in order to be able to certify it and go into some foreign countries, you need to be able to settle it out. And we're investing in some incremental tankage to be able to do that. So in the future, we will be increasing our gasoline exports. And then, we're also now looking at how we can improve on the exports out of Galveston Bay. So Garry is right, from the assets, as they set today, we think we're pretty much at the peak. But we are investing in both to be able to increase that number into the future.","Garry L. Peiffer","Maybe 1 slight clarification. The 151,000 Gary referred to was fourth quarter of 2012 and first quarter of about 121,000. So we have a little bit of a dip there. But 121,000, first quarter of 2013; 151,000, fourth quarter of 2012.","Gary R. Heminger","Right. Thank you.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","In fairness to what you're saying and I know you said you don't want to break down individual refineries, but you had been running Garyville and you had permitted, I think, for it to be a much bigger refinery than it was originally nameplate, if you like. Can you talk a little bit more about where you are in terms of, firstly, Garyville, and, secondly, your overall capacity and how much you think that will grow with the CapEx that you're expending?","Gary R. Heminger","Right. And the CapEx I was speaking to, Paul, is not in the processing side, it's on the actual logistics side and how we move the barrels out of the refinery, either through pipelines or via the dock and exports. Let me ask Rich to clarify -- Rich Bedell here to clarify 1 thing. There was some discussion this week about a certain permit. And Garyville continues to run very well. And as you recall, we had ability to run incrementally 180,000 barrels per day. We now have a permit to run 290,000. That's in the new expansion we put on, and it's running very, very well. But, Rich, why don't you talk about the question we had earlier this week about the permit?","Richard D. Bedell","Yes, there was -- an article came out that said the hydrocracker expansion at Garyville was going to be completed in the third quarter of this year. It's actually going to be in the first quarter of next year. The -- it's all part of a -- it's really 4 segments to a diesel optimization project that Garyville that go in, in various phases, and 1 phase of it is in the third quarter of '13, which is going to be a crude improvement diesel recovery project there and then the hydrocrackers in the first quarter of 2014.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Cheng from Barclays.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Two quick questions, if I could. One is a simple one. What is -- Gary, based on your best guess, how much do you think is the RIN cost being passed through so far or that you guys have been able to pass through?","Garry L. Peiffer","Well, Paul, this is Garry Peiffer. As I said, it's really difficult to estimate the RIN effect versus just normal supply and demand. So I wouldn't even want at this point hazard a guess how much is actually being passed through to the consumer. However, I guess, I would add, as Don suggested, that we do believe a substantial part of that is being reflected in the spot market values that you're seeing for gasoline and diesel fuels. So we do think that the -- if you look at, kind of, what the economic additions were in the second quarter and what we would have expected the crack spreads to be in the second quarter adjusted for how the Brent and LLS prices move, plus the fact that gasoline imports were similar to past years, so that means the importers will have to acquire a RIN, we're still making money, bringing barrels to the U.S. versus their next best alternative that we still think that there is some of -- there is a substantial amount of RIN being reflected in the spot market value.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Say, along that line, Garry, can you help me understand? I'm trying to think of -- in the ethanol market, when you guys sell a refined gasoline in your billing invoice to your customer, you identified that what is the output price and then what is the ethanol in the past fuel cost in the invoice? Why can't the industry do something similarly to the RIN? Is there anything that stop you guys in doing it? Because by doing it this way, a, then we know that whether it's been possible; and, b, it will also allow a transparent way for the consumer to know that how much they're being get hit. And if you really want MPC to act to change the role to a million more realistic program, it seems like you need the consumer to speak up.","Garry L. Peiffer","Yes. We've thought about that suggestion over the last few weeks and months. And I guess, it's really going to be impacted by competitive conditions, Paul, and we obviously are not the only marketer so we'd have to consider the -- what the competition is doing. But because there's some marketers out there what we would call non-obligated marketers that Don referred to who are net sellers of RINs. And then, we have obligated parties who are buyers of RINs comminuting at the wholesale level, it's going to be very confusing for the buyer of those E10s and other biofuels to say, is there a tax added on or not a tax added on or separate line charge. So probably, if it were to be done most effectively, it would have to be done at the spot market level, but I don't think you're going to see it happen there either. So we're not optimistic that that's going to happen, unless competitive conditions dictate it does.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Can I just sneak in a real short one for Don? What is the market value of the inventory overall?","Donald C. Templin","$5.1 billion.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chi Chow from Macquarie Capital.","Chi Chow - Macquarie Research","I'm curious on, here in the third quarter, the impact of the backwardated WTI market. Could you give us some comments and maybe your outlook on what impacts this is going to have on market structure measured here in the third quarter, what percent of crudes you purchased on a CMA basis and any thoughts on the outlook on how the curve will trend going forward here the rest of the year?","C. Michael Palmer","Yes. Chi, this is Mike Palmer. It's pretty -- I think it's pretty hard to forecast the extent of that backwardation and how long it's going to last. Obviously, what that tells us about the market is that there are companies out there that believe that supply is short today, and that's the reason that the market is in this backwardated phase. As I said, again, we don't try and forecast what those numbers are going to be going out. I think that there are a number of reasons that you could point to, to say that worldwide that there has been some shortages. It's hard for us to see that in the Gulf Coast. We have no problems supplying our refineries.","Garry L. Peiffer","And, Chi, this is Garry Peiffer. On the CMA question, obviously, when you buy on a CMA basis and you're in backwardation, that otherwise increases the cost versus the calculation if you're in contango. So that would have a negative effect on the crack spread calculation if we're in backwardation. So I'd say the majority -- or most of the domestic crudes that we buy have a CMA pricing basis to them. So most of our domestic crudes are affected by that market structure in terms of what we acquire. So if they're in backwardation, that's going to be a bit of a drag versus a contango, which is a bit of a benefit.","Chi Chow - Macquarie Research","Are your Canadian barrels priced on a CMA basis as well?","C. Michael Palmer","No, they're not.","Chi Chow - Macquarie Research","No? Okay, okay. And then, secondly, can you give us some comments on the EBITDA contribution of DHOUP in the third quarter?","Gary R. Heminger","Yes. Chi, I just had that discussion. I'm sorry, you must have missed it. But what we have decided -- we did give that number after the first quarter and the same for Galveston Bay after 2 months in the first quarter. And competitively, we've decided not to give those numbers out individually going forward. I had the same question. We break them out kind of Midwest versus Gulf Coast. And at this time, we decided not to go that direction either. And as we've had discussion with many -- I should say, most of you in the past, these are very competitive numbers for us in the way we source our crude, and we just think that's the best thing for us to do going forward.","Chi Chow - Macquarie Research","Okay. That's fair. So maybe I'll try this then. We've seen some volatility on the WCS pricing and differentials. Can you talk about your outlook on how you see the Canadian heavy dips trending here going forward?","Gary R. Heminger","Right. I'll -- let me have Mike cover that. But as you know, here in the second quarter, there are several production issues on the Canadian side, different producers who had downtime, a couple of upgraders that had some downtime. So that really affected the market in the second quarter and narrowed the spreads significantly. They have since widened out and widened out quickly. And let me have Mike go over the forward curve and what he sees now.","C. Michael Palmer","Yes. I guess, what I would say is, as Gary pointed out, we did hit a patch here where there were several production issues in Canada, and it doesn't take a lot to move the differentials. But as we look out through the end of the year, we know that there is a significant additional Canadian heavy that's due to come online. The Exxon crude volume is one of the major pieces, and it's been continually pushed back. But it will be available later in the year. And that, coupled with several other projects -- we believe that the differentials are probably going to widen out a bit from the point they're at today.","Gary R. Heminger","In that same -- to that same question, let me add one more thing, Chi. As you look going into the remainder of the year, as some of our competitors possibly bring up some heavier crude units, that's also going to change the historical shipping patterns and probably some of the historical marketers some of the sweet barrels are being replaced by these heavy barrels that we think will also have a positive effect on Midwest refineries running those sweet barrels.","Operator","Our next question comes from Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","On Galveston Bay, and not asking a break-out question here, yet you've been running the unit for an entire quarter. Could you discuss what you've learned there, good or bad, and update on the pace of potential feed changes to improve profitability, primarily the pace to source more Houston or Corpus-based crudes given the current discounts and, I guess, our expectation of forward and balance in that market?","Gary R. Heminger","Let me ask Rich to talk about, as you say, the pace of play on the refinery operations itself, how he's seeing some of the changes and operating practices and safety practices that he's been able to achieve. And then, Mike Palmer will take the latter question.","Richard D. Bedell","Yes. Evan, this is Rich. Overall, we're very pleased with the Galveston Bay refinery and how it's operating. The safety record, both personal and process safety, has been excellent there for the 6 months we've been running it, and we've been working to incorporate our standards and our operating philosophies in the plant, and they've been very well received by the workforce. So overall, the direction of the refinery, we're very pleased with it in the short time that we've had it. I think Mike can comment a little bit about the crude changes.","C. Michael Palmer","Yes, sure will. Evan, we've made some pretty substantial changes already when we -- and of course, a lot of that is the fact that we're optimizing this plant every day. But the pipeline infrastructure continues to be built out. So what we've been able to do up to this point is pretty much displace the foreign sweet crude that have been coming into the plant with the domestic crudes that you had mentioned. I mean, we're running more West Texas sour, Eagle Ford, those types of domestic crudes. And frankly, we -- what we did was we look at the markets every day to optimize those slates. So it's not to say we won't run the foreign cargo crude, but we're always looking for the best barrels. We think, going forward, domestic is where it's at.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Great. If I -- a second question, if I could. I know we've discussed -- but PADD II gasoline imports have tapered since 2010 from all regions with some uptick recently into driving season. And as you look forward primarily in the first quarter when that market is more balanced due to seasonal demand, could you update us how you see the potential to move more product out of region and potentially into the East Coast?","Gary R. Heminger","Well, Evan, we don't want to get into our detailed strategy on how we're going to move products out, but you are correct. And if you go back in history, the PADD II certainly imported more from PADD III and some from PADD I historically. And due to the significant increase in run rates by PADD II refiners, that has negated the need to import as much. But certainly, we are looking at how and probably more so on the diesel side than the gasoline side and diesel side in the shorter quarters on how you balance things. But I'm sorry, we can't get into our individual strategy of how we're going to move our product into additional regions.","Operator","Our next question comes from Blake Fernandez from Howard Weil.","Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","I had a question for you on Capline. I'm not sure how specific you can be, but there's been a lot of chatter that some of the strength we've seen in LLS pricing recently has been attributable to increased flows on Capline, basically the feed via BP\/Whiting ramp-up. And I was just curious if you could provide any color there.","Gary R. Heminger","Yes. I don't know, Blake, that we can provide you any information on what any competitors are doing. I think, overall, again, what we do is we look at LLS or other crudes that we might move up Capline relative to other alternative crudes that we can run. I don't think that we've seen major changes -- major shifts on Capline over the past couple of quarters.","Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, okay. The other question for you is a bit of a one-off, but it's on the chemicals side. Some of your peers are obviously evaluating some opportunities to use existing infrastructure and enter the chemicals business. And I didn't know if you've looked at that or if any of your facilities may have some opportunities there.","Gary R. Heminger","Right. Let me have Rich take that. This isn't the chemicals side but just to refresh that we have talked about a couple of splitters, 1 in Canton, 1 in Catlettsburg as a way to be able to utilize the feedstock that doesn't get into the chemicals side of the business. But that is something that we certainly have ongoing. But Rich will cover some of the chemicals as -- because we're -- also just took over a big chemical operation. About 1\/3 of the output of Galveston Bay is really on the chemicals side. So, Rich?","Richard D. Bedell","Yes. I mean -- and we continue to look for opportunities to where to invest. But our focus lately has really been on the condensate splitters, to take advantage in the Utica, moving more of the light crudes through our system and then optimizing in Galveston Bay and its aromatics picture there. So if you're talking about -- referring to Valero's methanol plant, no, we're not looking at anything in regard to a methanol plant.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Dietert from Simmons.","Jeffrey A. Dietert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","A question for Mike, and this would be a bit of a follow-up, I think on Evan's question, but it looks like your WTI-based feedstocks have been declining in recent quarters and other sweets have been increasing. I suspect a lot of that is the integration of the Galveston Bay refinery. But are there other factors impacting those shifts and how do you expect that to go going forward?","C. Michael Palmer","Yes. Jeff, I guess, what I would say is, if you look at the chart that we published in the second quarter, the percentage of the WTI-based crudes remained about the same. It has gone down from previous quarters, and I think that was a result of bringing Galveston Bay on that didn't have access to as much WTI-based crude. But the interesting thing about the second quarter is that we actually ran a higher crude rate. So in order to maintain that 22% level, we actually did increase the volume of the WTI-based crudes that went into the system. The other thing I think you'll find -- I think the other thing you'll find of interest on that chart is that the other sour crude went down, whereas the sweet crude did go up. And that's pretty much just a result of, I guess, the story that we've been telling you guys, and that is that the sweet crudes are getting more attractive as -- through time, as they continue to grow. And we've been very much focused on the crudes from North Dakota or the Eagle Ford.","Jeffrey A. Dietert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Very well. Mike, you guys have a good view into -- about the Gulf Coast and the Mid-Con and crude markets. Could you talk to us about what you expect the WTI-Brent differentials to look like through the second half of this year and what 2014 average might look like?","C. Michael Palmer","I guess, Jeff, the way I'd answer that is just to say that, if you go back and take a look at the second quarter, we began the second quarter with a Brent-TI spread around $12.5, and it moved out to around $4.5. By the end, it changed about $8. We then moved to flat. And after it was at flat, it moved to about $3.80 again. And now, it's in another dollar. So the one thing I would say to you is that it's going to remain extremely volatile, and that's the only thing we know with certainty. I think that, as Gary said earlier, when we think about the ARB, really, what we think about is that you've got a transportation cost to get those barrels from Cushing to the Eastern Gulf, where they need to go to clear. And so, when we look at the forward curve and see that it's around that $7 or $8 level, that makes some sense to us. But at the same time, we know that there is a lot of emphasis on these spreads and there's going to be a lot of trading activity. So the pendulum will move back-and-forth. There's going to be a lot of volatility.","Gary R. Heminger","And, Jeff, that's why I made my comment earlier that you're going to see possibly a big swing later in the year, as some other refiners possibly bring up heavier crude units. That's going to put more light sweet crude back on the market in different regions of the country. And I think it's going to change some pressure points and also lead to that widening out that we're talking -- that Mike was just talking about and I spoke about earlier.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Kessler from Tudor, Pickering, Holt.","Robert A. Kessler - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to push a point that you made earlier on light crude supply tightness. You said that globally, at least, there are some signs of shortages, but you, of course, had no problem sourcing your crude in the U.S. Gulf Coast. And I just wanted to push that point a little bit. Obviously, if we look at LLS and it's at a premium of Brent. So on that benchmark, that would imply the Gulf Coast is actually tighter than Brent or has been in recent history. That's, of course, if you believe LLS is representative of the coastal delivered price, and I think we generally don't. But that's really my question is what does your average coastal delivered price look like relative to LLS, particularly with Galveston Bay?","C. Michael Palmer","Well, I think, again, when you look at LLS, it's not a huge stream today. And on the margin, obviously, it couldn't command a premium to Brent that wouldn't be happening today. But I guess, again, as I tend to look forward and we think that the light sweet crude coming from, again, the Permian Basin or the Eagle Ford, perhaps even North Dakota continuing to move south, we just believe that, that LLS differential can't last, that it will turn into a discount at some point. Exactly when that happens is very difficult to understand.","Robert A. Kessler - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","What would you say you're getting for delivered price in Houston today relative to LLS?","C. Michael Palmer","Well, I guess, we just don't get into that kind of a detail. We probably can't answer that question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason Smith from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jason Smith - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","It's Jason on for Doug. Just come back to Galveston Bay again. I know we've spent some time on the crude slate. I mean, now that you've had a few months at the plant, have you found any incremental opportunities maybe with the existing Texas City refinery nearby?","Gary R. Heminger","Rich?","Richard D. Bedell","Yes, we have -- we found a number of synergies between the 2 plants in moving feedstocks and optimizing the operations between the 2. And we have projects that we're looking at to further increase that.","Jason Smith - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And should we maybe expect a synergy update at the Analyst Day later this year?","Gary R. Heminger","Yes, it's one of our plans, Jason, to be able to give you a little more color around Galveston Bay. We'll have many more months of operation at that time, but we'll give you more color then.","Jason Smith - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got you. And on the Garyville hydrocracker, is there any chance you'd be willing to share a cost and potential EBITDA estimate there?","Gary R. Heminger","We do not -- this is a revamp. This is not a brand-new hydrocracker. It's a revamp of our big plant that we put on because we could see some low-hanging fruit. And, Rich, do you have any more color?","Richard D. Bedell","Well, I mean, at our first Analyst Meeting in New York, we did give some guidance around that. And it's basically 4 different projects that, at that time, we said it was about $250 million over 4 years. And the EBITDA based on 2011 prices was $160 million is what we told you all.","Operator","Our final question comes from Roger Read from Wells Fargo.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","The question I had is maybe fairly straightforward, but I noticed the yield to gasoline lower in this quarter. I'm presuming at Galveston Bay its different product output. But is there anything else going on? I mean, is this a function of cracks in the market, RINs cost, anything like that that's taken it down from the low 50s to the upper 40% of gasoline blend stocks yields?","Gary R. Heminger","No, I think it all has to be due to Galveston Bay coming on. As I said, approximately 1\/3 of their output is on the chemicals side. So that would account for the majority. Then you'll have a little maintenance in different plants here and there. So that could be maybe less than 1% as you take refineries down for maintenance. It just depends on which unit, but the most should be GBR.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And the only other question I had, with the Ho-Ho line expected to be shut down here at the end of this month, I believe, for the reversal later this year, any thoughts on the impact that will have on pricing of crudes out of the Gulf of Mexico or LLS in terms of the very near term and anything you can provide in terms of thoughts on that?","C. Michael Palmer","Yes. This is Mike Palmer. I guess, it's bound to have some impact, although a part of that line is already down. So I wouldn't think that, that's -- I wouldn't think there would be anything that would be dramatic.","Operator","I'd like to turn the call back over to Pam for closing remarks.","Pamela K. M. Beall","Okay. Well, thank you, Cliff. Thanks, everyone, for joining us on the call today, and we'll be in the office for the rest of the day. So you can call and ask for myself, Beth Hunter and Jerry Ewing [ph], who's new to -- a recent addition to our team. So thanks, everybody, for your interest. Bye-bye.","Operator","Thank you.

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Lisa Wilson, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Lisa Wilson - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Good morning, and welcome to Marathon Petroleum's third quarter 2016 earnings webcast and conference call. The slides that accompany this call can be found on our website at marathonpetroleum.com under the Investor Center tab. On the call today are Gary Heminger, Chairman, President and CEO; Tim Griffith, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and other members of our MPC executive team. We invite you to read the Safe Harbor statements on slide two. It's a reminder that we will be making forward-looking statements during the call and during the question-and-answer session. Actual results may differ materially from what we expect today. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included there as well as in our filings with the SEC. Now I will turn the call over to Gary Heminger for opening remarks and highlights.","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Thanks, Lisa, and good morning to everyone. If you please turn to slide three. We issued two press releases earlier today: our third quarter earnings announcement and a strategic plan to enhance shareholder value. Driving long-term value for our shareholders is a top priority. Despite the steps we have taken to create value for investors, we believe that MPC's share price reflects a significant discount to the intrinsic value of our business, particularly as it relates to the valuation described for our general and limited partner ownership interests in MPLX and to the midstream assets we hold directly.","First, we announced an aggressive dropdown strategy. By the end of 2017, we plan to offer to MPLX assets contributing a total of approximately $350 million of annual EBITDA with the first dropdown of assets contributing $235 million of annual EBITDA expected to occur by the end of the first quarter. The partnership's plans for funding these drops would likely include transactions with MPC including the potential for substantial amount of equity to MPC. We also intend to execute on additional value-enhancing dropdowns totaling an estimated $1 billion of annual EBITDA as soon as practical within the next three years.","As a reminder, we are still awaiting tax clearance on a substantial portion of this dropdown portfolio which includes the revised treasury qualifying income regulations and a subsequent PLR for our fuels distribution business. Nonetheless, we are moving forward aggressively with other portions of the MLP eligible earnings available within MPC. This aggressive dropdown strategy is expected to support increased limited and general partner distributions from MPLX and provide value creation for investors. These transactions are subject to market and other conditions, as well as requisite approvals.","In addition, we are evaluating strategic opportunities to highlight and capture the value of our general partner ownership interest in MPLX and optimize the cost of capital for the partnership. We have retained independent financial advisors to assist with this evaluation. We will be evaluating a number of alternatives aimed at highlighting the value inherent in the general partner and will provide additional detail to investors once we have determined the path providing the greatest opportunity to capture this value.","Finally, in connection with these strategic actions to unlock value from our midstream assets, we plan to evaluate changes to our internal financial reporting largely focused on the assets and earnings associated with our future dropdown strategy that are currently reported in our refining and marketing segment. Our review is likely to result in changes to our segment reporting beginning in 2017. These initiatives are designed to unlock additional value from our robust portfolio of midstream assets and to further benefit from the value-enhancing platform we have established with MPLX.","We will continue to analyze our businesses and portfolio to ensure we continue to deliver superior performance and returns consistent with our track record of maximizing shareholder value over the long-term. We will be moving ahead expeditiously on each of these actions and look forward to communicating with our shareholders as we execute our strategic plan.","That said, let me turn back to our results for the third quarter. In our earnings release this morning, we reported third quarter earnings of $145 million or $0.27 per diluted share. Earnings include a $0.31 per diluted share charge related to the impairment of our investment in the Sandpiper Pipeline project, due to the withdrawal of regulatory applications for the project. The lower earnings this quarter were due in part to lower crack spreads and compressed project price realizations in the refining and marketing segment. Despite a challenging quarter, we remain optimistic as we move forward into 2017, given signs with a market rebalancing and sustain strong demand. The combination of our niche inland refineries and large Gulf Coast refineries provide competitive advantages, including optimization potential and export excess. We continue to recognize benefits from the diversified nature of our business as the Speedway and midstream segments contributed more than $450 million of combined segment income in the third quarter. Speedway delivered strong light product sales volume and record merchandise margin dollars. The higher merchandise margin is consistent with its strategy to realize marketing enhancement opportunities. Having a strong retail business as Speedway is a valuable differentiator for MPC.","Our integrated structure provides growing stable cash flows across market cycles, enabling us to return capital to shareholders while reinvesting in value enhancing growth initiatives. The stable cash flow also helps us maintain our investment-grade credit profile.","The midstream segment, which includes MPLX, delivered solid results supported by increases in gathering, processing and fractionation volumes. MPLX continues to drive exceptional growth opportunities, supporting a diverse set of producer customers in some of the nation's most prolific shale plays and positioning it well to benefit from a rising commodity price environment. Additionally, in October, MPLX commenced operations of the Cornerstone Pipeline on schedule and under budget.","We believe we're highly integrated and coordinated business model comprised of refining and marketing, midstream and Speedway along with a strategic plan announced today will enhance shareholder value and position MPC for future growth and continued attractive returns to investors.","With that, let me turn the call over to Tim to walk you through the financial results for the third quarter. Tim?","Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Thanks, Gary. Slide four provides earnings on both an absolute and per share basis. MPC's third quarter 2016 earnings of $145 million or $0.27 per diluted share were down from last year's third quarter earnings of $948 million or $1.76 per diluted share.","As Gary mentioned, third quarter 2016 results include a $267 million or $0.31 per diluted share impact from the impairment of our investment in the Sandpiper Pipeline project.","The chart on slide five shows by segment the changes in earnings from the third quarter of last year. The $803 million net decrease in earnings was primarily due to lower income from our refining and marketing segment.","In addition, we had higher impairment expense during the quarter as well as higher interest expense resulting from the debt assumed as part of the MarkWest merger. These negative impacts for the quarter were partially offset by lower income taxes and higher income contributed by our midstream segment.","Turning to slide six, our refining and marketing segment reported income from operations of $306 million in the third quarter of 2016 compared with $1.4 billion in the same quarter last year. The decrease was primarily due to weaker crack spreads in both the Gulf Coast and Chicago and less favorable product price realizations compared to the LLS-based crack spread.","The lower blended crack spread had a negative impact on earnings of approximately $711 million. The blended crack spread was $4.10 per barrel lower at $8.08 per barrel in the third quarter compared to $12.18 per barrel for the same period last year.","There were four primary contributors to the $463 million unfavorable other gross margin variants in this WACC. First, we experienced narrower gasoline and diesel price realizations versus reported market metric LLS-based crack spread in the third quarter of 2016 compared to the same quarter last year.","Second, our price realizations were negatively impacted by less favorable margins on non-transportation products, which includes asphalt. Asphalt realizations were exceptionally strong in the third quarter 2015 and have not increased at the same rate as the rise in the price of crude.","Third, as I mentioned we experienced weaker crack spreads during the quarter. At the same time our outright RIN purchase cost more than doubled when compared to third quarter of 2015. Our cost to purchase RINs to comply with the RFS standards was $80 million this quarter.","Finally, refinery volumetric gains also continued to be lower this quarter due to the lower commodity price environment we're in. R&M segment income benefited $79 million by an approximately $0.40 per barrel widening of the sweet\/sour differential, as well as higher sour runs in the quarter versus same quarter last year.","The LLS, WTI differential narrowed by $2.14 per barrel from $3.72 per barrel in the third quarter of 2015 to $1.58 per barrel in this third quarter. This had a negative impact on earnings of about $69 million based on the WTI-linked crudes in our slate.","The market structure, or contango effect during the quarter is reflected in the $32 million favorable variance on the WACC and relates to the difference between the prompt crude prices we used for market metrics and the actual crude acquisition costs in the quarter.","The $35 million year-over-year increase in direct operating costs relate primarily to higher turnaround activity in the quarter versus last year. Turnaround in major maintenance costs increased $0.25 per barrel or over $46 million compared to the third quarter of 2015.","Moving to our other segments, slide seven provides the Speedway segment earnings WACC compared to the same quarter last year. Speedway's income was down $34 million compared to the third quarter 2016, primarily driven by lower light product margins.","Gasoline and distillate margins were $0.177 per gallon in the third quarter of 2016, which was $0.037 lower than the third quarter of 2015, which was a period of very strong margins. On a sequential basis, light product margin was $0.022 per gallon higher than second quarter 2016. Partially offsetting lower fuel margins were higher gasoline and distillate sales volumes and higher merchandise margins. Gasoline and distillate sales volumes were up 20 million gallons over the same quarter last year. On a same-store basis, gasoline volumes decreased 0.6% over the same period last year.","Our focus continues to be on optimizing total gasoline contributions between volume and margin to ensure fuel margins remain adequate. Increase in merchandise sales continue to be a focus, the results of which can be seen in the $28 million increase in Speedway's merchandise gross margin compared to the third quarter of 2015. Merchandise margins increased due to higher overall merchandise sales, as well as higher margins realized on those sales.","Merchandise sales in the quarter, excluding cigarettes, increased 4% on a same-store year-over-year basis. In October, we've seen a decrease in gasoline demand with approximately 4% decrease in same-store gasoline sales volumes compared to last October. The decrease we expect to be temporary and largely reflects the impacts of Hurricane Matthew at approximately 500 Speedway locations.","Slide eight provides the changes in the midstream segment income versus the third quarter last year. The $165 million increase quarter-over-quarter was primarily due to the combination with MarkWest at the end of last year, which contributed $121 million of incremental segment income to the quarter. The remaining increase of $44 million was primarily due to an increase in income from our equity affiliates and lower operating expenses versus third quarter last year.","Slide nine presents the significant elements of changes in our consolidated cash position for the third quarter. Cash at the end of the quarter was just over $700 million. Core operating cash flow was a $1.1 billion source of cash. The $666 million use of working capital noted on the slide primarily relates to a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and an increase in crude and refined product inventory levels during the quarter.","The decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities was primarily due to the lower crude prices and volumes as well as timing of tax payments. Given the weaker refining margins we've seen this year, we took the opportunity to selectively prepay some of our debt during the quarter, which is reflected in the $516 million of net debt cash outflow shown in the WACC.","MPLX opportunistically issued equity through its ATM program during the quarter, with net proceeds of $184 million as shown on the WACC. Return of capital during the quarter included share repurchases of $51 million and dividends of $190 million. During the third quarter, we increased our dividend 12.5% or $0.36 per share. We've increased our dividend six times since becoming a standalone company five years ago, resulting in a 28% compound annual growth rate on the dividend. Our continued focus on growing regular quarterly dividends demonstrates our ongoing strategy to share in the success of the business with our shareholders and this dividend increase just reaffirms that strategy.","Slide 10 provides an overview of our capitalization and financial profile at the end of the quarter. We had $10.6 billion of total consolidated debt, including $4.4 billion of debt at MPLX. Total debt-to-book capitalization was about 34% and represented 2.3 times last 12 months pro forma adjusted EBITDA on a consolidated basis or about 1.8 times if we exclude MPLX.","We're showing the metric without MPLX, since the debt is non-recourse MPC, and MPLX will maintain a capital structure, which uses relatively higher leverage. Making consolidated debt-to-EBITDA increasingly less useful, given the size and continued growth of the partnership.","Slide 11 provides updated outlook information on key operating metrics for MPC for the fourth quarter of 2016. We're expecting fourth quarter throughput volumes to be down slightly compared to the fourth quarter of 2015, due to more planned maintenance in the quarter.","Total direct operating costs are expected to be $8.05 per barrel on total throughput of 1.83 million barrels per day. Beginning this quarter we're also providing our estimated percentage of sour crude throughput, which we expect to be 58% in the fourth quarter, due to the continued sour crude advantage. Our projected fourth quarter corporate and other unallocated items are estimated $75 million.","With that let me turn the call back over to Lisa. Lisa?","Lisa Wilson - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Thanks, Tim. As we open the call for your questions, as a courtesy to all participants, we ask that you limit yourself to one question plus a follow-up. If time permits, we will re-prompt for additional questions.","With that, we will now open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, good morning, everyone. How are you?","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Good morning, Neil. How are you?","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks, Gary. So, Gary, can you provide some early flavor as it relates to some of the strategic changes that you talked about, dropdowns, the GP structure, and some of the accounting changes? And then, talk about how retail fits into it, if at all?","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Sure, Neil. As we \u2013 in our separate release this morning and we've been working on this for quite some time on. We spent the early part of the year in the transition to get MarkWest into the fold and to really get our businesses lined out.","And then really focused on what is the proper growth strategy and how do we \u2013 we have tremendous portfolio of assets that can be considered over time to be dropdown, and we felt that it was the best to get into a very aggressive, strong rhythm on how to dropdown the assets that we have, and it's not just a dropdown strategy, Neil, we expect to be acquisitive in certain markets where it makes sense for the midstream, as well as we have a very good organic suite of projects to work on.","But as we step back and looked at our total midstream business, we felt that now is the time to take this a very bold aggressive action and then we've also stated not just the dropdowns for 2017 of approximately $350 million, but we've also then are talking about the future dropdown strategy of the approximate $1 billion of other assets.","Let me be specific through about that $1 billion of other assets, as you know, Neil, you and I talked about this many times. We have a significant portion of those assets under the fuels distribution piece that we have a private letter ruling request into the IRS.","So we have to be careful and make sure we don't have any potential tax liability of dropping those down sooner than we would believe we have approval from the IRS. One of the \u2013 an additional thing that we highlighted, the value of the general partner interest, let me have Tim talk about some of the actions and the aspects that we would have around looking at the general partner interest.","Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Yeah, Neil, we've \u2013 as we sort of outlined, I think the key for us is that we have \u2013 we've seen pretty clearly that the value of the GP is not being fully recognized in the value of MPC. So I think we want to take a careful but aggressive look at exactly ways that we can highlight that value, capture it and optimize the cost of capital for the partnership.","So again, I'd say that we really want to look at everything. There's no preconceived notion or conclusions as to where ultimately this may lead us. Again with that objective of highlighting that value and optimizing the cost of capital for the partnership, it could include things like a buy-in of the IDRs at the partnership level, a public sale of some portion of the GP, other alternatives around restructuring the GP interests.","Again, we want to make sure that we're going to look at everything and make sure that we understand what might be the best path to really have that value better reflected in the overall valuation of MPC.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yeah, I appreciate.","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","And Neil...","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yeah, sorry, go ahead.","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Yeah, and Neil, to your question on Speedway. We've talked many times about Speedway as well and you and other sell-side analysts have discussed this on how important Speedway is along with the midstream in trying to balance our cash flow across all cycles and we really believe that significant portion of the discount in our share price today really is reflected in the midstream space and Speedway is not the catalyst or the driver.","Speedway has continued to perform very, very well, as indicated again in the performance for this quarter. So we look at the integration value. We look at kind of the dis-synergy if we were to do something different with Speedway, and we still believe that it has a very strong fit in our system.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I appreciate those comments, and Gary, my follow-up here is that you cited four reasons that other gross margins were under pressure nearer (22:31) gasoline and diesel, the non-transportation products, RINs, and I believe volumetric gains. How much of that is at third quarter phenomenon here as opposed to a recurring point. And I guess the reason I'm going here is that when I think about MPC's portfolio, historically you guys have outperformed your indicator margins by taking advantage of the logistics and the infrastructure advantages that you guys have. I want to make sure that's going to be a recurring advantage for MPC on a go forward basis.","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Neil, you're spot on there with the outcome. Let's go back and look at the third quarter of 2016 versus the third quarter of 2015. Third quarter of 2015 had a rapid drop in the price of crude, and when you have that you're able to retain margins in all aspects of our business and all the way through asphalt. Asphalt was one of the major contributors to our third quarter last year.","This year, when we started to see a steady climate in crude prices and with some of the problems that you had in the third quarter, you go back and look at Colonial, while sometimes a dislocation in markets such as \u2013 happened with Colonial, sometimes you recognize different pockets of the country and we're able to capture some of that value through the logistics arm that we have. That did not happen with that downturn and in fact it backed product back into the Gulf Coast and in fact backed product for the West.","On top of that, we spent a lot of incremental money in order to be able to service our customers and keep our customers full during that period of time. So that was the phenomenon. But it really \u2013 Tim mentioned the gas and diesel prices, the price realization, but it really got into the bottom components and asphalt was a big marker that we saw as well. So I would say those are the big things. I would say they're non \u2013 expect them to be nonrecurring.","Kind of a follow on to that here, early in the fourth quarter, with Hurricane Matthew, that had an upset across the entire Gulf Coast and some don't think about the tropical storm Hermine that hit in the third quarter, that had an effect as well. When you lose that volume from these top tropical storms, it's gone. So you all those affects \u2013 but all those things affected the third quarter and some into the fourth quarter. But I would expect that they would be nonrecurring.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Appreciate the comments. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Yeah. Good morning and congratulations on the more aggressive strategy. I guess, in MPLX debt to pro-forma adjusted EBITDA I think it was 3.5 times at September 30. So when you think from the MPC perspective of the cash versus units debate, or maybe just give some color as to what sort of expectation of how much cash you could get from these drops over the next year and then maybe next three years.","Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Sure Ed. It's Tim. This is something that I think we're going to sort of carefully evaluate. I mean, the drops that we've talked about here and contemplated are certainly bigger than we've done in the past but I think we'll always be mindful of what the market capacity is to absorb new units. I think we would certainly want to take advantage of opportunities that exist, but clearly would not want to overwhelm the market with the number of units. So what we will \u2013 we'll assess as we go forward and make sure that we're being smart about it. I think the \u2013 from the overall enterprise perspective, we have a tremendous amount of flexibility here to take back units where we need to and we'll access the market in an opportunistic way as we go forward.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","And then you've just had this new 707 tax rule, which reduces the amount of debt that you can use in basis for dropdowns, so I don't it maybe still early, but have you got any idea in terms of what tax leakage you would expect at the MPC level in terms of the drops or the impact that that ruling has?","Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Yeah, well. Obviously doing things as tax efficiently as possible will always be a primary focus. I mean the changes to the 707 regs to be honest, Ed, don't have a massive impact on our strategy, utilizing sort of debt-financed distributions back would not have been part of our normal mode with regard to the drops anyway. And frankly even before the 707 regs, a more aggressive tack that the IRS have sort of been targeting and obviously the change in regs is a \u2013 it sort of demonstrates that that's where that focus has been.","So I don't think from our perspective, we view the change in the regs under the sky sale as substantially impactful to our strategy. But again, even the notion of taking back units and identifying assets with the greatest amount of basis, to shield as much tax as possible will be an important consideration as we evaluate which and what timing we'll undertake for the drop portfolio.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay, and then if I could sneak a quick one in, the cash flow was the full working capital at $1.07 billion, but your earnings collapsed. I mean obviously there's the impairment, but even adjusting for that. So any color as to why cash generation is diverging from earnings would be helpful.","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Ed, there's nothing specific in it. I'd say the \u2013 we had certainly some working capital impacts from the quarter that again really build on \u2013 based on some changes in prices and some inventory build in the quarter. And that was a relatively big use of working capital in the quarter. That's probably the biggest item of potential divergence that we'd highlight.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay, thanks.","Operator","And our next question comes from Chi Chow from Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Please go ahead.","Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Great, thanks. Good morning. Gary, can you talk about the specific assets you're targeting for the 2017 drops?","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Yeah. So, let me ask Don to cover that. Don's been doing most of the work on this.","Donald C. Templin - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Yeah, Chi. We would expect that particularly the first drop that we're targeting, those assets would be predominantly pipeline and terminal assets, so very, very traditional midstream assets that we currently own. And then later in the year, we also have some joint interest pipelines and others. So, it'll be in that vein of assets: typical, straight down the fairway, midstream assets that'll be moving from MPC to MPLX.","Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. And can you comment at all on what sort of multiple range you're targeting for the drops?","Donald C. Templin - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","I guess we're not targeting a specific multiple range. I think it'll be a fact and circumstance driven function based upon making sure that the drops are appropriately accretive for MPLX. One of the really important things about these drops was that, we wanted to \u2013 we don't believe that our yield is as low as we would like it to be at MPLX. And we are trying to take actions to lower that yield or lower our cost of capital. So, driving a distribution growth rate that is 12% to 15% and double digit in out years is important to us and having a valuation or multiple on the drop that makes sense to support that is, I think is in the best interest of both MPC and MPLX.","Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. Thanks, Don. And then one other question, can you comment on Marathon's interest in utilizing the reversal of the Laurel Pipeline once that becomes operational? And what are the opportunities this might open up for you down the road?","C. Michael Palmer - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Yeah, Chi, this is Mike Palmer. I can answer that for you.","Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Hi.","C. Michael Palmer - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Yeah, hi, Chi. Obviously, when you look at the Midwest, we have a lot of refining capacity, and in the wintertime when gasoline demand goes down, certainly we have gasoline and distillate that needs to seek new markets.","So you know we've been looking at a number of opportunities, but the reversing Laurel, such that Pittsburgh becomes primarily a pipeline supplied from the Midwest market is certainly big for us and we would participate in that.","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","And Chi, we've been saying for some time, in fact I think Marathon was one of the catalysts of this idea, that it really makes sense to go West to East and starting to supply the PAD 1 market and it further balances all of PAD 2. So, we won't get specific yet into how many barrels we might move. I just say that this open season that has been just completed is going to be a big event for the entire PAD 2 industry because it has another outlet for us to balance the Midwest.","Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Yeah, I agree. And do you see enough demand from PAD 2 to eventually force the reversal all the way back to Philadelphia?","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","I really believe long-term. And I've talked about this long-term that this is a \u2013 it's something that needs to happen, and is a big strategic move. So first I think we're looking to Altoona Mike (32:44), but yes, eventually I would see it going all the way to the East Coast.","Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Yeah. Okay, great. Thanks Gary. Appreciate it.","Operator","And our next question comes from Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America \/ Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Good morning Gary.","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Doug, how are you?","Doug Leggate - Bank of America \/ Merrill Lynch","Good, thank you. I \u2013 hopefully, we're going to see you in a couple weeks. I'm looking forward to that. The decision to take or the potential to take MPLX units in lieu of cash, obviously the quantity of the balance hasn't been determined yet, but what would that mean for your subsequent monetization of those units as it relates to your buyback strategy for MPC?","Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Doug, its Tim. Obviously that \u2013 if we did take back units, the percentage and number of units that MPC holds become substantial. And I think the things like potential sale of those units is something we'll evaluate over time. I mean again, wanting to make sure that anything that we do around that is tax efficient and we can minimize the amount of leakage around it. Again I think that our focus is much more around the total value getting realized within the system as opposed to the net cash, but I think we'll look at if there are efficient ways for us to potentially look at those units over time.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America \/ Merrill Lynch","I guess, just for clarification on my question, so if you took MPLX units, would you expect your buyback pace to moderate?","Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Well, again, the dropdown itself is not predicated on producing a huge amount of cash for a buyback necessarily. I mean the buybacks will always be a function of the cash that's being generated on an operating basis and potentially some from what gets dropped, so again, we'll evaluate as we go forward, and as we said, I mean, even if there are a number of units taken back, there's probably still a fair amount of debt that gets undertaken at the MPLX level on those assets. So I think the cash opportunity around it is beyond just the equity units themselves.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America \/ Merrill Lynch","Okay.","Donald C. Templin - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Yeah, I think you know Doug \u2013 Doug, this is Don. In 2016, one of the things that we were doing at MPLX was we had a leverage ratio that was non-investment grade in our view. And so, we committed to taking that leverage down and now we are in the zone that we want to be with respect to our leverage and to supporting an investment grade credit profile.","So we would likely be thinking about funding future growth. Whether it is organic growth or whether it is dropdowns with a more sort of balanced 50-50 debt and equity type of arrangement. So, I think, hopefully that answers some of your question as well.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America \/ Merrill Lynch","Okay. That's helpful, Don. I guess my follow-up is probably also for you, Don, because the more traditional nature of the assets you know pipelines, terminals and so on, accelerating the dropdowns obviously means accelerating the increase in the refining cost basis. Can you quantify what that would look like based on the plan you have? In other words, how much would you expect the cost basis for refining to go up as you monetize these assets? And I'll leave it there. Thanks.","Donald C. Templin - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Yeah, I guess, I am not sure from the MPLX perspective. I mean, what we're trying to do is to build an EBITDA portfolio so that you know, we can continue to support that high growth rate that we are committing to.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America \/ Merrill Lynch","Right. But the EBITDA that you're transferring has an incremental cost to the refining business, right? Because you know the refining business, I know it's a wash at the consolidated level, but the refinery business has to now pay a fee for those assets that it's not currently paying. So I'm trying to understand what the increase in the cost base \u2013 and how you would account for that. I guess it's going to come out in the wash in the accounting but order of magnitude would be useful?","Donald C. Templin - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Yeah, again, Doug, and I know we've had a similar dialogue as over time. We really are viewing this at sort of the enterprise level with regard to the earnings that are available within the business and where ultimately they may reside rather that's as part of the traditional R&M segment or part of MPLX and obviously with the IDRs around them and the sort of recycle of cash. I mean we have tended to look at this and I think we'll continue to look at this on an enterprise-wide basis as opposed to the specifics around the impact on a particular segment within the business.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America \/ Merrill Lynch","All right. I'll take it offline. Thanks guys.","Operator","And our next question comes from Paul Cheng from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Hi Paul.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Gary, just curious that do you have a timeline in terms of the strategic review win that \u2013 I mean, when's the next time we're going to hear from you guys do you have or that it is just go along and that you really don't have a specific timeline?","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","As far as a strategic review, Paul, I'm not sure I understand.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Right. So I mean, do you have...","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Strategic review for the MLP or...","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","For the MLP, GP and the LPE (38:10) structure...","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Okay, okay.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","...that strategic review. Do you have a timeline in terms of when that you think you're going to conclude or perhaps.","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Sure. Sure.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","You don't really have a timeline at this point, and also that whether that strategic review and timeline have any indication on your MPLX distribution growth target for 2017 and 2018?","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Right. I'm sorry I didn't \u2013 I wasn't tying your question at first. But I understand it. We've already been working on the strategic review. I would expect that we don't have an end date in mind, but with all the work we've already done, I would expect sometime mid-year or to be kind of in the arena of where we should have this work complete.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","So that the December Analyst Meeting we should not assume we are going to hear a lot of update on that?","Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Well, Paul there's no Analyst Meeting scheduled for this year, but...","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Are you guys not going to do one?","Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","No, no.","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","We do it.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay.","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","We do it generally every other year, Paul.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","All right.","Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","And I think that, Paul, the \u2013 may be to provide a little bit of framework around that, I mean, we've identified this as one of the biggest sources of value discount with regard to MPC. So we have every incentive and motivation to move through this as expeditiously as we can.","Again but I think we want to be careful and disciplined around the way that we look at things, but \u2013 we will be inclined to move through this as quickly as we can, and certainly we'll report back to investors, I think once we've determined what the most appropriate path is so, stay tuned. This is something that is a top priority for us.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. The second question then, just quickly, Tim, on the \u2013 I think with the Colonial Pipeline time for 10 days you incurred some additional trucking cost to supply your Speedway and Marathon network in the Southeast. Do you have a number that you can share, how big is that trucking cost? Is that material? And also whether that is being reported net of your refining margin?","Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Yeah, we have not sort of quantified or have anything to share. I mean, I think we would indicate there were some marginal increases on sort of trucking and some of the logistics cost to accommodate the situation, but nothing that is material that we'd call out specifically.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I see. And is it in the net margin or is it below line on the terminal cost and all the other total catch-all expense line?","Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Yeah. This is what sort of shows up in the other category with regard to the WACC. So again not amounts that we'd call out specifically, but that's where we would have captured it.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","All right. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Brad Heffern from RBC. Please go ahead.","Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Good morning everyone.","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Hey, Brad.","Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Gary, just circling back to some of the earlier questions about the general partner, I'm curious about the comment that you made specifically about reducing the cost of capital or optimizing the cost of capital for the partnership. I'm curious how that interacts with also unlocking value and how maybe having a public marker on the GP would help reduce the cost of capital and really what I'm getting at here is, is there a chance that maybe there is an IDR waiver that comes out as part of this process?","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Well, again, Brad, I don't think there is any preconceived conclusions as to exactly the path we take, but I think modifications to the GP interests or potentially IDR modifications, again the buy-in, the public sale, there are all things that are on the table. I don't think we want to exclude anything from our considerations to make sure that, again, the focus really here is on highlighting that value and making sure that everyone sort of understands and the market can see and understand that value and making sure that we've focused on optimizing the cost of capital for the partnership, which obviously over time, and certainly in the lifecycle of MPLX is at a point where the IDRs continue to be a cash flow that has to be covered with regard to the growth. So I think we want to be mindful of all of these considerations before we land on any solution, and we'll certainly let the market know once we reach some conclusions.","Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thanks for that. And then thinking about the drops that you were talking about before, I think pipeline and terminals were mentioned. I know that the RINs are generally internal within the refining and marketing business, but I'm wondering if any of these drops are going to include the RINs.","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","No, I mean, I think the drops that we've got contemplated now with some of the private pipelines and the terminals would not have any reflection from an earnings basis on the RINs, those are sort of independent from how we're looking at things.","Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And one more quick one if I could. Gary, I think that a couple of months ago you talked about a potential reduction in the scope of the STAR project from $2 billion to $1.5 billion. I'm curious where you are in that review, and if you have any sort of updated EBITDA target for that new scope?","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Right, let me ask Ray to answer this.","Raymond L. Brooks - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Sure. Earlier this year, we completed feasibility engineering of all the components of STAR, and what we concluded from that review was that, one of the components on newbuild distillate hydrotreater did not meet our internal minimum returns.","So, at this point, we're not progressing engineering on that portion, and we're looking for other opportunities, evaluating other opportunities of unit revamps within the refinery to accommodate distillate desulfurization.","So, that's a long way of saying that we do anticipate a drop in the CapEx that we were looking at before of the $2 billion range, we're looking at something south of that now, and we'll continue to progress our engineering and just do really what makes sense there.","I might add at this point that the STAR program really is a multi-year, multi-faceted project, and earlier this summer we brought on the first pay part (44:40) which was a resid (44:42) desulfurization unit repurposing and expansion and that's played out very well for us. That was CapEx of about $65 million and it delivered the results and performing as expected, so we'll continue to look at the program and just do what makes sense economically.","Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay, so no new EBITDA target?","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Not at this time. We're still finalizing the components of the project and when we have that finished, we'll make \u2013 we'll put it into our deck.","Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","And our next question comes from Phil Gresh from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, good morning.","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Good morning, Phil.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","First question is just on capital spending. I saw there is a budget out there for MPLX for 2017, wondering if you could just comment on the overall total MPC level capital spending outlook relative to this year, which I believe was tweaked up to 3.1 from 3.0 (45:42).","Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Yeah, so we haven't given specific guidance at the MPC level, again that's something that we'll provide probably sometime in the fourth quarter here. At a macro level, we'd probably suggest that we're unlikely to see major changes from where things tracked in 2016, and again you saw the MPLX guidance in terms of the range that we might expect at the partnership, so.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Right. Okay. Second question is, just on the droppable EBITDA pool and the $1 billion that includes fuels distribution. Gary, I think in the past you've mentioned that there might be an opportunity for that pool to potentially increase for fuels distribution, is that accurate or is that \u2013 would you say that that fully encompasses the total opportunity within fuels distribution?","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Yes, Phil, I don't recall of saying that there is a chance for that to increase. That's volume dependent. We sell approximately 20 billion gallons today of material that what we believe would qualify for this fuels distribution, but I don't recall of ever saying that we are looking at that of possibly increasing.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then just my last question, there is a recently MPC filed a lawsuit with respect to Texas City, and I was just wondering Gary, if may be you could comment on that a little bit, just provide more color?","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Sure, Phil. And I'm sure as you respect, we cannot openly talk about the litigation ongoing, so I just have to defer that to a later date.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Fair enough. Thanks.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jeff Dietert from Simmons. Please go ahead.","Jeff Dietert - Simmons & Company International","Good morning.","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Good morning, Jeff.","Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Hi, Jeff.","Jeff Dietert - Simmons & Company International","Tim, on your slide 20, you did a WACC on the basic components of refining segment income that other gross margin to $287 million. I assume that they are probably the same variables that you talked about on the 3Q 2015 to 3Q 2016 slide. On the narrower gasoline, diesel margin, was that primarily a factor of Colonial Pipeline outage, or were there other factors that impacted?","Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Yeah, there is a number of factors, and as you suggest, the drivers that sort of led to the full quarter are really a lot of the similar ones that we saw on the year-over-year with regard to narrower gas and diesel price realizations are Colonial piece of that, but I wouldn't say the major driver, but again a component of the total change.","Jeff Dietert - Simmons & Company International","Okay. So, but Colonial was not the major driver there?","Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","No. No. It was not.","Jeff Dietert - Simmons & Company International","Okay. Okay. Thank you. And you also mentioned building inventories during the third quarter as a negative hit here, how significant inventory build did you have, and is that going to be a positive offset in 4Q?","Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Well, again, the inventory actions that we took in third quarter are not unlike other years, in large parts for hurricane build and sort of positioning the business into the season, so nothing unusual. And, again, I think a lot of those effects will always manage into the sort of LIFO targets that we've got for the business. So that was probably the bigger driver in the quarter with the refined products and crude build that were not sort of unexpected relative to how we manage the business.","Jeff Dietert - Simmons & Company International","Got you. And talking about alkylation, any updates to your Garyville FCC alkylation project scheduled for the end of the year, and perhaps any change to your octane outlook going forward?","Raymond L. Brooks - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Yeah. In the third quarter, we actually initiated some work on the alkylation revamp at Garyville, so that still stays well on target, and to be completed on schedule.","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","As far as octane, Jeff, we still believe as you talk to the autos and you talk about the overall demand, we still think octane into the future is going to be a product in great demand, and it should be a valuable \u2013 it should have some incremental value to the entire slate as we go forward.","Jeff Dietert - Simmons & Company International","Thanks for your comments.","Operator","And our next question comes from Blake Fernandez from Howard Weil. Please go ahead.","Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil","Hey, folks, good morning. Gary, historically, you've talked about the benefits of control and basically maintaining a decent amount of control with regard to the MLP. I'm just curious with the announcement today, and some considerations on changes at that level, has there been any change in your appetite with regard to control and potentially maybe foregoing a bit in an effort to drive that value at the GP level?","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","No, Blake. It's still a very big piece of our strategy that as we said back when we first initiated the MLP. Being able to control and having all the pipeline assets, terminal assets that are really the key to our integrated model is very, very important. And we'd continue to expect to control those.","Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil","Okay, great. The second question, and this is really more just clarity from a reporting standpoint. But obviously, you've already got a midstream segment, is it fair to think that the impetus behind this is to really reallocate some of that EBITDA that's coming out of the refining segment into midstream? And if so, I'm assuming we'll get some restated historical gross margins, et cetera.","Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Yeah, Blake. I think that's conceptually how we're targeting that. There's a fair amount of what we've identified as MLP eligible earnings that really have been in the R&M segment historically. So certainly, for those portions that we think are and will be MLP eligible, identifying them independent from the R&M segment is conceptually I think what we're really targeting here.","Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil","Got it. Okay. Thanks, Tim. Appreciate it.","Operator","And our next question comes from Roger Read from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yeah, good morning.","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Hi, Roger.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","I guess to kind of come back to the overall strategic plan here if we could. As you've mentioned about the GP, we should consider almost anything as a possibility here from potentially elimination of the GP, a resetting of the IDRs or even an IPO of the GP, or is there something that's not on the table here? I just kind of want to make sure I understand all the potential here.","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Yeah. Again, I think we want to be careful that we have looked at everything and have evaluated things, again with the real focus on highlighting that value and optimizing the cost of capital for the partnership. So, again, I think as we suggested, this is an evaluation that we'll undertake over the course of the next several months. And, again, I mean, it could include things like a buy-in of the IDRs, it could include a partial public sale of the GP, it could include some restructuring of the GP interest or the IDRs. Again, we want to be careful that we evaluate everything. We'll look at everything and pursue the path that we think makes the most sense relative to those objectives.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","And along those lines, do you \u2013 where you mentioned in the strategic plan optimizing the cost of capital for MPLX, which presumably applies to the GP and the IDRs, et cetera. I mean, is there an ideal cost of capital that you would plan to have there both pre-and post the $1.03 billion of dropdowns?","Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Well, I don't know if there's a specific number, Roger, that we focus on. But as Don alluded to earlier we've been generally unhappy with where the units have traded at the LP level. And certainly as the partnership moved into the high splits, and certainly with the addition of MarkWest, we know that the IDR burden on the partnership is significant, and obviously impacts the level of growth and things that we can pursue.","So, I think a focus around things that will improve both in terms of the LP yield and where things are at as well as, again, ways to optimize the cost of capital for the overall partnership given the cash requirements that the IDRs bring are part of exactly what we're going to look at here.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then my last question, just as a follow-up of all of that. Presumably, the majority of the capital raised from the dropdowns, we should expect goes towards what, share repos, paying down debt, combination of the two?","Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Well, it all will sort of come into the total. I mean, I think to the extent that again we're comfortable with the liquidity position of the company, and we've got cash beyond the needs, then share purchase is high on our list.","Debt pay down, I think we'll evaluate as we go forward. We did a little bit this quarter just to sort of calibrate the cap structure relative to the refining environment we've seen. But I'd say the priority is probably more around share purchase, and again certainly where the shares trade we think there's a tremendous value there, so.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. I appreciate your time. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey, good morning, guys and congrats on today's strategic actions.","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Thank Evan.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Maybe just a follow-up to the last point. I mean, accelerated drops would be a significant cash windfall, I mean $1.4 billion x 9 is $12 billion before tax, before considering any GP potential monetization proceeds, which dwarf any capitalized costs you kind of referenced earlier today. Shouldn't we assume that most of that's going to support a buyback? I mean given your history, given your impetus for announcing today's actions that your equity is undervalued?","And secondly, if drops are on the come, would you buy shares, use the balance sheet before they occur like in the 4Q? Your stock's down 5% today, and I know you didn't acquire much in the third quarter and with that size of monetization, you have a lot of shares to put away potentially.","Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Well, and I think you're right, to be extent that there are big cash proceeds that ultimately come back, either from equity or debt that get raised through the drop process there, share purchase continues to be a priority for us in terms of where that money gets spent.","Again, our focus is I think primarily and starts with the notion that the value hasn't been recognized. So, we want to make sure that that value recognition occurs, and to the extent that that produces cash at MPC level, that can be used for share buyback all the better.","Again, provided that we have done that tax efficiently and managed it relative to the total needs of the enterprise. But, I think the notion that substantial portion could take the formal share purchase is not unreasonable.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. And maybe a similar follow-up to that and the prior questions on taking back equity as well as I guess your theory in terms of how this would be recognized by the market? But you mentioned dropping as soon as practical and then you dropped, and then you define drops per year. I mean, so is the limiting factor on the pace that you selected here, the capital markets \u2013 the equity capital markets for MPLX. So, meaning your actual dropdown pace could be faster if access or market depth or counterparty side proves to be greater?","And secondly that your goal is really to sell units for cash, right, because that's what compresses your multiple, and that's ultimately in my opinion what forces and unlock the value versus potentially taking back units. So what's the limiting factor there? What is the limiting factor to the pace, and, I guess, is your goal to optimize the equity?","Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Yeah. I mean, I think, our goal will definitely be to optimize. The market capacity to absorb transactions is certainly a consideration among others that we've evaluated. But again, Evan, this is really a look as to \u2013 obviously, there is a piece of the dropdown portfolio that we're just not going to get comfortable with until we can get to the QI regs and the PLR around it. So let's set those aside for a moment.","So, the remaining piece, we are moving pretty aggressively here. We're talking about dropping down up to half of those and setting a schedule for the remaining pieces, again, provided that we can get tax comfort on the rest at a pretty good clip.","So, I think the considerations around it, it certainly involves market capacity to absorb larger transactions, but also just in terms of the pace and the capacity to manage the growth of the partnership and making sure that we can optimize that total sort of equation with regard to how fast we grow the partnership at the LP level and ultimately the cash flow that comes to the GP as well.","So, again, I think, we are moving very aggressively here. I think we are \u2013 there are still certainly pieces of the drop portfolio that we will need to spend some time on the readiness for, but they are all from my perspective likely going to be part of MPLX, and we're moving very rapidly on it.","So, I think this is an aggressive schedule, I mean, even though the drop that we suggested for first quarter would be the largest transaction for MPLX in its history, and again we recognize that that value is not getting picked up, and this increased clarity around the drop portfolio and when it comes in, we think, will help address that valuation gap.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah. And then just maybe one more if I would. I mean, in terms of your statement of taking back units in conjunction with the drop, I mean, is that just a pragmatic statement that if that's what's necessary to fund, and I realize there is a debt piece that that provides cash to the parent. I mean, is that statement essentially there \u2013 if that's necessary? I mean, what's \u2013 or is it a goal to take, I guess, units back? That's what I am trying to get to.","Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Yeah. But I wouldn't call it a goal. I would say that we want to be mindful of the market's capacity to absorb transactions. And where we can officially raise that capital, I think, we'd be inclined to do so. We have the flexibility to take back units to help alleviate any of those issues, and again we'll manage it prudently as we go here.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Big source of cash, guys, again congratulations.","Donald C. Templin - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Yeah, Evan, this is Don. I mean just one more comment on that. I mean one, you know, historically, we manage tax leakage by taking back units, so that was one aspect of it. And the other is, we are a substantial holder of MPLX units, so the value in the MPLX units, we want to make sure that we're not doing anything in the market that puts an overhang on those units that causes the value of our investment to decrease. So those are all things that get into the consideration.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And in the future if you could share an aggregate tax basis, so the drop (01:01:30) EBITDA I think that would be helpful as well.","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And our final question comes from Paul Sankey from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Thank you. I guess, having settled that, I'm still a little bit perplexed by the timing here. If I look at the MPC share price or even the MPLX share price charts they don't look that troubled, I mean, I am sure you would want them higher, but I am still not clear why we have to have this announcement right here, right now. Could you just remind me why you decided that now is the moment that this needs to be announced? Thank you.","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Paul, we've \u2013 as I said earlier in my comments that the first nine months or so, we work very hard at getting the MarkWest transition in place, really working with the producers, MarkWest had an outstanding reputation in the producers field, so meeting with producers and that really as I say getting these assets under wraps.","But then, as you step back and look at how MPLX has performed and how the value has really been transparent or we believe lack of transparency of that value back into MPC, and the value to MPLX as well, that we thought it was important to really take a bold move here to increase the dropdowns, increase the pace of the dropdowns, of course a very bold move around us to reflect -an attempt to reflect what we believe is substantial value that is tied up inside of both components.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","So, Gary, basically, I'm (01:03:35) obviously apologies, but do you see this as a major change in the strategy that is a much more aggressive dropdown outlook, and you felt the need to announce it right here right now?","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Right. And Paul, if we take you back to prior to MarkWest, our strategy was to be a company-sponsored MLP, and all we had are dropdown components, and a few organic projects. At the time that we did MarkWest, we stated that we looked out into the future and could easily see that the rate of dropdowns from a sponsored MLP was not infinite and as you get out over time it was going to be much more difficult, and at the same time the pressure from others in the marketplace of attempting to be able to find growth opportunities was going to continue to be challenging, that's what we did the merger with MarkWest to begin with.","We've been very pleased with the assets. Don has talked about the rate of growth, the volumetric increases and the gathering and processing businesses is very solid as well as the logistics and storage business that we have as well, but still we were not seeing that value transferred in the yield component of MPLX. And talking to a number of unitholders, they wanted to have a better understanding of the rhythm of how we were going to dropdown assets, and we felt that at this time it was again after getting all this under our belt, we felt its compelling that we needed to move forward back in line with where we said we would grow, kind of middle double-digits where we said we would grow when we first started the discussion on the merger to begin with.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah. I get it. And I know we're over the hour, but can I just change subjects and ask you about...","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Sure.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","...the dreaded RINs thing. You've highlighted the cost here (1:05:51), but I get the sense there is a slight difference of view among refiners as to what should be done next. Could you first talk about what you anticipate to happen at end of November if anything? And then secondly talk about how you view the issue \u2013 the way the issue should be resolved? Thanks.","Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Right. Well, I don't know that anything is going to be happen at the end of November, Paul. But our \u2013 we've said for quite some time, and I know you've reported it as well that we believe how Marathon is positioned, we have the optionality, the flexibility with our retail component, our branded component and our very large blending component as well as some methanol production capacity.","We have the ability to capture RIN value, and probably more so to lessen the cost of rig value across all those different components of our business. To change the point of obligation, we think that as fraught with many ramifications.","Today, you have a \u2013 I don't know probably the number is less than 50 of refiners are big blenders for managing really step back and look at this, we're managing the whole RIN cycle for the EPA today.","If you are going to go put this into the hands of 150,000 people, this considered what those ramifications are. We believe the RIN cost is captured in part of the frac spread today, and part of its retail, and part of its in blending. So we just think that change in the point of obligation is a bigger distraction.","Operator","And with that let me turn the call back to over Lisa.","Lisa Wilson - Marathon Petroleum Corp.","Thank you Katy, and thanks all of you for joining us today and your interest in Marathon Petroleum Corporation.

It's a reminder that we will be making forward-looking statements during the call and during the question-and-answer session. Actual results may differ materially from what we expect today. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included there, as well as in our filings with the SEC.","Now, I will turn the call over to Gary Heminger for opening remarks on Slide 3.","Gary Heminger","Thanks Lisa, and good morning, and thank you for joining our call. We issued two press releases today, our usual fourth quarter earnings announcements and one announcing the completion of our previously announced strategic actions.","This morning we report a strong results for the quarter and full year. The Midstream and Speedway segments each achieved a record full year performance along with a substantial increase in earnings from the Refining & Marketing segment. I will as Don to cover addition highlights for the fourth quarter and full year results.","Before I move to our capital plan, I would like to take a moment to highlight two significant five year milestones for our company. February marks the five year anniversary of our acquisition of Galveston Bay refinery. The accomplishment since this acquisition are impressive. We have dramatically improved the environmental and safety performance of the refinery and advanced operational excellence all while achieving lower operating expenses.","For example, we have reduced environmental incidence by approximately 80%, achieved numerous processing records including 33 monthly process unit rate records in 2017 alone and cut unplanned downtime in half. We've also lowered operating expenses nearly 25%.","It's also been five years since the formation of MPLX. MPLX has delivered an impressive 20 consecutive quarters of increased cash distributions for unitholders representing a compound annual growth rate of 18.3% over the minimum quarterly distribution established at the partnership's formation.","The partnership's asset base and earnings profile have been transformed over this time. In late 2015, the partnership expanded into midstream natural gas business with the addition of MarkWest. Early last year, we announced a strategic action plan to enhance value for our investors which we completed today.","As part of this strategic actions, we executed dropdowns to MPLX of assets and services that are projected to generate approximately $1.4 billion of annual EBITDA adding high quality fee based streams to MPLX and further diversify the partnership's earnings.","Following the dropdowns, we completed the conversion of MPC's GP economic interest in MPLX into LP units. This conversion provides a clear valuation for MPC's ownership in MPLX. This combined with the elimination of the partnerships IDR burden creates mutual benefits of positions MPLX extraordinarily well to deliver long term sustainable growth for its unitholders including MPC.","Earlier this year, we're pleased to see Standard & Poor's recognized MPLX's transformation and strong credit profile by upgrading the partnership's credit rate to BBB plus.","Looking forward, this morning we announced our 2018 capital investment plans for both MPC and MPLX. This plan remains focus on strengthening the sustained earnings power of the business through growth and margin enhancing projects as well as expanding our more stable cash flow businesses especially Speedway and MPLX. Our capital plan for MPC for 2018 excluding MPLX is $1.6 billion. This plan spending includes 950 million for Refining & Marketing, 530 million for Speedway and 100 million to support corporate activities and other investments.","The Refining & Marketing investment plan includes approximately 400 million of growth capital focused on optimizing the Galveston Bay refinery, upgrading residual fuel oils to higher valued products, maximizing distiller production and expanding life product placement flexibility including exports.","With the investments we made in the business, we are well positioned to benefit from the adoption of the low softer international bunker fuel requirement in 2020 commonly referred to as IMO. Our refinery system has de-convergent to pass as well as asphalt production capabilities. We plan to increase our production of ultra-low sulfur diesel and residual upgrading ahead of IMO through future investments which include the optimization of the Galveston Bay refinery which we referred to as the star project, the diesel maximization project in Garyville, and the Garyville Major expansion.","We expect to invest $530 million in Speedway, $150 million increase from last year's plan and consistent with our commitment to aggressively grow this business and build up as industry leading position.","The significant increase is targeted for construction of new stores as well as remodeling and rebuilding existing locations.","MPLX also its capital investment plan for 2018 including $2.2 billion for organic growth and approximately 190 million for maintenance capital. This robust organic growth plan includes addition of eight processing plans representing nearly 1.5 billion cubic feet per day of incremental processing capacity as well as 100,000 barrels per day of additional fractionation capacity and a prolific Marcellus, Utica and Permian basins.","The remaining growth capital of the partnership has planned for the development of various crude oil of refine products infrastructure include export capacity expansion at our Galveston Bay refinery.","As we started the new year, I also wanted to provide some observations on the macro environment we are expecting in 2018.","From a commodity perspective, we are encouraged by a more balanced supply and demand environment which should be supported by crude oil and refined product prices throughout the year. We think that creates a very productive backdrop of refining margins in additional to generating meaningful midstream development opportunities for MPLX.","Inventories are more balanced than they have been for several years. On a days of supply basis including exports, December U.S. gasoline inventories were the lowest they have been since 2006 and U.S. distiller inventories were the lowest since 2013. Additionally, the U.S. crude inventory surplus is largely gone.","From a crude differential perspective, we expect the brand WTI spread to be volatile but to generally trade a couple of dollars at either side of $5 per barrel. These are based on our view that pipe are pushing to the gulf will be relatively fold and the differential should generally reflect transportation cost and quality differentials although always subject to changes due to domestic operating and geopolitical events.","We also expect favorable Canadian crude oil differentials both heavy and light over the course of 2018. We believe that pipelines into the U.S. will be fold and the incremental barrels of Canadian crude will have clear by rail. This should keep every differentials wider in 2018 than we experienced in 2017.","We also believe the global endues macro picture remains solid and expect that good underlying economic growth will continue to support strong demand for our products. We expect demand from export markets to remain robust. MPC continues to be well positioned to take advantage of export opportunities of both Galveston Bay and Garyville.","In the fourth quarter, we exported 314,000 barrels per day or about 17% of our nameplate capacity. Complementing our outlook for the business is a recent tax reform legislation. The reduction of the corporate tax rate is a catalyst for incremental investment in the business. Additionally, the reduction in the cash burden on MPC and are high confidence in the long term cash generation of the business help support our board's support to increase the regular quarterly dividend by 15% to $0.46 per share earlier this week.","During the quarter, we returned 945 million of capital to shareholders including the $750 million of share repurchases and $195 million in dividends.","For full year, we returned over $3 billion of capital to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases which were supported impart our proceeds from the dropdown transactions completed during the year.","Since MPC became a separate company in 2011, we have returned over $13 billion to shareholders. Importantly, 3.7 of that 13 billion was in the form of regular quarterly dividends which have grown by 26.5% CAGR since MPC became an independent company.","Return of capital to shareholders continued long term investments in the business and maintaining an investment grade credit profile will remain fundamental elements of MPC's capital allocation strategy and will continue to drive a very attractive value proposition for our investors.","As I ramp up, I wanted to highlight our recent publication of a report called Perspectives on Climate Related Scenarios. This document enhances our disclosures around climate related strategies, risk and opportunities using the framework recommended by the taskforce on climate related financial disclosures.","The report has been very well received by investors and as pointed to as an example for others in the industry to follow. As investors who care about environmental stewardship and a welfare of future generations, we can be proud to invest in MPC.","With that let me turn the call over to Don to cover additional highlights for the fourth quarter. Don?","Donald Templin","Thanks Gary. Turning to Slide 4. We reported fourth quarter earnings of $2 billion or $4.09 per diluted share and full year earnings of $3.4 billion or $6.70. Fourth quarter and full year earnings reflect the net benefit of $1.5 billion related to tax reform.","The Midstream segment which largely reflects the financial results of MPLX reported record financial results in the fourth quarter and for the full year 2017. This record setting performance was primarily driven by gathered, processed and fractionated volume growth resulting in high plant utilization.","After the closing of today's dropdown and the elimination of IDRs, MPLX is among the largest diversified master limited partnerships in the energy sector with a very competitive cost of capital going forward.","Given its robust portfolio of organic projects in the Marcellus, Utica, Permian and Stack, as well as a diversified suite of logistics assets, we believe MPLX is very well positioned to be a source of significant long term value for its unitholders including MPC.","I would encourage you to listen in on the MPLX call at 11 AM this morning to hear additional color on the partnerships performance and opportunities.","Speedway achieved record full year performance in 2017. This was driven by strong earnings from light product sales, an increase of 1.2% in same store merchandize sales, lower operating expenses and contributions from its travel center joint venture. This is Speedway's sixth straight year of record results and second consecutive year generating $1 billion of annual EBITDA reinforcing the strategic value of this high performing, stable cash flow business.","Turning Refining & Marketing, we delivered strong results with full year segment earnings of $2.3 billion, an increase of nearly $1 billion over 2016. We operated exceptionally well throughout the year and we're able to capture strong crack spreads and wider crude differentials across our system.","Additionally, we achieve numerous monthly process units and production records in the fourth quarter and throughout 2017 including monthly records for crude throughput and gasoline and distiller production.","As a result, we are now the second largest refinery in the U.S. on a crude throughput basis and Galveston Bay and Garyville are the second and third largest refineries respectively.","With that let me turn the call over to Tim to walk you through the financial results for the fourth quarter and the full year.","Timothy Griffith","Thanks Don. Slide 5 provides earnings on both an absolute and per share basis. For the fourth quarter and for the full year 2017.","For the fourth quarter of 2017, MPC reported earnings of $2.02 billion or $4.09 per diluted share compared to last year's $227 million or $0.43 per diluted share. For the full year earnings were $3.4 billion or $6.70 per diluted share, up from approximately $1.2 billion or $2.21 per diluted share in 2016.","As Don referenced, earnings for the fourth quarter and full year included a tax benefit of approximately $1.5 billion or $3.04 and $2.93 per diluted share for the fourth quarter and full year respectively, as a result of re-measuring certain net differed tax liabilities is using the lower corporate tax rate.","The bridge on Slide 6 shows the changes in earnings by segment over the fourth quarter last year. Apart from the $1.5 billion benefit resulting from tax reform what highlights the significant increase in Refining & Marketing compared to same quarter last year. The improvement was driven by higher LOS based blended crack spreads and higher utilization rates in the fourth quarter 2017. These benefits were partially offset by less favorable product price realizations versus spot prices used in the benchmark crack spread.","Speedways fourth quarter is also were generally comparable to last year. The increase in light product margins were offset by higher operating expenses and lower merchandize margin in the quarter.","The 47 million favorable midstream variance was primarily due to MPLX's record gathered process and factionary volumes as compared to the fourth quarter of last year. Quarterly results were also impacted by $205 million of income taxes associated with higher earnings and $47 million of increased allocation of higher MPLX earnings to the publically held units in the partnership, shown here is a negative variance in non-controlling interest.","Moving to Slide 7, our Refining & Marketing segment reported earnings of $732 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $166 million in the same quarter last year. Looking at our key market metrics, an increase in the LLS-based blended crack spread at a $586 million favorable impact to the segment results, primarily due to higher Chicago crack spread. The LLS-based Chicago crack spread increased from $11.8 from $6.32 per barrel in 2016, driving our LLS-based blended crack spread to $7.75 per barrel from $7.39 per barrel in the same quarter last year.","The Light Louisiana Sweet and Texas Intermediate differential widened to $5.64 per barrel, up from a $1.34 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2016. This wider differential drove a $214 million benefit based on the linked crudes in our slate.","These benefits were slightly offset by a $53 million unfavorable RIN\/CBOB crack adjustment as a result of higher in prices. This increase in costs was considered in our pricing decisions and is reflected in the price paid by consumers. As a result, there is an offset in the product portion of other margin.","As a reminder and concession with its treatment, we view the LLS crack and RIN\/CBOB crack adjustment together as an effective realized crack spread. Going forward, we'll collapse these impacts into a single variance factor which would have shown a net $533 million positive impact in the fourth quarter.","Partial offset in the strong cracks with $113 million unfavorable other margin variance in the quarter driven primarily by less favorable product price realizations versus the spot prices used in the benchmark LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spread.","Slide 8, provides the drivers for the change in Refining & Marketing segment income for the full year. Income from operations of the $2.3 billion in 2017, up $964 million versus 2016. The LLS-based 6-3-2-1 blend crack spread had a nearly $2.3 billion favorable impact on full year segment results, $2.1 billion on an X-written basis with higher cracks present both the Gulf Coast and Chicago markets. The blend of crack spread for the full year increased by $2.88 per barrel to $9.84 per barrel in 2017.","The LLS WTI differential widened to $3.15 per barrel, up from a $1.55 per barrel in 2016. This widening had a $250 million benefit on the full year segment earnings. These benefits were partially offset by three factors, the largest of which was the $505 million unfavorable variance and other margin. This unfavorable variance was primarily due to lower gasoline and non-transportation fuel product price realizations versus spot price is used in LLS based crack spread. This was partially offset by favorable impact in refinery value metric again, due to higher refined products price environment and increased crude throughput volumes in 2017.","A narrowing continuing effect shown in the market structure come with a walk resulted in a $350 million unfavorable variance. This is effectively an adjustment of the prime crude price used in the benchmark crack to actual crude acquisition costs. This walk also reflects an unfavorable $345 million due the absence of the LCM reversal that occurred in the second quarter of 2016.","Moving to Other segments, Slide 9 provide the Speedway segment results walk for the fourth quarter and full year. As a reminder, comparability of Speedways 2017 results to prior year's fourth quarter and full year's result are affected by the transfer of Speedways travel centers into a joint venture formed with Pilot Flying J called PFJ Southeast LLC in the fourth quarter of 2016.","Since the formation of the joint venture in the fourth quarter of 2016, Speedway shared the results of operations is reflected as income from equity method investments and as shown in the other column of this walk. While prior activity remains in the light product margin, merchandise margin and other categories. Speedway's segment income was $149 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $165 million in the same period of 2016.","The decrease in segment income was primarily due to higher operating expenses and lower merchandise margin. These impacts are partially offset by higher light product margin which increased to $17.70 per gallon in the fourth quarter, up from $16.17 per gallon the fourth quarter of 2016.","Speedways income from operations for the full year 2017 was $732 million compared to $734 million in 2016, a record when excluding the LCM benefit recorded in 2016. The increase in full year segment income excluding the LCM benefit was primarily due to contributions from the travel center joint venture with Pilot Flying J and lower operating expense, partially offset by lower merchandise margin for the year.","In January, we've seen a roughly 1.7% decrease in same store gasoline sales volumes compared to last January. Speedways same store gasoline sales has been impacted by higher retail prices as crude prices moved higher and impacts from severe winter weather. As Gary mentioned, the macro picture for 2018 remain solid and we expect a good underlying economic growth will continue to support strong demand for gasoline and distillate over the course of 2018.","Slide 10 provides changes in the midstream segment income highlighting the $47 million quarter-over-quarter and the $291 million year-over-year improvement in segment earnings. The higher earnings were primarily due to increase in contributions from MPLX.","MPLX results for the fourth quarter and full year were favorably impacted by record gathered processed and factionary volumes as well as contributions from acquired logistics and storage assets in 2017. As Don referenced earlier a more detailed description of the results for the partnership will be provided in the Marathon's earnings call being at 11 and we encourage you to listen in.","Slide 11 presents the elements of changes in consolidate cash position for the fourth quarter. Cash at the end of the year was just over $3 billion, an increase approximately $923 million for the end of the third quarter. Core operating cash flow before changes in working capital was an approximate $1.4 billion source of cash. Working capital was a $1.3 billion source of cash in the fourth quarter, primarily due to the impact of higher crude prices and volumes on accounts payable and higher crude liabilities offset by an increase in accounts receivable.","Net debt with a $73 million source of cash which represents MPLX's incremental revolver borrowings during the quarter.","Return of capital shareholders by where share repurchase and dividends told $945 million in the quarter including $750 million of share purchases at a weighted average share price of 57.90.","As Gary mentioned, on Monday, we announced a 15% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.46 per share. This represents a 26.5% compound annual growth rate in the dividend since becoming an independent company six years ago.","This accelerated timing and increase reflects the high confidence we have in the long term cash generation of the business. Since beginning of the year. We've returned over $3 billion of capital to MPC shareholders through dividends and share purchases which were supported in part by proceeds from dropdown transactions during the year.","Looking forward, we expect further return of capital with the after tax proceeds from today's dropdown transaction, all conducted with a continued focus on maintaining an investment grade credit profile at both MPC and MPLX.","Slide 12 provides an overview of our capitalization and financial profile at the end of the year. We're nearly $13 billion of total consolidated debt including approximately $6.9 billion of debt owed by MPLX.","Total consolidate debt represents 2.2 times last twelve months adjusted EBITDA on a consolidated basis or about 1.4 times excluding MPLX. This same metrics including distributions MPC received from MPLX in adjusted EBITDA was 1.3 times.","We believe the addition of the distributions from MPLX is a more useful way to look at MPLX's ongoing debt service capabilities given the importance and stability of MPLX distributions MPC going forward. Beginning this year and over time, the growing MPLX distributions will provide substantial funding to MPC and will be a fundamental component of MPC's discretionary free cash flow.","On Slide 13, we provide the illustrative impact to the Refining & Marketing segment from the drop of the refining logistics assets and fuels distribution services into MPLX. Similar to previous dropdowns, the intersegment earnings associated with the dropdown will be reflected in the Midstream segment. We are not restating the prior period results and as such prior period results remain in the R&M segment.","Importantly, the dropdown of earnings into the Midstream segment will not cause any change to R&M margin. Direct operating costs will no longer include costs related to the refining logistics assets and the MPLX sees to manage the refining logistics assets as well to provide fuel situation services will be reflected as an increase to other R&M expenses.","We expect a net annual increase in total R&M expenses of approximately $1 billion with the corresponding results to be reflected in the Midstream segment.","For the Midstream segment, we will also provide supplemental volume statistic related to the fuel distribution services, although volume risks of the partnership have been largely mitigated by the fee-for-services contract that underlies the arrangement.","Slide 14 provide updated outlook information and key operating metrics for MPC for the first quarter of 2018. We're expecting throughput volumes of 1.9 million barrels per day with some planned maintenance in the Midwest and Gulf Coast. Total direct operating costs are expected to be 7.90 per barrel.","As I mentioned in the prior slide, direct operating costs will exclude the costs related to the refinery logistics assets being dropped and our guidance here has been adjusted for the dropdown completed today. We'll continue to provide this guidance adjusted for the drop impacts on a going forward basis.","While guidance is not provided for other R&M expenses, for the first quarter, we expect a net increase of fractionally $230 million resulting from today's dropdown which includes the fees paid to MPLX for two of the three months of the first quarter.","Sour crude is estimated to make up 51% of our crude oil throughput for the quarter, down from the first quarter of 2017 as we expect sour crude runs to be impacted by plant maintenance in the Gulf Coast.","The estimated percentage of WTI price crude for the first quarter is 28%. Corporate and other unallocated items which were higher in the fourth quarter due to increase in unallocated corporate costs and employee related expenses are projected be $90 million for the first quarter. These costs are expected to moderate over the balance of 2018 as we move past some of the employee related expenses specific to the first quarter.","Additionally, we've updated MPC's R&M segment price and margin sensitive is appendix on Slide 21.","With that, let me turn the call back over to Lisa. Lisa?","Lisa Wilson","Thank you, Tim. As we open the call for your questions, as a courtesy to all participants, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and a follow-up. If time permits, we will re-prompt for additional questions. With that, we will now open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Kristina Kazarian from Credit Suisse.","Kristina Kazarian","Good morning, guys.","Gary Heminger","Good morning, Kristina, welcome back.","Kristina Kazarian","Thank you. As you had alluded to in the opening comments the WTI, WCS spreads really widened out. Can you give a bit more color on the how you guys are thinking about the overall impact on your refining system throughout the year?","Mike Palmer","Yes, Kristina. This is Mike Palmer. You're absolutely right. I mean the - what's happening is that the growth in Canadian heavy continues. And for example we've got the big four heels project is just now starting to ramp up. And with that growth in Canadian crude, what refining is that the pipelines that feed the U.S. systems are full and they're being portioned. So when you look at the numbers, we're very high WCS spreads right now, we do expect those to come down somewhat. But what it really means is that we'll continue to maximize the volume of heavy Canadian that we can move into our system.","Kristina Kazarian","Great. Thanks. And I'll follow-up on that to you. How you heard that thinking about the return that you will be generating on some of the residual upgrade projects you also talked about the beginning of the call particularly given the benefit of IMO that might be coming?","Mike Palmer","Well we look at those projects we've seen high double-digit returns of that we're looking at and that's being very conservative on IMO. We do believe that there are significant upside opportunity with IMO not only of the incremental projects but our base business, but we have not taken any of that upside into the IRR calculations on those projects. But when we finish, we're going to be able to destroy approximately probably somewhere between 280,000 to 300,000 barrels a day of residual and on a total refining system basis we're going to be up significantly over 700,000 barrels per day of annual distillate production.","So both the residual destruction, our total annual distillate production, we have the ability to swing that between gasoline and distillate when this is complete and we've always set around 8% to 10%, will probably be a little bit higher when we have these projects complete. But high returns and I think significant upside if the market continues to perform like many of us think it well.","Kristina Kazarian","Perfect. Thank you.","Mike Palmer","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Benny Wong from Morgan Stanley.","Benny Wong","Hi, good morning, guys. Hi Gary. Just following-up on projects to positioning you guys for IMO, is that $400 million looks like, is there any of that to need to be spent to be completed in 2019 or is it all in 2018 and also beyond that is there any more opportunities that you guys are looking at to further position you for IMO?","Gary Heminger","Yes. Let me have Ray Brooks take that question.","Raymond Brooks","Sure. Your question about that positioning for IMO had a 20\/20, probably the biggest thing that we have is Gary talked about residual destruction is we have a moderate expansion of our Garyville, Cokers, both Coker units were put in a larger Coke crowns and doing some deep bottleneck. And that wok will be primarily complete on one Coker Q4 2019 and the other Coker Q1 2020. So right on time there. At our Galveston Bay refinery, we've talked over the years about the Star Project which fits right in with IMO, it's a residual destruction, it's a diesel maximization project. That project is actually had staged implementation going back a couple years and will have stage implementation going forward all the way out to when it finally complete so be Q1 2022, but I had a IMO they'll be some more implementation there.","To follow-up with your other comment about additional projects. In addition to the CapEx for R&M we always have a backlog of projects that we're are doing some level of engineering and we have some very attractive projects in queue that will continue to re-evaluate given the current market look and potentially bring some more of those projects forward.","Benny Wong","Great. Thanks. And for a second question just regarding the LP units you guys will hold after all the strategic transformation here. Have you guys ever looked at an up-sea structure the something is kind of come across like discussions this was essentially C Corp unit is that something that would make sense at some point or are there any reason that it wouldn't?","Timothy Griffith","Well Benny, this Tim. We'll continue to evaluate potential structural turn as where we think that makes sense. I don't think there's anything at this point that is absolutely compelling or imminent in terms of the review, but we'll take a look and see if there are such that makes sense. I think as we've said publicly our intent plan would be to hold these units indefinitely. I mean we would - they are so important to MPC cash flow that we don't see any situation where those units are not held by MPC but we'll continue to evaluate structure where we think it may make sense, we've looked at other vehicles even for C Corp sleeves that may provide some market access that is tougher in the and not the space but nothing that is required or in terms of our view at this point.","Benny Wong","Got it. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question from Paul Cheng from Barclays Capital.","Paul Cheng","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Gary Heminger","Hi, Paul.","Paul Cheng","Gary, I just want to make sure I get your number correct, you said in the investment that you guys are making when if you think it sense then you're going to reduce in your we see production by 280,000 to 300,000 barrel today. I was looking at your press release, last year your heavy fuel oil is 37 and 63 so that's only about 100. Did I get it wrong and also you say production increase 700 or that you say that is up to 700 because in the full year last year your 641, so maybe you can clarify maybe I missed right one you just said?","Gary Heminger","Sure. And what I was saying is that in total I was not saying incremental, Paul, I was saying in total that our reserve destruction will grow to by the time we finish these projects in 2019 and 2020, we're going to grow to about 280,000 maybe I said 280,000 to 300,000 by the time we get this done in 2017. In '17 - let me tell in 2016 it was 240,000 barrels per day, in 2017, we finished a part of the Star Project which took us from that up to about 252,000 barrels per day and the balance would take us up this 280,000 to 300,000 and then that's a residual destruction. And then in distillate production, in 2017, we were about 640,000 and we're going to go up to about 710,000 to 720,000 when we complete these projects.","So in total, the increment is about 60,000 barrels a day of residual destruction incremental and about 110,000 barrels a day or so of incremental distillate.","Paul Cheng","Okay. And is that going to have any change in the crude or that will be relatively steady?","Gary Heminger","Well, that it all depended on the date - excuse me that the crude prices of the differentials when we get these projects complete. The other thing is that we have the flexibility to run about 70% of medium sours and heavier or 70% sweet. And every day we're going to optimize based on where the crude diffs are. So we're going to have tremendous flexibility to run a very high medium sour, heavy slate and residual destruction. But if the sweet markets are if you optimize with sweet then will be able to run sweet, but that's the benefit in our system is that we can go either direction.","Paul Cheng","Gary, you always been the statement for the industry, so any update about the temperature in DC related to the reform RFS, is that any remote sense that we may see something happen?","Gary Heminger","Let me ask Don to talk about this. Don's been very involved here recently meeting with a number of people in DC. And yes we are very, very involved in this. But let me have done to give you the details on the update.","Donald Templin","Sure, Paul. We have consistently believed that the RFS is broken and we need either significant reform or repeal. MPC has always been focused on a long term solution that in our view permanently addresses all the issues and problems with the RFS. Clearly the PES situation recently has that maybe put a little bit more focus on RIMs and the RFS. But our view is that you need to have a long term solution. And we're actually, fairly optimistic or optimistic about the legislative efforts that are ongoing in Washington D.C. led by Senator Cornyn and others and we think it will result in a solution that I think has some short term relief but more importantly has a long term solution to RFS eliminating the mandate and allowing our transportation fuels and other transportation fuels to be able to participate in a free market.","Paul Cheng","Don, Can you elaborate a little bit more in terms of what are changes that you guys think that it may happen?","Donald Templin","Well, I mean we've actually we've been having dialogue with a number of legislators and I guess we have some perspectives on things that we think will work. They've been - I think they need to make sure that they have a solution that works for the energy industry that works for the corn ethanol industry. So I think there's lots of perspectives that are currently being considered. We are hopeful that we should see legislation in the not too distant future Paul, but I think it's premature for us to try to speculate as to what that will be since a number of legislators are working on that.","Gary Heminger","And Paul, I can say that we have the right legislators at the table working on this. Senators Cornyn and Cruz along with Grassley and Ernst. Grassley and Ernst being from the Corn Belt states are all very involved. So we're both sides of the table working on this. And then on the house side, The Chairman, Walden along with our Congressman Shimkus are very, very involved. So they are the right people at the table trying to get this issue off a high center. And I'm fairly confident that we're going to get there this spring.","Paul Cheng","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Phil Gresh from JP Morgan.","Phil Gresh","Yeah. Hi, good morning. First question, I apologize if I missed it, I don't think you started. Do you have a new effective tax rate guidance that you think about following the tax reform and also perhaps how you might think about cash flow benefits from the tax reform, others have commented on the cashless side actually cash taxes trending below these book tax rates, so any thoughts there?","Gary Heminger","Yeah, Phil. We think that the effective tax rate is probably going to be a couple points below statutory in a going forward basis so we sort of guide you in that direction. We haven't given specific guidance as to the cash tax benefits but we have looked at 2017 sort of as if basis with tax reform and it's something in the order of $400 million to $500 million savings of cash taxes so again we're not giving specific forecast but it's certainly of that order of magnitude as we go forward.","Phil Gresh","Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. And then the second question would just be around capital allocation of the free cash flow above and beyond understanding capital spending and projects that you've highlighted, as you look at 2018, you think about the buybacks that you've completed in 2017 and where the balance sheet that. Is 2017 the right order of magnitude we thinking about from a buyback perspective then in this type of market or any color would be helpful?","Gary Heminger","Sure. Yeah and again we're not giving specific guidance but what we did indicate is that after tax cash proceeds from the drops which are closing today beyond what any adjustments we need to make to capital structure to support the investment grade credit profile would generally be targeted at some form of shareholder return. So again I would use that as your guide in terms of what you think the year could be, but it is share purchase continues to be an important vehicle for us to get capital back to shareholders. We think it is very tax efficient and I think you'll continue to see you know substantial activity there.","Phil Gresh","And how much is the tax and leakage at this point I think you at one point you talk about I think the exact numbers are getting back I guess with the new tax rates?","Gary Heminger","Yeah. I think Phil probably the best thing to do would be to just adjust down based on the new tax rates from where we're at in terms of what the absolute leakage around the distributions would be. We haven't given specific guidance as a lot of allocation work that's got to be done in order to determine what that will look like but I think at a macro level taking the new statutory rates at what we provided before is probably a pretty good starting point.","Phil Gresh","Okay. And last one, Gary any thoughts in M&A environment you seems reasonably upbeat on the last call particularly around retail midstream?","Gary Heminger","Well, there continues to be opportunities in the midstream. I think the number at the year, I would expect the midstream positions probably to heat up. We're very bullish on the midstream when you look at the couple of our biggest customers on the production side that they're talking about the big increase and drilling activity over the next couple years. We're bullish on the in the Marcellus, Utica area that we've seen very strong growth in both of those arenas. On top of that the Permian, overtime, there's been a number of assets put in place I think specifically were put in place eventually to put on the market does a more single one-off type assets. We continue to look at a number of those, but I think both in midstream and in retail, there are going to be some opportunities during 2018.","Phil Gresh","Thanks, Gary.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Brad Heffern from RBC Capital Markets.","Brad Heffern","Good morning, everyone. Just following-up on Phil's question about taxes, what's the reason that you guys would end up being below the statutory rate, is that just the new higher bonus depreciation?","Gary Heminger","Brad, the biggest piece is really the income allocation that we make to the publicly held units and MPLX so that that is even without tax reform there would have been a big impact on the effective tax rate. So that's the biggest driver of that to a couple of point difference between statutory and our effective guidance.","Brad Heffern","Okay. So at the corporate level you know excluding that MPLX impact as it just basically modelling you know around the statutory rate?","Timothy Griffith","That's probably the right way to start it, yeah and that's sort of the marginal statutory rate.","Brad Heffern","Okay, thanks for the color. And then Gary, you know obviously you've been focused on this value unlocking plan for the past year, 18 months and it's coming to an end year. Can you talk a little bit about from a corporate strategy standpoint, what we're going to be thinking about for MPC going forward, you know, there going to be a greater focus on Midstream or Speedway or we're going to talking about cash returns, just sort of what's the theme for 2018?","Gary Heminger","The answer is yes. You know I've been very clear in the presentations we made at the end of the year and in our presentation today. And we are increasing the capital budget by $150 million in Speedway this year from 3.80 to 5.30, a very strong - and I'll ask Mike Hennigan to talk in a second here about what he sees on the Midstream side and Tim just answered on our return to shareholders.","If you look since the beginning of MPC and specifically in 2017, very, very strong returns to shareholders both in dividends and share buybacks. You will continue to see as Tim just highlighted a significant amount of the after tax proceeds we received for these drops, it's going to be available for capital return to shareholders. Beyond that we see some very strong opportunities, Kristina's first question of the day a very strong opportunities in the refining side mainly around distillates production in our refineries.","And let ask Mike here to talk about what he is seeing in the Midstream side.","Mike Hennigan","Hey Brad. We're pretty bullish our organic capital plan for 2018 if you noticed we disclosed about $2 billion of capital spend. That comprises eight processing plants, six up in the Marcellus, Utica as Gary mentioned, one in the Stack and one in the Permian. So we're in the right locations as far as shale development. We're also going to add a fractionator up in the Marcellus area. We are going to add two of euthanizes up in the Marcellus which I think is another opportunity to starting to reveal itself ethane up in the North East. In addition to that, we're expanding crude pipelines Ozark up in the mid-continent as well as Wood River over to Patoka as well.","So we have a pretty full plate, execution will be a high priority for MPLX in 2018 as far as the identified capital. And then we have a couple of other opportunities that we're working on that will give some more diversified cash flows. So it's exciting time to be in Midstream and we're trying to get after it.","Brad Heffern","Great, thanks for all the color.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs.","Neil Mehta","Good morning, Tim. Thanks for taking the question. Gary, on same store sales in January, I am sorry if missed that, did you say they were down 1.7%, was there anything funky in there if that was the number or that a function of some macro-trend that you are seeing in gasoline and any comments in terms of the gasoline outlook here distillates definitely looks very bullish but just to start on the gasoline product side?","Gary Heminger","Yes, just it is very bullish but and Tony can give you more color but it's - let's hope it's non-recurring but it was the tremendous weather issues we had across the entire southeast, the southwest added as well but mainly the southeast all the way up to New York to region where you live. And then we had it across entire Ohio valley. But we've had two to three major ice storms and things just we're shutdown. And I think that proves out, if you look at this week's inventory number in the build in crude oil, it's just less of refineries not being able to run, fall out, a number of refineries having temporary blips mostly due to power outage, but all this kind of works together. I think it is a very temporary thing.","The other thing that Tony can speak to is we've had a very swift rising crude price and you have to be able to get that price to the street. So Tony, you want to how many restorations you've seen so far this year.","Anthony Kenney","Hi Gary. I think the two comments you've made is essentially the entire reason the same store is down as we are seeing it so far. Storm is the biggest impact, but as we see this rising commodity price environment, our wholesale cost has moved up in line with the rising crude prices. So in our efforts to pass that rising cost on to the street. We do incur some volume impact as a result of try to more or restore margins as well call it back to the levels where we think is appropriate given the environment.","Gary Heminger","Neil, let me say to your question and we had this in conference as well. I need the biggest macro change that you have seen in 2017 is that gasoline demand has outpaced where the expectations of the prognosticators are in the market. So outperformed very nicely in 2017. We would expect that to continue. Distillate continues to outperform. So both of those with the days of supply being very much in checked both gasoline and distillate as compared to five year average. I think build is very, very well on a macro standpoint for the refining industry.","Neil Mehta","I appreciate that Gary. One of the other things you talked about when we cut up a couple of weeks ago that you are generally constructive on the oil macro, those are view in 2017 as well and you are right. Can you just talk about the broader oil view that you had and then also talk about as one of the largest buyers OPEC buyers in the U.S. any thoughts on Saudi and OPEC going into through the year in terms of compliance?","Gary Heminger","Yeah, from a macro standpoint Neil, if you look at the crude inventories, very much in line and looking at a just over the last years a significant I would say rebalancing of crude oil across the entire system. So at your conference, we talked about where we think prices will be for the year and since your conference, I even becoming more bullish on where I think crude prices are going to go because of the resilience of the market, how the oil producers are continuing to I think be more constrained about incremental production coming into the market.","And I think on the U.S. production side, there is a very strong view of that they need to be careful on running too fast, too quickly in the marketplace. So I think you are going to see probably will get north of 70 this year on the crude price which I think boards well for the total utilization of refineries, they boards well for the drill bit that's going to satisfy the NGL producers and those markets as well. So I think from a macro standpoint, it's going to be a strong year. Now the caveat to that is when you continue to see an increase in price, you have to get that price to the street, going to have to get to the wholesale level as well as retail level.","However, inventories are in check and are in very good shape. And when you look at the first part of the year, I think they are going to see more turnarounds in the entire refining system and we very - some that are scheduled here in pad 2 earlier in the year than you would anticipate. And I think that again is going to put a very good balance underlying the refining system.","Let me ask Mike to talk here about what he sees as far as OPEC supply coming into the market.","Mike Hennigan","Yeah, Gary, I think you said it well. I mean OPEC is doing a great job with their production. Again Saudi Arabia kind of the king pin they basically said that they need to continue to constraining their full production through 2018. And I think they will. From our standpoint, we've had no problem replacing the term crude out of the Arabian Gulf that is no longer economic to us with other grades. We have tremendous flexibility within our refining system we can process the very heavy high sulfur, high acid crudes that not everyone can. So that's been a positive for us.","Neil Mehta","Thanks, everyone.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Doug Leggate","Thank you. Hi, good morning, everybody. Gary, I think it's the first time you've spoken this year, so happy New Year. Gary, the tax on the benefit on your cash flow, how does that change you are thinking about a more aggressive step up in your dividend versus buybacks going forward?","Gary Heminger","Doug, Happy New Year to you as well. I think we outlined it before that we see capital investment some new opportunities in refining, but the further advancement in retail and in our midstream space from an investment side, we've been very aggressive in capital return to shareholders in 2107. We accelerated our dividend from July now to early January here and a significant increase in our dividend. So we will continue that type of cadence as we see fit. We have great investment opportunities as well as we have great opportunities. And I think it's a good investment we all do here in returning capital to shareholders. So we will continue to stay on top of our game as we look to return of capital to shareholders.","Doug Leggate","A nice one for sure. I guess I really only have one other the big picture question Gary and like several of the guys over there if I could take advantage of your macro view and it really goes back to IMO and one of the things we're kind of thinking is that there are still some regions of the world with utilization rates and the diesel margins really improve as much as some folks think we could. My concern I guess is that we see a step up in utilization for example in Europe at the expense of gasoline supply in the Atlantic based meaning we end up what we supply in the gasoline markets. I was just wondering how much you thought about the scenarios as to how just can alternately play out in let's say at $70 oil world which I guess also changes the economics for shipping, decisions as always discover and so on. So I am just wondering how - what are the kind of scenarios you're thinking about best case, worst case for the IMO outcome? And I'll it there. Thanks.","Gary Heminger","Yes, Doug. We thought about those scenarios as well. One of the things that you have to look at in Europe and it is starting in the U.K. it's going to happen so other countries in Europe as well. But they're going to become more of a sponge for gasoline going forward. As you know it's always been historically that they pushed diesel into the marketplace and those benefits are have gone away. So I do think that you're going to see more demand for gasoline.","And the other thing is our exports, if you look at the rate of change of exports from the Gulf Coast, gasoline is becoming more and more prominent in the exports was to Latin America, South America, West Africa or into Europe. So Europe is still predominantly diesel, but it's going to increase. So yes, we look at those scenarios and we will continue to watch those very carefully. But right now, I think we are not only speak for MPC, we are very, very well positioned for this IMO changes coming. And if gasoline continues to pick up that's why we're investing in further distribution of capabilities both in Galveston Bay and Garyville to be able to take bigger cargoes of gasoline.","Doug Leggate","I appreciate the full answer Gary and congrats on a great year. Thanks again.","Gary Heminger","Thanks, Doug.","Operator","Thank you. We do have time for one final question. Our last question today is from Roger Read from Wells Fargo.","Roger Read","Yeah. Thank you. Good morning.","Gary Heminger","Hi, Roger.","Roger Read","Hey Gary. Just if we could catch up a little more on the retail since that's where your kind of incremental investments are coming on presuming didn't need the tax reform to make that happen. But with the slower growth we've seen in terms of I know January weather, but if you look at Q4 right on a per store basis, retail was down and the merchandise excuse me was down, in the fields were down. Is that a function of why you need to repurpose some of the stores or upgrade them I guess was the term used?","And then as we think about expansion is that a function of new markets or better locations within existing markets, just going to understand want to understand if it's a regional growth story or stepping into a new region?","And then the last part of the retail question since it was asked about midstream any retail acquisitions that are possible or look attractive in this environment?","Gary Heminger","Sure. Tony, you want to take Roger's first questions and I will take rest.","Tony Kenney","I'd be happy to Gary. First of all let me remind you the comps you're looking at when you mention the trends in the fourth quarter and actually for the full year, remember we formed this joint venture with pilot, so we moved sales margin expenses out of the detailed categories into an equity earnings component. So you will see some natural variances on those just because of the formation of venture. However, your point is correct there is some softness in what we look at is transaction counts inside of our store. But again, we think that our plans, the technology investment, our loyalty program, the focus on the consumer that we have, those are all and actually the priorities and some of the growth areas and some of the store that we're investing that capital that Gary mentioned earlier, will be around so high growth areas like food service for example in convenience store. I think we've got a very good program to continue to grow and invest on the remodel part of that capital that Gary talked about.","As far as the new builds, rebuilds, our focus is going to continue to be and we've consistently said this. We're going to be in the footprint of MPC's supply chain. I mean that's part of the synergies and the value that we have seen over the years that we continue to tell the market about in terms of the integration benefits of Speedway with MPC supply. So when you look at our footprint, you look at our foothold in the Midwest and some of the new markets we have on our eastern markets. Those are really good MPC supply areas and therefore we want to take advantage of those synergies by investing our stores where we can take advantage of the synergies with supply.","And the last point on acquisitions. We don't say anything specific about that. But the industry as a whole my observation would be is that is consolidating, there needs to be some consolidation, it's a very fragmented convenient store industry, so I think there's going to be opportunities in the future to look at some acquisitions in our primary footprint.","Roger Read","Okay.

My name is Sylvia, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Tim Griffith. Tim Griffith, you may begin.","Timothy T. Griffith","Okay. Thank you, Sylvia. And again, welcome to Marathon Petroleum Corporation's First Quarter 2014 Earnings Webcast and Conference Call. The synchronized slides that accompany this call can be found on our website at marathonpetroleum.com under the Investor Center tab.","On the call today are Gary Heminger, President and CEO; Don Templin, Senior Vice President and CFO; Mike Palmer, Senior Vice President of Supply, Distribution and Planning; Pam Beall, Senior Vice President of Corporate Planning and Government and Public Affairs and President of MPLX; and Rich Bedell, Senior Vice President of Refining.","We invite you to read the Safe Harbor statement on Slide 2. It's a reminder that we will be making forward-looking statements during the presentation and during the question-and-answer session. Actual results may differ materially from what we expect today. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included here, as well as in our filings with the SEC.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Gary Heminger for opening remarks and highlights.","Gary R. Heminger","Thanks, Tim, and good morning, and thank you for joining our call. We reported this morning that we generated nearly $200 million of income during the first quarter despite the number of challenges. The MPC team successfully completed significant turnaround activity at our 2 largest refineries in Galveston Bay and Garyville.","This was the first turnaround at Galveston Bay since we acquired the facility in February of last year, and we were pleased to complete the work on schedule with no major surprises. This project, along with other maintenance work across our operations, made up the largest quarterly combined turnaround activity in our history, with expenditures of approximately $470 million for the quarter. This continued investment in our system helps ensure we maintain the highest levels of asset integrity, and enables us to drive continued top-tier operational performance.","Market conditions during the first quarter were challenging. Volatile but generally narrower crude differentials were partially offset by higher crack spreads. Adverse weather conditions in the form of low temperatures and heavy snow accumulations in most of our markets brought challenges to the entire supply chain, from crude deliveries to the gas pump. Despite the market challenges and adverse weather conditions, I was very pleased with the team's focus on strong operational performance.","We also continued to diversify our asset portfolio during the quarter. On April 1, we expanded our renewable fuels capabilities with the purchase of a biodiesel manufacturing facility in Cincinnati, Ohio. This facility has the capacity of approximately 60 million gallons per year of biodiesel and is well positioned, logistically, near the Ohio River. This facility fits well with our existing marine and terminal system.","We also acquired an additional 7% interest in Explorer Pipeline, which increased our ownership interest to 25% in that system. This investment is consistent with our strategic objective of meaningfully growing our midstream portfolio and adding to the stable cash flow segments of our business.","Despite the challenging market conditions in our Refining & Marketing segment, we returned $812 million of capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in the quarter. Don will provide more information on this activity shortly, but I want to highlight that we remain confident in our ability to generate cash to continue our balanced approach to investing in value-enhancing investments in the business and returning capital to our shareholders over the long term.","We are encouraged by the signs of improving market conditions, with Refining returning to full run rates that support our positive outlook for the business.","Market dynamics, including inventory levels and continued increases in domestic production, are leading to widening crude differentials, which we believe will persist for some time. And with that, I'll turn over to Don to review our financial performance for the quarter.","Donald C. Templin","Thanks, Gary. Slide 4 provides earnings both on an absolute and per share basis. Our first quarter 2014 earnings were $199 million compared to $725 million in the first quarter of 2013. First quarter 2014 earnings include pretax settlement expenses of $64 million, which we've historically been presenting as a special item in arriving at adjusted earnings.","First quarter earnings were also impacted by a $29 million pretax accrual for 2013 bonuses that were paid in 2014. As you know, our bonuses are based on relative performance to our peer group, and certain of that information was not available until 2014.","Earnings per diluted share were $0.67 for the first quarter of 2014. We reported EPS of $2.17 per share for the same period last year.","The waterfall chart on Slide 5 shows by segment the change in earnings from the first quarter of 2013 to the first quarter of 2014. The primary driver for the change was the decrease in Refining & Marketing segment income.","As shown on Slide 6, Refining & Marketing segment income from operations was $362 million in the first quarter of 2014 compared with $1.1 billion in the first quarter of 2013. The changes from 2013 was primarily due to the narrowing crude oil differentials and higher direct operating costs, partially offset by wider crack spreads. Results were also impacted by refining throughputs, which were lower than expected due to heavy turnaround activity and severe weather in the quarter.","The unfavorable earnings impacts associated with the narrowing crude oil differentials are found in the columns for the sweet\/sour differential and the LLS to WTI differential.","The increase in direct operating costs quarter-over-quarter is primarily due to the significant turnarounds that occurred in the first quarter that Gary referred to earlier, as well as an additional month of operating expenses associated with the Galveston Bay refinery. Our earnings were favorably impacted by wider crack spreads as reflected in the LLS 6-3-2-1 crack.","All of the gross margin indicators utilized spot market values and an estimated mix of crude purchases and products sold. As a result, differences in our actual product price realizations, mix and crude costs quarter-to-quarter, as well as various other items like refinery yields, are reflected in the other gross margin column, which was a $148 million net benefit versus the same quarter last year.","Turning to Speedway segment results from Slide 7. Income from operations were $58 million in the first quarter of 2014, compared with $67 million in the first quarter of last year. The cold weather impacted all aspects of Speedway's business. Light product gross margin was about $8 million lower in the first quarter of 2014 compared with the first quarter of 2013. The decrease was primarily due to $0.015 per gallon lower gross margin.","Merchandise margin was $192 million in the first quarter of 2014 compared with $184 million in the same period last year. This $8 million increase was primarily due to higher merchandise sales and higher merchandise margins.","Speedway's operating and other expenses were also $9 million higher during the first quarter of 2014 compared to the first quarter of 2013, primarily driven by an increase in store count and additional operating costs associated with keeping our facility safe for our customers during the adverse weather conditions. On a same-store basis, gasoline sales volumes decreased 0.7%, and merchandise sales, excluding cigarettes, increased 5.3% in the first quarter of 2014 compared with the 2013 first quarter.","In April 2014, we've seen a slight decline in demand, with an approximately 1% decrease in same-store gasoline sales volumes versus the prior year, primarily due to higher average gasoline street prices.","Slide 8 shows changes in our Pipeline Transportation segment income. Income from operations was $72 million in the first quarter of 2014 compared with $51 million in the first quarter of 2013. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in transportation revenue and pipeline affiliate income, partially offset by higher operating expenses.","$17 million of the $22 million increase in transportation revenue is attributable to the recognition of deferred transportation credits during the quarter. The remainder was primarily due to higher average tariff rates.","Slide 9 presents the significant drivers of changes in our cash flow for the first quarter of 2014. At March 31, 2014, our cash balance was nearly $2.2 billion. Operating cash flow before changes in working capital was a $641 million source of cash.","A long-term debt increase of $264 million is primarily associated with MPLX's acquisition of additional midstream assets from MPC. As Gary highlighted, we continued delivering on our commitment to return capital to shareholders, with $689 million of share repurchases and $123 million of dividends paid in the first quarter.","Slide 10 shows that at the end of the first quarter, we had nearly $2.2 billion of cash and approximately $3.7 billion of debt. With EBITDA of about $3.9 billion during the last 12 months, we continue to be in a very manageable debt position, with leverage of 0.9x EBITDA and a debt-to-total capital ratio of 25%.","Turning to Slide 11. During the last 12 months, we generated $2.1 billion in cash from operations and $550 million of free cash flow. Over this period, we've returned $3.5 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. This was more than 6x our free cash flow over that period.","During the first quarter of 2014, we purchased approximately 8 million shares for $689 million through open market repurchases. It is our intention to continue returning capital to our shareholders that is not currently needed to support the operational and investment needs of the business, and we continue to believe share repurchases are the most efficient way to do so.","There was $1.17 billion outstanding on our share repurchase authorization as of March 31, 2014. We intend to remain focused around our efforts to balance careful investment in the business with returning capital to our shareholders.","Slide 12 provides updated outlook information on key operating metrics for MPC for the second quarter of 2014. For comparative purposes, those same metrics for the second quarter of 2013 are also shown. Please note that estimated pension settlement expense is now included in the outlook information for corporate and on other unallocated items.","With the recent published requirements around Tier 3 gasoline, I also wanted to provide an update on our projected compliance costs. Based on our current understanding of the standards and the changes necessary to our system, we broadly estimate that the costs could range from $750 million to $1 billion, and would be incurred between now and the end of 2019. We will continue to refine these estimates as well as identify opportunities to reduce the impact. I will note that the capital spending outlook we shared with you at our Investor Day in December included estimates for these costs.","Now, I will turn the call back over to Tim Griffith.","Timothy T. Griffith","Thanks, Don. [Operator Instructions] With that, Sylvia, we're prepared to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we have Ed Westlake from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just on, obviously, the quarter there was obviously a lot of turnarounds at Galveston and Garyville. I -- Do you have a number for the opportunity costs? And then maybe if there were any sort of self-help improvements you've made at those refineries in terms of future profitability, if you could give us some color as to what changes you've made to the assets during the turnaround, if any.","Gary R. Heminger","Yes, Ed. We calculate the lost opportunity was approximately $150 million due to the maintenance activities that we had the first quarter. And we're very pleased with the -- as Galveston Bay has come back up and the run rates and how it's performing, and the same way with Garyville. Recall at Garyville we did 2 things. We had our normal maintenance of around the crude unit, but then we also had also did the big hydrocracker expansion. And Rich, you want to take a couple of minutes to talk about what you did at Garyville?","Richard D. Bedell","Yes, the hydrocracker expansion was one we talked about at the investor meeting last year. And that's where we took the capacity from 90,000 to 110,000 barrels a day, and that's online and running just fine. We did the -- there was a crude unit component to that distillate project that was done last fall and that was another 10,000 of distillate.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Great. And then a separate question just on the Mid-Con. Obviously, there's a lot of crude that's sloshing down to the Gulf, and that's helping profitability in the Gulf, but the Mid-Con crude markets seem relatively tight at the moment. I'm just -- any color in terms of what you're seeing in terms of the Mid-Con crude balances for light and heavy.","Gary R. Heminger","Let me turn that over to Mike.","C. Michael Palmer","Yes. Ed, right now, I don't think that there's anything particularly about the Mid-Con. I mean, I think you're referring to the lower balances of Cushing. And certainly, those balances are lower, but I think that really when we look out here at the second quarter, I think that what we're seeing right now are differentials are starting to come our way. The Brent TI spread has been widening. We're starting to see that some of this length that we've seen in the DOE numbers on inventories, we're starting to see that the differentials are starting to react to that. So it looks like we're heading into a pretty good period for crude differentials.","Operator","And we have Paul Cheng from Barclays.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Gary, after this major turnaround, do you view Galveston Bay now, from a hardware standpoint, has been raised to the standard that you want or that you need another turnaround cycle before you would get there?","Gary R. Heminger","Sure, Paul. And it's good to hear from you, I haven't heard from you in the last couple of quarters. And so the Galveston Bay turnaround, we're very pleased, and no, I don't think it takes another cycle. Of course, we will continue to improve as we go through the cycles. But then as I said in my remarks, we didn't have any surprises. And we implemented a -- our planning model and our plant maintenance model for doing turnarounds, we implemented that. We started it last year but this is the first big turnaround. And we had very, very good results of being able to control the timing, control the cost. And I'll turn it over to Rich to how he sees the plant, but as I said to Ed Westlake's question, we're very pleased coming out of this turnaround what we're seeing, and how we're seeing the crude unit run.","Richard D. Bedell","Yes, Paul. We just -- this was a sort of a basic turnaround where we went in and did a lot of cleaning and upgrading in both the crude unit and the rig [ph] Unit. It was our first chance to get a full turnaround in any of the units there. There are additional turnarounds out in the future years, '16 and '17 and -- but the upgrades on these were -- there's no big capital improvements on these units. Those will be continuing as we evaluate those opportunities. It was really just a routine turnaround.","Gary R. Heminger","And Paul, as we continue down the path here, and this was always in our original plan, we will continue to upgrade the safety environmental -- or excuse me, safety instrumented systems and relief valve projects. We'll continue to update those in coordination with our turnarounds. But as I said, very pleased with the management team there, very pleased with the workforce and how they were able to complete this turnaround.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","The second question I think is for Don and Mike, maybe I get 2 parts here. Don, on the corporate unallocated the first half runway [ph] seems to be about for the -- in the Refining business, about in the $200 million, $210 million a quarter, which is lower than what in the past. Is that a reasonable run rate going forward that we can use? And secondly, for Mike, any way to estimate what is the PADD III total crude storage capacity that you can share?","Donald C. Templin","Paul, I missed the first part of your question -- this is Don. I missed the first part of your question.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","If I look at in the first quarter and also your second quarter guideline on the corporate and other allocated item in the Refining business, seems to be now running at 200 million to 210 million barrels -- sorry, to $210 million a quarter, which is lower than the historical past. And so my question is that on a going forward basis, is that a reasonable run rate that we can use?","Donald C. Templin","Yes. I -- Paul, I believe that corporate and unallocated, it is -- that's a normal -- a more normalized rate. I will add though, that we will have pension settlement expense that goes into that number. This year, our pension settlement expense occurred this -- in the first quarter. Last year, our big charge for pension settlement expense occurred in the second quarter. So you would expect and you see it in our guidance here, you'd expect to see about $60 million of pension settlement expense into second quarter of '13, and our outlook for the second quarter of '14 is about $5 million. Mike?","C. Michael Palmer","Yes, okay, Paul. We had our economics group take a look at the inventory capacity in PADD III. And they tell us that the EIA estimates at about 273 million barrels. Of that, there's something like 73 million barrels in refinery tankage. So that's the information that we have, Paul.","Operator","We have Doug Terreson from ISI Group.","Douglas Terreson - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Staying with refinery costs, is there any segmentation on 100,000 barrels per day of loss throughput between turnarounds and whether -- is there any insight into the mix there?","Gary R. Heminger","Let me answer it this way, Doug. A lot of it was due to weather, and it wasn't necessarily crude but the subable was feedstocks, and we had planned because we have these 2 big turnarounds, being able to move feedstocks between refineries and moved some of the feedstocks back up into the Midwest during that period of time. And the polar vortex, we would get one in the Midwest and turnaround the next week, and get one in the Gulf Coast. And it kept hampering our ability to move some of the feedstocks that we have planned to move on the water, up the river system, as well as from refinery to refinery. So I would say more than 1\/2 of it was due to the feedstock movements.","Douglas Terreson - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, I see. And then just to clarify, Gary, a minute ago, you mentioned that the opportunity cost was around $150 million. And then, when you think about the higher turnaround expenses versus 1 year ago, which looked to me to be about over $380 million. It seems like these 2 factors affected profits by $400 million, $500 million versus the year ago period. Is that the way you guys are thinking about it?","Gary R. Heminger","Yes, it is, Doug. I believe, Don, it was about $300 million incremental?","Donald C. Templin","Yes, the incremental turnaround cost was about $300 million, Doug, you got that, correct.","Gary R. Heminger","So, and then around -- another $150 million of what we call lost opportunity. And then just some of the incremental demurrage cost you're setting with fog-related issues going back and forth with -- trying to move from refinery to refinery on the water would have had some additional operating costs that was not included in this number.","Donald C. Templin","And Doug, I think there's -- the $300 million is a pretax number. The $150 million that Gary was talking to you about was an after-tax number. So make sure we're not mixing apples and oranges there.","Douglas Terreson - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's not an insignificant number either way.","Operator","And we have Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Gary, can I ask you to dig a little bit deeper into the capture rate? One of the moving parts that we don't really get great transparency on is rack margins. And I'm just wondering if you could help us understand a little bit of what's happening there sequentially from Q4 to Q1, but also how things are kind of shaping up as oil prices kind of start to stabilize here a little bit. And I've got a follow-up, please.","Gary R. Heminger","Sure, Doug. As you know, that is one of our probably biggest competitive advantages and -- is our logistics system and our terminals and the way we can move products, and therefore, I can't get into the rack margins on a quarter-to-quarter basis or even a current basis. But I will say, if you look at the inventories and if you look at the inventories Q4, looked at the inventories Q1 and looked at them by PADD, and you can see where there have been some real challenges in the marketplace of being able to supply some markets. And I think that can give you a hint that there's some markets that have been very advantageous to supply.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So is it fair to assume that you guys can benefit from that in the current quarter as oil prices stabilize?","Gary R. Heminger","It's not necessarily driven by oil prices, it's delivered -- it's driven by supply and how you can get that supply into the market. So yes, we have been able to move our product into some very key markets and, I think, have done very well being able to accomplish that.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I guess, I was just assuming there was some kind of lag effect on tight oil prices denting your margins and then things kind of stabilize out again. But I'll take it off-line. [indiscernible]","Gary R. Heminger","But you are -- Doug, you are correct. The higher oil prices, if you go all the way down to the retail level and looked at Speedway's performance for the quarter, being able to, with higher oil prices, move that price all the way to the street at the retail level, it takes time to be able to accomplish that. And so you are correct there on how the oil prices reflect. But I would say, from a wholesale standpoint, it's really been driven more by the supply and, again, some weather-related issues, being able to get that supply into the marketplace both first quarter and as we lean into the second quarter.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I appreciate that, Gary. My follow-up, I'm not sure who wants to take this, but it's really going more back to the inventory situation on the Gulf Coast and the shift that we've seen from PADD II to PADD III. I'm just curious on your opinion on this because utilization rates and yourselves included have, obviously, you're doing a terrific job running as hard as you possibly can, I guess, for the whole industry as well as Marathon. But because of that it seems that on an adjusted basis, supply basis that inventories in the Gulf may not be as tight as they look. So I'm just kind of curious on your perspective on how that plays out as we go into peak run rate season, if you like, in terms of your expectations for how those differentials relative to Brent could play out, how we get there.","C. Michael Palmer","Yes, Doug, this is Mike Palmer. And it's an interesting comment you make with regard to days of supply because I think you're right. When you do the calculation, the days of supply that we have right now, the calculation that you guys went through, I think, is right. The days supply is not in that bad a shape. But I guess what we expect to have happen is we do know that these inventories are building. And we've been surprised that we haven't seen more of a differentials widening on the sweet crude than what we've seen to date. In fact, we've seen probably a little more on the sour side. So what we expect is, as these inventories continue to build, we do expect to see the light differentials widen out a bit and give us an opportunity.","Operator","And our next question comes from Chi Chow from Macquarie Capital.","Chi Chow - Macquarie Research","Mike, I just want to follow-up on that last comment there when you said the sours are widening out more than the sweets. What is causing that? Is there a specific dynamic you're seeing on the relative weakness on the mediums?","C. Michael Palmer","Well, I think, probably a part of that is just due to individual refinery issues that have occurred in the Gulf. So as we watch these differentials kind of, not just on a monthly basis but on a daily basis, we've seen opportunities where the sour crudes -- the sour Gulf of Mexico crudes have looked pretty attractive, and that will constantly shift. I think right now, it's starting to shift back more in favor of the light sweets.","Chi Chow - Macquarie Research","We can't really see the data on our end with the details. But how do you see the inventories in the Gulf Coast stacking up between the Texas Gulf Coast region and Louisiana? And are there some inefficiencies still in getting barrels into St. James that may be holding up that LLS price?","C. Michael Palmer","I think, there still are inefficiencies in the Gulf Coast. I think that's very true. I mean, the most dramatic thing that we've seen, I think, would have to come back to Midland. And if you track West Texas sour or if you track Midland WTI, I think you've seen that those differentials have widened out. So the capacity, the pipeline capacity to move barrels out of the Midland area has certainly been a factor. We don't have a lot of great data with regard to inventories in the different parts of the Gulf either, but we suspect that probably there are some additional inventory in the Nederland area. Again, as the pipes have expanded and allowed crude to move down into Nederland, we're not sure that the takeaway logistics have kept pace. So that may be, those 2 areas may be where we're seeing a reasonable amount of this Gulf Coast surplus.","Gary R. Heminger","Chi, this is Gary, let me add a couple more comments. So in fact, we were just yesterday, looking at some of the production that's coming in -- the new production that's coming in from the Gulf this year, and that's going to really land over in the St. James area and some significant increase in the Gulf Coast production. So that's something to keep an eye on. And the other thing that we're watching very carefully is as you look at inventory growing in the Gulf Coast, therefor PADD III and how that has continued to grow, week after week, I think the DOE showed yesterday, was up 5.7 million barrels of additional inventory, is the time that it starts backing up to the Mid-Con or backing up to Cushing is where we're keeping a close eye on that to show how much inventory, as Mike related earlier how much inventory or shelf capacity there is in the Gulf Coast. As that starts to fill up in the -- in PADD III and move back to Cushing is when you know that, I think, things are going to even lighten out more.","Chi Chow - Macquarie Research","All right, a lot of dynamics going on right now. Just as a follow-up on Gary, I just want to ask if you had any updated views on how regulators in Washington may be considering the whole discussion on crude oil exports, changes in the Jones Act, RFS, any updated thoughts on that end?","Gary R. Heminger","We continue to be -- work on these issues and be very close to the discussions back in the mid part of the quarter we had some meetings on the export","discussions. And then at the same -- in the same discussions talked about how inefficient the Jones Act is to the transportation sector and how inefficient the renewable fuel system is to being able to deliver products to consumers. And I will say all of that is caught up with a number of other discussions that are going on in D.C. right now, and I don't see any movement on any of those. Of course, we're waiting on the final rule to come out of the EPA on the ethanol blending requirement for this year. Still expecting that. That's probably going to be the latter part of this quarter before we hear what the final rule making is on the ethanol blend component for this year. A lot of discussion continues on with the Jones Act, but I think Senator Landrieu was very forward in her comments that she does not support any change to that legislation. So accompanied with the Jones Act and very top level Discussion on crude oil exports. We don't see anything moving on either side.","Chi Chow - Macquarie Research","Okay. Was there a general acknowledgment that all these issues are somewhat interrelated and it's not -- that everything has to be considered, I suppose?","Gary R. Heminger","I would say that most of the folks that we have met with understand that this is a dynamic situation and that you just can't peel the onion back one layer and come up with a decision. You have to look at the total market. And yes, there totally is an understanding of the dynamics involved.","Operator","And we have Paul Sankey, Wolfe Research, online with a question.","Paul I. Sankey - Wolfe Research, LLC","Gary, there's been obviously a ton of questions on the turnarounds, and I think you fairly clearly stated that these were not capital improvement cost overruns, they were more weather related. What I was wondering is the extent to which now, looking forward, creep is back. You're coming out of these turnarounds with higher capacity and, I assume, yet higher ability to run light sweets. Can you just talk about the outlook for how the industry is increasing its capacity and specifically Marathon is and the extent to which you were able to increase your light sweet throughputs by the same token?","Gary R. Heminger","Yes. And I think that -- and I stated on one of the first calls on the turnaround we're very pleased with how Galveston Bay came out. And anytime you'd want to do a big revamp and turnaround of a crude unit, you would expect that it's going to run better than as you go into a turnaround. It's just going to run better. As I look at creep across the entire industry, it certainly is hard to separate between creep and those who have just -- are replacing a medium barrel with a lighter barrel, therefore you can get more throughput in a crude unit, generally. So it's really hard, Paul, to calculate creep. I'll let Mike or Rich here add into what they're seeing in the industry and\/or our refining.","Paul I. Sankey - Wolfe Research, LLC","Yes, Gary, I mean, if I could interrupt. So is it -- can you give us a sense as to how your capacity specifically has grown? Just for example, as we head for summer, is it a given percentage higher than it was 1 year ago? And any observations, obviously, on the industry would also be very interesting.","Gary R. Heminger","So yes, Mike's prepared to talk about that.","C. Michael Palmer","Yes, Paul, let me just give you a couple of thoughts, I guess, that I have and maybe Rich can add to it. But it's very interesting. In the first quarter, kind of Gary alluded to some of the weather-related issues we had. But one of the problems that we had during the first quarter was that we were buying light sweet crude and it was not being delivered. There were production issues, there were issues with moving crude by water. The trains were a problem. Our big problem in the first quarter, one of them, was that we weren't getting all the light sweet crude that we were trying to buy, and we're now just now starting to come out of that. The other thing that I would say is that the amount of light sweet crude that refineries can run, there are hard limits that Rich can talk about, but it's very much a function of pricing. And I can tell you that within our system, we still need to see wider discounts when we look at, for example, Light Louisiana Sweet versus Gulf of Mexico sour or Mars. We see these differentials really kind of on the breakeven so that we go either way from week to week. So I think once we start to see additional production of the shale crudes, we should get to a point where it really gives us incentive to bring more of this light sweet crude in the system, which we can still do. Up to this point, that -- we have not run into any problems with regard to how much we can run. We can run more.","Paul I. Sankey - Wolfe Research, LLC","So could you give us a number on that? Is it 100,000, 200,000, 300,000 more a day?","C. Michael Palmer","Well, I don't -- I'm not sure that I can really give you a good number. As I say, it's a function of price.","Paul I. Sankey - Wolfe Research, LLC","Okay, good answer. But okay, interesting. Was I going to...","Pamela K. M. Beall","Oh.","Richard D. Bedell","Plus, I guess, Paul, the other question you had about are we increasing our crude capacity, nameplate-wise, we're not doing that now. We usually do that based on a full year run in what we do. But coming out of the turnaround, especially with Galveston Bay and Garyville, you're coming out with clean exchangers. Everything's ready to go, and we typically run a little bit more during those time periods. But when we talk about our overall refining capacity, we use the annual averages.","Paul I. Sankey - Wolfe Research, LLC","Great. And I just had a follow-up, which is the old question about how much you're exporting of what products and the same store sales demand numbers that you're seeing.","Gary R. Heminger","Yes, Mike will take care of the export numbers.","Donald C. Templin","So Paul, this is Don. Our exports for the first quarter were 223,000 barrels a day, and of that amount about 50,000 barrels a day was gasoline.","C. Michael Palmer","Yes, and let me just add to that, Paul, by saying that our exports in the first quarter were down, and they were certainly impacted by the turnaround activity that we had. We didn't have the volumes to export that we would have without the turnarounds. And as we got out of the first quarter back into the April kind of time period, I think we're returning to more normal levels.","Operator","Okay. And our next question comes from Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I guess my question, Gary, there's a lot of embedded value in MPC, and I'm sure that drives the buyback and then drives the buyback condition for you. But on midstream specifically, do you believe that MPC is being valued or fully credited for the embedded midstream value at the C-corp? And how do you think about ways to potentially call that out or pull that forward?","Gary R. Heminger","Well, that's a very pertinent question, Evan. And no, I do not believe that -- as we started the MLP in October of 2012, that's one of the key factors that we looked at as a lot of people advised, they saw that value. That value has not pulled through. I think a very small part of that value has pulled through into MPC. We certainly are being recognized with MPLX and how we're growing MPLX, and we're -- it's being recognized not only on the amount of drop-down capacity that we have but also the organic work that we've been doing and how we're trying to get ahead of the curve on the organic work being the Sandpiper-SAX pipeline that we spoke about, the incremental investment in Explorer, and we talked about the splitters. So that is being recognized -- it's being recognized with MPLX that we're growing that midstream reserve, if you will. But it still is not being pulled through at the level that we think we deserve. And that was a big part of our analyst briefing that we had in December, is that we still believe, and it's why we continue to buy back shares, is that we believe there's a tremendous value still embedded within our strong and stable cash flow businesses that is not being fully recognized.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Do you think a faster or bigger pace of monetizations would result in unlocking the value at the MPC level?","Gary R. Heminger","We continue to look at the pace. In fact, I think the market has been very, very receptive of the rhythm that we've put in place within MPLX. To go in and say, let's just do a faster monetization is -- that is -- also can lead to destroying value if you do not have, again, this reserve base teed up. So I think it's a delicate balance, a fine line in what that rhythm of growth. And you just take the compounding effect out for a number of years at the growth rate that we have been public with in our midstream business so -- in between a 15% to 20% number, and that compounding is -- becomes quite a big number quickly. And that's why we've been so aggressive, and I think we've been very fortunate in how we're growing this business and growing the stable. But we continue to look at our rate of growth, continue to look at our midstream assets. Pam Beall is here with us who is the President of MPLX. Pam, do you want to add anything to this?","Pamela K. M. Beall","Well, really Gary, I think you summed it up right. We think that we created MPLX to participate in the growth and build out the infrastructure to support the production of oil and natural gas. We also did it to highlight the substantial value that our midstream assets can provide to MPC and the flexibility it provides to the company. We think a more measured pace is the right way to go to retain flexibility both for MPC, and we think that's what the MLP's investment community really favors, is the ability to see that the MLP, especially sponsored MLP, have a long runway of potential growth potential. Because part of the total return is the growth rate, and part of the return is [indiscernible]. We like this measured approach.","Gary R. Heminger","And I'll say, Evan, that you'll recall my closing remarks in our analyst meeting in December were that we're going to grow our stable cash flow businesses, and that being midstream and retail, and we've been very successful in the balance of the fourth quarter and the first quarter of continuing to add to those base.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I mean, that's a good segue for a question to the retail, another segment that's valued in the market on a higher stand-alone basis. I mean, how do you think about that segment or even MLP potential within the wholesale fuels business or even, conversely, retail inorganic growth potential? I'll leave it there.","Gary R. Heminger","Right. You're right, Evan. And the way we look at this is that we have multiple levels of optionality. The -- we are fully aware of some of those different structures. But I also want to be consistent that we believe there's a tremendous value and a value around synergy within MPC of having this very strong retail base and knowing how you're going to move your product and the efficiencies of moving your product through the marketplace that we've been able to capture historically. However, that does not say that we will forever maintain that type of a structure. We're fully aware, and we continue to do a lot of analysis on what the best way forward would be. And -- but for now, we think we're in a very good position.","Operator","And now we have Roger Read, Wells Fargo Securities, online with a question.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I guess one follow-up off of Galveston Bay following the turnaround. I think Paul asked it earlier, Paul Cheng. But now that you've done the turnaround and you're thinking about how the unit operates relative to what it was doing before or what you think it can do now, can you give us any quantifiable way to think about how the unit runs better, whether it's a yield, whether it's lower cost, a combination of the 2?","Gary R. Heminger","All right, I'll let -- Rich, you want to please handle this?","Richard D. Bedell","Well, we definitely see better yields, better cut points that -- off of the crude unit that just went through the turnaround. And again, you get a little bit better throughput, too, because of the clean exchangers, but the cuts are also much better, especially between resid and gas oil. So we're seeing that, and that's just a matter of getting everything cleaned up and running it. So there wasn't any real big revamp of the unit. It's all based on just getting it in better condition.","Gary R. Heminger","And Roger, you'll recall at the analyst meeting that I said at the end we need 1 more year to really get our arms around and get this plant running like we want it. This was the first big turnaround that we've accomplished, and we accomplished it under our control of how we do turnarounds, and that went very well. So my outlook -- and I know Rich and I spent a lot of time on this, our outlook for this refinery is that with the strides that we've made in a very short time, we're expecting it to get better and better. And -- but the thing I want to come back on, we're very impressed with the workforce that we acquired when we bought this plant. And they know how to run refineries, and we have a great management team there as well. So I'm very pleased with what we're seeing on the front end.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, so that's helpful. So a quick summary would be you feel better about the acquisition today than you did at the time you made it in terms of just the quantifiable things you can achieve with it?","Gary R. Heminger","I felt very good on the day we announced the acquisition, and I even feel better.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then the last question I had, just on the exports. Obviously, you addressed the issues that held them back in Q1. You've had time to spend a little money and time expanding some of the key side issues and then the work here at Galveston Bay. So if you were to think about what max export capacity is, can you give us an idea of what that is today and maybe what that'll do over the next 12 to 24 months?","Gary R. Heminger","Well, what we've said, Roger, in our Analyst Day briefing, as well as I believe we updated this in the fourth quarter, we would expect by 2016 to be able to move this out to around 450,000 to 475,000 barrels per day of exports by -- in that time frame. I mean, in fact, I think it's 2018 because we have to tie the kind of the last piece to a turnaround that we have scheduled down the road.","Donald C. Templin","Yes, I would say Roger, this is Don, our view before that sort of major incremental leap is that we would get to about 350,000 barrels a day, and then there will be an incremental leap that will take us -- that will require capital but will get us then to that 475,000 number that Gary referred to.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So you did I think it was about 250,000 in the third quarter and a similar level in the fourth quarter, fell back a little bit here and then what, by 1 year from now the 350,000? Or are we thinking more like 2 years to get to that level?","Donald C. Templin","Well, for the fourth quarter, I think we were just under 300,000 barrels a day. So that incremental 50,000, I think, will -- we're doing a great job of evaluating how to be more efficient and how to make sure that we're maximizing the product placement with crude receipts and with making sure that we're taking advantage of both the availability at Garyville and at Galveston Bay. So I think the 350,000 is not that far away from the 300,000 that we had at the end of the fourth quarter -- or for the fourth quarter.","Operator","And our next question comes from Blake Fernandez from Howard Weil.","Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","I had a question for you on condensate splitters. Gary, I know you've already kind of addressed your thoughts on crude exports, but there had been some rumblings in the industry from the E&P side that they may be able to export condensate, and it seems like some of your peers are taking a little bit more of a measured approach to it. If I recall, I'm looking at some of your previous slide packs, you had a decent amount of spending in '14 on condensate splitters. So just any updated thoughts there, I would appreciate it.","Gary R. Heminger","Right. Blake, the condensate splitters that we've talked about on the front end here of our business and technical plan are in Canton and Catlettsburg. So they're really all around the Utica and Marcellus, which would not -- I don't think would -- because of the transportation costs to be able to move the river system, that I don't see that the Utica and Marcellus really tees up that well for export. So I'll ask Rich to talk about the spending that we plan and the timing that we have planned for Canton and Catlettsburg, and those 2 splitters are ongoing right now.","Richard D. Bedell","Yes, the Canton project will be completed at the end of this year. And then in the second quarter, we'll have the Catlettsburg project finished. Canton is 25,000 barrels a day, and Catlettsburg is 35,000 barrels a day of the condensate.","Gary R. Heminger","So -- and so that is all Midwest production at, I should say, really Eastern side of PADD II production that will go into those splitters. And I understand that the measured approach and the desire by some to be able to look at condensate splitting or -- condensate that has been split for export, and we'll continue to see how that moves down the path.","Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","Perfect, that's helpful. The second question was, I guess, more a clarification. I think you mentioned in the prepared remarks a decline in demand. And I guess if I heard correctly in April, that doesn't seem to be kind of consistent with the DOE numbers we're getting. I was just hoping maybe you could give a little clarity around that.","Donald C. Templin","Yes, Blake, this is Don. The decline that I mentioned was just Speedway demand, and I would say that our -- and that market, obviously, is a Midwest market. So we think the recent run-up in prices at retail have had an impact on that.","Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. So that's really not winter related or anything that we saw in 1Q? This is more recent, right?","Donald C. Templin","Yes, the 1Q was down I want to say 0.7%, so -- on a same-store basis. This was the -- we were trying to give an April number, and that's down about 1%. But once again, we think a lot of that is really reflective of the fact that the price at the pump is $0.20 or $0.25 generally higher than it was 1 year ago.","Operator","And the next question comes from Jeff Dietert from Simmons & Company.","Jeffrey A. Dietert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","It's Jeff Dietert. I was hoping to get a comment on your expectations for oil imports into PADD III. And they've been relatively sticky so far this year, roughly flat year-on-year. And we've got increased pipeline barrels, rail barrels and flat imports coming in, which is contributing to the build here in April in front of what looks like a relatively active maintenance period on the Gulf Coast. Could you talk about your expectations for those imports?","C. Michael Palmer","Well, Jeff, this is Mike Palmer. As we all know, most of the light sweet crude is no longer coming into the Gulf. It's pretty much been eliminated. So the next step is going to be starting to back out either light sour or medium sour crudes. And I think, as I mentioned earlier, that certainly could happen as the spreads start to give us incentive to do that. So I would think that if production continues in this country along the growth path that we've seen, that you're going to start to see some of that foreign light sour and medium sour start to get backed out.","Jeffrey A. Dietert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","And they've been a little bit sticky so far. I mean, most of the oil imports are priced off of domestic grades, which have to be priced attractively for the U.S. Gulf Coast refining market. Some of the exporters have joint ventures, term sales, strategic interest in sustaining U.S. market share. Do you think we need to see a substantial discount relative to international prices in order to reduce those imports?","C. Michael Palmer","Well, I guess my feeling is that yes, you're going to need to see and have a perception that you're going to have this discount that's going to be ongoing. But up to this point, what I would argue is that, again, it's breakeven between some of the -- even the U.S. Gulf of Mexico sour crudes and the light crudes on the Gulf Coast are close. So you can go back and forth between those 2 grades in terms of economics. So we need to start to see the light sweet crudes -- if that's where the surplus is going to be, which we would expect, we need to see the discounts start to widen and last for a period of time.","Gary R. Heminger","And Jeff, if you look at the kind of the world economics and the producers in West Africa, in the North Sea, not that much of the North Sea production comes to the U.S. anymore but mainly West Africa and some of the South American countries. As Gulf Coast production continues to increase, there's going to be friction because those producers are still looking for a home for their crude. And the home, of course, they can take some to Asia. However, you look at some of the Middle East producers and how they're increasing and ramping up their production to Asia, there's a -- quite a bit of friction and pressure on being able to deliver those barrels into Asia. So I think this bodes well, back for our initial comments, that we see spreads will persist, the wider spreads will persist, because those countries are still looking for a home for their crude, and I think the friction point becomes the Gulf Coast.","Jeffrey A. Dietert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Okay. And secondly, could you provide an update on the Garyville Resid Hydrocracker Project? I think I saw some news that you were applying for permits. Anything to dissuade you from continuing to analyze that project?","Gary R. Heminger","I'll let Rich handle that.","Richard D. Bedell","That was the resid hydrocracker project that we submitted our air permit. But throughout this year, we have a more detailed engineering effort going on. Our decision point on this project will be in the first quarter of next year. But everything still looks very good on the project.","Operator","And our next question comes from Faisel Khan with Citigroup.","Mohit Bhardwaj - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","This is actually Mohit Bhardwaj for Faisel. Gary, just looking on the Gulf Coast, there's a lot of crude coming over there, and there are new inventories building up. Just from a logistic standpoint, you mentioned some of the factors that are getting crude into Texas City or into Garyville and also supplying product into the Florida markets, which you are sort of benefiting from. Are there any opportunities that you see right now that you can share with us?","Gary R. Heminger","I'm sorry, opportunities -- I missed the...","Mohit Bhardwaj - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Oh, On the logistics side to smoothen some of the transportation on the crude side. And also, products are getting into the Florida markets that you -- that are sort of tight and you sort of benefit as well from it because of the wholesale margins.","Gary R. Heminger","Yes, the way we have been having our transportation of refined products into the Florida market, and we have a virtual pipeline on the water -- on the Gulf that we're supplying both out of Texas City, Galveston Bay and Garyville into the Florida and some of the other Gulf Coast terminals into that marketplace. So we're in very good shape as far as the transportation mode that we're using there. The -- this incremental production that I've talked about coming from the Gulf Coast from a crude standpoint, we are in great shape because a lot of that is going to be plumbed up to come through LOOP.","Mohit Bhardwaj - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","All right. All right. And just one final quick one for me. Any indication on the RIN expense for this quarter?","Gary R. Heminger","RINs?","Donald C. Templin","The RIN expense was $71 million for the quarter. That was purchased RINs.","Operator","And our last question comes from Paul Cheng from Barclays.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just a quick follow-up. Gary, when we're looking at Galveston Bay based on your unit cost estimate in the second quarter for the Gulf Coast, they seems to be still high comparing to the Garyville. Any plan what you may be able to do in terms of reducing the costs there? And also there for Mike, in your conversation with whether the Mexican -- or with the Mexican, have the tone or the attitude have changed now in terms of how they're looking at the Gulf Coast market?","Donald C. Templin","Paul, this is Don. Let me take the unit cost question. We don't provide specific information on individual refineries, but I think it's fair to say that Garyville is, if not the most efficient, one of the most efficient refineries from an operating cost perspective. And so, there will always, I think at least in the foreseeable future, be a gap between their operating costs and those at Galveston Bay. There's also a structural difference in that Galveston Bay has a very large aromatics complex and this very large resid hydrocracker complex. So the -- you -- I don't think you'd ever expect to see a parity on that because of the different configurations.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Sure. But, I mean, I guess my question is that are you comfortable and happy about the current unit cost in Galveston Bay or that this is an area of focus?","Gary R. Heminger","Paul, this is Gary. As I mentioned in December, this is top of mind, top of mind every day as an area of focus. Rich is doing a great job. Just completed the largest turnaround they've ever had there in one cycle and did it right according to our plan. And our plan through these turnarounds is to improve the operability, to improve the mechanical availability, therefore lowering the unit cost. Are we where we want to get to yet? No. Are we making progress? Yes.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","How about...?","C. Michael Palmer","Yes, Paul, Paul, this is Mike Palmer. Paul, we really don't have any indication that the Mexicans have changed their thoughts about the U.S. Gulf Coast. I really don't have anything that I can tell you there.","Operator","And we have no further questions at this time.","Timothy T. Griffith","Okay. Thanks, Sylvia.

It's a reminder that we will be making forward-looking statements during the presentation and during the question-and-answer session. Actual results may differ materially from what we expect today. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included here, as well, as in our filings with the SEC.","With that, I'll be happy to turn the call over to Gary Heminger for opening remarks and highlights. Gary.","Gary R. Heminger","Thank you, Tim, and good morning everyone and thank you for joining our call. We are pleased to report strong results for the quarter and full-year of $798 million of earnings in the fourth quarter and $2.5 billion or earnings for the full-year. MPC completed another milestone year.","Our Refining & Marketing segment achieved income from operations of $3.6 billion for the year while executing the largest series of planned refinery maintenance projects in the company's history. Our achievements such as acquisition of Hess' retail operations and the acceleration of MPLX growth underscore our commitment to grow higher-value, stable cash flow segments of the business while optimizing our refining system for strong returns.","While crude oil prices fell and crack spreads narrowed during the fourth quarter, we experienced strong product price realizations at both the wholesale and retail level. Speedway reported record earnings of $273 million for the quarter, including the newly acquired Hess locations and posted what would have been recording earnings for just the legacy Speedway locations. Conversions of these new locations and the deployment of Speedway's highly successful merchandise model are progressing well.","As of January 31, 134 of the 1,245 acquired stores have been converted. We are taking the opportunity to evaluate ways to leverage existing best practices of both business models and implementing those practices across the entire Speedway platform. The earnings power of this combined business will be tremendous, and we are well positioned to execute our strategy to grow the EBITDA of this business to over $1 billion.","MPC completed its third and largest dropdown to MPLX during the fourth quarter of 2014, which increased MPLX's interest in Pipeline Holdings to 99.5%. This dropdown was an important first step in our strategy to substantially accelerate the growth of MPLX. As the sponsor of MPLX, MPC intends to maintain a growing reserve of MLP eligible assets. That growth in reserves will be accomplished through MPC's continued focus of midstream investments and both entities' participation and energy infrastructure build-out that continues in North America.","MPC continued to deliver peer-leading capital returns to its shareholders. MPC returned a total of $2.7 billion of capital to shareholders in 2014, $820 million which occurred in the fourth quarter. We have repurchased approximately 25% of the shares that were outstanding when we became a standalone company. MPC remains focused on the long-term value proposition for our investors.","We also announced this morning our 2015 investment plan of $2.5 billion, which includes $1.3 billion for the refining and marketing segment, $452 million for the Speedway segment, and $659 million for the pipeline transportation segment.","With respect to the residual oil upgrader expansion project at the Garyville refinery, we believe this project has great potential returns, but we are deferring our final investment decision as we further evaluate the implications of current market conditions on the project. MPC's 2015 capital plan reflects our commitment to further develop a stable cash flow, generate excitements of our business while enhancing refining margins. This will be done by growing our midstream assets, integrating the Hess retail operations into our Speedway business, and continuing to implement the margin enhancement projects in refining, including synergistic projects at our Galveston Bay refinery, which we acquired in 2013.","Before I turn it over to Don, I also want to take this opportunity to remind investors that as a backdrop of the volatile crude price environment, we experienced over the last six months, we continue to be enthusiastic about the prospects for this business. Our flexible refining system, large retail presence, and extensive logistics network allowed us to successfully adapt to changing production and supply patterns.","This was a year where our results clearly demonstrate the value of our integrated downstream system. Looking ahead, I think it is important to continue to pay close attention to crude oil inventory in PADD III and Cushing. We believe as those inventory levels continue to rise, it will have a favorable impact on crude differentials in the coming months.","Fundamentally, ours is a spread business. We are well positioned to drive sustainable earnings in a variety of crude price environments, and we continue to believe that our best days are in front of us.","With that, let me ask Don to review our financial performance for the quarter and provide some more detailed commentary on our 2015 capital plan.","Donald C. Templin","Thanks Gary. Slide 4 provides earnings both on an absolute and per share basis. Our financial performance for both the fourth quarter and full-year 2014 was strong. MPC had earnings of $798 million or $2.86 per diluted share during the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to $626 million or $2.07 per diluted share in last year's fourth quarter. For the full-year 2014, our earnings were over $2.5 billion, $400 million improvement over the $2.1 billion of earnings in 2013. Earnings per diluted share were $8.78 for the full-year 2014 compared to $6.64 for 2013.","The chart on slide 5 shows by segment the change in earnings from the fourth quarter of 2013 to the fourth quarter of 2014. Speedway segment income was a major driver for our year-over-year increase, which I'll discuss in a minute. The Refining & Marketing segment income also contributed to the increase in overall earnings in the quarter.","Turning to slide 6, Refining & Marketing segment income from operations was just over $1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared with $971 million in the fourth quarter last year. The increase from 2013 was primarily due to higher product price realizations and a favorable LIFO inventory accounting effect, partially offset by narrower sweet\/sour crude oil differentials and a lower LLS 6-3-2-1 blended crack spread. The lower blended crack spread had a negative impact on earnings of approximately $197 million. The blended crack spread was $5.43 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to $6.82 per barrel last year. The narrower sweet\/sour crude oil differential had a negative impact on earnings of approximately $240 million versus the fourth quarter of 2013.","There were three primary contributors to the $494 million increase in other gross margin. First, we recognized the build in our crude oil and refined products inventories in the 2014 fourth quarter when compared to year end 2013. For purposes of our annual LIFO inventory costing, this increase in inventory is recorded based on pricing at the beginning of 2014 which was substantially higher than fourth quarter prices.","As a result, Refining & Marketing segment income for the quarter reflects the favorable effect of approximately $240 million. Comparing the fourth quarter of 2014 to 2013, the LIFO impact was approximately $190 million, which is included in the $494 million increase in other gross margin shown here.","Second, we experienced strong product price realizations. Generally, as crude prices decline, our wholesale brand and Speedway prices tend to fall at a slower rate leading to some margin expansion. For the wholesale and brand businesses, this margin impact is reflected in our Refining & Marketing segment and represents about two thirds of the non-LIFO change.","Finally, our actual crude and feedstock acquisition costs compared to the market indicators were more favorable during the fourth quarter 2014 as compared to the fourth quarter 2013. Segment income for the quarter was also impacted by the reinstatement of the biodiesel blenders credit on December 2014, retroactive to the beginning of the year.","Slide 7 provides the drivers for the change in Refining & Marketing segment income on a year-over-year basis. Refining & Marketing segment income from operations was $3.6 billion for the full-year 2014 compared with $3.2 billion in 2013. The LLS 6-3-2-1 blended crack spread had $761 million favorable impact on earnings. Both the sweet\/sour and the LLS to WTI crude oil differentials narrowed in 2014 compared to 2013 resulting in negative impact to earnings of approximately $489 million and $695 million respectively.","All of the gross margin indicators utilize spot market values and an estimated mix of crude purchases and products sold. Differences in our actual product price relations, mix and crude costs quarter-to-quarter are reflected in the other gross margin column.","Given the substantial $1.7 billion impact of the items, let me make a few comments about these year-over-year differences. The majority of the year-over-year change was attributable to product price realizations which were substantially more favorable in 2014 than they were in 2013. The impact of falling crude oil prices on wholesale and brand margins had a positive impact in the latter part of the year. In addition, second and third quarter 2013 product price relations compared to spot market values were negatively impacted by the effects of RINs further driving the year-over-year change.","The LIFO accounting effect that I described earlier also impacts the 2014 full-year earnings. And finally our actual crude and feedstock acquisition costs compared to the market indicators were more favorable during 2014 as compared to 2013.","Moving to operating costs, direct operating expenses were $913 million higher in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to higher turnaround expenses. As Gary highlighted, 2014 included the largest series of planned refinery maintenance projects in the company's history.","On slide 8 we provide the Speedway segment earnings walk [ph] for both the fourth quarter and full-year. Speedway's income from operations was $273 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared with 83 million last year. This is the first quarter with the results for the acquired Hess sites. The Hess locations contributed approximately $118 million to the segment's fourth quarter income.","For the legacy Speedway sites the light product gross margin was about $67 million higher in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to last year. Overall, the Speedway segment's gasoline and distillate gross margin increased by more than $0.11 per gallon from fourth quarter 2013 in the fourth quarter of 2014.","Speedway's merchandise margin in the legacy locations was $20 million higher in the fourth quarter 2014 compared to fourth quarter 2013. On a same-store basis, gasoline sales volumes increased 0.3% and merchandise sales excluding cigarettes increased 5.4% in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared with last year. In January 2015 we've seen a slight decrease in demand with an approximately 0.8% decrease in the same-store gasoline sales volumes versus the prior year.","Speedway's income from operations for full-year 2014 was $544 million compared with $375 million in 2013. The Hess locations contributed approximately $113 million of income in 2014. For the legacy speedway sites like product gross margins increased $50 million and merchandise margins increased $55 million year-over-year. For the Speedway site segment gasoline and distillates gross margins averaged $17.75 per gallon in 2014 compared to $14.4 per gallon in 2013.","On a same-store basis, gasoline sales volumes decreased 0.7% in 2014 and increased 0.5% in 2013. Partially offsetting the increases in Speedway income were higher operating expenses primarily attributed to an increase in the number of stores.","Slide 9 provides the components of Speedway's fourth quarter segment income on an absolute basis. The like product margin for the legacy Speedway and Hess locations were $176 million and $197 million respectively. The legacy Speedway and Hess locations contributed $225 million and $99 million in merchandise margin respectively. Operating and other net expenses were $424 million for the quarter.","Slide 10 shows fourth quarter and full-year changes for our Pipeline Transportation segment. Income from operations was $58 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared with $47 million last year. Income from operations was $280 million for the full-year 2014 compared with $210 million for the full-year 2013.","The increases for both the quarter and full-year were primarily attributable to higher transportation revenue and pipeline affiliate income partially offset by higher operating expenses associated with pipeline maintenance activities. The increase in transportation revenue for the quarter and year were attributable to higher average pipeline tariff rates and an increase in the revenue recognized for volume deficiency credits in 2014.","Slide 11 presents the significant drivers of changes in our cash flow for the fourth quarter of 2014. At December 31, our cash balance was $1.5 billion. Operating cash flow before changes in working capital was $1.1 billion source of cash. The $670 million use of working capital noted on the slide primarily relates to $1.9 billion decrease in accounts payable partially offset by $1.2 billion decrease in accounts receivable. Decreases in accounts payable and accounts receivable were primarily due to the significant drop in crude oil and refined product prices during the quarter.","Long-term debt was $371 million source of cash during the quarter which was driven by MPLXs borrowings to help finance its acquisition of an additional 30.5% interest in Pipeline Holdings in December.","As Gary highlighted we continue delivering on our commitment to balance investments of the business with return of capital to our shareholders. We repurchased $682 million of shares and paid $138 million of dividends in the fourth quarter demonstrating this commitment to regular returns of capital. MPLX also had a public equity issuance during the fourth quarter with net proceeds of $221 million. That makes up the most significant portion of the other column.","Slide 12 shows that at the end of the fourth quarter we had $1.5 billion of cash and approximately $6.6 billion of debt. With EBITDA of about $5.4 billion during the last 12 months we continue to be in a very manageable debt position with debt-to-EBITDA 1.2 times and a debt-to-total capital ratio of 37%.","Turning to slide 13, during the last 12 months we generated $3.1 billion in cash from operations and $1 billion of free cash flow excluding the Hess retail acquisition. Over this period we returned about $2.7 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases or approximately 2.7 times our adjusted free cash flow.","During the fourth quarter of 2014 we purchased approximately 7 million shares for $682 million through open market repurchases. It is our intention to continue returning capital to our shareholder s that is not currently needed to support the operational and investment needs of the business and we continue to believe that share repurchases are the most efficient way to do so.","Slide 14 provides updated outlook information on key operating metrics for MPC for the first quarter of 2015. We are expecting first quarter throughput volumes to be up compared to first quarter 2014 due to less planned maintenance. Since we have no comparable 2014 data that includes the newly acquired Hess locations we plan to provide Speedway outlook information by quarter for 2015. For the first quarter 2015 we project Speedway's light product sales volume will be approximately 1.4 billion gallons.","Slide 15 provides a breakdown by segment of our 2014 capital expenditures and investments excluding the acquisition of the Hess retail operations along with our approved capital planned for 2015.","Slide 16 lists the significant capital projects that we will be working on in 2015 and beyond. Our capital investment plan is focused on growing our midstream business, integrating the Hess retail operations into our Speedway system and pursuing margin enhancing projects at our refineries including further implementing synergistic projects at our Galveston Bay refinery. This slide also shows the percentage of our 2015 capital plan allocated to the various operations of our business.","As you can see 35% of our capital is being allocated to investments in midstream assets, 18% to Speedway and 15% to margin enhancing refining projects. The remainder is primarily attributable to refinery sustaining capital. We believe this allocation of capital is consistent with our commitment to further develop a stable cash flow generating segments of our business while also enhancing refining margins.","Now, I will turn the call back to Tim Griffith.","Timothy T. Griffith","Thanks Don. As we are going to poll for your questions we ask that you limit yourself to one question plus a follow-up. You may re-prompt for additional questions as time permits.","With that Brandon, we are prepared to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you sir, and we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] and from Morgan Stanley we have Evan Calio on the line. Please go ahead.","Evan Calio","Good morning guys, very strong results today. My first question is on contango. I know you hedged 75% of your runs with the TI contract. You know, can you remind us how you benefit in a contango TI market and any thoughts on contango as you move into turnarounds with the growing and imbalanced crude market and storage limitations and even how steeper contango may relate to a wider TI Brent spread?","C. Michael Palmer","Hi Evan, this is C. Michael Palmer.","Evan Calio","Hi Mike.","C. Michael Palmer","Yeah, as you point out, not only are we able to lock in that front month contango with our hedging strategies, but in terms of the purchase strategy for domestic crude, we also lock in that front month contango, so we are the beneficiary of that, you know, cheaper front month. With regard to the rest of your question, what was next?","Evan Calio","Yeah, just more just as an outlook item of kind of what do you think of the structure on the curve as we move into peak U.S. turnarounds with the growing imbalance market and even how storage limitations can factor into return of some more favorable U.S. pricing?","C. Michael Palmer","Well you know, that's the $64,000 question in my mind and everyone's mind is how long does this very weak market last. You know, I think to the extent that we see oversupply in the market, which certainly appears to be with us during the first half of the year, you'd believe the steep contango should be with us. As things come back more in the balance in the second half of the year, then I would guess that the contango would narrow.","Evan Calio","Great and then a second question I have is really on the wholesale fuel distribution segment. I know that it increased following the Hess transaction. It's included within the other gross margin in your R&M operations, and you included I think $600 million of MLP -able EBITDA largely related to that fuel distribution business. Can you help us with what wholesale added in the fourth quarter, and can it really, how you define that wholesale margin at least as for an internal transfer basis?","Donald C. Templin","Well, I guess Evan, this is Don. We don't typically comment on sort of individual components of the business. I guess when I was explaining the results for the quarter, in that other gross margin caption about two-thirds of the differential from last year's fourth quarter was related to, you know, product price realizations, and that's really a function of you know, wholesale and brand. So that to me is a demonstration if you will of sort of the earnings power of that part of the business, but in terms of the - when we had come up with the $600 million of fuels distribution that could potentially be MLP \u2013able, that was largely a function of our wholesale and BRENT volumes of 20 billion gallons times, you know we just used a $0.03 marker to get you 20 billion gallons times $0.03 cents to the $600 million.","Evan Calio","Okay, so a portion of that, the step up quarter-to-quarter is ongoing and a portion of that profitability relates to market conditions for both product and other feedstock. So, I guess, I am trying to distill, which would ultimately at least how we model to drive higher capture rate going forward. So, I am just trying to find what that step change was given the Hess assets within your portfolio, and I guess we can maybe use the volumetric and the margin that you provided.","Donald C. Templin","I think that's the best way to do it Evan.","Evan Calio","Great, I appreciate it.","Operator","From Credit Suisse we have Ed Westlake on line. Please go ahead.","Ed Westlake","Yes, good morning and I guess solid is an underestimation, congratulations. Just on the same follow-on from Evan's question, where are you in terms of decision making or process in terms of being able to perhaps monetize some of that sort of wholesale EBITDA stream into the MLP?","Gary R. Heminger","Ed, this is Gary. As we said the last November, when we rolled out the acceleration, the fuels distribution was just a piece of the backlog, if you will of MLP eligible assets and we are in the process of going to a private letter ruling on the fuels distribution just to confirm what our thoughts are that this will all be eligible earnings, and we are very confident that it will, but there are certain steps you have to take.","We would expect as we go through and look at future opportunities for MPLX, the fuels distribution more than likely is going to have to follow with the terminals as we go into that business, so we have plenty of run room where we need to instead of dropping in the fuels distribution, but we are carefully working on it and we expect to have that completed, that private letter ruling completed this year.","Ed Westlake","And then sticking with the MLP, obviously you mentioned that you\u2019ve got the binding open season in the first quarter for Cornerstone and there is the permitting issues on Sandpiper and SAX, but maybe just a general comments in terms of the response of potential shippers given obviously the collapse in oil prices in terms of your ability to execute?","Gary R. Heminger","Well, it is very interesting Ed, if you look at the rig count Mike Palmer was just showing with me this morning. If you looked at the rig counts in the Bakken, Niobrara, Eagle Ford, and [indiscernible] rig counts have declined versus the Utica. The Utica's rig counts are fairly unchanged at this point in time and being one of the larger purchasers of the output of Utica, we continue to see growth in that volume. So we continue to still be confident in our open season, and the binding open season portion, and I think that truly reflects the change in the rig count.","Ed Westlake","Right, and comments on Sandpiper and SAX?","Gary R. Heminger","Sandpiper and SAX we unfortunately have the delay in the ride away permits. They're moving along well. They have just completed some testimony last week on the ride away business side that continues to move along well. So it's just the delay in the permitting is why we're deferring the capital spend, but we expect both of them to be moving along once they are ride away and this typical need is completed by the end of this year.","Ed Westlake","Great, thanks very much.","Gary R. Heminger","You're welcome Ed. Thank you.","Operator","From JP Morgan we have Phil Gresh on line. Please go ahead.","Phil Gresh","Hi, good morning.","Gary R. Heminger","Good morning.","Phil Gresh","First question is just in terms of the Garyville hydrocracker project, was just kind of wondering where things stand in terms of what contribution if any you are seeing? And just in general, your distillate production in the Gulf Coast in the fourth quarter was not up as much on a year-over-year basis as the third quarter, so just curious if you could kind of put those two things together and talk about just any color you have on the distillate fundamentals in the Gulf Coast, some of your peers have talked about weaker export markets recently?","Gary R. Heminger","Right, well, first of all on the Garyville ROUX project as we said in our earnings call this morning and in our capital plan that was released is that we are going to differ the final investment decision on the Garyville ROUX due to the very volatile crude markets and the crude markets tend to relay into the spreads that you will look between ultra low sulfur diesel and the heavy resid. So we are going to delay that for the time being, but still believe it is an outstanding project and one that has great potential for us, but at this point in time we will delay and come back and look at it at a later date. On the distillate, I will turn that over to Rich.","Richard D. Bedell","But Phil, were you asking about the hydrocracker expansion we did at Garyville last year?","Phil Gresh","Yes, I just kind of, you know, you had expected contribution from an EBITDA basis, so just kind of curious to get a snapshot on where you're at with that and I just noticed that the distillate production wasn't up quite as much in the fourth quarter on a year-over-year basis, so just kind of wondering you know, what's going on behind the scenes there?","Richard D. Bedell","Well, the Garyville distillate, or hydrocrack, or not distillate hydrocrack. Hydrocrack expansion that was taken from 95,000 to 110,000 and it is doing all of that and has been for most of the year. I think anything you see in distillate in the fourth quarter we had some hydrotreaters down and some turnaround activities at Galveston Bay and Garyville on catalyst changes, so that's probably what you're seeing there.","Phil Gresh","Got it.","Donald C. Templin","And Phil, this is Don. I think you had asked about sort of export. We averaged about 282,000 barrels a day in the fourth quarter of exports and about two-thirds of that was distillate and a third of that was gasoline. So we continue to see strong markets in terms of our ability to place export products both gasoline and distillate.","Phil Gresh","Got it. Okay. Follow-up question just on the fundamentals as we look to the second half of the year, a comment was made just you know, when we kind of get past the supply situation, just wondering how you are thinking about crude differentials in that world, you know, you have a long-term view of $7 to top $12 spreads for Brent- WTI for example, but you know, also just worrying about Brent LLS and how you think about that in the world where crude production growth could actually maybe turn negative?","C. Michael Palmer","Well, you know Phil, I guess the \u2013 this is Mike Palmer. I guess the thing that we've been focused on of late is how quickly that Brent-WTI spread has moved out from something on the order of $1 out to $5 in that range and I think that's related to something that we've talked about before and that's just the inventories, they are building up on the U.S. Gulf Coast. So you know, it's extremely difficult to go out very far into fine forecast that differential, but it's at $5 today and certainly as inventories build it could go wider.","Phil Gresh","Okay, thanks.","Operator","From Wolfe Research we have Paul Sankey on line. Please go ahead.","Paul Sankey","Hi, good morning everyone. Gary, I was going to ask you about the hydrocracker decision, but I think you made that pretty clear in the previous answer. I don't know if there is anything more to add on that. I think of you is that we wanted to see a breather in terms of major projects. As I said, I am not sure if you want to add anything. I think it was quite clear. I'll go on to say given the oil price environment in the case of demand for oil, in the past you've talked about the year that distillate demand would exceed gasoline demand. We obviously got a different situation right now. How sustainable do you think the strength in gasoline demand is going to prove to be and how low do you think oil prices need to be for that to be the case? I'll leave it there.","Gary R. Heminger","Right, well. First of all, let me go back to your first comment on the Garyville project and I know you've always stated somewhat of a breather, however, I look at these projects as being very important for the long-term sustainability of the company. And when you have a very strong project we will continue to look at that, but as I stated, we have delayed any final investment decision and we will continue to look at this, but we certainly need to see these crude markets come back to some normal range before we would step in and look at this again. ","Paul Sankey","If I could just jump in Gary, so if I could just jump in there, what would that be, at what point would you say okay, this makes much better sense now?","Gary R. Heminger","Well as I said earlier, you have to have a view and a very strong view on where the ultra low sulfur diesel to resid spread will go into the future. And if you look at the projects based on for flatlining spreads and for flatlining different crude prices, even in today's markets it's still a good project, but it's not as robust as we had, as I said we'll continue to look at this and determine where we go from there.","Looking at Mike Palmer and Rich just talked a bit about exports. The export, diesel across the globe is down just a little bit from the exports and the gasoline has picked up somewhat. And if you look at gasoline prices in this market, gasoline was very strong in the second half of the fourth quarter. As prices continued to decline, we were able to see an uptick in gasoline demand. But recognized we're comparing ourselves same period this year when you look at same-store results both in the same period this year versus last year and we have a lot of other issues going on last year. We had three polar vortex events, very heavy snowstorms.","Now this year we have the addition of the Hess locations in the Northeast. We have stores that we didn\u2019t have before that we're comparing some numbers against this year some very heavy snowstorms in the Northeast that we did not have in the period last year. But we see gasoline demand and my view is gasoline demand will continue to be strong this year and I think even at this prices, anything below 250 [ph] is going to continue to be robust for gasoline demand. I think we are just in a little bit of a low in Europe as far as diesel demand and the amount of exports of diesel, but we still see fundamentally across North America and even into the international markets we think diesel demand is going to be strong.","Paul Sankey","I got it. So essentially it's more of a price effect on gasoline and the cyclical effect on diesel right now?","Gary R. Heminger","Yes sir.","Paul Sankey","Thanks Gary.","Gary R. Heminger","All right Paul, thank you.","Operator","From Goldman Sachs we have Neil Mehta on line. Please go ahead.","Neil Mehta","Hey, good morning Gary.","Gary R. Heminger","Hi Neil.","Neil Mehta","Just can you just walk us through a little bit the way you're thinking about your capital allocation strategy, been aggressive on the dividend, aggressive on buy backs, but as you look to stock today and as you think about the cash flow going forward, how do you think about weighting one versus the other?","Gary R. Heminger","We have been and will continue to be very focused on capital discipline. If you look at the projects and our budgets they, and our capital plan for 2015 it aligns very much with the Analyst Day meeting we had at the end of 2013, where we said we're going to continue to invest in midstream and in our Speedway retail segment and in those very strong projects within refining that will give us high rates of return and that's exactly what we're doing.","At the time we at that Analyst Meeting we did not have the Hess acquisition on our radar, but the investments we are doing are in the legacy Speedway locations, where we're going very strong, in fact across the entire Speedway chain. If I look at the return on capital employed in that segment over the last five years, we've continued to increase return on capital employed each year.","So we think that was a - that strategy and our deployment of capital in Speedway is very sound. The same way in the midstream our strategy around Sandpiper and SAX and our Cornerstone are a very strong and that it provides very good earnings from a MLP -eligible earnings type of a project, but behind that it also has some very strong components that provides synergies to Mike Palmer's crude oil acquisition strategies and also into some of our light product distribution strategies. So we will continue to be focused on those components and then let me turn it over to Don to talk about the balance sheet, share repurchases versus dividend and our philosophy. ","Donald C. Templin","Neil, this is Don. I think that we are not targeting a particular amount of share repurchases in any period. I mean what we've historically leave was, was the way to manage the balance sheet, what we've communicated to you all is that we look to core liquidity and that sort of drives our investment allocation.","So to the extent that we have the cash on our balance sheet that supports our core liquidity, the incremental cash is either invested in the business or returned to shareholders and if it isn\u2019t being invested into the business we are returning it to the shareholders. So that is really the way we look at that allocation of capital.","Neil Mehta","That is very clear Don. So, Gary and Don, as follow-up on two topics that have been in the news lately, just any comments you might have on either then would be great. One would be thoughts on the union strike that has impacted your two facilities and then how you're responding to it and how we should think about the path forward there? And the other is the crude export discussion which seems like the volume around that has died down a bit, but Gary, I know you've spent a lot of time in Washington talking to policy makers, so your latest temperature on that issue would be great.","Gary R. Heminger","Sure, let me take both of those Neil, first of all on the union and the strike at various refineries around the country. It's been very orderly. We have two plants that have been affected, our Galveston Bay Refinery and Catlettsburg and both and we were very well prepared in the event this happened at any of our plants, as I said we were very well prepared, we were operating these plants at a very cleaned, what I should say cleaned turnover is the word I was looking for, cleaned turnover when the union workers left and we took over. And we would expect to continue to have very strong operations and as I said, we are well prepared, we were well trained and when you have these type of incidents you have to be prepared. So we'll continue to see Neil how this plays out.","On crude oil exports and this really comes back to the crude oil exports that and it's a definition of crude oil exports. What is being exported is condensate and as I have said in the past and I have said in Washington, we really do not see that the condensate is an issue for U.S. refining, and what we've always in the past that there is not a glut of crude oil on the marketplace. Therefore some innuendo that there was a glut of crude oil, therefore we have to be able to export light crude oil. We do not see that as factual.","And as we continue each month to close out the books, we continue to see areas where we do not get the deliveries of light crude that we had expected, and then the backdrop of that is to look at the imports that are coming into the country still suggest that we have at least 50% or so of the crude oil requirements of North America being imported. So looking at the condensate that is being exported, I'm not so certain that the volume has increased that much as maybe the media around this issue has dropped off more.","So I think that's really more the subject that is going on, but it has not affected of us and I come back to most important thing to watch is how the exports coming in to the U.S. Gulf Coast as I said the imports with the exports from the middle east and others that are coming into the Gulf Coast has continued to watch how that grows, look at inventory that is building up in Houston and Cushing, I looked at the numbers in the last couple of days to see how PADD III, PADD II and Cushing inventories and for the last three weeks in a row have continued to grow if I take it even back to October, November, December, those inventories continue to grow in those markets. And that is what is even I think to watch to determine where crude spreads might be going. And overall where the crude price in the market may be going.","Neil Mehta","Thank you for your comments.","Gary R. Heminger","All right Neil.","Operator","From Barclay's we have Paul Cheng online, please go ahead.","Paul Cheng","Hey guys, good morning.","Gary R. Heminger","Hey, Paul.","Paul Cheng","Gary, can it, the 2014 was a very happy turnaround year. If that means that now Galveston Bay is pretty much that up to your standard and any rough estimate for the 2015 total turnaround expense? I mean in 2014 it was about $1.2 billion.","Gary R. Heminger","Right and as I said last year may been on the call this same period that we do, 2014 was going to be a very large turnaround year especially for Galveston Bay as we went through two of their very large units. Yes, we now have been through the majority of the big units and have those units close to our operating expectations. I'll let Rich go into that in a little more detail. And Paul, as you know, we do not give out the actual numbers nor do we give out a calendar of what our turnarounds are for this year. But it is going to be significantly less than the expenditures we had last year. Don you want to cover that?","Donald C. Templin","Yeah Paul, this is Don. I mean you are right, we did about $1.2 of turnaround expense last year. If you look at our guidance or just the outlook for the first quarter of 2015, you compare that to the first quarter of 2014 our turnaround, the projected turnaround expense is substantially down and you know it's probably in the $250 million range or slightly higher than that compared to first quarter of 2013. So we would also expect there be a bit of that that would play through in the rest of the year, but that's in the guidance of the outlook information that we've provided there.","Paul Cheng","Don what numbers they averaged for the cycle turnaround cause for you guys, is it $900 million a year a conjured opinion? I mean what number you can share?","Donald C. Templin","Well I would say that that number has probably been in the $800 million range, you know, broadly. I mean it's hard to point to a typical year. I would say last year it was $1.2 billion, maybe it was a $400 million differential this year to, for last year, but it is hard to kind of, each year is different and it depends on which units are being turned around and what not, but I'd say broadly that would be a good guide.","Gary R. Heminger","And Paul, let me ask Rich to make any comments after has finished these two big turnarounds any further comments on what you see in the plant and how you are in your staged planning that we talked about back in the acquisition day.","Richard D. Bedell","Well, we could continue to work through and we still have some more turnarounds out in the future on some of the Capline [ph] areas, but that's out in the out years. So we've been through some of the crude units and the hydrocracker s and we've been refurbishing them and getting them up to our standards. And we\u2019ve seen through last year we set record production rates on a number of units at that refinery and we continue to optimize it and we think it's a great platform going forward.","Paul Cheng","The second question, do you have updates about Capline [ph] discussion with your partner? And also Mike do you have or maybe this is actually for Tony, do you have a number that what is the biodiesel blenders credit that the catch up from the first nine months of the year that you reported in the fourth quarter? Thank you.","Anthony R. Kenney","Well that was about $40 million, the biodiesel impact.","Paul Cheng","Full-year or just nine months is the catch up?","Anthony R. Kenney","Well it was about 40 million for the catch up yeah.","Paul Cheng","Okay, thank you.","Gary R. Heminger","Right, and Paul on Capline, we've talked about this somewhat before. We're completing the engineering to reverse this pipeline is not that difficult and the engineering studies will be complete here in the first quarter. But the longer term effect is really the commercial and it really goes back to and especially in this crude market that we're seeing today, we have a lot of analysis to understand where is the or do we have enough supply and it needs to mainly be heavy, so Canadian heavy type of input and there is enough supply to be able to satisfy those refineries in the upper PADD II markets who have already converted and require the Canadian heavy in order to be able to fill up their coffers.","And then secondly, how much volume is available to get all the way down to the St. James or Louisiana Gulf Coast. So that is the big study that we know is going to take the balance of the year to understand if we you can line up the supply, how that supply will move to the markets and how that supply may affect some of the upper PADD II refineries I discussed touched earlier.","Paul Cheng","Thank you.","Gary R. Heminger","Welcome.","Operator","From Simmons we have Jeff Dietert on the line, please go ahead.","Jeffrey A. Dietert","Good morning.","Gary R. Heminger","Hi, Jeff.","Jeffrey A. Dietert","I was wanting to follow up Don, I believe you mentioned same-store sales in your discussion lead in, but I wanted to make sure I understood the January comparisons correctly, what were the comparisons for Speedway and then for Hess for January?","Gary R. Heminger","Why don\u2019t we turn that Jeff over to Tony Kenney who is with us today?","Anthony R. Kenney","Jeff, January the light, the gasoline same-store we reflected negative 0.8 tens of a percent on gasoline and that is only for the legacy Speedway stores. We are not tracking yet same-store metrics on the Hess assets until the 13th month when we have confidence in those metrics.","Jeffrey A. Dietert","Got you and were there specific things that you attributed that the client to the DOE stats are reporting gasoline up seven or 8% this or the 5% or 6% which sometimes does get revised in the monthly data, but I was curious if there's any specific items that caused this to be lower? And anything that you are expecting to see, response on the demand side to these lower prices?","Anthony R. Kenney","Yeah, I guess what I would say is that from the Speedway and Hess side of the business during the month of January we actually saw about just under 10% increase in the wholesale cost to our business. So as we've attempted to pass along those increased costs to the market, you know that price elasticity does come into play for us. So as we're out there with those prices there may be some shifting between gasoline volume between competitors in the market and that's generally what I would say that the eight tenths rules, that reflects the Speedway.","Jeffrey A. Dietert","Great, and secondly on your Hess retail obviously a terrific performance in the quarter, excellent margin environment, could you talk about operations and sales volumes and how they're performing relative to expectations and any update to synergies that you have there?","Anthony R. Kenney","Yeah Jeff, I would say that I'm very pleased with the overall, I mean from the very beginning I took over the operations on October 1st and this is really a lot of credit goes to the wonderful people and the execution and the focus that Hess had on the business we basically were seamless. So the ongoing day-to-day operations and probably the most important aspect is making sure we're taking care of the customer and we've got some very good feedback from our customers. They've acknowledged the performance. So I've been very pleased on that side of it.","In terms of the overall business, I think we're seeing that as we continue to implement the best practices at a stepped-up pace, the conversions and branding from Hess to Speedway as well as the implementation of the technology platforms inside the store such as our Speedy Rewards program, those are all generating the types of benefits that we would expect from that activity. The comment in terms of the synergies, we met the $20 million in the fourth quarter 2014 that we told the market and we are on pace to hit the 2015 mark as well for synergies. So, so far so good.","Jeffrey A. Dietert","Thanks for your comments.","Operator","From Tudor Pickering Holt, we have Chi Chow on line. Please go ahead.","Chi Chow","Great, thanks, this fantastic fourth quarter earnings, doesn\u2019t look like you're getting much credit quite frankly in the market today. So I guess the question is, I guess Don, you outlined in some of the waterfall charts the uptick on the product price realizations. I'm just wondering, can the company sustain that outperformance on those realizations when crude prices stabilize or increase or will that performance reverse in that sort of commodity price environment?","Donald C. Templin","Chi, this is Don. I would say broadly if prices are falling quickly we tend \u2013 it tends to be sticky coming down and we tend to outperform. If prices are rising quickly the inverse is true. We tend to - it tends to take as a little while to catch up. So you know, in a flat environment I would say we would typically perform consistent with how we've done in the flat environments in a drop, in a dropping price environment, you know, we tend to outperform and this is really against the market metrics as opposed to our ability to capture margin, but it's against the market metrics and then in a rising price environment, you know, we tend to capture rate at least as it's reflected against those market metrics tend to be, tend to show that we are not getting all of that as the price runs up.","Chi Chow","Okay, great. And you also talked about realizing lower crude acquisition costs. Can you comment on that versus the indicators and have you changed your crude slate versus historical levels and is that sort of lower cost basis sustainable in the coming quarters?","Donald C. Templin","Yeah Chi, I would say that when you look at the crude slate in general there have not been very significant changes to the crude slates. As you know, I mean we basically have a process in place where we will take advantage of whatever the most advantageous crude is during a month when we're optimizing. So I don't think that the changes to the crude slates have been huge. We continue to focus on the domestic crudes, North American crudes, Canada as well as the U.S. and I think that will continue to be the case.","Chi Chow","Okay, I guess one more question on kind of the crude market then. Gary, you've talked about and you made some comments today also that you don't really see a glut of crude develop in the Gulf Coast, yet at the same time you also comment on looking at rising inventory levels and I think Mike, you mentioned that maybe the TI Brent widens out beyond $5 bucks. How do you reconcile those two statements on no glut versus potentially widening differential?","Gary R. Heminger","Well, I might have Mike Palmer cover this, but the comments that were made before was that there is a glut of light sweet crude. We ran 51% sour in the quarter which means we ran 49% sweet. That says and we believe we can run up to about 65% sweet crude, light sweet crude in our units. That suggests we have a tremendous runway to run more light sweet crude. If it is priced \u2013 if it is the right barrel and if you look at the alternative barrel if it's the next best priced barrel then that's what we would buy. So let me have Mike go into this in a little more detail.","C. Michael Palmer","Yeah, it's kind of an interesting phenomenon where you get the - have three inventories that have been consistently rising, but certainly that doesn't appear to be in the very light sweet crude oil, you know, especially when you look at differentials. The differential between LLS and Mars has been fairly consistent around that $4 level and there's been no compelling advantage to buy these light sweet crudes.","And certainly when we look at the market today and if you're in the market on a spot basis for some of these again light sweet shale crudes, they are not very plentiful. So the inventories that are building up you know, we don't have a breakdown of exactly what that is, but certainly the differentials don't reflect the fact that it's a glut of this very light sweet shale crude that producers have been worried about.","Chi Chow","So Mike, are you suggesting then the inventory build is more on medium, you think it is Gulf of Mexico produced crudes or are there incremental imports coming in?","C. Michael Palmer","I think it's a combination of all those things to be honest and I think that the other thing that is happening as you know is the logistics systems continue to build out. So there's more line fill that's needed. I think that's one of the differences between this year and last year, but we certainly don't see this glut of this very light material that that producers have been worried about.","Chi Chow","Okay, great. Thanks for your comments, I appreciate it.","Operator","From RBC Capital Markets we have Brad Heffern on the line. Please go ahead.","Brad Heffern","Good morning everyone. One for Don maybe, you know, just looking at debt levels certainly they've ticked up since the Speedway acquisition. I'm wondering how you think about returning cash to shareholders versus maybe using some cash to paydown debt?","Donald C. Templin","Yes Brad, I think our view and our commitment is to maintain an investment grade credit profile. So that will guide sort of all of our actions around what our balance sheet looks like and you know, right now we feel comfortable that our balance sheet comfortably supports an investment grade credit profile. And as we make investments in the business and as we continue to look at M&A opportunities, we'll continue to evaluate what the balance sheet needs to look like to make sure that we don't cross the line or put any pressure on that investment grade credit profile.","Brad Heffern","Okay, great, and then I think that the Canton condensates that has been online for a little while now, can you talk about how that's running and sort of demands that you are seeing?","Richard D. Bedell","Yeah Brad, this is Rich Bedell. We put the Canton splitter online at right the end of the year and it's running, we run it up to designed capacity. We're running maybe 20,000 barrels a day right now. So it's running very well.","Brad Heffern","Great. Thanks.","Operator","From Citigroup we have Mohit Bhardwaj on the line. Please go ahead.","Mohit Bhardwaj","Yeah, thanks for taking my question. Gary we spent a lot of time looking at two different shells and also talking about your integrated business. But one of the things that a lot of people forget is about some of the other feedstock prices like VGO prices and they have been really low of late if you compare the differentials versus the traditional differentials that they had versus compared to say on lesser the Brent pricing. If you could just talk about that and how does that impact your business and what kind of benefit it has been over the last six months?","C. Michael Palmer","Yes, this is the Mike Palmer. Yeah, what I would say is that we are a big player in that feedstock market and generally when you're talking about VGO, as you know I mean the VGO is just extremely sensitive to the operations of those Gulf Coast refineries. If you have a CAT cracker go down and it is surplusing VGO into the market, you can get very attractive differentials and that\u2019s true of planned turnarounds as well. So that's a market that we're involved in all the time buying and selling in VGO. Our position changes depending upon our turnaround schedule, but it's something that we always take advantage of.","Mohit Bhardwaj","Is there a number that you guys can provide like it wasn't anything different last year or is it really what your normal operations are and there was no significant impact of it?","C. Michael Palmer","You know, I don't think we really have any comparisons that we could provide today.","Mohit Bhardwaj","Okay. Thank you. I know that we are just running over the hour here, but one final question Don, you just mentioned M&A opportunities and if you just comment especially on the logistics side if you're seeing especially with the light of \u2013 in the light of the crude prices where they are and you're seeing more opportunities here just to grow MPLX as you guys want to, but with a higher rate of dropdowns and also higher rate of distribution growth over there?","Gary R. Heminger","Hey, Mohit, this is Gary. You know, the market that we're in and we are seeing many opportunities come across our desk throughout the entire market. I think we're very well positioned. If something made sense we're well positioned within our balance sheet and are very well positioned within MPLX. If something made sense within the logistics from midstream side of the business we would I think be in a good position to be able to act. But the key here is to be cautious and to do your - continue to do very strong due diligence on anything that might become available because I think there will be more and more things available in the marketplace as we go forward.","Mohit Bhardwaj","Yeah, thanks for your comments.","Gary R. Heminger","Yep.","Operator","We will now turn it back to Tim Griffith for final remarks.","Timothy T. Griffith","Okay, thanks Brandon. With that, we want to thank everyone for joining us today and for your interest in Marathon Petroleum. If there are additional questions you would like clarification on any of the topics discussed this morning, Jerry Ewing and Teresa Homan will be available to take your calls. Thanks for joining.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect."],"14342":["Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call January 29, 2020  9:30 AM ET","Company Participants","Doug Wendt - IR","Gary Heminger - Chairman and CEO","Don Templin - CFO","Mike Hennigan - CEO, MPLX","Ray Brooks - EVP, Refining","Rick Hessling - SVP, Crude Oil Supply and Logistics","Dave Whikehart - SVP, Light Products, Supply and Logistics","Brian Partee - SVP, Marketing","Tim Griffith - President-Speedway LLC","Conference Call Participants","Phil Gresh - JPMorgan","Doug Legate - Bank of America","Roger Read - Wells Fargo","Benny Wong - Morgan Stanley","Manav Gupta - Credit Suisse","Paul Cheng - Scotiabank","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs","Operator","Welcome to the MPC Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. My name is Jacqueline, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Doug Wendt. Doug, you may begin.","Doug Wendt","Thank you, Jacqueline. Welcome to Marathon Petroleum Corporation's fourth quarter 2019 earnings conference call. The slides that accompany this call can be found on our website at marathonpetroleum.com under the Investors tab. On the call today are Gary Heminger, Chairman and CEO; Don Templin, CFO; Mike Hennigan, CEO of MPLX, as well as other members of the executive team.","As you know, Kristina Kazarian typically host this call. I'm doing that today because Kristina is celebrating the arrival of a baby girl a week and a half ago. Both Kristina and baby Agnes are doing well.","We invite you to read the Safe Harbor statements on Slide 2. It's a reminder that we will be making forward-looking statements during the call and during the question-and-answer session. Actual results may differ materially from what we expect today. Factors that could cause results to differ are included there as well as in our filings with the SEC.","Now I will turn the call over to Gary Heminger for some opening remarks and highlights on Slide 3.","Gary Heminger","Thanks, Doug, and good morning, and thank you everyone for joining us. I too would like to congratulate Kristina and look forward to her return in a few weeks.","If you please return to Slide number 3. Earlier today, we reported adjusted net income of $1 billion or $1.56 per diluted share. This quarter's performance demonstrates our continued ability to execute across all aspects of our business and capture incremental synergies at an accelerated pace.","In Refining and Marketing, the team's commercial document coupled with our geographically diverse footprint drove tremendous capture results of 105%. Key drivers of capture for the quarter included strong gasoline price realizations, leveraging our integrated assets and scale to capture geographic base prices dislocations compared to broader market benchmarks and the impact of our strong synergy delivery. Our Refining team executed turnarounds, performed engineering projects, and completed major maintenance at multiple refineries.","At Garyville, the crude revamp project and the first phase of the coker expansion project were commissioned, allowing us to realize higher coker unit rates from the expanded drum size. The second phase of the coker project is on schedule to be completed in the first quarter of 2020. Early operating results in the first quarter, coker, have been very positive and we have been able to achieve a 17% capacity increase, exceeding our original project expectations. We expect - anticipate the second phase of the project to achieve a similar rate increase.","Our Speedway team also executed well this quarter. They delivered strong results while also exceeding our cumulative store conversion target with over 700 stores converted to the Speedway platform since the combination.","In the Midstream segment, we progressed strategic long haul pipeline projects that are key to the development of our integrated Permian-to-Gulf Coast logistics system. Additionally, Northeast gathered, processed and fractionated volumes were up 18%, 14%, and 12% respectively in 2019 versus 2018, demonstrated continued growth and strong performance in this region.","Our team's execution this quarter continued the trend of a very impressive synergy capture. We realized over $420 million of synergies in the fourth quarter. It has been over a year since the combination with an endeavor.","As a result of our focus on integration and outstanding execution over that period, our full year realized synergies now have totaled $1.1 billion. We believe MPC will build upon this platform and continue to capture substantial incremental value in 2020 and beyond. Don will provide more details around our synergy capture later on the call.","Now let me briefly share some thoughts on the macro environment. While current U.S. gasoline inventory levels have been high in the first few weeks of the year, we believe this is a function of healthy supply and high utilization in the fourth quarter.","We anticipate inventory levels to moderate for the upcoming seasonal RVP transition. We expect U.S. gasoline demand to remain similar to last year's levels, supported by a steady economic outlook and stable labor market.","Overall, U.S. diesel inventory levels remain relatively constructive, running slightly below the midpoint of the five year average. Warmer than normal temperatures in the Northeast have recently weakened distillate demand, but we do not expect this near-term weakness to persist as underlying fundamentals for light products remain supportive.","We continue to support this constructive outlook, spring turnaround activity globally is expected to be close to last year's record levels peaking at 8 million to 9 million barrels per day of crude capacity offline in March and April. Furthermore, we believe the impact of additional global refining capacity will be moderated by lower utilization or less complex foreign refineries due to the collapse of high sulfur fuel oil prices.","Turning to crude. We have seen the WCS differential widen since October, partly supported by easing of mandated production cuts and incremental rail loadings. On the light sweet side, we anticipate a slight narrowing of the WTI brent spread through the rest of the year as new pipeline takeaway and Gulf Coast export capacity comes online.","Prompt medium and heavy sour differentials are currently narrower than expected in a post IMO world, primarily due to supply constraints, geopolitical instability, and strong U.S. and Asian demand. However, we anticipate heavy sour prices to weaken as HSFO continues to become a discounted alternative feedstock.","We are focused on minimizing our exposure to weak HSFO product pricing by destroying the vast majority of internally produced resid in our own system, aided by the successful expansion at our Garyville coker. We are also importing third-party HSFO into our West Coast facilities as an advantage feedstock for our cokers.","Low sulfur fuel oil prices meaningfully elevated relative to gasoline and diesel. We are also utilizing our robust coastal logistics systems to opportunistically export low sulfur VGO and other components into the bunker market at a premium.","We expect refining margins to strengthen throughout the first quarter from seasonal factors in transportation markets and the industry has continued to response to IMO implementation. We are optimistic about the prospects for our business. With continuous progress of high grading our midstream project backlog, we are targeting positive free cash flow generation across the MPLX business in 2021.","In Retail, our team is making good progress on the Speedway separation, while continuing to identify opportunities to grow merchandise margin through store conversions and remodels. In Refining, we have made significant enhancements in the operations and reliability of the assets we acquired and we continue to believe that the configuration and upgrading capacity at our coastal refineries positions us well to capture the market opportunities that are expected to arise from the implementation of IMO 2020 regulations.","Coupled with our impressive synergy capture so far and the opportunities we have before us, we are confident in our ability to continue delivering compelling financial results and maximizing shareholder value.","Let me conclude my comments providing an update on some of our recent strategic actions. Our work on Speedway is progressing as planned, and we are targeting early fourth quarter for the completion of the separation.","The Midstream Special Committee is advancing its work as we continue to expect to provide an update during the first quarter, and the CEO Search Committee is also progressing the work on schedule with expectations to be complete the latter part of the first quarter.","Now let me turn the call over to Mike, who will provide an update on our Midstream segment. Mike?","Mike Hennigan","Thanks Gary.","Turning to Slide 4. Today we updated MPLX's 2020 growth capital target to approximately $1.5 billion, down from the approximately $2 billion target shared last quarter. This reduction shows our ongoing commitment to high grade, our project portfolio.","We are also targeting growth capital of approximately $1 billion for 2021. We continue to emphasize the growth of the L&S segment. We also remain focused on advancing our strategy of creating integrated crude oil and natural gas logistics systems from the Permian to the U.S. Gulf Coast.","For the past several years, we have been committed to funding our growth project portfolio without issuing equity. Given our attractive growth capital project portfolio, we have historically funded around 50% of our growth needs with that. We have done so while maintaining healthy distribution coverage of around 1.4 times, and investment grade leverage of approximately 4 times.","Assuming continued growth in our earnings and growth capital of approximately $1.5 billion and approximately $1 billion in 2020 and 2021 respectively, we are expecting to achieve positive excess free cash flow generation in 2021. The targeted reduction in capital is expected to allow the funding of our distribution and capital program entirely from internally generated cash flow, as well as provide us with improved capital allocation flexibility to pursue opportunities, including leverage reduction or unit repurchases.","With continued earnings growth in investment discipline, we believe that we will be positioned to pursue incremental capital allocation opportunities, broadening our value creation options and enhancing long-term flexibility.","Now let me turn the call over to Don to cover financial highlights for the quarter.","Don Templin","Thanks Mike.","Slide 5 provides a summary of our fourth quarter financial results. Earlier today, we reported adjusted earnings of $1.56 per share. Adjusted EBITDA was $3.2 billion for the quarter. Operating cash flow before working capital was approximately $2.7 billion. We returned $409 million to shareholders in the fourth quarter, bringing the total to $3.3 billion of capital return to shareholders in 2019, including approximately $2 billion in share repurchases.","Slide 6 shows the sequential change in adjusted EBITDA from third quarter to fourth quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was up approximately $100 million quarter-over-quarter, driven by higher earnings in all segments of the business. Fourth quarter results included a non-cash impairment charge of approximately $1.2 billion related to goodwill associated with gathering and processing businesses acquired as part of the Andeavor combination.","Our reported effective tax rate for the quarter was 51%. This is significantly higher than our historical rate due to the effects of the non-taxable deduct - non-tax deductible midstream goodwill impairments and a biodiesel tax credit included in pretax income.","Excluding these items, our overall adjusted tax rate for the quarter would have been approximately 17.5%. This adjusted rate was also lower than our normal 21% effective tax rate, primarily as a result of discrete tax benefits recognized in the fourth quarter.","Before reviewing the details of each segment, I would like to discuss our synergy capture for the quarter. As shown on Slide 7, we realized $420 million of synergies in the fourth quarter, including $91 million of one-time synergies, offset by $48 million of system integration costs. For the full year, we realized over $1.1 billion of synergies. The full year results substantially exceed the $600 million of gross run rate synergies targeted for 2019.","Slide 8 provides additional insight into our synergy capture for the quarter and full year. For the fourth quarter, more than 80% of our synergies were in the Refining and Marketing segment. This included $62 million from catalyst formulation improvements at multiple refineries, $55 million in crude supply optimization in the Mid-Continent region and $15 million in marine optimization.","For the full year 2019, the majority of the synergy capture related to operational and commercial performance in the Refining and Marketing segment, this included $128 million in catalyst formulation enhancements at seven refineries, $76 million in turnaround execution improvements at the Los Angeles, Martinez and St. Paul Park refineries, a $127 million in crude supply optimization in the Mid-Continent region, and $25 million in improved crude sourcing for the West Coast refineries.","We also realized $121 million of synergies in the Retail segment associated with economies of scale and implementation of the Speedway labor and merchandise models at the newly-converted stores. Lastly, we realized $24 million of synergies in the Midstream segment, and $109 million of net corporate synergies. The corporate synergies were driven by cost eliminations and contract negotiations made possible by the combination.","Moving to our segment results. Slide 9 shows the change in our Midstream EBITDA versus the third quarter 2019. MPLX EBITDA increased $3 million versus the third quarter. During the fourth quarter, MPLX had strong terminal and pipeline throughputs. MPLX also successfully brought online three new gas processing plants, and a new fractionator.","We also continue to progress the reversal of the Capline pipeline, with a purge of the mainline completed in the fourth quarter. In Texas, the Gray Oak pipeline began initial startup in the fourth quarter, and we expect the pipeline to be in full service in the second quarter of 2020.","Slide 10 provides an overview of our Retail segment results. Fourth quarter EBITDA was $636 million. Retail fuel margins were nearly $0.29 per gallon for the quarter. Merchandise margins decreased by $47 million compared to the third quarter, reflecting typical seasonality. We continue to see strong merchandise performance with a 4.7% year-over-year increase in same-store sales. Operating expenses decreased by $12 million in the fourth quarter.","The increase in the other column of the walk is due both - is due to both an asset sale gain, as well as a new commercial diesel branding agreement with Pilot Travel Centers that began in the fourth quarter. The fuel volumes and associated income related to this agreement are now reflected in the other portion of this segment rather than in fuel margin.","More details on this agreement can be found in the appendix. Speedway continues to execute its brand expansion strategy through store conversions. We converted 158 sites in the fourth quarter, bringing the cumulative store conversions count to 708 locations, exceeding our goal of 700 total cumulative store conversions by the end of 2019.","Slide 11 provides an overview of our Refining & Marketing segment results. R&M performed very well despite declines in crack spreads in all regions. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was $1.5 billion, an increase of approximately $51 million versus the third quarter. Despite a $4 barrel decrease in the Chicago WTI 3:2:1 crack spread, our Mid-Con margin remained relatively flat for the quarter, reflecting our ability to leverage our diverse geographic footprint to capture regional market opportunities, particularly in the Salt Lake City and Southwest regions.","In the Gulf Coast region, the reduction in overall margin dollars was primarily related to lower throughputs associated with planned work at our Garyville refinery. On the West Coast, our team did an extraordinary job, capturing a $19.44 per barrel margin, an increase of over $3 per barrel from the third quarter, despite a relatively flat indicator crack spread.","This performance demonstrates our ability to use our operational and commercial expertise to drive value in this market. Strong performance across all three of our regions led the capture of 105% for the quarter.","Slide 21 in the appendix provides additional details on some of the primary drivers for capture. Fourth quarter results included a benefit of $153 million for the biodiesel blender's credit attributable to volumes blended in 2018 and the first three quarters of 2019.","The benefit was recognized in the fourth quarter because the legislation authorizing the credit was enacted in December 2019. Refining operating costs increased versus the third quarter, primarily due to planned project work at our Garyville and Los Angeles facilities.","Slide 12 presents the elements of change in our consolidated cash position for the fourth quarter. Cash at the end of the quarter was approximately $1.5 billion. Operating cash flow before changes in working capital was $2.7 billion source of cash in the quarter.","Working capital was $334 million use of cash in the quarter, primarily due to changes in inventory levels. Return of capital to MPC shareholders share repurchases and dividends totaled $409 million, with $65 million worth of shares acquired in the quarter. In 2019, we returned $3.3 billion to investors through dividends and share repurchases.","You'll recall that at our Investor Day in December 2018, we articulated our target of returning at least 50% of MPC's operating cash flow after maintenance and regulatory capital to our shareholders. The 3.3 billion we returned to investors during 2019 substantially exceeded the approximately $2 billion of growth capital invested in the MPC businesses, excluding MPLX.","As shown on Slide 13, we have a strong track record of maintaining through-cycle financial discipline. At quarter end, we had approximately $28.8 billion of total consolidated debt, including $19.7 billion of debt at MPLX, which is nonrecourse to MPC. MPC's parent level debt of approximately $9.1 billion represents 1.2 times the last 12 months of MPC's standalone EBITDA. This ratio excludes the debt and EBITDA of MPLX, but includes distributions received from MPLX.","On Slide 14 we provide our first quarter outlook. We expect total throughput volumes at just under 3 million barrels per day. Planned turnaround costs are projected to be $425 million. Planned work for the quarter includes turnarounds at our El Paso and Salt Lake City refineries, as well as catalyst changes at our Anacortes and Garyville facilities.","Additionally, we have planned maintenance work related to the completion of the coker drum upgrade project at Garyville and the expansion of the Wilmington hydrocracker which is the last phase of the LARIC project.","For the year, we anticipate turnaround spend of roughly $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion. Total operating costs, including major maintenance, are projected to be $6.05 per barrel for the quarter. Distribution costs are projected to be $1.3 billion, which is consistent with historic guidance. Corporate costs are projected to be $225 million for the quarter, which is slightly higher than previous quarters, primarily due to corporate contributions and benefit adjustments that typically occur in the first quarter of every year.","Slide 15 provides our capital investment plan for 2020, which remains focused on strengthening the earnings power of our business through growth and margin enhancing investments across the enterprise. MPC's investment plan, excluding MPLX, totals approximately $2.6 billion. The plan includes $1.55 billion for the Refining & Marketing segment, of which approximately $450 million is for maintenance capital.","Our growth investments in Refining & Marketing are focused on high-return projects that enhance margin, produce higher value products, and promote resid destruction. We expect to invest approximately $550 million in the Retail segment, primarily to build new Speedway stores and to rebuild and remodel existing Speedway locations.","The plan also includes approximately $300 million for our Midstream segment and approximately $200 million to support corporate activities. Midstream segment capital projects include the Capline reversal and the South Texas Gateway Terminal project.","As Mike mentioned earlier, MPLX also announced its 2020 capital investment plan, which includes approximately $1.5 billion of organic growth capital and $250 million of maintenance capital.","With that, let me turn the call back over to Doug.","Doug Wendt","Thanks Don.","As we open the call for your questions, as a courtesy to all participants, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and a follow-up. If time permits, we will re-prompt for additional questions.","With that, we will now open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from Phil Gresh of JPMorgan.","Phil Gresh","First question, Gary, you shared a lot of helpful color on your thoughts on how things are going to progress here from a macro perspective. Just wanted your additional thoughts on high sulfur fuel oil. You talked about your expectations that prices would continue to come down there and then pressure the sweet sour spreads, but obviously recently you've seen a rather strong improvement or strengthening in the high sulfur fuel oil crack. So what do you think is happening there and how do you foresee this playing out?","Gary Heminger","Yes. Phil, let me turn that to Ray Brooks. He will give you some color on this.","Ray Brooks","Hi, Phil. As far as high sulfur fuel oil, we have seen - we have seen that incentive and we've taken advantage of the fact with our system. I kind of want to break that into two pieces. The first is, our internal production of high sulfur fuel oil where we don't have coking capacity. What we've done through our investments at our coking refineries has have the logistics that essentially we're taking all back material and we're taking it to our coastal refineries with cokers and destructing that.","The other thing is, we're configured for additional high sulfur fuel oil and we're taking advantage. The biggest thing thus far is out on the West Coast between LAR and Martinez, we're in the 20,000 to 30,000 barrels a day range of purchased feedstock. We talked earlier on the call about our work in the first quarter with Garyville, completing that coker work. Once that's done, we'll have similar opportunities at Garyville.","Phil Gresh","And then just from a macro perspective, maybe Gary your thoughts as to why the cracks have strengthened so much, and do you see a re-weakening of high sulfur fuel oil cracks coming?","Gary Heminger","This has really been our strategy all along that we didn't see that we will see a increase in the cracks due to higher distiller prices on the front end. We really saw it as a feedstock advantage on the front end as Ray just discussed.","Now as we go forward and it appears to us, we're getting - the market is starting to strengthened and we're seeing pretty strong compliance with the shipping companies and switching over to the low sulfur fuel oil and we think that bodes well. We never expected in the first three, four weeks of January to have a acceleration in the distillate cracks. We thought this would come and we'll be stair-step into the year and that's still how we feel, Phil.","Phil Gresh","Second question would just be on the capital spending where obviously we've seen some reduction in the planned spending here. The refining growth CapEx is still fairly elevated in 2020, and I know in the past, Gary, I think you've talked about some potential for that to come down further especially as we look beyond 2020. So is that something that you would still expect?","And then if I could tie in, just - the turnaround spending number is also up quite a bit year-over-year. Is this just an elevated turnaround year and is that something you would also expect to come down more in future years? Thanks.","Don Templin","Yes, Phil. This is Don. Let me address, sort of, CapEx first, and then I'll have Ray talk a little bit about the turnaround spending. So you'll recall that in December 2018 at our Investor Day, we targeted about $2.8 billion of capital for MPC, excluding MPLX, our target and we also targeted basically flat capital spending in 2020 from that $2.8 billion.","So our total capital budget for MPC excluding MPLX is down. And as you rightly say, there are some projects that are multi-year projects. So about 40% of our refining growth capital is related to the STAR project. So that's the one at GBR and the Dickinson Renewable Diesel project.","The Dickinson Renewable Diesel project will essentially be complete at the end of the year. So all of that capital will fall off, and the STAR project, it's spending will be substantially less in 2021 than in 2020. So your comment about some of those ongoing capital projects tapering off is absolutely correct. So let me turn it over then to Ray to talk a little bit about turnarounds.","Ray Brooks","Hey, when we did the combination back in 2018, the turnaround spend, go-forward spend was not as ratable as we would preferred. 2019, even though we did a lot of work at Los Angeles, Martinez and St. Paul Park was a little lighter than average. 2020 will be a little heavier in average, particularly in the first quarter, but we're working that our go-forward schedule is going to be more even year-in and year-out.","Our biggest work is in the first quarter at 2020. We're currently in the latter stages at El Paso doing a turnaround on the south side of that refinery and then we'll follow that up with a pretty much full plant refinery at Salt Lake City, and both of these are seven year cycle ending turnaround. So not a whole lot of options to work with there.","And then the other piece, that's major in this quarter, is we have the second phase of our Garyville Coker Max project, just starting in a couple of weeks, coupled with the catalyst change. So higher first quarter but when margins are low, that's when we really want to load our turnaround spend.","Operator","Our next question comes from Doug Legate from Bank of America. Your line is open.","Doug Legate","Gary, I have a feeling this might be your last earnings call. And so I just want to wish you all the best, but also ask you to maybe frame your outlook for the macro going forward. Specifically, is IMO playing out as you expected. I know you touched on it a few minutes ago, but it seems things are a little softer at least on the product side. And I wonder if I could have you elaborate on your confidence, let's say, that the new capacity additions going forward might be met with run cuts and less advantaged areas? And I've got a follow-up for Don please. But again, I hope to run into you again, Gary, and thanks for everything you've done over the years.","Gary Heminger","Thank you, Doug. Maybe in the future you can take me through a proper dinner. That's a long history with Doug. So Doug, the - yes, as I just stated, we think IMO is starting off like we had anticipated and we were conservative in our views on IMO, did not expect a significant run-up in crack spreads.","Now, of course, this has been a bit of a downward move recently with the coronavirus, but I think that will - I think distillate demand will certainly pick up quickly the aftermath of this. But as I said, first, we are looking at feedstocks to be depressed and it gave us higher margins being able to run the feedstocks. That is happening. We are being able to eradicate all of the resid in our own system by moving it into our coastal refineries as Ray just mentioned. That's right on target of what we expected.","And as I said, we never expected a immediate run up in distillate pricing. We think this is going to be more steady and stair-step over the year. And I think the most positive thing that we're seeing is what appears to be the compliance of the shipping companies. And so, yeah, I would say, Doug, it's right on target where we expected. Ray wants to add another comment.","Ray Brooks","Yes, the other thing regarding run cuts, the thing that I would offer, we talked about resid destruction, we talked a little bit about diesel. The other factor with IMO is VGO and how it plays into it. So what we've seen is a very, very strong VGO market and so we pivoted on that. So mainly in the U.S. Gulf Coast where we've taken about 50,000 barrels a day out of our cat crackers and putting that in the VGO market.","Gary Heminger","And Doug, I would say the last part --","Doug Legate","Go ahead, Gary.","Gary Heminger","Those coastal refineries of what we believe we have the highest leverage to anyone in the industry, but the coastal refineries that have the processing ability to handle the heavy resid and destroy that in our coking system. When you look across the globe, those refineries that have that processing are going to be advantaged, and we expect probably some East Coast and European refiners who do not have that capability will have a hard time competing on the front end here.","Doug Legate","I appreciate all your comments. I do not want to elaborate on this question too much, but Ray, could I just touch on your VGO comment. I mean, we've all been hoping that may happen, but do you think it's enough to perhaps cleanup the gasoline weakness that we've been seeing here in the last several quarters.","Gary Heminger","I think, Doug, I would say - I mean the thing that you're going to see immediately to clean up the gasoline inventories is the RVP changeover, that will be starting here in just a couple of weeks and that vector will accelerate anything then in VGO. Dave, do you agree with that comment?","Dave Whikehart","Yes, we get started actually out West with the RVP turn in a few days really, but additional to the RVP turn, Gary, is the shutdown scheduled coming up. That also tends to put a draw on not only Gasper diesel inventories.","Doug Legate","Well, thanks a lot of fellows. Yeah, it does indeed, Gary. My follow-up very quickly and I will hopefully keep it quick, because I've been talking a long time about the stuff already. Just the capture rates and synergies. I'm just wondering if the synergies are flowing through just obviously a little bit quicker, are we now seeing upside risk or permanent reset in your capture rates or maybe the likelihood that you are going to go out with the buying, Gary, and reset the synergies, higher sometime this year. That seems to be really [trending for sure, but I'll leave it there. And again, congrats Gary. I hope to run in to you soon.","Gary Heminger","Yes. You bet, Doug. I'm going to turn it over to Don, but let me say, this is something we've been talking about for some time as our - is our synergy capture. I would say this quarter is where you've seen the accumulation of all the work that we've been doing to really bring the refineries that we just acquired. Ray and his team have done a tremendous job in accelerating the pace of improving those refineries and proving the run rates.","I'll have Don get into the yield improvements, but we think that the catalyst reformulations that we put in, the technology that we put in these plants on a very accelerated basis, you're now going to see that yield improvement as a structural change. Then I'll have Don go over the capture rate here.","Don Templin","Yes, I echo Gary's comments. What we're doing around synergies, I think is repeatable. The capture rate is also impacted by a number of other factors. So this quarter particularly and you saw really in December when the crack spreads drop very quickly, there tends to be some stickiness around refined product capture. So we benefited this quarter from very strong gasoline price realizations, and I think part of that was due to the very sharp decline in crack spreads.","The other thing that we did this quarter that is - won't always be recurring is that, there can be priced differences in markets particularly compared to the benchmark that we're using. So, as I mentioned, Salt Lake City and some of the Southwest regions were very attractive for a period of time and we were able to use our logistics and other integrated model to supply markets where the demand was high and where the pricing was favorable.","Gary Heminger","And one more thing that is clear. Not only do we have yield improvements on the synergies, but our commercial skills of being able to take all these dislocations around many different markets. You couple that with our Midstream system that, the second to none in the industry, but the key factor, the key underlying fundamental is the commercial skills we have to be able to capture that value.","Doug Legate","Very clear fellows. I'll leave that Midstream question to someone else. Thank you so much.","Gary Heminger","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Your line is open sir.","Roger Read","And similarly to Doug, let me say, Gary, thanks for everything and good luck. Not having to talk to us anymore on earnings calls.","Gary Heminger","I'd love to talk with you, Roger.","Roger Read","I know. It's just - I can't see anybody would actually miss earnings calls all that much. I was wondering if we could dig in a little bit on the Coronavirus, and particularly since you're on the West Coast and you're talking about limiting flying, just kind of maybe give an idea of exposure to jet fuel as a component of the distillate side and whether or not that's something we really need to focus on or you've got the flexibility to move that around as well within your trading optional?","Gary Heminger","Yes. In fact, Dave Whikehart will talk to this. Jet fuel is one of the real bright spots in our overall demand equation within MPCs. Dave, you want to cover this.","Dave Whikehart","Yes, so on the - on the West Coast, we actually are - have a short position against our contracted demands and are importing in order to cover that short. So we're actually really well positioned for recovering that internally if the markets send us in that direction. So if there is some sort of impact to jet demand, our position is actually short and should benefit the company.","Roger Read","Okay.","Brian Partee","Roger, this is Brian Partee. Just - I wanted to bolt-on to that too. One of the elements is our demand profile in the U.S. and where we're seeing the growth is actually in the cargo. Though commercial travel is one element, but actually a lot of the growth we're seeing particularly in PADD II and PADD III is in air cargo.","Roger Read","So I guess, we'll watch it like everybody else, but at least we won't panic at this particular point. Second question, little bit on the unrelated side. As we look at some of the future restructuring that may occur here and the guidance obviously on MPLX, on lower CapEx going forward and free cash flow, but one of the thoughts has been or at least as we've talked to investors, expectations have been for cleaning up a little bit on asset sales in that segment. So I was just curious if there's been any progress there or is there any sort of time line we should be thinking about as we look into the, well, the vast majority of this year?","Mike Hennigan","Roger, this is Mike Hennigan. Now there is not a real lot of products to report there, mainly because of the macro backdrop in the gas business with natural gas tipping under $2. We continue to look in the market, but as we said many times, our view is, this will only work for us if we think we've got a real good value for the assets. So in the short term, we continue to look, we continue to have an advisor engaged in helping us look, but I'm not expecting a whole lot of action in the short term.","Gary Heminger","And Roger, I think I don't want the investors to miss, while the Marcellus and Utica has had kind of an umbrella of pressure. Look at our execution and look at our performance, gathered, processed and fractionated volumes up 18%, 14% and 12% respectively in a area that some people had expected will be down. I think this shows the strength of our assets in those regions, the strength of where they're located, and how we have commercially put those transactions together. So I think we're in very good shape and we certainly think this is a - our position, there is a gold standard within the natural gas processing space. So we aren't just going to give assets away.","Roger Read","No, we don't want you to do that. I was just curious if anything was pending, but I appreciate the clarity there. And thanks all. I'll turn it back to you all.","Gary Heminger","All right. Thanks, Roger.","Operator","Our next question comes from Benny Wong with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Benny Wong","Just a little bit around the strategic review in the Midstream. I understand you guys are looking to give us an update in the first quarter here. I guess my question is really, at the same time you guys are looking for a new CEO. How interconnected or related are those two processes. I guess, like, would you guys need a pretty good idea of who is coming in as CEO before you make a decision on your Midstream or how are you guys thinking about that?","Gary Heminger","Well, Benny, as you know, we just had our Board meeting this week and we're on target. And in all of the strategic reviews we're doing, this is a very thorough review with the Board from an operating, execution, and the governance standpoint. So all of those will be taken into context.","Timing wise, all I can say is, we'll see on any overlap, but the structure of the Board is, we have kept the Board so much involved in and they're driving - we have a special committee on the Midstream, a special committee on the Speedway transaction, as well as my successor. And all of them are involved. All of them understand the game plan, and we'll just see how it plays out.","Benny Wong","I appreciate the color there, Gary. And then my next question is really on Speedway. Within your retail budget, I guess, how many store conversions are you guys targeted within there this year? And beyond, how much more opportunity is there for conversions outside of new acquisitions? And if it's possible, would it be possible to give us an update in terms of how much those conversions generally cost you and what's the associate EBITDA or merchandise uplift you're seeing so far?","Gary Heminger","All right. Tim?","Tim Griffith","Yes, Benny, it's Tim. The - in terms of the go forward conversion plans as you heard, we've converted since the close the acquisition over 700 locations. There is probably something on the order of about 250 that would be left to be converted this year. We expect to have that probably done on around mid-year. We haven't given specific guidance on what the earnings potential is per store, what the investment is, but I can certainly point to the fact that you saw relatively strong merchandise same-store sales.","This is really the first quarter where we had the former Andeavor locations and you're starting to see some of that pull-through on the conversions. We go through a little bit of a two phase on conversion where we will convert to the brand and then we'll bring in and re-layout the store, we will re-layout the cooler, we will put food programs in where appropriate, and we're starting to see some of those impacts in the business.","So I'd say, keep an eye on merchandise over the course of the year. I think you're going to continue to see a lot of that uplift which is clearly going to be synergy for the business and really put the business in a good position.","Gary Heminger","And Benny, you'll recall when we announced the acquisition, we saw this as one of our biggest opportunities, a lot of low hanging fruit in being able to improve the store performance, both front court and back court, and that certainly is playing out, you know an exceptional performance to get - over 700 stores converted in this period of time is really exceptional.","Operator","Our next question comes from Manav Gupta with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Manav Gupta","I wanted to focus a little bit on the West Coast. Going back to 1Q '19, throughputs were a little low, OpEx was high, turnaround expense was high, capture was low. As the year has progressed, every metrics has improved to a point where this quarter you almost captured $20 in gross margin. So can you walk us through the measures that have been taken which is now allowing you to not only capture the synergies but operate these assets in a materially better way than they were being operated at the start of the acquisition?","Gary Heminger","Yes, so let me - let me ask Ray to talk about that. So it's not only the operations of the physical assets. Then I want to Dave Whikehart to talk about the commercial side, because the commercial side is equally important on how we have really improved the commercial abilities over there before to what we're doing today. So Ray?","Ray Brooks","You hit on it. In the first quarter of 2019, we did some major work at both LAR and Martinez doing a turnaround work. In the fourth quarter, we were able to take advantage of a billing network. Specifically in October when gasoline got very strong, we were able to pivot quickly and maximize our gasoline production.","One thing I want to focus on LAR is, a couple of things that I'm very proud of the team of doing. The first thing is, we were able to defer some coker work that we planned early in the month. We were able to defer that working with our commercial team by a couple of weeks, so that we could take advantage of the strong margin environment.","The second thing is, one of the synergies we talked about, Gary just talked about on the call today, was catalyst reformulation synergies. The biggest one that we did was in LAR's cat cracking unit, where we did complete reformulation, and this is a big unit, a 100,000 barrel a day cat cracker. And so it went really well.","Everything we wanted to happen, happened. The light product yield went up, the heavy yields went down, the gasoline octane went up. So we were really able to take advantage of that and that paid off well for us in the month of October.","Just one thing I'll say in concluding my part is, the West Coast is a very challenging region and our key focus has been and will be reliability and then also cost control. Now, I'll turn it over to Dave.","Dave Whikehart","So from a commercial standpoint, one of the value adds that we've had managing the West Coast is actually been to rely on the Gulf Coast for shifting our export barrels from - mostly from the West Coast Northern refineries over to the Gulf Coast in order to keep that high valued West Coast product in the West Coast and sell it at those high basis margin.","So there has been basically a tripling of the number of - of the number of cargoes that we've relocated from the West Coast to the Gulf Coast here since the first quarter. So that's a pretty significant improvement given the basis differential between those two markets.","And I would say, secondly, we had a lot of the commercial activity around managing our inventories in that system and had tremendous success in capturing value in basically trading around the refinery given the market conditions.","So I think from a commercial perspective, you've got - you've really got it coming both ways from - not only from the folks at around the ground there and working out of San Antonio, but also our ability to quickly relocate these cargoes from the West Coast to the Gulf Coast as the market dictates.","Rick Hessling","Hey Manav. This is Rick Hessling. I just want to add on to Dave's comments. So from a crude perspective, the story is very similar to what Dave just mentioned. We, with our size, our integration, and our flexibility has enabled to toggle between the Eastern Gulf Coast to the U.S. West Coast with foreign spot and term barrels. That just - that optionality wasn't there in the past. So we've added significant value by optimizing and making those moves as well.","Manav Gupta","All these make a lot of sense. A quick follow-up is, this is more of an IMO question. Gary initially mentioned like heavy sours have moved out WTI, WCS is 21. We are also seeing Brent Maya trend towards that $10. What I'm trying to understand is, if sulfur is the problem, why aren't Mars and medium discount slightly wider or wider from where they are right now. What's causing those spreads to be so narrow?","Gary Heminger","Yes. So it's a great question. There is so many world dynamics going into play with the medium sours, geopolitical events, the events - volume offline, Iranian volume offline. I will tell you as you look out, our view going forward is you will see movement there. Specifically, when we look at the Gulf Coast and you look at the Mars and the production in the Gulf Coast, right around - right now, it's - we're expecting it to exceed 2 million barrels per day in 2020. So that's a good sign.","And I would also say, when you look at the Guyana and Brazilian production that is coming online here, well just recently and more here in 2020, I think you will see some of that trend play out. But short term, I would say it was - it wasn't is geopolitical events beyond anyone's ability to predict going forward. We see this as a potential bright spot.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. Your line is open.","Paul Cheng","And Gary, if I don't talk to you in the next conference call, then best wishes for your retirement. And if you are in New York, please give me a call.","Gary Heminger","Thanks, Paul.","Paul Cheng","A couple of questions. I think the first one is, if I looking at the cash flow, stripping out the MPLX, on the C Corp level, it look like you have - the cash flow is in excess of your CapEx and your dividend. So the question is that - is there any reason why you were not maybe more aggressive in the buyback?","Gary Heminger","Yes, Paul. So as you know, we returned a significant amount of capital this year through share repurchases, nearly $2 billion. Those share repurchases sometimes aren't always ratable, and we also, I think you know, we tend to use or have used tools like 10b5 programs to be able to effect share repurchases. There are times where those type of programs expire in a period where we aren't able to sort of re-implement the program.","So I don't think you should read anything into the amount of share repurchases that occurred in the fourth quarter and extrapolate it into a view that we're not committed to returning capital to shareholders. We are absolutely committed to doing so and we'll continue that practice going forward.","Paul Cheng","The second question is for Ray. Ray, can you tell us that which of your refineries you were able to run the high sulfur fuel oil and how much you run in the fourth quarter and what is the maximum you think you can run if not by refinery, but on a total region or total company? And also, I think you guys have said you are exporting some areas VGO in the fourth quarter. How much you export and what if the current economic sustain, how much more that you will be able to export? Thank you.","Ray Brooks","As far as HSFO that we brand and what our capacity, what we did in the fourth quarter 2019 and the first quarter of 2020 has primarily been on LAR and Martinez, and like I said earlier, running in the 20,000 to 30,000 barrel a day range. Since we're running what we would call a cut resid that essentially has to go through the crude unit.","So when we're running this, we're backing out some crude in the process of doing that primarily at Martinez. So we think we're in a good spot on the West Coast where we have potential, whether this is an HSFO or additional resid that comes from crude if the margins dictate, will be at the Garyville refinery once we complete the expansion.","And just to give you a little color on that. We did the first expansion in the fourth quarter last year and we were targeting to get about a 14% increase in coker, right, we got 17% to date with our debottlenecking there. And we expect a similar type of increase when we do the second coker. So when you put the two together, we're going to be talking about 18,000 barrels a day of additional resid destruction capacity at the Garyville refinery.","Paul Cheng","Ray, in the Garyville that, are you going to run also similar to California that is going to use the [indiscernible] into the crude unit or that you will have the logistic allow you that to direct the figure into the coker?","Ray Brooks","You know it depends on what the cargo looks like and the infrastructure. On the West Coast at LAR and Martinez, we're primarily set up to go through the crude unit. At Garyville, we actually put infrastructure in to take directly into the coker and we've already done that with our internal production that we've directed from Catlettsburg down to Garyville. So at Garyville, we will have the flexibility then to take hot resid direct to the coker or if we get a cut resid or an M100 type material we would take that to the crude unit.","Paul Cheng","Any opportunity in Galveston Bay?","Ray Brooks","Galveston Bay is a little different animal. First, I'll start off by saying, we're keeping our resid destruction units full. And so at Galveston Bay, we have some coking capacity. So we have an opportunity there should we choose. The bigger opportunity at Galveston Bay as far as resid destruction is, with resid hydrotreater.","And so, when we're running all three trains, all of that is 70,000 barrels a day. But we got to be very careful there, because resid - resid quality really matters with that unit and from the stability of the unit. So we actually prefer to fill the RO unit, the resid hydrocracker, be very defined crudes that we run there. So a little less optionality at Galveston Bay relative to LAR, Martinez and Garyville.","Operator","Our next question comes from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Neil Mehta","Gary, really wish you well here. And if Kristina is listening, congrats to her on her baby daughter. I guess the first question is just on the CEO successor process. Can you provide an update on where we stand? It sounds like we'll get an update at the end of the first quarter. And just in general, in conversations with the Board, what are the characteristics important in terms of who you're going to pass the baton to?","Gary Heminger","Yes. As I've said in my earlier comments, the Board has a very detailed, very strong governance and thorough review process national search. They're on target and we expect to give you a - hopefully an answer at the latter part of this quarter, but it's moving along very well. And as I said, the Board is very engaged.","Neil Mehta","All right. And then the follow-up is, actually for Mike here. I think you had made the comment that you're evaluating 25 different options in Midstream, but there was no silver bullet. And I think today, you're seeing the environments tricky for Midstream asset sales. Again, I know you're going to provide a little more color on this. So I'm not asking your front run, but is it fair for us to construe that it would be difficult for you to execute a full spin out of MPLX in the current environment that we're in?","Mike Hennigan","Yes, Neil, like you said, I'm not going to front run the committee. What I can tell you is, the committee is very, very engaged. We've had a lot of detailed discussions and we continue to do that works. We are not quite at a completion. So I won't comment on that.","What I will comment on those that I think this will help you overall is, we've announced the goal to be free cash flow in '21. I would tell you that, return on investing capital is always been a high priority for us, but we did not want to pass on the opportunity for some NVC backed projects like Whistler, and Wink-to-Webster, et cetera.","Also remind everybody, the MPLX does return $3 billion in the form of distributions. So with that, we continue to high grade our portfolio. We're trying to drive to a higher ROIC. And at the end of the day, I think it will be a very good opportunity for us long term to be in that free cash flow positive mode as quickly as we can get there.","Neil Mehta","Yes, the CapEx reduction is notable and we appreciate that. Thanks very much.","Mike Hennigan","You're welcome. Neil.","Doug Wendt","Thank you for your interest in Marathon Petroleum Corporation. Should you have additional questions or would like clarification on topics discussed this morning, we will be available to take your calls.

My name is Katie, and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question and answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Lisa Wilson, Director of Investor Relations. Ms. Wilson, please go ahead.","Lisa Wilson","Thank you, Katie. Welcome to Marathon Petroleum's Fourth Quarter 2015 Earnings Webcast and Conference Call. The synchronized slides that accompany this call can be found on our website at marathonpetroleum.com, under the Investor Center tab.","On the call today are Gary Heminger, President and CEO; Tim Griffith, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and other members of MPC's executive team.","We invite you to read the Safe Harbor statements on Slide 2. It is a reminder that we will be making forward-looking statements during the call and during the question-and-answer session. Actual results may differ materially from what we expect today. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included there as well as in our filings with the SEC.","Now I will turn the call over to Gary Heminger for opening remarks and highlights. Gary?","Gary Heminger","Thanks, Lisa, and good morning to everyone. Before I begin, I want to take the opportunity to introduce Lisa Wilson, our new Director of Investor Relations. Lisa is replacing Geri Ewing, who is transferring to our Finance department.","Lisa has nearly 25 years of experience with the company and was most recently our Director of Financial Services and Insurance.","We are pleased to report fourth quarter 2015 earnings of $187 million, ending a strong year with $2.85 billion in earnings. These results include $370 million pre-tax charge to value our inventory at lower cost to market.","We remained very encouraged by the environment for U.S. refiners and we are pleased to see resilient crack spread supported by attractive product price realizations and continued strong gasoline demand in the fourth quarter.","We believe lower prices at the pump will remain constructive for retail demand as we move through 2016.","Crude oil prices continue to see pressure with the lifting of the Iranian sanctions. Resiliency of domestic producers and the [ph] sentiment in the market. Crude differentials have been and will likely remain volatile.","WTI has traded at parity and in fact higher than Brent recently and we expect this trading pattern could continue in the near-term. However, longer term, we believe it will revert back to a differential based on product quality and transportation cost between the grades.","We believe more favorable sweet\/sour spreads will continue to exist and benefit MPC's complex refinery configuration in the Midwest and Gulf Coast.","In December, , the Southern Access Extension pipeline or SAX came online, providing increased logistics flexibility and crude optionality, allowing us to more cost-effectively move Bakken and Canadian crudes into our Midwest refineries.","SAX allows MPC to access additional advantaged crudes and adjust our slate based on the best economics. Speedway continued its solid performance during the fourth quarter, finishing the year with nearly $1 billion of EBITDA. I want to recognize Tony Kenney and his team's efforts in completing the planned conversions of our East Coast and Southeast retail locations to the Speedway brand well ahead of schedule.","The team's aggressive execution strategy facilitated the realization of its synergies from these locations much sooner than anticipated and beyond our original productions. The acquisition of these high-quality assets has been a tremendous value driver and has exceeded our expectations in virtually every area.","In addition to our strong financial and operational results in 2015, we also made tremendous progress in our strategic objectives of growing the more stable cash flow segments of our business and enhancing our refining margins. An example of enhancing refining margins is the condensate splitter that came online in 2015 at our Catlettsburg refinery, which allows the refinery to process condensate produced in the region and thus improve its realized margins.","Completion of the MPLX and MarkWest merger in early December was a significant accomplishment in the company's strategy. Through this combination, we have created a diversified, large-cap MLP that positions the partnership as a Midstream leader with compelling long-term growth opportunities.","We continue to believe MPLX will create substantial value to MPC's shareholders through its general partner interest and associated incentive distribution rights and we are eager to develop a numerous commercial synergies available to the combine partnership.","I would also like to comment on our long-term commitment to returning capital to shareholders. Through share buyback programs and dividends, we returned a total of $1.6 billion of capital to shareholders in 2015; including $362 million during the fourth quarter.","Delivering attractive capital returns to our shareholders continues to be an instrumental part of our strategy. Through year-end 2015, we have purchased over $7 billion of MPC common stock or approximately 28% of the shares that were outstanding when we became a standalone company.","Our approach to the allocation of capital continues to be balanced and long-term in nature, taking into consideration the requirements of the business, returns to our shareholders and our overall capital structure. As a result, we may increase or decrease the amount of share repurchase activity in any given year based on these variables.","Through disciplined strategic investments in our business and returning capital to shareholders, we remained focused on the long-term value proposition for our investors. This disciplined and prudent approach carries over to our sponsorship of the MPLX. As we evaluate the continued decline in commodity prices and the market's increasing belief that these price conditions will persist for some period of time. MPLX's producer customers are directly impacted. While MPLX's producers are in some of the best areas and continue to manage their capital and production plans very carefully, changes in volume growth will continue to impact income growth for the partnership.","At the same time, valuations with within the MLP space, including MPLX have been severely impacted resulting in yield levels that are substantially higher than what we anticipated at the time of the merger, even with the strong support we expect to continue to make available to the partnership. These factors contributed to the MPLX's decision to provide new distribution growth guidance.","Current market conditions were [ph] to an expected 12% to 15% distribution growth rate for 2016 revised from the prior 25%. Even with this change MPLX's distribution growth continues to be among the highest for large cap diversified MLPs.","We were asked at our Investor Day meeting, if there was a tipping point as to when higher growth guidance will not make sense, I shared then that the conditions did not improve in MPLX's valuation and resulting yield, we would likely revisit the growth outlook for partnership.","Based on the continued deterioration, we have seen since then, we have reached that point and this changed distribution growth is necessary. The commodity and equity market conditions we have now experienced could be temporary and we will assess the growth path for 2017 later this year, providing guidance around the partnership's distribution growth capabilities at that time.","We will take into consideration the capital allocation needs of both MPC and the MPLX, but expect to continue providing support to the partnership as it navigates through this challenging environment. In support of the MPLX's 2016 growth plans, MPC offered to contribute its inland marine business to MPLX at what we believe will be a supportive value and we anticipate receiving MPLX equity in exchange for these assets.","The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2016, pending requisite approvals. This dropdown of additional logistics assets to the partnership further diversifies as high-quality earning stream and underscores the flexibility our sponsorship as MPLX.","MPC is focused on strengthening the earnings power of all aspects of its business. With the expanded margin enhancing investments across the enterprise, we recently announced plans to invest $2 billion at our Galveston Bay refinery over the next five years and investment program collectively referred to as the South Texas Asset Repositioning program or STAR. The investments planned as part of the STAR program of which approximately $150 million will be spent in 2016, are intended to increase production of higher value products and improve the facility's reliability as well as increase processing capacity.","These high return investments were fully integrated at our Galveston Bay refinery with our Texas City refinery, making it the second largest refinery in the U.S. We expect the rapid payback on the stage investments planned for the STAR program, including an earnings stream in 2016.","By using the flexibility inherent in our refining system and optimizing our logistics and transportation network, we are able to react quickly to changing crude oil and refined product market conditions, maximizing our profitability.","In addition, as our downstream earnings demonstrate, our business produced strong results in a wide variety of commodity price environments. We remain optimistic on the long-term prospects for business and continue to believe returns will be compelling, including our sponsorship and GP interest in MPLX.","With that, let me turn the call over to Tim to walk through the financial results for the fourth quarter. Tim?","Tim Griffith ","Thanks, Gary. Slide 4 provides earnings both, on an absolute and per share basis for the fourth quarter and full year of 2015.","MPC's earnings were $187 million or $0.35 per diluted share during the fourth quarter compared to $798 million or $1.43 per diluted share in last year's fourth quarter.","For the full year 2015, our earnings were almost $2.9 billion or $5.26 per diluted share compared to 2014 earnings of $2.5 billion or $4.39 per diluted share.","Chart on Slide 5 shows by segment, change in earnings from the fourth quarter of last year to the fourth quarter of 2015. As Gary mentioned, earnings were impacted during the quarter by $370 million pre-tax charge to adjust inventories to market values. $345 million of this charge is included in the refining and marketing segment and $25 million is reflected in Speedway segment.","After adjusting for the charge, earnings were down $374 million versus fourth quarter last year, largely attributable to our refining and marketing and Speedway segments, partially offset by lower income taxes associated with those lower earnings. I will talk about each of these segments and the changes compared to prior period shortly.","Results for the quarter also, include income from the MarkWest since the December 4th merger date with MPLX, which is included in the renamed Midstream segment, previously known as pipeline transportation and will continue to consolidate MPLX for reporting purposes.","Turning to Slide 6, refining and marketing segment income from operations was $207 million in the fourth quarter compared to just over $1 billion for the fourth quarter of last year. The decrease was primarily due to less favorable crude oil in feedstock acquisition costs relative to our market indicators, largely resulting from narrower crude differentials and lower dollar-based refinery volumetric gains resulting from overall lower overall lower refined product prices.","In addition, the fourth quarter of 2015 reflected an unfavorable LIFO accounting effect of approximate $45 million as compared to a favorable effect of approximate $240 million in the fourth quarter last year. All these unfavorable impacts are included in the $784 million other gross margin step on slide. In addition, segment results were negatively impacted in the quarter by the $345 million LCM charge I just mentioned, which is broken out separately here.","The unfavorable impact from segment income were partially offset by higher LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spreads in Chicago in the Gulf Coast, favorable market structure and improvement in the sweet\/sour differential in the quarter along with slightly higher sour runs.","The blended crack $6365 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to $5.42 per barrel in the fourth quarter of '14. You may recall that the crack spreads we provide in our market metrics on the website are calculated using prompt product and crude prices. The price we actually pay for crude on the other hand is established over the calendar month that we process the crude, but takes into account the market structure. This contango effect is reflected the $192 million favorable difference reflected as market structure on the walk and relates to this difference between the prompt crude prices we use for market metrics and the actual crude acquisition cost.","Slide 7 provides the drivers for the change in refining and marketing segment income on a year-over-year basis. Refining and marketing segment income from operations is nearly $4.2 billion for the full year of 2015 compared to $3.6 billion in 2014.","The LSS 6-3-2-1 blended crack spread had $1.3 billion favorable impact on full-year earnings. With Chicago cracks a $1.11 per barrel better in '15 and Gulf Coast cracks a $1.88 per barrel higher. Based on our estimated mix of 38% Chicago and 62% Gulf Coast has resulted in the blended crack spread of $9.70 per barrel or about $1.59 better than 2014.","In addition, favorable market structure, more favorable product price realizations and lower direct operating costs, driven primarily by lower turnaround activity and lower purchased energy costs had positive impacts on earnings year-over-year. These positive impacts on earnings were partially offset by less favorable crude oil and feedstock acquisition costs relative to our market indicators, large resulting from narrower crude differentials and lower refinery volumetric gains. In addition, the LCM and LIFO accounting impacts I described earlier also impacted 2015 full year earnings.","The impact of more favorable product price realizations, less favorable crude oil feedstock acquisition costs relative to market indicators, lower volumetric gains and the unfavorable LIFO impact are all reflected in the $1.5 billion of other gross margin in the graph.","Other refining and marketing segment net expenses increased $396 million compared to 2014, as a result of a number of items, including higher terminal and transportation costs and lower equity affiliate income.","Slide 8, shows the Speedway segment earnings walk for both, the fourth quarter and full year. Speedway's income from operations was $135 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the fourth quarter's 2014 record quarterly income of $273 million.","Lower gasoline and distillate margins were significant changes in the quarter-over-quarter comparison, decreasing segment income by $93 million. Gasoline and distillate margins averaged $0.1823 per gallon in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to $0.2451 in the fourth quarter of 2014.","The non-cash LCM charge of $25 million and higher operating expenses also had negative impacts on segment income compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. These unfavorable impacts on income were partially offset by higher merchandise margin, which increased from $324 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 to $340 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. The $16 million increase is a result of higher overall merchandise sales in addition to higher margins on those sales.","On a same-store basis, gasoline sales volumes were essentially flat, decreasing three-tenths of a percent and merchandise sales, excluding cigarettes decreased 2.7% in the fourth quarter 2015 compared with 2014.","Speedway's same-store gasoline sales growth was lower than estimated U.S. demand growth as we continually strive to optimize total gasoline contributions between volume and margin to ensure fuel margins remain adequate.","In January 2016, we have see a slight increase in demand with an approximate 1% increase in same-store gasoline sales volumes versus the prior year impacted to some extent by the winter storms in the East in the last few weeks.","Speedway's income from operations for full-year 2015 was $673 million compared with $544 million for 2014.","Results for 2015 include a full year of income from the operations acquired from Hess, whereas 2014 results only include income from those locations in the fourth quarter.","Gasoline and distillate margins increased $401 million from 2014, primarily due to higher volumes resulting from the additional locations acquired as well as higher margins. Gasoline and distillate margins were $0.1823 per gallon in 2015 compared to $0.1775 per gallon in 2014.","Speedway's merchandise margin increased $393 million to $1.4 billion in 2015, primarily due to the increase in a number of locations as well as higher margins on the merchandise sold. Partially offsetting increases in Speedway income from operations for the year were higher operating expenses, primarily attributed to increase in the number of stores.","Turning to Slide 9, as I mentioned, we changed the name of the segment this quarter. Instead of a pipeline transportation segment, we now report a Midstream segment, which continues to include a 100% of MPLX's results, including income contributed by MarkWest since the December 4th merger. The addition of MarkWest is the only change to what is included in the segment.","Midstream segment income was $71 million and $289 million for the fourth quarter and full year 2015 compared with $58 million and $280 million for the comparable periods in 2014. The decrease for the quarter was primarily due to the inclusion of MarkWest from the December 4th merger date and higher income from our pipeline affiliates, partially offset by $26 million of transactions' costs associated with merger.","The increase for the full-year was primarily due to the MarkWest merger and higher transportation revenue resulting from higher average pipeline tariff rates. These favorable impacts were partially offset by $30 million of transactions costs associated with the merger and higher pipeline operating expenses.","Slide 10, presents the significant drivers of changes in our cash flow for the fourth quarter of 2015. At December 31st, our cash balance was $1.1 billion.","Operating cash flow before changes in working capital was $1.2 billion source of cash. The $343 million use of working capital noted on the slide, primarily relates to $693 million decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, partially offset by $361 million decrease in accounts receivable. The decreases in accounts payable and accounts receivable were primarily due to the significant drop in crude and refined product prices during the quarter.","We completed a $1.5 billion public debt offering during the quarter, of which a little more than half was used to extinguish our obligation for the March 2016, 3.5% notes. These new notes, net of some pay down on the MPLX revolver resulted in the $655 million net source of financing cash shown in long-term debt here.","Cash flow was also impacted by the approximately $1.2 billion paid to former MarkWest unitholders as part of the transaction consideration during the quarter, which is shown separately on the graph.","As Gary highlighted, we continue delivering our commitment to balance investments in the business with return of capital to our shareholders. We returned a total of $362 million to shareholders in the fourth quarter bringing the total for the year to $1.6 billion.","Turning to Slide 11, in the fourth quarter, we paid a $0.32 per share dividend, representing 28% increase over the dividend paid during the same quarter last year. We have increased our dividend five times since becoming a standalone company in mid-2011; result in 29.5% compound annual growth rate in dividend. Our continued focus on growing regular quarterly dividends demonstrates our ongoing commitment to our shareholders to sharing the success of the business and we are pleased to affirm that commitment with a $0.32 per share dividend declared earlier this week.","Slide 12 provides an overview of our capitalization as of the end of the year. Just under $12 billion of total consolidated debt reflects the $6.7 billion of debt at MPC, plus the $5.3 billion of debt at MPLX, including the $4.1 billion of MarkWest notes assumed in the transaction.","Total debt to [ph] capitalization was about 38% and represented a manageable 1.9 times last 12 months consolidated EBITDA.","Operating cash flow for the quarter was about $1.2 billion before reflecting the $343 million use of cash for working capital in the quarter.","Slide 13 provides a breakdown by segment of our 2015 capital expenditures and investments, excluding MPLX's acquisition of MarkWest, along with the revised capital plan for 2016. In light of a challenging commodity price environment that Gary talked about, our focus will be to aggressively manage CapEx spending. As part of this process, MPLX lowered its 2016 capital plan from an estimated $1.7 to a range of $1 billion to $1.5 billion. The midpoint of the revised range represents a decrease of approximately $450 million from the previous forecast.","Throughout the courses of '16, we will continue to evaluate our capital program carefully and identify further opportunities to reduce or defer investments where appropriate given the cash and capital constraints of the business.","Slide 14 provides updated outlook information on key operating metrics for MPC for the first quarter of 2016. We are expecting first quarter throughput volumes of $1.7 million barrels per day, which are lower than fourth quarter 2015 volumes due to more planned maintenance this quarter.","Our projected first-quarter corporate and other unallocated items are expected to be about $85 million for the first quarter.","With that, let me turn the call back over to Lisa. Lisa?","Lisa Wilson","Thanks, Tim. As we open the call for your questions, we ask that you limit yourself to one question plus a follow-up. You may re-prompt for additional questions as time permits.","With that, we will now open the call to questions. Katie?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse. Ed, please go ahead.","Ed Westlake","Good morning, everyone. First, before I ask my question, congrats on strong cash generation last year. I think a lot of focus is going to be on capital allocation, so I will kick it off on that. You have cut Midstream CapEx; can you give a little bit of guidance as to what has fallen out of the program and how the program might evolve into 2017, for example, if commodity prices stay low? Then, I have follow-on.","Gary Heminger","Don, you want to handle that please?","Don Templin","Sure. Ed, this is Don. A majority of the decline in that CapEx forecast is around the money we were going to spend in Utica and Marcellus, so you will recall that our original forecast was around $1.7 billion, and on the legacy MPLX side of the business, you know, that money was going to be spent on Cornerstone and the Robinson Butane cavern and a couple of those projects that are continuing on.","The remainder was with respect to our G&P segment and a lot of that spending is going to be matched consistent with our just in time capital spending program to be able to meet our producer customers' demand, but not to deploy the capital in advance of their demands or their needs.","Ed Westlake","Okay. Thank you. Then a follow-on, still on capital, I mean, folks are worried about a recession, people have many different views on that, but you have revised capital down to 3.7. If you did have a period, where the market was stressed and you had to cut CapEx even further? Maybe just talk a little bit through the flexibility that you have in the capital program to manage a downturn. Thanks.","Ed Westlake","In fact, we are analyzing that right now, Ed, and we have several areas where we can manage our capital and that is the prudent thing that we are doing here. While I know it is difficult to lower the capital guidance and lower the distribution growth guidance, we just feel it is necessary to make sure we always manage within our means, so we have those opportunities, we can push some of the retail spending out if we had to that we are getting very high returns and really are very pleased with the returns we are getting there, but we are going through that exercise right now and we have already identified areas that we can be flexible.","Ed Westlake","Okay. Thanks very much.","Gary Heminger","All right, Ed.","Operator","Our next question comes from Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley. Evan, please go ahead.","Evan Calio","Good morning, guys. I think that this will be the theme on capital allocation. Gary, the market is clearly concerned on the Midstream CapEx and MPC's potential carry of MPLX CapEx, potentially expense of the buyback given the state of the new issuance market. I mean, can you further elaborate how far you can go down in MPLX capital spending given the wealth of dropdown assets that you already have?","Gary Heminger","Evan, our first statements here, while the entire MLP market has been under tremendous stress, almost since the day that we announced this transaction, but it was clear even with our increase in distribution last week that the market is still under tremendous stress and is challenge not to recognize that value, so that is why we have really ratchet back our distribution growth, which is certainly part of the capital allocation as we look at it into MPLX.","Don just mentioned how far we have gone; so far we cut back to capital of MPLX and if need be, we could even trim it back some more on the MPC and should it be on the MPLX side.","What we are clearly going to do and it has always been part of our strategy and part of our flexibility is that we will manage to our capital budget whether it is out of refining, whether it is out of Midstream or whether it is out of retail, we will be able to ratchet back to maintain a strong balance sheet.","Evan Calio","Great, and how does the consideration of a buyback, given your view of value and some of the relative underperformance of the stock. I mean, how does the view of a potential cap allocation to a buyback weigh against a potential further reduction of capital spending, whether it would be in refining or Midstream?","Gary Heminger","Sure. Tim, you want to take that?","Tim Griffith","Sure. Evan, again, I think considerations around the total capital allocation for the enterprise will continue to focus on balance. I think as we suggested even at Investor Day and this morning, the amount of share buybacks that we do at any point in time is going to flex depending on the needs of the business, but I think certainly in a environment of capital constraints, we will revisit the spending.","Again, I think the intent and the plan for us is that the commitment around return of capital is really a long-term commitment. We do not get too focused on any one particular quarter one period, but certainly we will need to look at that across the full scope of the capital allocation of the enterprise.","Evan Calio","Thanks guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs. Neil Please go ahead.","Neil Mehta","Hey, good morning, Gary and Tim.","Gary Heminger","Hey, Neil.","Neil Mehta","Gary, can you walk us through the new guidance from 25% down to 12% to 15%? Is there a way to bridge or quantify how much of the delta comes from different components, for example, how much of it is a change in dropdown multiples versus a change in the margin environment at MarkWest or a change in capital spending?","Gary Heminger","Right. Neil, I am going to ask Don and Tim to take this. I am overseas and I need to change phones here. Can you guys take that?","Don Templin","Yes. Neil, this is Don. I guess we were evaluating the full-year and there are a number of factors that we considered. You know, clearly, there has been pressure on volumes, but you know we are still seeing good volume growth and expect good volume growth in Marcellus and Utica to support our underlying business.","We are very confident in the legacy MPLX business or the pipeline business. We are very confident in the steady cash flow of the marine business that has been offered to MPLX. I would say probably the biggest factor that we have been considering and have been analyzing and evaluating is the yield environment and you know the pressure that the yield environment puts on growth is we are funding our growth and issuing new units or funding it with debt.","That has put, you know, incremental pressure on that, so I would say that a lot of our decision in our evaluation has not been based upon the underlying cash flows of the business, but it has really been a function of the way the market has performed since we announced the combination and even since early end of November when we were probably in the 4.5% kind of yield range. You know, we are more than 200 basis points wide of that in just a couple of months' time.","Neil Mehta","Okay. That is very, very clear, Don. Then, Gary, I am not sure if you are back on the line, but maybe the team can take it here. As it relates to gasoline, it is the topic that has been top of mind here.","Week one, it felt like we could dismiss it, the inventory builds due to fog or weather conditions, but we have seen the relentless build in gasoline inventory, so, I want you guys to comment in terms of what you are seeing on demand. It sounds like you are up 1% in gasoline same-store sales, so that sounds fine.","Why do you think we are seeing that level of inventory build and how do you think about the gasoline outlook from here?","Gary Heminger","Yes, Neil. I am back online. Sorry that I had to cut off.","Neil Mehta","Okay.","Gary Heminger","As I said at your conference, we were surprised to see that big of a build and had expected it to be reversed due to a lot of operating issues and it has not reversed to the area that we thought it, but gasoline demand continues to be strong. When we look at our exports, we know averaged 330,000 barrels per day in the fourth quarter of exports, granted we have a couple of turnarounds here early in the first quarter, but that will reduce our number of exports, but also our total volume and capacity will be down a little bit in the first quarter due to the exports.","We see gasoline demand, as Tim stated, up 1% and we see that continuing on and I think I stated in our Analyst Day meeting that we would expect first quarter to be over first quarter last year due to continued lower price versus same period last year, but gasoline and octane continue to be very strong.","Diesel has picked up a little in comparison to the fourth quarter across our same-store sector and our under diesel exports continue to be strong as well, so I will - Mike Palmer, see if he has any additional comments.","Mike Palmer","You know, Gary, the only thing that I would add is that, obviously, this time of year, we typically see gasoline builds, especially in PADD II, and you know that is what we are seeing now. We are getting ready to go into the turnaround season and part of the build that you see is in order to handle the shortfall that we are going to have when those refineries go down. That is only other thing that I would add to your comments.","Neil Mehta","All right guys. Thank you so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brad Heffern from RBC Capital Markets. Brad, please go ahead.","Brad Heffern","Good morning, everyone.","Gary Heminger","Hi, Brad.","Brad Heffern","Again, on a MPLX, I am curious about the projects that you had discussed that had sort of more direct synergies to Marathon itself, the alkylation project and so on. Has the timeline for those projects been pushed back?","Gary Heminger","Not at this time, Brad. You know, when we laid out all those projects in the third and fourth quarter last year, it was always anticipated that these were no longer lead projects and we are continuing to work those very hard. We are in some engineering on a couple of those projects, but we do not anticipate at this time to move those out.","The alkylation project is very important, very important for the producers, very important for our octane needs and the distribution of octane into the refining system. We are still looking at a very strong interest in a solution in order to be able to move propane either to an East Coast market or move propane down into the Gulf Coast, so those are still continuing on and those were the two biggest synergy projects that we had outlined at the time of the transaction and both of those as I say we are continuing to work on.","Brad Heffern","Okay. Thanks for that.","Don Templin","Brad, this is Don. I might even add one more comment on that, particularly on the NGL project. One of the things that we believe is really important is that our producer customers are very much in need of an opportunity to increase the netback, particular on propane. I mean, we have been challenged in terms of getting it to a market where they can realize a higher price, so in our efforts to make sure that we are very sensitive to and focused on our producer customers, we think it is important for us to deliver a project or projects that allow them to get the highest netback they possibly can as quickly as they can, so speed is of the essence in terms of those types of projects.","Brad Heffern","Okay. Understood and thanks for that. Then thinking about the refining business, I am just curious around the crude slate, how things have changed of late, how you are changing, what you are running in the context of mediums and heavies appearing to be much more attractive and lights being less so?","Gary Heminger","Mike?","Mike Palmer","Yes. Brad, this is Mike Palmer. Yes. You have hit the nail on the head. I think what we are seeing now is that, when you look at the light sweet domestic production in this country, you know, we think that those lines are coming off and there is tightness, but at the same time we are seeing very good values on the sour side of the barrel.","We are getting a lot of Middle Eastern crudes that are moving into the Gulf. As you know, the Gulf of Mexico itself has grown and continues to grow and the Canadian heavy sour continues to be a good value, so I think that is exactly what you are going to see happening as there is going to be probably less sweet runs and a shift to sour.","Brad Heffern","Okay. I will leave it there. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Phil Gresh from JPMorgan. Phil, please go ahead.","Phil Gresh","Hi. Good morning.","Gary Heminger","Morning, Phil.","Phil Gresh","The first question is just a follow-up on Neil's question on refining fundamentals. Gary, you have been pretty upbeat about your outlook for the full year. Obviously, you know, it is just the start of the year and January does not make a full year, but I am just curious if what we have seen thus far in any way, reduces your conviction in the full-year refining outlook or if you still think that refining margins should be up in 2016 over 2015 or at least in the first half?","Gary Heminger","Yes. Phil, I still think refining should be strong in the first half, driven as I said earlier by gasoline demand and driven by octane. The crude oil prices have been quite choppy over the last three weeks here. Crude try to get momentum and then [ph], so that would be a little bit of a driver and the differentials of course that goes with that.","Overall demand, again, driven by gasoline. As I said, we have seen some uptick in our diesel over the road demand here so far in the first quarter, but clearly in the market right now are the diesel inventories as Mike Palmer explained we will look at diesel as we go through the turnarounds season within the industry here already started in the Gulf coast. It will move up into PADD II and PADD I, starting in the second quarter should take care of the overhang in the diesel inventory, but if there is any overhang in the margins, I believe, it is going to really be diesel-driven.","Phil Gresh","Okay. Thanks. The second question is on the Midstream side. You guys have talked a lot about the levers available to pull, one of which is of course the support from the MPC side. You still have this significant backlog of droppable inventory, so I guess I just wanted to understand a little bit more how you are thinking about that support mechanism as we move forward and are you less certain about wanting to do drops beyond marine at this point just because of what we are seeing on valuations or just any thoughts around the puts and takes there would be helpful.","Gary Heminger","Sure, Phil. We still have all the flexibility and still have all the interest in supporting MPLX, supporting the Midstream business as we have stated. It is just as Don outlined, if you look at our yields from the time we announced the transaction to the date of closing and until note yesterday.","Obviously, as we speak today, the yield continues to back up. I have always outlined that we believe that the differentiator in the MLP space is the quality of earnings and the quality of distribution growth. We have highlighted very clearly what that quality is and what flexibilities we have. However, the market is the indicator on how that is going to be recognized.","Today, the entire market is under complete stress and MLPs have backed up in their yields value, so we just think it is prudent at this time not to chase that yield. As I said at the last question I had at the Analyst Day meeting, we will continue to assess, but there is no reason to chase the yield that is backing up with when we have very, very high quality assets, very high distribution growth that we can make happen.","I think it is just best that we settle back, we see how the entire market continues to recognize MLP investments. As I said in my talk, we expect this to be temporary and we expect to be able to revert to our initial distribution growth guidance down the road as market settle down a little bit.","Phil Gresh","Okay. Thanks, Gary.","Gary Heminger","You are welcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Cheng from Barclays. Paul, please go ahead.","Paul Cheng","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Gary Heminger","Good morning, Paul.","Paul Cheng","Gary, I have to apologize. First, because I was going to ask a similar questions as other people on the MPLX side. I understand that once you go into a certain construction or that you have certain commitment, so it will base on the commitment and the construction that you already have today. What is the minimum CapEx that you have to spend in the MPLX in 2016 and 2017? Also, what is the maximum that the MPC support on an annual basis that you are willing to do for that CapEx?","Gary Heminger","Sure. We have already outlined, Paul, that on the MPLX side, we dropped the capital back above $450 million from where we had initially approved the capital and I will let Don and Frank take it from there, if there is any - how much more room they have, but I know we have more room to drop back from there. Then I will have Tim cover the maximum that we would support.","Don Templin","Yes. Paul, we have not given specific guidance on sort of what the minimum is. I think that it is important to us to be able to flex in order to be able to meet the increase in volumes that are producers are experiencing and we expect them to experience, so we will continue to monitor that. We do have a lot of knobs to pull or levers to pull and we feel like we can manage capital in a very, very efficient way.","I mean, we expect for example that in fractionation or in processing in Utica and Marcellus, we would expect processing to increase by 20% year-over-year and fractionation to increase by 30% year-over-year, so we are expecting good volume increases and we are going to make sure we are managing our capital appropriately to be able to support our producer customers.","Frank Semple","Yes. Paul with regard to what is the maximum amount that MPC would be prepared to support. I mean, again, the commitment to supporting the partnership as the needs arises there, that support can take a number of different forms.","We have highlighted this morning that the marine assets are being offered into the partnership that what we believe people will see as a very supportive multiple. That is a fantastic opportunity. We would be taking back all units for it, limiting the partnership's need to access the equity markets, we have got options with regard to the intercompany funding either on alone or equity basis, we can look at potential modifications to do GP cash flows.","We have got a host of things that we will look at. I am not sure that there is a hard target number in terms of what supports necessary, but we will continue to look at it in the totality of how the entities will manage each other and MPC is fully supportive of helping the partnership to achieve the objectives that it has got laid out, so we will see what the environment holds.","As Don indicated and Gary highlighted, what really makes things challenging is the higher yield. I mean, obviously for the partnership, for every dollar of growth or earnings that goes into it either on an organic or acquired basis, there are just that many more units that go out, so we will have to assess this as we move along. The support is there and we will remain flexible with regard to what forms make the most sense given the time and circumstances involved.","Paul Cheng","Before I ask the second question, Tim, if I may, I would just say that in a market where there is a lot of nerviness and concern, I think both your shareholder in MPLX and MPC may benefit if the company would come with a more definitive answer in terms of what is the maximum support, and also correspondingly what is the roadmap that MPLX will be able to self fund the remaining. I think that your share pie on both sides probably will do much better if you would be able to come up with an answer in a more direct way for that.","My second question, Tim, is for you. When looking at the refining operation, in addition to your manufacturing costs, your turnaround costs and your DD&A as a bottom. There is always a sort of like the terminal cost and other expense on refining.","In the past couple years ago, that was roughly about running at $215 million a quarter. In the last several quarters, seems now they are running at about in the $350 million to $375 million a quarter, so the question is that, is that a reasonable run rate going forward? If it is, what may have caused the increase over the last couple years?","Tim Griffith","Well, Paul, I think you are sort of referring to the elements of other gross margin in terms of how we have looked at earnings quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year?","Paul Cheng","Yes. I mean, when we do a simple math in the model, if I look at what you record as gross margin in refining and your throughput and then your three cause items that you gave. After we do that, there is a gap between what do we report as your profit and what model we suggest and that gap in deposits is about $215 million a quarter.","In the last several quarters, it has become more like in the $350 million, so I just want to see and I think that in the [ph] one, I understand is that that is including order, the terminal cost and other that is embedded and one is core business inside refining.","Gary Heminger","Yes. Again, there are certainly some seasonal factors that enter in too, but you are talking about things that would include sort of marketing, transportation, other expenses that get factored in.","Paul Cheng","That is correct.","Gary Heminger","Again, I would not say there has been any structural change to the sort of run rate around the expenses related. A lot of it will move higher based on some unplanned turnaround activity to the extent that comes in.","We have certainly been impacted and benefited from the lower overall fuel costs related to natural gas. I would say as the structural matter, there is nothing that has moved dramatically. The notion that there is roughly $200 million gap, again I think it is difficult to predict based on the environment, but with regard to the refining system itself there is nothing that has structurally change that would impact that.","Don Templin","Hey, Paul, this is Don. I had maybe one other comment or observation. I mean, that number when prices are going up really quickly or prices are coming down really quickly, that number seems to expand or contract.","While we have had volatility in the markets, we have had sort of relative prices have relatively have not moved down as fast or up as fast, so we get impacted in there when RIN prices move up really quickly or move down really quickly. We get impacted when commodity prices are moving up really quickly or down quickly. Even though it is a low-price environment, because we go a little bit more steady action there, I think, that is probably what has moderated a little bit from some of the previous quarters.","Paul Cheng","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chi Chow from Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Chi, please go ahead.","Chi Chow","Thank you. Good morning. My question may be a little bit derivative from Paul's here. It looks like you cut MPLX CapEx, obviously, but you kept the Midstream spending at the MPC level constant at about $830 million, looking at your slide 13 here.","Can you talk about what projects are in that bucket and how much of that capital is earmarked for the support for MPLX in terms of incubating projects or other growth initiatives?","Gary Heminger","Don?","Don Templin","I guess, some of the ones that are in the MPC bucket versus, I will call up that the, G&P bucket or the logistics and storage, would include investments and things like we had some tail expenditures on the Southern Access Extension when we completed that. We have investments in Sandpiper as we are funding that with our joint venture partner Enbridge, so some of those projects, Chi, are ones that are longer lived, had some maybe bigger dollars associated with them. It was one of the reasons why we were actually incubating those up at MPC versus funding them directly at MPLX.","I might also add, we have been making some investments in blue water, our joint venture with Crowley, the investment in the blue water vessels, so those are some of the things that are sitting up in MPC and not in the MPLX number.","Chi Chow","Don, again, looking at Slide 13, is that in the $351 million bucket, the Midstream R&M piece or is that in the other Midstream bucket excluding MPLX down below, which amounts to about $480 million to the other bucket from what I gather here.","Don Templin","I am sorry. I missed your question Chi?","Chi Chow","The SAX and Sandpiper spending in the blue water, is that all, and you have got two buckets of Midstream CapEx here on Page 13. You have got a Midstream R&M piece, $351 million. If I back out the MPLX CapEx in the second Midstream bucket, it gets to about $480 million.","I am just wondering, I guess the bottom-line question is, is there room to cut the MPC Midstream CapEx or do you still need to spend that $830 million in support of MPLX going forward here?","Don Templin","I would say that the MPC piece of it is probably a little less flexibility in terms of cutting that. The stuff that is in MPLX consolidated, there is a lot more flexibility there.","Chi Chow","Okay. Maybe I will follow up with some details later. I guess, secondly, on the marine asset drop. Can you provide us any sort of EBITDA guidance on the\u2026","Don Templin","Yes. We expect the next 12 months EBITDA to be around $120 million, Chi.","Chi Chow","Okay. You kind of hinted at it, but any sort of dropdown multiple you can share at this point?","Don Templin","We cannot share that right now, because the process is going through. It has been referred by MPC to the MPLX special committee or conflicts committee, so they are working through their valuation and we would not want to get in front of that.","Chi Chow","Okay. Final question on the condensate splitters, can you provide an update on the operation there and discussed the accretion and returns you might have realized in the fourth quarter?","Gary Heminger","Chi, we do not breakout the splitters at Canton and Catlettsburg separately, but both are operating at their design capacity. Mike Palmer, can talk about what the design capacity and what we have been running them at.","Mike Palmer","Yes. Gary, I sure can. The two splitters, you know, Catlettsburg has a design capacity of 35,000 barrels a day. Canton is 25,000 barrels a day. Total of 60, we are operating those two splitters at the plan that we have had. Typically, we do not talk about just exactly how much we were running. We still got some room. We are not full, but that was the plan for this point forward.","I can tell you that we are buying as much condensate now as we have at any time in the past. That condensate production is holding up well, our strategy is working well. We did have a little bit of weather issue in January, but really that is all we have seen, so it continues to work per plan.","Chi Chow","Okay. Mike, can I ask, it looks like from some public pricing sources that Utica condensate prices fell below $10 a barrel in January and still holding in the low teens. Is that the level of feedstock cost you are realizing for the splitters?","Mike Palmer","Again, Chi, we do not really talk specifically about those price levels. I think all we said in the past is, what you need to do is take a look at the Ergon [ph] postings in that area to give you an idea of what the prices look like.","Chi Chow","Okay. That is good enough. Thanks. I appreciate it, Mike.","Operator","Our next question comes from Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Doug, please go ahead.","Doug Leggate","Thanks to everybody. I know we are getting close to the top of the hour, so thanks for getting me on, but I guess we cancelled the two question rule today. I have two questions, if I may.","First one is also on the MLP. Gary, to you, as you are taking units from MPLX, when MPLX is already very, very weak, thinking about the saturation of piling on and top of the existing MPLX shareholders, why not just slow down or defer the marine dropdown like you were originally going to do rather than force more equity into the market. What is probably going to have to be a relatively low multiple for MPC shareholders?","Gary Heminger","That is certainly is one of the things that we have looked at, Doug. Let me turn it over to Tim, as Tim has done all the analysis on what we think the best options are.","Tim Griffith","Yes. I mean, I think, ultimately as we scope the distributable cash flow necessary to support growth and the partnership, adding incremental earnings into the partnership is necessary, frankly, just to support the distribution growth even as revised this morning, so a deferral would put the partnership in a more compromised position and obviously, getting the earnings base recalibrated.","I mean, in addition to the growth of distributable cash flow, we are also sort of very carefully watching the leverage profile of the partnership and the capacity to take on any incremental debt there is more limited, so this is, Doug, I think really a necessary step to keep us on the path that is designed and has been shared with the investment community with regard to the distribution growth.","We have looked at a number of different alternatives and I think adding the Marine business into MPLX both, from a diversification and to support the growth and distributable cash flows, is what we think makes the most sense at this point.","Doug Leggate","Okay. Just a quick follow-up to that, Tim, just to clarify what I am asking, so MPLX right now is trading on about a 6.5 times multiple of enterprise value based on your guidance you have given today. There is the legacy dropdowns for the industry, the whole MLP argument or case was predicated on our 8 to 10-plus times multiple.","From an MPC standpoint, are MPC shareholders going to get proper value recognition for the assets you are dropping down in this environment? That was kind of what I am asking.","Tim Griffith","Well, we think so. Again, I think, for the entire - MLP space to the extent that yields have moved up, it is highly likely that multiples likely would move lower. I think, you will see evidence of that as we get through our transaction here.","Again, we think that the long-term value to MPC really again relates to the GP and the potential IDR stream and cash flows that are generated from the partnership over a period of time and the growth in distributions made possible by the drop of marine and other assets from MPC will help to accomplish that over time.","Obviously, it slows a bit here relative to our initial expectations on growth, but we still think the long-term value proposition is very strong.","Doug Leggate","Okay. Thanks a lot. My follow-up is just a quick follow-up on gasoline, so whoever wants to take this. Gary, as you know, I think we have been kind of a lone voice in talking about too much U.S. gas in the supply for quite some time. It seems to becoming [ph] home tourist to some extent.","My question is, a lot of your competitors are still talking about max gasoline modes and given the weakness in distillate, what is Marathon's view on nice gasoline versus nice distillate in winter. At what point do you - basically just runs to limit gasoline output and I will leave it there? Thanks.","Gary Heminger","Right. Well, we review that every day, Doug. As I have stated before, we are able to flex our gasoline versus distillate make around 8% to 10%, so every day we are looking at that termination on the values in the marketplace and we are just coming up now on starting to make [ph] for pressure gasoline getting ready for the changeover. We have the market starting early April to make sure it is in 8% to 10%. 8% to 10% is how we can flex, but every day we are making that decision on what is the best product to make.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ryan Todd from Deutsche Bank. Ryan, please go ahead.","Ryan Todd","Thanks. Good morning, everybody. I will try to avoid one more shot at the horse and ask you a couple of quick refining ones. Maybe is a follow-up on the last question, you had a relatively high gasoline yield of 50% in the quarter, which is higher generally than what we have seen historically? Was that seasonality one-off effects. Is that kind of a maximum of process system? Is at the high end of where we can flex or is that a sustainable number that you think going forward if it were necessary?","Gary Heminger","Mike, you want to cover why we have more gasoline?","Mike Palmer","Gary, as you pointed out, determining whether we are going to be at max gasoline or max distillate is something that we look at continuously. You know the only thing I can say there is that, with regard to the 50%, I mean, economically that was the best place for us to be at that time.","We certainly have seen a lot of strength with regard to gasoline exports in the current environment, a lot of that coming out of Latin America and even in the Far East and that is probably one of the reasons that the gasoline makes that high.","Ryan Todd","Okay. Thanks. Then maybe one follow-up on your outlook on turnaround season, as you look at turnaround season in the first half of the year, do you think that we will see the potential guidance to accelerate run cuts into the weak environment? Your outlook for a normal versus a heavy turnaround season and it seems like in your guidance, there is a relatively healthy amount of downtime, so any thoughts around both yours and maybe the industry turnaround season into the first half of '16?","Mike Palmer","Yes. Clearly, all of the refining industry, we look at the where the inventory situation and what the margins are. In the event, and we continue to expect gasoline to be strong, but in the event inventories are not in balance after the turnaround season here. It appears to be about normal season in the Gulf Coast, maybe a little bit heavier going into PADD2 early in the second quarter remains to be seen.","I think the refining industry, as well as specific I can speak for Marathon. We have been very cautious and very prudent and always so watching the margins and if run cuts need to be made, the industry I think has been a very quick to assess that, but backup and say we do not see any issues today - any need for immediate run cuts. It is something that we certainly will watch going out into the second half of the year.","Operator","Our last question comes from Paul Sankey from Wolfe Research. Paul, please go ahead.","Paul Sankey","Hi, everyone. Thanks. It is going to be the same old subject. Just one on gasoline, Gary, your same-store sales were negative, very mildly negative in Q4. I was wondering why you would then think that how you could square the circle between being relatively optimistic on demand against what looks like quite a weak number actually to end the year.","Additionally, could you just repeat the points about you think that gasoline inventory is being built here specifically with a view to a big turnaround season about to come, because it does seem that we are in turnaround season.","Then just to hurry things up, I will tell you the follow-up is totally separate. Do you have a longer-term CapEx guidance for MPLX and MarkWest, given the changes since the Analyst Meeting? Thank you very much.","Gary Heminger","Okay. On demand [ph] I have Tony covered in more detail, but let me remind everyone that one of the - a same-store calculation really takes into account two things. Overall demand, but overall posture and how we are pricing into the marketplace.","As Tim had in his script, we are always going to optimize and maximize what we believe to be the pricing posture in order to be able to get adequate returns within the Speedway space.","Tony, I will turn it over to you. I believe that is exactly how you operated, so you want to make a few comments?","Tony Kenney","Yes. Gary, sure I will and you are exactly right. There is a lot of factors, Paul, that go into what really determines our same-store calculation. Speedway is on a growth profile and we continually add new stores is one example and some of the opportunity is to move volume to our new store.","Overall for the quarter, if you looked at Speedway's total light product volume, we are actually up in total gallons, but when you do it on a true same-store basis, because of a lot of variables, one being the movement of volume, other factors within the PADD that we are seeing, as well as what Gary talked about in terms of the balance between volume and margin that we take going forward.","Paul Sankey","Got it, so you have got some pricing power, which gives you the knowledge that demand is pretty good?","Tony Kenney","Right. The other thing, Paul, we have recognized here in part of January the numbers Tim stated in his script were up 1.1%, I believe, so far as this month, but we were up higher than that in the first half of the month and we are very strong same-store month-on-month, but then the bump in crude prices, the quick response to the street cost you some volume.","When you are one of the leaders in the market that is what happen, so we still continue to be very bullish on gasoline demand going into the second part of the year.","Don, you want to take the question on the capital and then I will follow-up with a little bit more on the MPLX guidance?","Don Templin","Sure. We have not provided incremental outlook on capital spending. I guess, I would say it this way, Paul. The resource exists, we are very confident it does. Our producer customers are in what we believe to be very good regions and plays.","The projects exist and what we are really doing is, we are managing the completion of projects to coincide with the volumes that are producer customers are producing, so we believe that the projects and the revenue opportunities are there. It is likely that some of those make it stretched a bit and we will match our capital plan to deal with the potential stretching in the volumes but we are very confident in our producer customers and the resources and their ability to long-term to deliver those volumes.","Gary Heminger","Thanks, Don. Go ahead, Paul.","Paul Sankey","I was just thinking should we just cut some of our long-term assumptions based on what you said and assume that even '16 will be a relatively high year? Post the cut, still high relative to the future?","Gary Heminger","I do not know. If prices rebound by the end of the year, Paul, it would be really dependent, I think, on sort of where prices end the year and what the outlook is for '17 and what the producer customers' drilling program and profiles are.","Paul Sankey","Okay. Thank you.","Gary Heminger","Paul, to that point, and I know there are number of questions that we had throughout this call. We reduce our guidance in this call. As I stated, we have decided at this time to suspend talking about guidance beyond '16. We just think that is the prudent thing to do. As we look at the overall business, we have been very clear. We have a temporary pullback here. I expect and my entire team expects, so this is temporary.","As Don just stated, if crude prices rebound like we anticipate they will in the second half of this year, that could lead to volume growth, that could lead to producers being quicker to return into their producing regions, especially in the Utica and Marcellus, that is very important to our Midstream, but I want to temper any concerns about going past '16, because it is just important that we take care of the work at hand here then we will look at what happens beyond '16.","Again, I think prices will recover in the second half and we will see where we go from there, but there is no reason to get into a discussion beyond '16 at this time.","Lisa, I will turn it back to you.","Lisa Wilson","Thank you, Gary. Thank you for joining us today. Thank you for your interest in Marathon Petroleum Corporation. Should you have additional questions or would like clarification on topics discussed to this morning, Teresa Homan and I will be available to take your calls.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating and you may now disconnect."],"14338":["Marathon Petroleum Corp (NYSE:MPC) Q3 2018 Earnings Conference Call November  1, 2018  9:00 AM ET","Executives","Kristina Kazarian - VP, IR","Gary Heminger - Chairman & CEO","Donald Templin - President","Timothy Griffith - SVP & CFO","Rick Hessling - SVP, Crude Oil Supply & Logistics","Michael Hennigan - President & Director","Gregory Goff - Executive Vice Chairman","Raymond Brooks - EVP, Refining","Analysts","Douglas Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs Group","Philip Gresh - JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Roger Read - Wells Fargo Securities","Douglas Terreson - Evercore ISI","Manav Gupta - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse","Prashant Rao - Citigroup","Bradley Heffern - RBC Capital Markets","Paul Cheng - Barclays Bank","Operator","Welcome to the MPC Third Quarter Earnings Call. My name is Elan, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions]. Please note that this conference is now being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Kristina Kazarian. Kristina, you may begin.","Kristina Kazarian","Welcome to Marathon Petroleum's third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. The slides that accompany this call can be found on our website at marathonpetroleum.com under the Investor Center tab. On the call today are Gary Heminger, Chairman and CEO; Greg Goff, Executive Vice Chairman; Tim Griffith, CFO; Don Templin, President of Refining, Marketing and Supply; Mike Hennigan, President of MPLX; as well as other members of the executive team.","We invite you to read the safe harbor statement on Slide 2. It's a reminder that we will be making forward-looking statements during the call and during the question-and-answer session. Actual results may differ materially from what we expect today. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included there as well as in our filings with the SEC.","Now I will turn the call over to Gary Heminger for opening remarks on Slide 3.","Gary Heminger","Thanks, Kristina. Good morning, and thank you, everyone, for joining our call. Earlier this morning, we reported another impressive quarter. Our net income attributable to MPC was $737 million, and we were pleased to report adjusted EBITDA of approximately $2 billion for the second quarter in a row. Our refining throughput was strong at slightly north of 2 million barrels per day. This was especially impressive, considering we had both our Detroit and Canton refineries in turnaround during the quarter, both of which were completed on time and under budget.","Our integrated business model, together with our team's commercial and operational execution, continue to create opportunities for us to capture value, driving over $1.2 billion of cash from operations, which allowed us to return over $600 million to shareholders in the quarter. During the quarter,, we repurchased $400 million of shares, even though our repurchase ability was limited by the proxy solicitation period. Through the first 9 months of this year, we have returned $3.2 billion of capital to our shareholders and remain committed to our strategy of returning excess cash flow going forward. And we expect to resume our repurchase activity shortly as market and other conditions allow.","On October 1, we closed on our transaction with Andeavor. Both sets of shareholders demonstrated overwhelming support as we are now the leading integrated downstream energy company in the U.S. As we look forward, we see extraordinary potential across our nationwide platform, including over $1 billion of annual run rate synergies within the first three years. Over the first few months, our teams will be diligently working on integrating the business, deploying the best practices and aligning the cultures. In just the first month, I'm especially impressed with the enthusiasm and energy of our commercial teams. We are already harvesting synergies and plan to report on our progress regularly, starting in 2019.","As we look to the fourth quarter and into 2019, we see a lot of positive market trends for our business. Both global and U.S. economic growth continues. While risk factors and the recent market pullback have been the focal point of news headlines, the fundamentals that underpin distillate demand appears strong. Inventory levels remaining moderate and days of supply are near 5-year lows. We believe current distillate trends, combined with the impact of changing IMO regulations around sulfur content, will support strong distillate demand well into the future, and we are well positioned given the investments we have made in our business over the last decade. As you may recall, MPC now has the highest coking and hydrocracking capacity in the U.S.","Despite recently weaker gasoline markets, our integrated business model allows us to both flex our yields to maximize our gasoline-to-distillate ratio as well as take advantage of export opportunities. In October, we exported approximately 370,000 barrels per day.","With limited turnarounds as we head into 2019, our refining system has the opportunity to capture what appears to be sustainably wider crude differentials in many of our markets. With Detroit and St. Paul Park now out of turnaround, both plants are poised to harvest these wider WCS differentials. We expect to run approximately 500,000 barrels per day of various Canadian crudes across our new refining system. The differentials across these grades, and in particular WCS, appear to be sustainably wider, given meaningful logistics constraints relative to production levels.","As we look at our optionality in crude slate, we see opportunities to maximize usage of WTI-based crudes. With the addition of 400,000 barrels per day of MidCon refining capacity, we now have over 1 million barrels per day that are very well positioned to capture the attractive crude differentials in those markets.","We are currently wrapping up our fourth quarter plant turnaround for the Martinez refinery and have some minor maintenance planned at the Robinson refinery.","Lastly, as you may have already seen, we announced that we are evaluating the financial business plans of Andeavor Logistics, with the intent to move toward financial policies more consistent with our approach toward MPLX. MPC plans to engage advisers and begin the process of assessing all options for the 2 MLPs, which could include MPLX acquiring ANDX or ANDX acquiring MPLX. Our comments will be limited on this as we work through our evaluation and process, and we will provide an update to investors at the appropriate time.","Now let me turn the call over to Don to cover additional highlights for the third quarter and an update on our integration process. Don?","Donald Templin","Thanks, Gary. Turning to Slide 4. We reported third quarter earnings of $737 million and income from operations of $1.4 billion. Refining & Marketing delivered strong results with third quarter segment earnings of $666 million. We operated exceptionally well throughout the quarter and achieved 97% utilization across our refining system, despite having our Canton and Detroit refineries in turnaround during the quarter. Within the Midstream segment, which largely reflects the financial results of MPLX, we reported income from operations of $679 million, driven by strong pipeline throughput volumes as well as record gathered process and fractionated volumes during the third quarter.","MPLX announced several new projects during the quarter, including planned investments in two long-haul pipelines as well as the acquisition of a Gulf Coast export terminal in Louisiana. We encourage you to listen in on the MPLX call at 11 a.m. this morning to hear more about MPLX's performance and the opportunities across the business. We would also point you to ANDX's call on November 7, as both partnerships will be part of our Midstream segment going forward.","On the retail side, Speedway reported income from operations of $161 million. In the third quarter, gasoline and distillate margins continued to be adversely impacted by rising crude oil prices. In a rising market, there is a delay in our ability to react at The Street, which pressures margins. Our focus continues to be optimizing total gasoline contributions between volume and margin as market conditions adjust.","While our third quarter earnings materials do not reflect the results for Andeavor, I would like to provide some key statistics for the quarter, which demonstrate continued strong performance in the legacy business. The legacy Andeavor refining segment had throughput of 1.1 million barrels per day, which was roughly 97% utilization. The Andeavor index was $16.03 per barrel for the quarter with a margin capture rate of 80%. Manufacturing cost was $5.50 per barrel. We look forward to reporting on a consolidated basis starting in the fourth quarter when we think the tremendous benefits to combining these two powerful businesses will be evident.","As shown on Slide 5, one of the first tangible signs of integration comes from the retail segment. We immediately started converting the Andeavor company-owned and operated stores to the Speedway brand. At the end of October, roughly 90 sites in the St. Paul and Minneapolis markets have been converted, and we expect to complete approximately 200 sites by the end of 2018. These conversions are an important element in the synergy capture we are driving. We are learning each day, implementing the best practices from each organization, and while the conversions of the Speedway stores are an easy first milestone to point out, we look forward to providing more updates across our refining, midstream and retail organizations at our upcoming Investor Day.","With that, let me turn our call over to Tim to provide a more detailed walk-through of the financial results for the third quarter.","Timothy Griffith","Thanks, Don. Slide 6 provides earnings on both an absolute and per share basis. For the third quarter 2018, MPC reported earnings of $1.62 per diluted share compared to $1.77 per diluted share last year. Third quarter 2018 earnings of $1.62 per diluted share included pretax charges of $49 million related to pension settlement and transaction costs or approximately $0.08 per share. The bridge on Slide 7 shows the change in earnings by segment over the third quarter last year. The log shows a decline of $431 million in the Refining & Marketing earnings. Approximately $230 million of the variance was driven by the February 1 dropdown transaction as we don't reflect the impact of these drops in prior period segment results. The remaining variance is driven by lower crack spreads and higher turnaround costs in the quarter.","Speedway's third quarter results were lower than the same quarter last year by $47 million, primarily related to lower light product margins and higher operating expenses. The $324 million favorable Midstream variance was due to the February 1 drop of refining logistics and fuels distribution services to MPLX as well as higher pipeline volumes and record gathered process and fractionated volumes compared to last year. The unfavorable year-over-year variance in items not allocated to segments was largely due to transaction costs related to the combination of Andeavor and increased employee benefit costs.","Interest and financing costs were $82 million higher during the third quarter of this year due to higher debt levels at MPLX compared to last year and $45 million of pension settlement charges in the quarter. Interest and financing costs were -- I'm sorry, income taxes were a benefit as lower taxable income, combined with lower tax rate, resulted in $193 million lower taxes compared to last year.","The higher earnings in MPLX resulted in an increased allocation of MPLX earnings to the publicly held units in the partnership, shown here as $103 million in noncontrolling interest variance. Turning to Slide 8. Our Refining & Marketing segment reported earnings of $666 million in the third quarter of '18 compared to nearly $1.1 billion in the same quarter last year. The LLS-based blended crack spread had $111 million unfavorable impact to segment results, largely due to lower Midwest and Gulf Coast crack spreads. The LLS blended 6-3-2-1 crack spread was $8.03 per barrel in the third quarter of '18 as compared to $8.68 per barrel in the third quarter of 2017, reflecting to some extent the wider cracks experienced during Hurricane Harvey last year.","Our ability to take advantage of crude differentials provided substantial benefits in the quarter. The widening sweet\/sour differential had a positive effect of approximately $283 million versus last year, with the differential increasing from $5.42 per barrel in the third quarter of '17 to $9.09 per barrel in 2018. The LSS\/WTI differential increased to $4.71 per barrel, up from $3.42 per barrel in the third quarter of 2017. This wider differential drove $102 million benefit based on the WTI-linked crude in our slate.","Direct operating costs for the third quarter were $6.60 per barrel compared with $6.37 per barrel in the third quarter of 2017, resulting in a $51 million unfavorable impact to segment earnings. The increase was driven by higher turnaround and maintenance spend during the quarter. The $419 million unfavorable variance in other R&M expenses is primarily due to the fees paid to MPLX related to the businesses that were dropped to MPLX in February. Prior period R&M results were not adjusted to reflect these newly constituted businesses.","Moving to our other segments. Slide 9 provides the Speedway segment results walk for the third quarter. Segment income from operations was $161 million compared to $208 million in the third quarter last year. The year-over-year decrease in segment results is primarily related to lower light product margins and higher operating expenses. Speedway's gasoline and distillate margin decreased to $0.165 per gallon in the third quarter of 2018 compared to $0.177 per gallon in the third quarter of 2017, primarily due to the effects of rising crude oil prices and the lag effect at the retail level. Same-store merchandise sales, excluding cigarettes, increased by 4.9% in the third quarter of 2018 versus same quarter last year, leading to the $10 million increase in merchandise margin.","Operating expenses increased $28 million year-over-year, mainly due to higher labor and benefit costs and depreciation, which was $8 million higher, primarily due to increased investments in the business. For the month of October, we experienced approximately 0.5% increase in same-store gasoline volumes versus last year. Slide 10 provides the Midstream segment results for the third quarter. Segment income was $679 million in the third quarter of 2018 compared to $355 million for the same period in 2017. The $361 million improvement for MPLX was favorably impacted by $230 million from the earnings of the businesses included in the February 1 dropdown. The rest of the improvement is related to higher pipeline throughput volumes and record gathered, processed and fractionated volumes. As Don referenced, we encourage you to listen in the call at 11 to hear color in MPLX's strong performance in the third quarter.","Slide 11 presents the elements of changes in our consolidated cash position for the third quarter. Cash at the end of the quarter was nearly $5 billion, including the approximately $3.5 billion necessary to close the Andeavor transaction on October 1. Core operating cash flow before change to working capital was a $1.6 billion source of cash in the quarter. Working capital was a $408 million use of cash in the quarter, largely due to lower volumes of net crude payables, offset to some extent by a net inventory reduction in the quarter. ","Return of capital to shareholders by share repurchase and dividends totaled $607 million in the quarter. The $400 million of shares acquired was accomplished despite having a more limited window to repurchase shares, given the pending Andeavor transaction vote in closing. Looking forward, we remain committed to our disciplined capital strategy and returning capital beyond the needs of the business in a manner consistent with maintaining the company's current investment-grade credit profile and expect to resume share repurchase activity consistent with that strategy during the fourth quarter. We plan to provide an update and guidance around capital allocation strategy at the Investor Day in December.","Slide 12 provides an overview of our capitalization and financial profile at the end of the third quarter. We had approximately $18.5 billion of total consolidated debt, including nearly $13 billion of debt at MPLX. Total debt represented 2.8x last 12 months adjusted EBITDA on a consolidated basis or 1.4x EBITDA excluding the debt and EBITDA of MPLX. Lower [indiscernible] for distributions from MPLX are added to the debt service capabilities of the parent. Moving to Slide 13. We intend to provide fourth quarter and 2019 guidance at our Investor Day in December, and we'll be suspending publication of the market data on our website until then. Given all the moving pieces, we want to provide an update to the company's 2018 capital investment plan to give an illustration of run rate capital spending for the combined business. On a consolidated basis, including the MLPs, we expect to invest roughly $6 billion this year. This combined total remains in line with prior guidance. As you can see on the slide, roughly half of the planned investment will be pursued and funded by MPLX and ANDX directly. We look forward to providing our 2019 capital outlook at our Analyst Day on December 4. We hope you can join us.","With that, let me turn the call back over to Kristina.","Kristina Kazarian","Thanks, Tim. [Operator Instructions].","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question today is from Doug Terreson from Evercore ISI.","Douglas Terreson","Congratulations on close of the Andeavor transaction. And then first, Gary, in Refining, your turnaround activity was really high in the Midwest this quarter, and it seemed to be abnormally high during 2018 overall as well. And on this point -- my question is, were higher turnarounds by design somewhat, such as the company is prepared to capture benefits during the 2019, 2020 IMO period or other factors at work? And either way, what are the implications or the profile for refinery utilization given the situation over the next couple of years?","Gary Heminger","That's a very good question and kind of top on the charts of what we're working on, Doug. First of all, with the -- in combining the new companies, we are really attempting to smooth out these turnarounds so we don't have a lumpy turnaround schedule in any given period. As I look at what we just completed here, there's some work done at El Paso, St. Paul, Detroit, Canton, and we're just about completing a turnaround at Martinez. But especially when you look at those markets around the MidCon, and as I said in my script earlier, we're now going to have 1 million barrels a day -- a little over 1 million barrels a day of refining capacity in and around the WTI in Cushing-related crudes, which is a significant benefit. And we have all that work behind us, and as I say, we're going to really smooth things out going forward into '19 and '20 and believe that '19 is going to be really kind of a soft year in the turnaround space.","Douglas Terreson","Okay, good. That sounds great for utilization. And then also, Tim talked about share repurchases, and just to clarify, my recollection is that you guys were restricted from purchasing shares for about 2\/3 of the quarter. So my question is, is that a good approximation? And second, with cash flows that's derived significantly with the transaction, I want to see if you could provide some more color or the plan for share repurchases for the medium term because it seems like we should see a ramp in that area.","Timothy Griffith","Yes, Doug, it's a good question. The -- you're exactly right that we were precluded during the proxy period from doing share repurchase. So actually, $400 million was a pretty good clip given the periods that we could not be in the market. I think you can expect to see that our approach on this and the return of cash beyond the needs of the business is going to be as steadfast as ever. I mean, a big part of the combination, certainly, was the incremental cash flow provided by the transaction. And as the synergies come online, the business continues to perform, I think the expectation that share repurchase will be an important part of our capital allocation is an appropriate assumption.","Operator","Our next question is from Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs.","Neil Mehta","Gary, I want to start off on your comment in your prepared remarks around the 500,000 barrels a day of Canadian crude that you're taking in right now. It's a big number. So can you talk about kind of what the economics of that crude that you're bringing in? I'm sure not all of it is getting the discounted heavier light barrel. And how much of a tailwind you see that being on a go-forward basis? And to frame that out, if you could just talk about your broader views on Western Canadian differentials from here.","Gary Heminger","Sure. I'm going to ask Rick Hessling to get into that in more detail. And as you know, as we visited last week, we talked a little bit about the Canadian as well. And not only are we a very large purchaser of WCS, but we're very large in the Syncrude side, which have had tremendous margins, or I should say, differentials as well. But Rick will give you some more detail.","Rick Hessling","Yes, Neil, it is a very good question. So on the heavy front, as you know, on the WCS side, it's touched $50 under TI; and Syncrude, I think, yesterday touched $32 under. So as Gary mentioned, there's a lot of upside for us. We mentioned our purchases being north of 500,000. We do not share and break down how much is fully discounted and how much isn't. What I can share, though, is that our optionality is significant amongst PADD II, especially when now, when you put in St. Paul Park into the grid, that allows us even more connectivity and optionality to really eke out the most benefit for these advantaged barrels. Going forward, Neil, on discounts, we're bullish. We sit and we see high all-time production in Canada. There are constraints leaving the basin. Rail is limited. Rail is doing slightly over 200 today, and it may get into the 3 to mid-3s in 2019. That certainly will not alleviate the constraints. So we're bullish on the differentials going forward, not only on heavy but light and medium, which we're players in all 3. And really, the relief won't happen, Neil, until you get another big pipeline out of the basin, which, by all accounts, might be lying three and that may be end of 2019 at best.","Neil Mehta","Appreciate all that color. The follow-up is just on synergies. It gets come out saying that you expect at least $1 billion, know that you've only had the Andeavor assets for a couple of weeks at this point. But just want to get your sense of your conviction around achievability of that $1 billion as most of us use some level of a discount to $1 billion, where you think there's potential upside. Sure, we'll get a little more flavor here in a couple of weeks, but any early thoughts?","Gary Heminger","Neil, we're going to give you a lot more flavor at the Analyst Day Meeting. And when I hear that people continue to discount this number, I think we're going to really be able to put that to rest at our Analyst Day Meeting because -- and you're right, we now have 31 days under our belt of operating, but we weren't sitting still in the transition period. We're really working hard at what opportunities we could see. I'm going to ask Don. Don has really led the integration team. I'm going to ask Don to give you some -- just some upfront color on what we're seeing. We're already seeing some synergies above and beyond what we had recognized in our due diligence exercise. But I have -- let Don give you some more color.","Donald Templin","Yes, Neil, we are really positive on the realization of those synergies. You talked about the $1 billion and we had a ramp that had us at like $480 million in year 1, ramping up to the $1 billion. I'm very confident about achievability, not only of the $1 billion but also of the ramp. To give you some examples, we talked a little bit about, in my prepared comments, around the Speedway conversion. You think about sort of crude acquisition, we have 10 refineries and more than 1.1 million barrels of processing capacity in the MidContinent, Midwest and all sorts of logistics assets. And as Rick mentioned, we are seeing optimization of those logistics assets that are helping us achieve those synergies at a faster pace than we'd originally contemplated when we gave you the numbers. On the refined products side, we've had opportunities to place cargoes now. If we have a customer, we can actually place cargoes from either the West Coast or the Gulf Coast, which wasn't an option before we were combined. And then on the refining side, we mentioned -- Gary mentioned, a couple of turnarounds. We were able to leverage at both St. Paul Park and Martinez. We were able to leverage having supplementing the turnaround teams with MPC employees as well as some of our key contractors. And so both of those turnarounds are coming in under budget -- or came in under budget and ahead of schedule. So I think those are sort of 4 tangible examples, retail, crude acquisition, refined product supply and what we're doing on the refining side that give us a lot of confidence about our ability to deliver.","Operator","Our next question is from Paul Cheng from Barclays Capital.","Paul Cheng","Two questions. In the integration or any merger, I think oftentimes people overlook the importance on the back office just some support, how that integration. We have seen many cases that they fell because they didn't do a good job on that. So on that basis that maybe -- I know it's early, but perhaps you guys can give us some idea that how that process has been conduct and what kind of pipeline and [indiscernible] opportunity we are seeing from that. And also that, from that standpoint, will you have the system in place so that you can help us from the outside to track and reconcile your synergy benefit back to the financial result?","Timothy Griffith","Yes, Paul, it's Tim. We certainly take the point that getting back up the systems, pulled together and integrated will be an important part, and I think we've recognized that from the outset. There are a couple of systems integration processes that are still underway within the legacy Andeavor business. We'll continue to get those complete, done right, and we will, in very short order, take up the process of evaluating exactly what the plans would be on the systems side to come into full integration. We are not in a position at this time to give you a time line over what that -- over what time period that will take, but it will be a big focus. I think importantly for the synergies themselves, though, this is not a massive component of the achievement. I mean, there's certainly a small segment of the synergies that will be part of the systems integration, but some of the items that Don mentioned are really the lion's share where those synergies are going to be driven.","So it is not a gating item. It is not a critical path on the synergy achievement that we expect to see over time, but we'll clearly stay focused on it as we go in again. The -- with regard to the reporting out, I mean, I think we recognize and expect full well that we are going to be bringing and accounting around the synergies to the market on a regular basis. I mean, we'll -- again, I think we'll share some color at Investor Day and beyond, but we will be building a -- sort of a framework and reporting protocol to share exactly what the progress has been and what the color has been as we go along the way. So this is something that's high in the radar. Whether the systems integrate or not, we'll have the full ability and anticipate reporting out in our progress along the way. So appreciate the question, Paul.","Gary Heminger","So, Paul, let me add on to that. One of the things that we really want investors to understand, and it's what next week having a kind of our top 100 management team men for a full meeting, one of the things you need to recognize in a transaction like this is you need to step back and understand the scale, and you have to have a vision for how big this company has become. And the scale is going to be one of the most important parts, not only to driving synergy but to driving efficiency. And so I really want to -- we're going to strive and we're going to talk about scale a lot with investors. So that's what we're seeing already. And some of the early synergies that we're capturing that we had anticipated is that scale is very, very important. And you get the scale running down the track in the same direction. It could be a very, very positive of that with a lot of momentum behind it. So that's really the point that I want to get across to investors.","Paul Cheng","I totally agree, I mean, that the scale, I think, is going to be phenomenal in your advantage at this point. The second question, if I may, on Speedway. Historically that Marathon, using a one brand strategy, one brand in the retail, one brand in the wholesale or in the [indiscernible] market, and this legacy is multi-brand. And so how exactly that going forward that you guys going to be in the brand strategy? And how fast are you going to move on that?","Gary Heminger","Sure. Well, Paul, as we mentioned, we're already completing the turnaround of the St. Paul, Minnesota and Wisconsin assets from SuperAmerica into Speedway. We expect that to be done by the end of the year. From there, we have crews doing 7 to 8 stores every day. We're able to turn those stores that quick. And that -- when we say turn the store, that's not just putting signs out on the pumps and at the street. That's remerchandising the store and putting your backroom system and the managers, the entire store as well. And from there, we'll get those completed here in December, and then we're going to move to the west and southwest and start probably in the El Paso and Arizona market, starting to rebrand those into Speedway. Now as we go out to Southern California, Northern California, the ARCO brand is a very, very strong brand. We're continuing our analysis. We won't have the crews freed up to be able to go further west until probably mid-'19 to later '19. So we're completing our analysis on what brands we may want to use in that market.","As I said, ARCO is a very strong brand. Speedway has a very strong brand and a very strong convenience store merchandising component. And then in addition, as you said, there is a potpourri of many other brands that have been used historically. It is our intent that we're going to whittle this down to either one or maybe a handful of other brands and locations by the time we complete. And then at the same time, the jobber business that you're familiar with that we have branded Marathon, there are a large number of brands that have been used on the jobber dealer side in Andeavor in the past. We will expect to take the majority of those to the Marathon brand over time. Again, it will take us a little while to finish up the analysis as we meet with some of our suppliers and as we meet with our customers as well to determine which brands, but predominant brand going forward on that side of the business will be Marathon.","Operator","Our next question is from Phil Gresh from JPMorgan.","Philip Gresh","First question, just wanted to follow up one more time on the crude exposures because you mentioned 1 million barrels a day of advantaged crudes. How do you think about the Bakken exposure for the pro forma company at this point? Obviously, the differentials have widened up quite a bit. I'm just wondering how you think about your advantage access there and then just if you have a view of how much of this is temporary for maintenance versus more structural because of pipeline or real capacity constraints.","Gary Heminger","Yes, Phil, it's a good point. And you recall, when we invested in the Dakota Access Pipeline, it gives us that ability to bring Bakken crude down into our PADD II refineries. It gives us the ability to run it now in some of our MidCon refineries. As you know, Greg and his team have taken Bakken to the west of the rail and other methods of transportation. So we have tremendous optionality, to use Rick's term, on being able to move Bakken around our system. But let me ask Rick to get into the details of what he's seeing and talk about the structure of the market.","Rick Hessling","Yes, Phil, I'm really glad you brought this up. A lot of people want to talk Canadian and want to talk Midland. And really, Bakken is kind of the forgotten basin, if you will, and it's extremely important to us. Yesterday, Beaver Lodge, which is an origin point that feeds DAPL, trade at $14 -- at a $14 differential. So unheard of, by all accounts, every report we hear is that basin is flushed with barrels. Really similar to the Canadian story, Phil, it's flushed with barrels, and there's no way out. And there's no immediate relief, Phil, that we can see. Rail can only do so much. And as we head into winter, you're going to have rail constraints, the difficulties of loading rail out. So we kind of see that's the perfect storm we had in our St. Paul Park refinery now. That gives us, as Gary said, more optionality, connectivity. We have the DAPL Pipeline that feeds barrels to us right into Patoka, where we can go throughout our PADD II system, as well as we can also take their barrels to Southern Access Extension or Ozark. So we have multiple ways of getting barrels to multiple plants, and we're very bullish this differential here going forward.","Philip Gresh","And just to clarify, the Bakken is in the 1 million barrels a day of advantaged crudes that you're speaking to.","Rick Hessling","Yes, correct.","Philip Gresh","Okay. Second question would just be -- this might be a difficult one, but to the extent you can talk a little bit to the Andeavor performance in the quarter, realize you may not be able to give hard financials, but it would be helpful to at least understand since we don't have anything publicly available to us.","Gary Heminger","Sure. Greg, would you like to handle that?","Gregory Goff","Yes, I sure will. It's a good question, Phil. I would say, if I look back at the third quarter, the -- as Don stated, we had refinery utilization right around 97%, ran a little bit more than 1.1 million barrels per day, and we had a strong index for the quarter. The index for the quarter was a little bit more than $16.50 a barrel. We didn't have -- the maintenance that Gary alluded to earlier basically started in October. So we ran, from a refining standpoint, very strong in the quarter. We also successfully continued the Los Angeles project, and the cat cracker in Los Angeles that we intended to shut down is now shut down. And we've begun moving feedstocks through some of the pipelines between the 2 parts of the facility. So that project is on target, and the success there is it positions us well for IMO because, as you're aware, it allows us to run another 40,000 barrels a day or so of distillates over gasoline as the market trades distillate higher than gasoline. The marketing business performed volumes were strong, but like the comments on Speedway with the rising crude price environment, the margins were off a little bit versus our plan but overall results across the system, we had strong volumes.","We continue to grow in Mexico when -- we're seeing very good success in Mexico as part of our integrated strategy for the business model. And the logistics business performed extremely well. Kind of touching upon Rick's last comment on the Bakken, we're seeing really strong growth in our crude oil system up in North Dakota. Likewise, the growth and development of the Permian system is continuing to blossom and develop, just like we expected. And with the participation in the Gray Oak Pipeline, it will allow the company to access the crude that we gather from the wellhead and take it into the system however we want to, whether Corpus Christi or other places. And so I would say overall that the business performed very, very well, and it's right on target with very strong financial results.","Gary Heminger","And, Phil, one more thing I'll add to that, and this kind of goes back to the questions on the confidence of being able to capture the synergies. When you look at how well the legacy Andeavor assets performed in the third quarter, how well the MPC assets, even though we had a couple turnarounds, how well we performed in the utilization rates while we had this major transaction going on, I think that illustrates that we can execute on big projects. As we've done in the past with all the big projects we've done over our life over the last 7 years, we execute and we complete big projects on time and usually on or below budget. I think that was represented here in how well both sides performed while we had integration process going on. And that's -- again, it gives us tremendous confidence going forward we'll be able to execute.","Gregory Goff","Yes. And I would just add to that. I know that there have been a few questions on the synergies and how the integration process is going in. I would just offer from my experience of doing this type of stuff that I am extremely confident that what we've identified as opportunities -- because at the end of the day, synergies or ideas and opportunities that people in the organization have come up with and what we identified initially, we've been able to confirm. But it's been very -- it's been interesting and exciting to see the opportunities that happen right out of the starting gate in that. And so from my personal experience and the work that I've been doing, I am extremely confident in what we're doing. And I would reinforce Don's summary of kind of the things that he said, and I just think we're going to have a very robust delivery of synergies over time that will surprise people.","Operator","Our next question is from Roger Read from Wells Fargo.","Roger Read","I guess to keep on with the theme here of crude differentials, crude capture, we've had some other companies on both sides of the border talk about apportionment issues with the pipelines. And I was just curious what you -- or how you think about your deliverability of the Canadian crudes, whether heavy or light, what kind of apportionment issues you may be seeing and whether or not the earlier comments about the advantages around the SPP unit being added helped on that front.","Gary Heminger","Yes, let me ask Rick to take that, Roger.","Rick Hessling","Yes. So, Roger, ultimately, the apportionment that Enbridge has had out of the basin has been pretty consistent, plus or minus 5%. We predicted every month and we usually come in within 1% or 2%. And to be frank, if you look at what the barrels we received in the past with what we receive in current month and what we believe we'll receive going forward, we're very confident with the numbers we've shared to date going forward. So I can't speak to anyone else's view on apportionment, but from our standpoint, it's been relatively consistent and we see it that way going forward.","Roger Read","And along those lines, thinking of the 1 million barrels total, is it fair to say it's probably about around terms 30-70 heavy, light? Or are you closer to -- not exactly but maybe closer to a 50-50 level on that if you go to full flexibility?","Rick Hessling","Yes, it would be closer to 2\/3, 1\/3, but I would caution you that fluctuates month-to-month. It's really all based on refinery runs, are we looking to run more gas, more diesel, and obviously, the differentials. So I would caution you not to get locked in on a specific percentage because that does fluctuate month-to-month significantly.","Donald Templin","Yes, Roger, that 2\/3, 1\/3 -- this is Don, that 2\/3, 1\/3 is really a reference to the Canadian acquisition -- or Canadian crudes that we're acquiring.","Operator","Our next question is from Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Douglas Leggate","I hate to hark on about the differentials, but I'm going to do that as well, sorry. So just on -- obviously, Canadian heavy has been particularly weak here, and you guys are ideally positioned to take advantage of that. I'm just curious if you can offer your prognosis as to how you think it plays out as a huge amount of downtime in PADD II comes back online. But more importantly, Gary, your ability to move crudes around your system has been an anchor of the whole strategy you built at Marathon. I'm just wondering, when you look at the opportunities to do something around logistics and moving crudes specifically in the Andeavor network, do you see any obvious advantages? Because I'd like to say Greg had done a pretty good job on that as well. I'm just curious if you see any significant shifts in that 1 million barrels a day across the -- on a proportional basis across the combined company.","Gary Heminger","Well, Doug, I'll give you a narrative that the answer is yes. I'm not going to -- I can't share with you the individual areas that we have already seen that we can capture some additional value because it's a very competitive market there. I shared some -- a few years ago a different system, and it only took 60 days and that evaporated from a competitive standpoint. So I'm not going to get into the details, but yes, we're seeing in and around the Northern Pipeline systems. And when you step back and look at what it costs to rail, to rail out of Canada or to rail out of the Bakken to PADD I, $15, $16 a barrel, and then you back into our MidCon, PADD II, PADD IV systems today, that gives us a tremendous advantage over the next barrel that's trying to move out of that market. So I would just say we've captured very early some additional synergies, commercial synergies that we had not recognized in our initial due diligence, and I'll just leave it at that, Doug.","Douglas Leggate","I assume we can get into some of that detail in December, Gary, hopefully or not.","Gary Heminger","Okay.","Douglas Leggate","Okay. My follow-up, if I may, is just a pickup on a comment that Greg made relating to gasoline, distillate and the whole IMO situation. And I do really just -- hoping for a high-level perspective from whoever you think is best equipped to answer the question. But it seems to us that one of the big question marks is if diesel really does get the spike everyone is expecting. There's a pretty relatively easy fix in terms of cat feed as a low-cost equivalent bunker fuel. I'm just curious if you can offer your perspective as to how that might cap any diesel premium that could evolve as a result of IMO, and I'm obviously thinking specifically about the European market. I'll leave it there.","Gary Heminger","All right. Let's have Ray Brooks, who runs all refining, touch on that, Doug.","Raymond Brooks","Yes. If I understand your question, it plays into sweet gas oil as well as ULSD. And certainly, from our standpoint, we position ourselves really well across our entire 16-plant system to make a whole lot of ULSD. We also have the ability to bring in additional sour gas oil if needed and make sweet gas oil for our system. So is that really what you're getting at?","Douglas Leggate","A huge range of uncertainty and a wide range of expectations out there. What I'm really trying to understand is if gasoline is as weak as it's been, I'm thinking Brent-based tracked European refineries, this is probably the best thing to happen to them in 20 years. But it seems to us that you could cap that upside by swinging cat feed into the bunker fuel market and essentially improving the supply side of what is expected to be a tight supply dynamic. I'm just wondering if you think we're getting that wrong. Is that something you think about as well? And ultimately, what do you think the endgame would be if that was the case?","Raymond Brooks","At this point, none of our plants would have us essentially slacking our cat crackers and then blending that cat feed. Our models going forward see very good opportunities for running our cat crackers. We have taken the opportunity to change our catalyst mix and our cat crackers to swing more toward petrochemicals, but we don't have any forward look that slacks our cat cracker at this point.","Gary Heminger","Yes. Doug, you -- the equipment you have, the processing facilities you have, you absolutely maximize those to the full extent. You may change a little bit of your feedstock, but the way we are set up, whether it's cat feed, whether it's light crude or whether it's heavy crude, we will absolutely maximize the amount of diesel we can make, no matter what feedstocks are available. We will top those facilities out.","Operator","Our next question is from Manav Gupta from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Manav Gupta","Gary, earlier in the year, you were working very closely with Washington to improve the situation on RINs, and looks like some of what you did, plus other steps, have been a big problem solver. Now a lot of people forget that MPC does have retail, but it's still exposed to RINs and -- so was Andeavor. So can you talk a little bit about how this lower RIN prices will be -- quantify how much a benefit it will be to the combined entity, MPC plus Andeavor?","Gary Heminger","You're right, Manav. And in fact, I will go back to Washington again next week to -- I don't know, to chat about this. But our big push has been to have a refresh, if you will, of the renewable fuel standard. And while that has not happened yet, you really step back and say -- and look at the numbers, RINs have gone from $1.25 back in 2016, 2017, down to $0.78 this week. So we have made a tremendous amount of progress. It has to do with lower refinery -- or small refinery exemptions and the accounting of RINs beyond that. So we have had a tremendous improvement in the cost of the RINs. I'll ask Tim to -- if he can answer your question on what that value is. But as I said, we have made a lot of progress. We're not fully where we think the market needs to go and where the administration needs to go as far as fixing this RFS problem, but we're continuing to work on it diligently. Tim, can you answer the question on the value side?","Timothy Griffith","Sure. Manav, you've probably seen and we've, I think, said this on multiple occasions over the last couple of years that we are not believers that RIN costs are -- drive differential profitability within the refining system. I think we are -- we have a pretty convicted view that as RIN prices arise, it gets reflected in the crack, and on a net basis, the system is no better or worse off than where things are at. So I'm not sure we'd highlighted an incremental benefit to the lower RINs costs. It certainly introduces a lot less noise into the market relative to -- so what the real economic cracks are, but we would not identify any natural economic benefit in total to the system related to the lower prices.","Manav Gupta","A very quick follow-up. You're cracking about 3.5 million to 4 million barrels of capacity coming from Permian to the Gulf Coast. What's your outlook for 2021 for light sweet crude on the Gulf Coast? Would the entire MPC's refining system become an advantage system just like the MidCon as all this Permian crude flows into the Gulf Coast?","Gary Heminger","Well, you've just touched on kind of our thesis, what we think is going to play out over time. As we've said in the past, Manav, we can run 70% light slate or 70% medium sour to heavy slate. With all of the light sweet crude that's being exported out of the market and with the number that Middle East producers wanted to continue to have their market share not erode in the Gulf Coast, we believe the medium sour will become kind of the crude de jure because so much light sweet crude is going to be exported, and competitively, the foreign players are not going to want to have to come and compete with that. So we believe that we are very, very well positioned, whether it's an air of life, which kind of has a gravity to more look like Mars, we believe that is going to be a very strong feedstock for us going into the future. And as I said earlier, we have the ability to run tremendous amount of medium sours, heavies, or we can keep it in the light range. The other thing that's so important that -- let me ask Mike Hennigan to just talk a second about the big pipeline projects coming out of the Permian and our strategy. Greg Goff had done the deal on Gray Oak Pipeline. Now we're looking at the Permian to Gulf Coast Pipeline. We're looking at Swordfish, example for the Eastern Gulf. So we have tremendous opportunities there that I think helps our feedstock supply as well. Mike, you want to talk about that strategy?","Michael Hennigan","Sure, Gary. So, Manav, what we've been doing on the logistics side to support MPC's refining system is what we call the Permian to Gulf Coast Pipeline, which will enable Delaware Basin and Midland Basin crudes be originated out in Wink or Crane or Midland and come down into the Houston, Texas City market as well as other markets. But one of the main drivers is the supply to Galveston Bay refinery. We've also expanded the Ozark Pipeline as well as the Wood River to Patoka Pipeline to get Cushing light material up into that area. And as Gary mentioned as well, we're also looking at what the market needs from an overall standpoint as far as exports. And we've talked to -- and we'll talk a little bit more on the later call on the Swordfish Pipeline, which is existing assets that we think is going to be very competitive and connecting that Eastern Gulf system to refineries into the export markets. So we're very attuned to the point that you made about light sweet growth. We're trying to maximize our ability to get that to markets, whether it be the refining systems at MPC or others and also into the export market.","Operator","Our next question is from Prashant Rao from Citigroup.","Prashant Rao","I guess my first one, I wanted to touch on crude sourcing. And I think you guys have touched upon this already on the call, but waterborne crude, particularly, I think, is sort of the other side of the question when you're talking about getting more domestic heavy discounted barrels than light barrels. And so just wanted to get some color on the current market. We've seen Maya differentials come in, maybe the Gulf Coast. Waterborne heavy barrels have been a little bit more difficult, they were in 3Q. So that's -- part one is sort of to ask about that in the Gulf Coast. But then also pro forma for the company if you look at PADD V as well, what we've heard from some other peers that waterborne heavier barrels were maybe a little bit more challenging compared to domestic versus ANS out there. So I wanted to get your thoughts around that, too, and maybe initiatives around sort of managing crude costs sort of more in the medium term pro forma for company in both of those regions.","Gary Heminger","Rick?","Rick Hessling","Yes, this is Rick. So first off, on the Maya piece, Maya has been extremely expensive. Its formula, as you know, follows basically WTS as well as some other domestic grades. So with everything strengthening, Maya has kind of priced itself out of the market. The good news from our front on Maya is we run very little Maya, and we are able to pivot away from Maya and have great optionality to bring in other heavies. On the market tightening, I would agree with that, that it had tightened for a period of time, but I would tell you at this 10 seconds and looking forward, we're seeing a window where the market is now the avails looks good, the economics behind the avails look good, both on heavy and air of gulf crudes as well as Latin American and crudes really throughout the -- throughout and around the globe. So we believe the pinchpoint of the tightness in the market is kind of clearing, and we believe better days are ahead, certainly, with optionality into the Gulf with all waterborne crudes.","Prashant Rao","Okay. And I guess to follow up, so a little bit more specific to the quarter and thinking it carries forward to the end of the year here. When I look at the variance year-on-year, understanding and appreciating the $230 million from MPLX, that's unfavorable. There's still $190 million or so in that minus $419 million negative variance in the other category. I know that's a mix of things. But just wanted to get a sense of if there's anything -- color you can give on that in the quarter and maybe how we should be thinking about that going forward. Sounds like in general, things are positive and we should see a strong 4Q here given the Canadian heavy barrels' turnaround season is being completed and maybe some better crack realizations. So just wanted to make sure that we're thinking about things right in terms of how we're looking at the cadence Q-on-Q and then maybe into early '19.","Timothy Griffith","Yes, Prashant, it's Tim. The -- that $419 million in other really reflects almost entirely the services being paid to MPLX for the refinery logistics assets and fuels distribution. So that is the lion's share of that delta versus last year. It's probably inappropriate assumption these on a going-forward basis because those are agreements that will be in place for an extended period of time.","Operator","Our next question is from Brad Heffern from RBC Capital Markets.","Bradley Heffern","I'll just skip it to one given we're past the top of the hour here. But I was wondering, Gary, if you could give your thoughts on the E15 year round waiver. And I'm particularly interested in your thoughts from a Speedway standpoint as to whether you see value in having an E15 offering and sort of what your assessment of the long-term demand impact is on gasoline.","Gary Heminger","Okay. I'll just give you a very quick summary. We could talk a long time about this. But probably less than 1% of the stations in America today are offering E15. We have analyzed it in many different ways, and if you look at the -- still the biggest issue is a majority of the vehicles on the road today will not warrant anything greater than E10, unless you have a flex-fueled vehicle. So as we continue to study that, the procedures and implementation processes are not out yet from the EPA on how they would implement this. We question whether or not they really have the authority to grant this E15 waiver year round. Adding incrementally, it's 3 months beyond what's already in the marketplace today. So it's not -- we kind of look at it as being de minimis. However, E85 -- excuse me, E15, the way it's marketed, is at 88 Octane. There will be a number of issues you would have to be able to counter such as misfueling. So we continue to analyze this. We need to see, Brad, what the procedures are that come out from the EPA before we make a final determination. But I think the best thing that has happened throughout all of this, it's kind of been neutral to the overall market, but Brent prices have really continued to decline.","Kristina Kazarian","Sounds great, operator. I think we'll end there. So thank you, everyone, for joining us today, and thank you for your interest in MPC. Should you have additional questions or would like clarification on any of the topics discussed this morning, we will be available to take your calls. Operator, that's it.","Operator","Thank you.

My name is Christine, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Pam Beall, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin.","Pamela K. M.

Good morning, and welcome, everybody, to Marathon Petroleum Corporation's First Quarter 2013 Earnings Webcast and Conference Call. The synchronized slides that accompany this call can be found on our website.","And on the call today, we have Gary Heminger, President and CEO; Garry Peiffer, Executive Vice President of Corporate Planning and Investor and Government Relations; Don Templin, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Mike Palmer, Senior Vice President of Supply, Distribution and Planning; and Rich Bedell, Senior Vice President of Refining.","If you turn to Slide 2, please read the Safe Harbor statement. It is a reminder that we will be making forward-looking statements during the presentation and during the question-and-answer session. Our actual results may differ materially from what we expect today, and factors that could cause actual results to differ are included here, as well as in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","And now, I'll turn the call over to Gary Heminger for some opening remarks.","Gary R. Heminger","Thanks, Pam, and good morning to everyone. Thank you for joining us.","If you'll please turn to Slide 3. Our strong financial results this quarter reflect the strategic expansion and optimization of our refining system, favorable market conditions and increased income from Speedway. Since the completion of our Detroit Heavy Oil Upgrade Project in November of last year, this project has provided our system with greater flexibility to refine larger volumes of price-advantaged crudes, including Canadian heavy.","The refinery quickly reached its design capacity and performed very well during its first quarter of operation. Also contributing to our financial performance this quarter was the acquisition of the Galveston Bay refinery on February 1. Results from the first 2 months of operation have been consistent with our expectations. Located on the Texas Gulf Coast, our Galveston Bay refinery is well positioned to process growing supplies in North American crude oil, with expanding access to price-advantaged feedstocks and an array of complex processing units, we're enthusiastic about the prospects of this facility to enhance margins and further leverage dynamic market trends through this strategic acquisition. We are working hard to integrate this large, very complex refinery and the related assets we acquired into our system, and we are pleased with the enthusiasm and professionalism of the employee team.","Speedway also had a very strong quarter. It posted increased segment income, primarily due to higher fuel margins and additional revenue from the stores that were acquired last year.","We announced today that we have agreed to sell MPLX an additional 5% interest in Pipeline Holdings for $100 million. This transaction, which is expected to close on May 1, will increase MPLX's interest to 56% from the 51% it held since initial public offering in October of 2012. We believe this drop-down, along with expected throughput increases, positions MPLX to support distribution growth in the near term and is consistent with our intent to provide an attractive growth profile over the long term.","MPLX also announced today an increase of $0.01 per unit to its quarterly distribution, raising it to $0.2725 per unit. This is the first drop-down following the IPO. This transaction, along with the increase in its quarterly distribution, demonstrates our commitment to support the growth of MPLX.","We continue to focus on our commitment to balance investments in the business with returning capital to shareholders. During the first quarter, we returned $547 million to the shareholders through share repurchases and the payment of $116 million in dividends. As of the end of the quarter, the total remaining share repurchase authorization was $2.2 billion.","And now I will turn the call over to Don Templin to review our financial results for the first quarter.","Donald C. Templin","Thanks, Gary. Slide 4 provides earnings both on an absolute and per share basis. Our first quarter 2013 earnings of $725 million reflects $129 million increase from the $596 million we earned in the first quarter of 2012. Earnings per diluted share were $2.17 for the first quarter 2013 compared to $1.70 during the same period last year.","I should note that, as a result of our share repurchases, the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding during the 2013 first quarter was 333 million compared to 350 million in the first quarter 2012. As of March 31, 2013, 327 million common shares were outstanding.","The waterfall chart on Slide 5 shows, by segment, the change in earnings from the first quarter of 2012 to the first quarter of 2013. The primary driver for the change in our earnings was the increase in Refining & Marketing income, partially offset by additional income tax expense. The improvement in Refining & Marketing segment income was primarily the result of a higher refined product production and sales volumes attributable, in large part, to the acquisition of the Galveston Bay refinery on February 1, 2013. The increase in income tax expense is primarily a function of higher earnings during the first quarter of 2013.","As shown on Slide 6, Refining & Marketing segment income from operations was just over $1.1 billion in the first quarter of 2013 compared with $943 million in the first quarter of 2012. The primary drivers of this increase were the contributions from 2 months of operating the Galveston Bay refinery and the first full quarter of upgraded operations at Detroit, partially offset by increased operating expenses or costs.","Utilizing market indicators and actual refinery throughputs, we estimate that the Galveston Bay refinery contributed approximately $150 million of EBITDA for the 2 months we operated the facility during the quarter. This income impact is reflected in the changes in market indicators on this slide, and the incremental costs make up a majority of the direct operating cost variance. In addition to Galveston Bay's success, we estimate the first full quarter of operating the Detroit refinery, following the upgrade project, contributed approximately $100 million of incremental EBITDA to our quarterly results.","On Slide 7, Speedway's income from operations was $67 million in the first quarter of 2013 compared with $50 million in the first quarter of 2012. Light product and merchandise gross margin combined were about $25 million higher than the first quarter of 2013 compared with the first quarter of 2012. Light product margins increased by $20 million as margins averaged $0.1301 per gallon compared to $0.1096 in the first quarter of 2012. The light product margin increase also reflected the impacts of a higher number of stores in the first quarter of 2013 as compared to the same quarter in 2012.","Merchandise margin was $184 million in the first quarter 2013 compared with $179 million in the same period last year. This $5 million merchandise margin increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of stores compared to the same period last year. The $8 million increase in expenses also reflects the increase in the number of stores compared to the same quarter of last year.","On a same-store basis, gasoline sales volumes increased 0.7%, and merchandise sales, excluding cigarettes, increased 0.8% in the first quarter 2013 compared with the 2012 first quarter. Speedway's average retail gasoline price was $3.47 per gallon during the first quarter of 2013, compared with $3.48 per gallon for the comparable quarter last year.","Slide 8 shows changes in our transportation -- Pipeline Transportation segment income. Income from operations was $51 million in the first quarter of 2013 compared with $42 million in the first quarter of 2012. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in transportation tariffs and earnings from pipeline affiliates. Offsetting these increases are higher costs associated with mechanical integrity and depreciation expenses. Some of the increase in the transportation tariffs was related to the formation of MPLX.","The chart on Slide 9 presents the more significant drivers of changes in our cash flow for the first quarter of 2013. At March 31, 2013, our cash balance was just over $4.7 billion. Operating cash flow, before changes in working capital, was a little over $1 billion source of cash. The working capital benefit of $1 billion noted on the slide, primarily relates to an increase in payables that were partially offset by an increase in receivables, both due, in large part, to the acquisition of the Galveston Bay refinery and related assets. Payables also increased due to higher crude oil prices at the end of the first quarter of 2013 compared to year end.","Excluding the Galveston Bay purchase price, capital expenditures and acquisitions were $197 million during the first quarter. On February 1, we also made a payment of approximately $1.5 billion to the seller for the Galveston Bay refinery and related assets. This amount included the purchase price as well as the acquired inventory. As shown on this slide is a $431 million use of cash for the first quarter of share repurchases that Gary mentioned earlier.","Slide 10 shows that at the end of the first quarter, we had just over $4.7 billion of cash and approximately $3.4 billion of debt. With EBITDA of nearly $6.6 billion during the last 12 months, we continue to be in a very manageable debt position with leverage of 0.5x EBITDA and a debt-to-total capital ratio of 22%. This strong liquidity position enables us to support our core liquidity and continue to focus on capital return to shareholders.","Turning to Slide 11. During the last 12 months, we generated $6.2 billion in cash from operations and nearly $3.3 billion of free cash flow. Over the last 12 months, we've returned 42% of our free cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. During the quarter, we purchased approximately 5.1 million shares for $431 million through open market repurchases. When combined, the dividend payment and share repurchases accounted for 140% of our free cash flow for the first quarter of 2013. We remain committed to balancing investments in the business with returning capital to shareholders.","Slide 12 provides outlook information on key operating metrics for MPC for the second quarter of 2013. For comparative purposes, those same metrics for the second quarter 2012 are also shown. The April market data document will be published tomorrow on our investor website. I might add, with respect to our outlook information, we received some calls today about our tax rate, and we would -- I would suggest using a tax rate of 35% for modeling purposes going forward.","Our mission continues to be value creation for our shareholders. We are committed to pursuing opportunities to create near- and long-term value. We will be balanced in our approach to capital allocation as we continue to assess the opportunities in front of us.","Now I will turn the call back to Pam Beall.","Pamela K. M. Beall","Thanks, Don. [Operator Instructions] And with that, we are now going to open the call, Christine, to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Ed Westlake of Credit Suisse.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just on Galveston, could you give us an idea of the crude cost in the quarter, perhaps relative to LLS? I understand, I think, you're still running the old slate and just wondering, in terms of progress of switching out imports for domestic crudes, and general comments there.","C. Michael Palmer","This is Mike Palmer. Ed, I'm not sure that we can give you the number, the difference between the crude slate and WTI or LLS. But I can tell you that, if you look at the first quarter, we closed on this transaction in February and, of course, the February supply was arranged by the previous owner during the month of January. So we've really been involved in formulating the crude slates just during March in that quarter. When you look at this plant, overall, and if you looked in the appendix, at the MPC Crude Slate, you can see that we -- at this plant, we don't run, at least in the first quarter, quite as much WTI-based crude as we did in the 6-plant system. And of course, that'll be dictated by the marketplace over time. The other thing is that's important in this plant is that we do continue to see value in some foreign sweet cargo crudes, which is related to the aromatics business at the plant. So again, we're working to optimize the crude slate everyday and the market will dictate the crudes that we purchase.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","But in terms of being able to capture a discount to crude, is there any sort of sense of how many thousand barrels a day you could process at Galveston to take advantage of domestic discounts?","C. Michael Palmer","Ed, what I would say is that, if you look at the -- where this plant is located and its access to domestically produced crudes, what we're starting to see is that pipelines are getting built into the Houston area. And I'm sure you're aware that the Longhorn pipeline has just recently begun. Permian Express will begin shortly. We're going to continue to have a buildout of pipelines that are going to feed this refinery. So as domestic crude continues to grow, we expect that we're going to see that crude being run by this plant. We think it's very well positioned for that going forward.","Operator","Our next question is from Evan Calio of Morgan Stanley.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","My question, my first question -- yet, I'm just trying to understand the sizing and the overall drop-down strategy. What you sold, 5% in Pipeline Holdings for $100 million, but you're still in net cash position, MPLX debt-free, $500 million of credit. I know you got assets in the quarter with the Texas City acquisition. So, I mean, can you just kind of talk me through the strategy on the sizing of the first drop? And I have a different question, please.","Garry L. Peiffer","Sure, this is Garry Peiffer. I think we've been consistent, both when we did the roadshow before the IPO and since the IPO, that we're looking at this MPLX as a long-term, very transparent, consistent growth type of vehicle here, and we plan to grow this business both through tariff increases, organic projects that add value and acquisitions. And when we look at the fact that our goal and it's our strategy to have annual distribution growth in the top quartile of a high-growth, drop-down peers, this is the amount of distribution, or, excuse me, drop, that we felt we needed to lease from a first-drop standpoint, put into the new entity, only 6 months after we went through an IPO as well. I think dependent upon everybody's outlook, well, I think a lot people might have expected us to do the drop a little bit later than 6 months, but we felt the timing was good to get the first drop done at this point, which gives us more earnings power from that drop earlier on in the life of MPLX. So it's really our goal to achieve this top quartile annual distribution growth that -- not dictated, drove us to this type of drop.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","That could -- certainly have the assets at the parent level. Let me ask you a different question yet related. I believe you guys are investing in condensate splinters associated around your Ohio asset in Canton and Catlettsburg, to process and provide advantage condensate as it grows from Utica. Can you provide any details on kind of costs and potential volumes and when you potentially could see those units on stream and also whether you think those are suitable, potentially, for MLP? I'll leave it at that.","Gary R. Heminger","Well, the last part of your question, yes, they're suitable, they qualify for an MLP. So that's the easy part of the answer, but I think what our goal is here, is to -- today, we've said that, at our Canton and Catlettsburg refinery, we believe without any additional investment, we can run roughly 20,000 to 30,000 barrels a day in total of condensate at those 2 facilities. As the amount of condensate grows there, we want to be in a position to make sure that we can handle more than that amount of volume, which we expect to come online maybe in a year or 2. But we are not in the exploration business, we are just in the refining business. So we're positioning ourselves with these condensate splinters, which we announced, that when completed, we could go from about 20,000 to 30,000 barrels a day to about 60,000 barrels a day of total condensate throughput. We've kind of pegged end of 2015, 2016 type of timeframe for these new units to come online. That's going to really be driven by how quickly the condensate production ramps up there. So we're doing the engineering. But we haven't finalized exactly when we're going to come online with those new units. But again, we'll be in a position, that once we exceed that 30,000 barrels a day or so, that we will have -- be in a position to have the condensate splinters there, to be able to process the higher volumes.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Great. Any estimate on cost as well? And I'll leave it at that.","Garry L. Peiffer","I think, we've said previously that when you look at all of the investments we're making in the Utica, we're investing in some barges, as you know, we announced that we're -- signed a letter of intent to convert our Wellsville terminal into a barge-loading facility for crude and condensate. So the whole complement of investments in that area is about $300 million over the next few years is what we're looking at. So we haven't split that out into particular assets, but roughly $300 million over the next 2 to 3 years.","Operator","Our next question is from Doug Leggate of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I'm not sure who wants to take this one, but it was being -- before it came onstream, I guess, you've given some indication as to how you expected the contribution to look. I think you mentioned the numbers on your prepared remarks. So I'm just wondering if you can kind of characterize how the project's actually behaving, relative to expectations and any differences in your view going forward. And I have a follow up please.","Gary R. Heminger","Doug, this is Gary. Yes, we had given some earlier indications of $200 million to $350 million, and we believe after our first quarter of operations that we are right in that sweet spot, and the plant performed very, very well, as we stated in our remarks in the first quarter. So I'd say we're right on target.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. Great. Is there any debottlenecking potential down the road, Gary? Or is it pretty much running at capacity now?","Gary R. Heminger","Well, let me -- may I ask Rich Bedell to talk about the next step after -- we brought it up, as we said, and quickly got it up to its designed capacity, and now they are -- they will work on the next steps. Rich?","Richard D. Bedell","Yes, that's right, Gary, I mean, Doug, as you know, we've got it up and it's running very well at that design. And as we go forward, we're looking at debottlenecking opportunities, as we find -- as we gather more information, do more engineering. So I'm sure with -- as with any of the expansions, there's going to be some debottlenecking in the future.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. Gary, my follow up is really -- you've been quite vocal about your views on differentials. And obviously, there's been a lot of moving parts this past quarter. So I'm just curious if you could bring us up-to-date with how you're seeing -- or your view of the world as in terms of the sustainability of the end line versus international -- the discounts, and then perhaps a comment on the heavy outlook as well? I'll leave it at that.","Gary R. Heminger","All right. Thanks, Doug, and you're right. We have talked about that a number of times, but let me ask Mike Palmer, who runs all of our daily supply operation to give you his view. Mike?","C. Michael Palmer","Okay, yes. Thanks, Gary. Obviously, you've watched the transatlantic arb, the difference between Brent and WTI, that's come in since early February from a level around 2,200 or 2,300, to around 10 today. A lot of that, I think, that we believe was caused by the weakness in Europe in a very, very heavy turnaround season. And if you look at the WTI side of the equation, the inventories at Cushing really have not come down. They're still around 51 million barrels. But again, I talked earlier, I mentioned a couple of pipelines from the Permian that will direct Permian crude into Houston. So we do think that we're going to see the Cushing inventory start to come down this year. So I guess what we would say is that, with this big move that's taken place down to just a little bit below $10 on the spread, I don't think we'd be at all surprised if that spread would start to move out a little bit again. I don't think, personally, that it's going to reach the kind of levels that we saw before in the $20 level. But to have that arb trade between $10 and $15 would certainly not be a surprise.","Operator","Our next question is from Paul Sankey of Deutsche Bank.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just as a direct follow up, you did a nice job there on WTI-Brent. Can you talk a bit about heavy versus lighter crude spreads? And also, for you guys particularly, the sweet\/sour ratios, that would be interesting, too.","C. Michael Palmer","Yes, this is Mike Palmer. I guess, probably the most important one to talk about would probably just be the Canadian crude. And if you watch the heavy Canadian closely, you would have seen kind of an unusual pattern that occurred this year. We did have the spreads that started to come in, basically in May, to around $15 on Western Canadian Select. And now -- and that really was related to a number of production problems that were occurring in Canada. Many of those have been resolved. Production is now increasing, and you watch the spread that it started to move apart again to more, what I guess I would call, seasonal levels. I guess when we look at what's happening in Canada, we're still very optimistic. Exxon is bringing on their Kearl project. We believe that, that crude will start to flow into the marketplace in July. I think that'll be a very important source of heavy crude oil for the market. And in addition to that, if you look at some of the other production for the rest of the year, we think it's very likely that we're going to see Canadian heavy production increase another 250,000 barrels a day by the end of 2013, in addition to the Kearl. So we continue to be very optimistic about the heavy Canadian supply.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Great. And then sours?","C. Michael Palmer","I'm sorry.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Sour crude. That's obviously a very important differential that we look out for you guys, the sweet\/sour spread.","C. Michael Palmer","And you're thinking in terms of what? LLS March?","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just in the context of what Doug asked, which is where we've been, where we are today and where we're going to, from here.","C. Michael Palmer","I think, again, when you look at the very big picture, certainly, one of the things that is going to continue to happen is that, in the U.S. is we're going to continue to see this light sweet crude continue to grow. So I guess I would expect that as we move forward, you're going to continue to see probably the most attractive differentials being in terms of these light sweet crudes, the Bakken, the Eagle Ford, the Utica, that sort of crude going forward. But having said that, I think that, at the same time, we see very good production growth in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. So we would expect to see the Gulf of Mexico being attractive as well.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes, I guess, the anomalous one would be the premium of LLS that we're seeing. I assume that you're not expecting that to continue as the pipes are developed on the Gulf.","C. Michael Palmer","No. We're not, and I think that, actually, if you look at it today, we can reconcile Brent -- LLS being $2 to $3 over Brent today. On the Gulf Coast, there's probably $1 difference in the quality, the value of the 2 crudes. And in addition to that, it cost a couple of dollars to bring a barrel of Brent into the U.S. Gulf Coast. So with LLS $2 to $3 over Brent, I think that a U.S. Gulf Coast refiner today would probably be indifferent, on average. Everybody's a little different. But as we move forward and we continue to see the growth in the U.S. domestic shale plays, we would very much expect that LLS will trade at a discount to Brent.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Great. If I could throw in one key question, which would be, Gary, can you just talk a little bit more about Galveston Bay? There's an earn out there, I think, but can you also talk about how you feel about the costs and how you can change performance there, given that you're now 2 months in? And I'll leave it there, I promise.","Gary R. Heminger","Well, thanks, Paul. I was hoping you're going to ask a question about Chicago dips instead of Galveston Bay, but I'll leave that for another time. Paul, we're very pleased with Galveston Bay, on the front end. We only have 2 months of operations that were just reported. The processing kit, we're very pleased with, we had a turnaround right after we took over the asset, which was planned. And we came out of that turnaround in very good shape, but we have a lot of work to do. And I will say that the employee base that -- in the acquisition, is very energized and very pleased to be working with Marathon. And I think that is -- since we have a very strong base, our employee base and interest in the plant, I think that is probably the most important thing. Now as we go forward, to go in and get some of the units turnaround over the next couple of years, our plans are such that, that'll happen. But you look at the financial performance, $150 million of EBITDA in the first 2 months. We're very pleased with that. And we have a very, very strong team that we put in place to operate this plant, and I think we will perform well there.","Operator","Our next question is from Chi Chow of Macquarie Capital.","Chi Chow - Macquarie Research","Great. Just further on Galveston Bay. Mike, you talked a little bit about crude slate optimization activities going forward, but can you give us some guidance on what to expect on yields between gasoline, distillate and pet chems?","Garry L. Peiffer","Chi, this is Garry Peiffer. I think, in the past we pretty much said and, for the time being, it's probably reasonable that it's roughly 1\/3 gasoline, 1\/3 distillate and 1\/3 petrochemicals, at the moment. So intermediates, I mean, the intermediates, so we're going to continue to optimize that and, again, we've only been operating it here for a few months so we're trying to see where the sweet spot is for yield and the crude slate. So that's kind of where we're at the moment, and it is a bit less, in terms of gasoline yield than our other facilities would be, but that's just the market and the processes that they have in place there at the Galveston Bay refinery.","Chi Chow - Macquarie Research","Okay. On the pet chem side, what sort of products are you producing at the plant? Are they mostly aromatics? Or there's...","Richard D. Bedell","Yes, Chi. This is Rich Bedell. Yes, we have a large aromatics production, as well as propylene. And so that's primarily at this benzene, toluene, xylene and propylene.","Chi Chow - Macquarie Research","Okay. I guess, Gary, you talked a little bit or mentioned Chicago, I kind of want to ask you about near term here. There's been certainly a lot of flooding activity in the whole Midwest region, can you talk about any impact to your refineries or your other assets due to the flooding? And maybe comment on the margin strength there, we're seeing.","Gary R. Heminger","Well, fortunately, Chi, we've not had any flooding or any problems with our refineries. Robinson, Detroit, Catlettsburg are running full out. We have a little bit of a maintenance going on at Canton, but it's still running well. But the -- what you look at, with the problems of the river system, being able to get product down the river, due to the flooding, I think are -- were possibly some turnarounds from some of our competitors in the Midwest. And thus, led to very high crack spreads. They've been in the high teens to low $20 on the Chicago side here for the last couple of weeks. So we expect, and you look at the pipelines, certainly, the market is looking to replenish the inventory, when you look at Explorer and some of the other pipelines that are full coming north. But we've been very fortunate. We haven't had any problems in our plants.","Chi Chow - Macquarie Research","Good. So it sounds like you're capturing a lot of the upside?","Gary R. Heminger","Yes, sir.","Operator","Our next question is from Blake Fernandez of Howard Weil.","Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","I was hoping you could maybe give us an update on the export market? Obviously, we see natural gas prices moving up a bit. Differentials have come in, at least, at the beginning of 2Q, and I think rumblings of Venezuela ramping back up. I was just curious if you could give us a feel for how that arb spread looks.","C. Michael Palmer","Blake, this is Mike Palmer. If you -- again, if you looked at the numbers, you'd see that in the first quarter, we did export about 121,000 barrels a day of diesel and about 9,000 barrels a day gasoline. And in the fourth quarter, we were just -- we were a little higher than that. We were about 151,000 barrels a day of diesel. The market will dictate to us kind of everyday how much we actually export. We are always looking at the tradeoff between selling export barrels and selling bulk into the pipelines. So we're looking at economics every day. I think that, in the first quarter, there were a number of factors that tended to cause a bit of a weakness in the export market. Certainly, there was Europe. Europe was fairly weak. We had more competition in the U.S. Gulf Coast with Motiva coming on. And with a weak harbor, New York Harbor, I think that there was competition from the New York Harbor that was a little unusual as well. And there may have even been some volatility from the uncertainty surrounding RINs. So it was a little weaker in the first quarter. We continue to expect that exports are going to be a very important part of our business, and we're very positive about exports going forward.","Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. Great. The second question, you mentioned RINs, and I don't mean to get into the regulatory front too much, but I am curious on the earn out that you have on Texas City. Can you help me understand, is any potential RINs increase, is that part of the margin calculation that dictates your payout or does that come in after the fact?","Gary R. Heminger","No, Blake. It's based on a gross margin calculation, and you look at the ASCI index, and Garry Peiffer, I think, has the details here.","Garry L. Peiffer","Yes, this is Garry Peiffer. It's just based upon the spot market values for the refined products. So whatever the spot market values are for the refined products, that's what goes into calculation. Now to the extent that RINs affects the spot market values, there will be an impact. But the actual calculations, just based on spot market values, for the ASCI index, as well as for the refined products.","Gary R. Heminger","And also, Blake, you need to look at the output, as Gary had mentioned earlier, about 1\/3 of the output is on the petrochemical side, and that does not carry a RIN with it. It's not in the calculations. It's just a 3, 2, 1.","Gary R. Heminger","Right.","Operator","Our next question is from Doug Terreson of ISI.","Douglas Terreson - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","My question's also on Galveston Bay, but it's a little bit more broad. I think a few minutes ago, you mentioned the opportunity related to advantaged crude oil, and it just sounds like you guys are just scratching the surface in that area. But there were other categories, too, that were opportunities on this transaction. Meaning product logistics and synergies with other Marathon refineries, market integration and some more. And so, I realize it's early, but I just wanted to see if you could provide any insight or color on the opportunities that may materialize related to that plant, thus far.","Gary R. Heminger","Sure, Doug. And our strategy, when we purchased this plant, is that we were not going to purchase just a merchant refinery. We picked up 1,200 branded locations, approximately 1,200 branded locations, 4 terminals and Colonial line space. We have been able to utilize some of our Colonial line space. So far, 3 other intrastate pipelines we picked up. So all these things encompass opportunities and synergies. As Mike mentioned earlier, the month of February, the crude has already been purchased and we needed that to have a smooth transition. But as we go forward, certainly, we're looking at synergies, not only with our current Texas City plant, but other plants, and because we have the distribution assets that we can move feedstocks into the Midwest if we need to, or we can move things from our Texas City refinery over to this plant and vice versa. The other thing that we're looking at, that we think are going to give us some opportunities -- and we're a very big supplier into the State of Florida and, heretofore, we had supplied a lot of that out of Garyville. Well now, we can move bigger ships into Florida and be -- and pick up synergies from just the efficiency and the way, as Mike Palmer was just talking about, exporting into the South America, Latin America markets vis-a-vis Europe, and how we -- the parallels we have out of Garyville versus Galveston Bay. We have some good logistics that we can pick up there. So all of those things are in the works right now. Again, we've only been operating for a few months, but we certainly have all those things in our plans and how I think we can pick up some further efficiencies on the way we loads ships.","Operator","Our next question is from Paul Cheng of Barclays.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I have to apologize. I joined late. So some of the questions that you may already answer. Gary, have you guys provided any financial information in terms of the BP Texas City for 2 months? What kind of financial contribution there may have been?","Donald C. Templin","Yes, Paul. This is Don Templin. We indicated on the call that the incremental -- estimated incremental EBITDA from Galveston Bay for the 2 months was $150 million.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","After tax or before tax, Don?","Donald C. Templin","EBITDA.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","EBITDA, okay. Don, do have some balance sheet data, what is the market value in excess of book for your inventory?","Donald C. Templin","$6.1 billion.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","$6.1 billion. And Don, the working capital for the quarter is a positive $1 billion. Is it related primarily to the timing of the tax payment or there is something else?","Donald C. Templin","No. It's a combination of a number of things, Paul. But broadly, our payables are up $2.5 billion, and that payable increase is a combination of 3 things: a price increase, crude oil prices were higher at the end of the year -- at the end of March than they were at the end of the year; and then a volume increase because of Galveston Bay; and then there's also a volume increase because, in December, we were heading into a turnaround period and now, we're heading out of a turnaround period. So payables were up about $2.5 billion. Receivables were up $900 million, primarily related to Galveston Bay. And then net inventories, after the inventories that we acquired, we acquired about $900 million worth of inventories as part of the Galveston Bay acquisition, but net inventories were up about $500 million and that was largely related to price changes.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, very good. And Gary, just curious that with Hess putting up their retail and wholesale terminal business up for sale, strategically speaking, does it fit into your system or that is the -- they really is primary in the Northeast and that doesn't really fit to you guys?","Gary R. Heminger","Well, Paul, if you look at their terminals, they're not only in the Northeast, they're also in the Southeast. So they're across the entire Eastern Seaboard. And their retail really encompasses the Eastern Seaboard as well. The only place we would have -- we don't have any direct control of retail in the Southeast markets today. We have a large branded presence. So I would say if there's any overlap, certainly, it would be a step out and we're -- I complement Hess, I think they have very looking good-looking assets.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And on -- I think, earlier, that you probably may have already mentioned, on BP Texas City with their crude purchase agreement that is going to be over soon and you start to utilizing your own trading department and all of that, what kind of potential benefit that we may be seeing? I mean, will you be able to quantify the amount?","Gary R. Heminger","Well, Paul, that agreement was only for one month. It was just in transition. They purchased for the month that we were taking over. So there was no agreement beyond that, and we're going to be very careful not to get into the types of crudes and stuff that we're going to buy for competitive reasons. But we are -- Mike and his team are deep into optimizing this plant as we speak.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And for the month of May, is it still their old purchase agreement or that is based on your new agreement already?","Gary R. Heminger","No. It's our own, and we started our -- Mike, we started our own in March?","Garry L. Peiffer","It would have been March, Gary.","Gary R. Heminger","March. So we've done March, April already has been our own crude purchases.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. A final question for me. I think there's a debate in the industry, at least in the investment community, that butane and naptha may be increasingly become so abundant that pricing will be very attractive. So the question is that, can you bring more of those products into your gasoline pool? Or that you're already maxed out? And if the price really become very attractive, what needs to be done in order for you to be able to bring more and that how much more, what is the maximum you can do?","Richard D. Bedell","This is Rich Bedell, Paul. On butane, you're really limited by the gasoline specs on vapor pressure, and we already blend up to the max there. On naptha, it's just going to be a play between intermediate price or running crude and generate your own naptha. So we'll just take a look at that, how it happens.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","But, I mean, can you actually blend more of the naptha than what you currently already existing in the gasoline pool, I guess that's the question. That's stretching between what you buy from the crude and generate your own naptha or that you purchase. I'm talking about on an absolute level, can you blend even more than what you already did, to date?","Richard D. Bedell","Theoretically, yes, you can do that. You can -- you have to adjust your octane, you have to adjust the -- re-optimize your plants and that may not be the optimal solution, but we look at those economics all the time and decide how we want to blend it and what's optimal.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","But there's no -- so that means that just probably need capital investment in order for you to do substantially more?","Garry L. Peiffer","I wouldn't say investment, Paul. I would say it's optimizing. If it's the optimal way to blend today, we would be doing that. So what Rich is saying is, we have some room. It's just, everyday, we will run our optimization models to determine what is the best.","Operator","Our next question is from Jeff Dietert of Simmons.","Jeffrey A. Dietert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","TransCanada recently announced that Keystone XL, the Northern Atlantic, has been delayed into the second half of 2015, and I was hoping I could get some commentary from you on how you think that impacts potential logistics? Does it make rail more attractive? Would you consider rail at Garyville and Galveston Bay? And how does that impact your plans on the pipeline side as well?","C. Michael Palmer","Jeff, this is Mike Palmer. Yes, the delay doesn't come as a big surprise to us. We were expecting that it would be delayed from what they had earlier said. But the other thing is that you have to also factor in, the Enbridge Gulf Coast Access pipeline that should be complete in 2014. So I mean, as you know, we're already -- there's already the Seaway line that was reversed, from Cushing down to the Gulf, and that line is -- the plans are to twin that line, and then Enbridge is going to build another large diameter line that's basically going to twin Spearhead. So it's not as if there won't be an outlet for significant additional volumes of Canadian crude into the U.S. system. So -- and I think that when that happens, it will have an impact, certainly, on the incremental supply, it will give the incremental supply out of Canada another home. There could be some additional railing that occurs as well, but that's very expensive, and I don't see that as a long-term solution for Canadian heavy crude.","Jeffrey A. Dietert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","And just quickly, with the Permian pipes coming in and the Seaway volumes that are already there, are you seeing a price differential from Houston versus St. James for similar quality crudes? And how much might that be?","C. Michael Palmer","Well, the Longhorn pipe just began and the Permian Express has yet to come on, so it's not as if we have a lot of pipeline capacity that's come in yet. But we will always expect that there will be some differential between Houston and St. James, because the crude is being produced in the West and the transportation cost into Houston is going to be less than it is into St. James. And that's going to be several -- $2 to $3, depending upon how you move it.","Operator","Our next question is from Faisel Khan of Citigroup.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I just want to get a clarification on Slide 2. The percentage of WTI-priced crude at 22% for the second quarter, does that also include WCS?","Donald C. Templin","It does not.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, what would that number be for the quarter?","Donald C. Templin","We don't give that number.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then just one last question on the -- you guys talked about the chemicals product yield out of the Galveston Bay facility, but can you give a little bit more detail on that, between aromatics and olefins, because they're widely different sort of products and product margins, so that would help us understand a little bit the profitability of the refinery.","Garry L. Peiffer","This is Garry Peiffer. We really haven't broken it down to that level of detail, and it's really change within valuation, U.S. pricing, so, at this point, we just don't break it down to that level of detail.","Operator","Our next question is from Robert Kessler of Tudor, Pickering, Holt.","Robert A. Kessler - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","A question about your Utica investment plans there and the incremental condensate splitting you've got planned. Having done the engineering now, presumably you've profiled the yield structure out of a typical barrel of Utica condensate. Can you give some indication as to what the product mix looks like, as you've engineered it?","Gary R. Heminger","Okay, Robert. We are in the -- when we say we've engineered, the conceptual engineering is complete. We are just in now to the front-end engineering and we do not have the yield structures and optimizations complete at this time yet. So it'll be awhile until we have that finished.","Robert A. Kessler - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Can you provide a rough indication on what you're seeing for total Utica volumes right now? And maybe some kind of split between crude and condensate?","Gary R. Heminger","Mike can handle this for you.","C. Michael Palmer","Yes. I can give you a little information. Obviously, the Utica production has come on more slowly than was anticipated. I think we've talked before about our volumes being in the 2,000 to 3,000 barrel a day range. That's still the case today, and it's somewhat volatile. But I think the important point with the Utica is that there have been a lot of wells drilled. I think the latest numbers that I have is there have been over 600 permits issued, there have been just slightly over 300 wells drilled and you've only got 89 of those that are producing. So you've got 70% of the wells that have been drilled and are waiting to get hooked up to gas processing and that, really, is the bottleneck right now. You've got companies out there that are spending billions of dollars on this infrastructure, and we fully expect to see our Utica condensate volumes ramp up significantly this year and then significantly, again, in 2014. So it still looks very optimistic to us.","Robert A. Kessler - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Last one for me. Can you provide the average throughput for the quarter with the 2 months that you owned Galveston Bay?","Donald C. Templin","No. We can't. We do not give out individual refinery information.","Robert A. Kessler - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division",".","You did say that you went in and turned around just after purchase. Can you give some indication of how many days and what portion of the refinery was down for that turnaround?","Gary R. Heminger","Yes. Rich can handle that here.","Richard D. Bedell","Yes. There was a section of the residual hydrocracker unit, so that was just that portion of it and some catalyst change and so some hydrotreaters.","Operator","Our next question is from Roger Read of Wells Fargo.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I guess to keep on with the Galveston Bay parade here, at the time you acquired this unit, you indicated, I believe, $700 million to about $1.2 billion in annual EBITDA. Obviously, good start with the first 2 months in the first quarter. I was wondering with the crude changes with, I would say, overall, the ability to probably run it a little more efficiently than the previous owner, are we thinking the top end of that range now for 2013? And can we think of it as better in '14, again, as you pursue the turnarounds and improve efficiencies?","Garry L. Peiffer","This is Garry Peiffer. When we gave that previous guidance, we were anticipating some of those things occurring in that guidance. So we're still in that same band of EBITDA, and the first 2 months, as suggested, kind of puts us right in the middle of those numbers. So I think we still feel comfortable, that range of the guidance that we gave previously.","Donald C. Templin","And Roger, this is Don Templin. I mean, in that range, the price that was used was -- that the top end of the range was at $15 or so, for the ASCI 3, 2, 1 and the bottom end of the range was $11, and we're right in the middle of that. So I mean, I think, from a modeling perspective, that's how you would think about it.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And that actually kind of helps me lead into the next question which is, we look at the -- there are a lot talk about the kind of light-light spreads here. But if we look at the light-heavy spreads, we've seen those tighten up quite considerably, kind of from the end of last year into beginning of the second quarter. Can you maybe help us understand a little bit how you can move around? Which heavies you're able to use? Maybe how much flexibility you have, in just a broad sense along the Gulf Coast, to kind of counteract that contracted spread?","C. Michael Palmer","Yes, Roger. This is Mike Palmer. As these spreads move around, Roger, I can tell you that we have almost complete flexibility. We're very closely watching spreads, for example, between Mars, Poseidon, Southern Green Canyon, the medium sours, as opposed to LLS or Eagle Ford, or one of the other light grades, light sweet grades on the Gulf, and these volumes are basically all spot. So from month-to-month, we -- and not only month to month but from day-to-day, we will back out sour and bring in sweet, if that's what the economics say to do or vice versa. So we have tremendous flexibility.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, but, I mean, fair to say that as the spreads have closed, overall, that's going to impact, I mean, obviously, pick a better crude on a given day. But I mean, all in all, we have seen a contraction as we kick off Q2 here. I was just wondering what kind of impact that could have on sort of a broader Gulf Coast refining margin.","Gary R. Heminger","Roger, why don't we get back to you and we'll be able to answer that question in more detail. Pam will call you back to review that, okay?","Operator","Our next question is a follow up from Ed Westlake of Credit Suisse.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I thought this would have been asked already, but just on the RINs. Maybe -- I don't want to get your blood pressure up by the end of the call, but what are you doing to reduce exposure and any thoughts about things like using biodiesel to meet ethanol RINs, et cetera, just to limit the potential upside to those costs next year?","C. Michael Palmer","Ed, this is Mike Palmer. Obviously, this has been on our minds and not just in the current market, but we've been looking at this for, obviously, the last several years. And we've made investments within our system to be able to blend as much, not only ethanol as possible, but also the biodiesel. So we're in relatively good shape. Obviously, we still have a purchase requirement for RINs. But we've got a very good team that's looking at various ways that we can produce RINs outside of the norm, and that could be in a number of different ways. So just rest assured that we have a number of things that we're looking at doing that could reduce our RIN exposure and too early to talk about anything specifically, but we're going to continue to look at that.","Donald C. Templin","This is Don Templin. We did, for the first quarter, we were -- we paid about or we expensed about $15 million, or purchased about $15 million of RIN a month. And last year the comparable number was about $10 million a month.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes, I guess sort of March was probably much higher than the average in the first quarter. I don't know if you have that number.","Donald C. Templin","We don't give it by month. I'm sorry, Ed.","Garry L. Peiffer","This is Garry Peiffer, again. On that sweet\/sour differential, we've given the sensitivities in the past but now with the more capacity or the bigger capacity with Galveston Bay, every dollar change in that sweet\/sour differential that we included in our market metrics, that we put on our website, equates about $225 million of after-tax financial effect. So every dollar has that type of sensitivity to our bottom line. $225 million annually per dollar change after tax.","Operator","And our next question is a follow up from Paul Sankey of Deutsche Bank.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes, I just thought of the RINs thing, I just wondered how you expect 2014 to play out? Because obviously it looks like it's going to be a major shortage, that gets even worse in 2015.","Gary R. Heminger","Well, Paul, I will say it and it'd be very hard to forecast other than if you look at the total math and reaching the blend wall here in 2013 and not having available the cellulosic option and advance cellulosic is in question, certainly we've had -- the industry had several conversations with the EPA and members of the administration to really talk through how to combat this issue. So I would just say, stay tuned. The administration focused on Washington, D.C. are very cognizant of this problem, the blend wall came at them much faster than they were expecting. So we are working this issue hard within the industry, and we will continue to do so.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","But my understanding, Gary, is the EPA is pointing to the legislators, and the legislators don't really care because the gasoline price is low.","Gary R. Heminger","Well, there are 2 ways that you can handle this. The first is that the EPA does have a waiver opportunity within their jurisdiction on a year-by-year basis. So that's something that they certainly could employ if there is a shortage of RINs. And secondly, you have the legislative piece. Legislative, obviously, would take longer than the waiver option. But we're working both sides very hard, Paul.","Operator","We have no further questions. I will now turn the call back over to Pam Beall.","Pamela K. M.

My name is Hilda and I will be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the call over to Geri Ewing, Director of Investor Relations. Ms. Ewing, you may begin.","Geri Ewing","Thank you, Hilda. Welcome to Marathon Petroleum Corporation's third quarter 2015 earnings webcast and conference call. The synchronized slides that accompany this call can be found on our website at marathonpetroleum.com under the investor center tab. On the call today are Gary Heminger, President and CEO; Tim Griffith, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and other members of MPC's management team.","We invite you to read the Safe Harbor statement on slide 2. It's a reminder that we will be making forward-looking statements during the call and during the question-and-answer session. Actual results may differ materially from what we expect today. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included there as well as in our filings with the SEC.","Now I'll turn the call over to Gary Heminger for opening remarks and highlights. Gary?","Gary Heminger","Thank you, Geri. Good morning and thank you for joining us. We're pleased to report third quarter consolidated earnings of $948 million. Our results were driven by a solid performance across all of our businesses. We were able to capture strong crack spreads in a favorable refining environment and we took advantage of our flexibility to move feed stocks and refined products throughout our system to optimize profitability where original dislocations occurred. Lower fuel prices facilitate a strong refine product demand, further contributing to our results.","Speedway also performed very well during the quarter, benefiting from higher light product margins. Our peer-leading merchandise model also continues to drive profitability, with higher earnings compared to the third quarter of last year. On September 30, we celebrated the one-year anniversary of our East Coast retail acquisition and we're very pleased with the results of the transaction so far. The new locations are performing well and the business is on track to more than double the $75 million in synergies we expected in this first year.","We're significantly ahead of schedule in converting the acquired stores, with nearly 1,000 of the 1245 new locations converted to the Speedway brand and operating system. In addition to the convergence, over 240 remodels of these new stores have been completed or are in progress. This rapid progress on conversions and focus on remodeling selected locations will further enhance Speedway's ability to grow merchandise margins across this entire platform.","Turning to the midstream business, we look forward to finalizing a combination of MPLX and MarkWest later this year and are very enthusiastic about the prospects of the combined partnership. The MPLX and MarkWest combination will create one of the industry's largest diversified master limited partnerships. We will combine MarkWest's robust organic growth opportunities with MPC's large and growing inventory of MLP-qualifying EBITDA.","The growth of distributable cash flows to the combined partnership will also be supported by MPC's and MPLX's strong financial position, creating a large-cap diversified MLP with an attractive distribution growth profile over an extended period of time. The strategic combination will drive substantial long-term value for the unit holders of both partnerships as well as MPC shareholders.","At the time MPLX announced a combination with MarkWest, the partnership provided distribution growth guidance through 2019. MPLX remains committed to the growth profile provided in that guidance. Given the significant change in MLP valuations and the resultant higher-yield environment the sector has experienced in the last several months, we now expect drop-down transactions or some other form of MPC support as early as 2016. As MPLX's sponsor, we're committed to support its success.","As we work to maximize our shareholders' long-term returns, we continue to focus on a disciplined and balanced approach to investing in the business and returning capital to our investors. An important element of this focus has been to identify market opportunities and pursue transactions that accrue long-term benefits to shareholders, as we have done with our acquisitions of the Galveston Bay refinery and the East Coast retail operations. I'm confident we will extend our track record with the pending MarkWest combination. We look forward to MarkWest becoming part of MPLX to the benefit of all equity owners associated with the merger.","Another important element of the Company's capital discipline is to monitor changes in the market to ensure investments reflect the best long-term, risk-adjusted returns to shareholders. In February of this year, we announced deferral of the final investment decision on the proposed residual oil upgrader expansion project at our Garyville refinery in order to evaluate the implications of market conditions on the project.","While we still believe the ROUX project, as we call it, is an excellent project to enhance MPC's platform, at this time we have decided to cancel the project based on our assessment of market conditions. And we wrote off the $144 million in capitalized project costs incurred to date. We will look to deploy this $2.2 billion in capital on a variety of other projects to provide superior long-term return prospects.","We were also pleased to return $327 million of capital to shareholders during the quarter. We purchased 156 million of our shares -- $156 million of our shares and have approximately $3 billion remaining under our total of $10 billion of share repurchase authorizations.","We also paid dividends of $171 million. Our Board approved a $0.32-per-share dividend which was increased 28% last quarter, resulting in a 31.5% compound annual growth rate on our quarterly dividend since we spun in 2011. We continue our efforts to remain a leader in our industry through all cycles by focusing on operational excellence and continuous optimization of our refining and marketing system.","We will continue to grow our stable cash flows through our retail and midstream businesses, taking a disciplined approach to capital allocation and delivering significant value to our shareholders through our sponsorship of and our general partner interest in MPLX. Due to the timing of MarkWest's special meeting for the proposed combination with MPLX, we're moving our analyst day meeting back one day to December 3.","At that time, we plan to provide an update on our allocation of capital, including margin-enhancing opportunities identified at our Galveston Bay refinery, Speedway's growth in synergies from the stores acquired in September of 2014, the compelling combination with MarkWest and other midstream areas of focus. We look forward to seeing you at our combined MPC and MPLX analyst day on December 3.","With that, let me turn the call over to Tim to walk you through the financial results for the third quarter. Tim?","Tim Griffith","Thanks, Gary. Slide 4 provides earnings on both an absolute and per-share basis. As Gary mentioned, our financial performance was strong once again in the third quarter, with earnings of $948 million or $1.76 per diluted share, during the third quarter of 2015, compared to $672 million or $1.18 per diluted share, in the third quarter of last year.","Just note, third quarter 2015 earnings reflects the $144 million impairment charge or about $0.17 per diluted share, for the cancellation of the ROUX project that Gary just mentioned. You can see the earnings through third quarter are already about $140 million ahead of the entire year last year. The chart on slide 5 shows by segment the change in earnings from the third quarter of last year. The $276 million net increase in earnings was primarily due to higher income from our refining and marketing and Speedway segments which I'll discuss further in just a minute. ","Partially offsetting these higher earnings is $144 million non-cash impairment charge for ROUX which is included in the items not allocated in the chart, as well as higher taxes resulting from higher taxable income in the quarter.","Turning to slide 6, refining and marketing segment income from operations was about $1.5 billion in the third quarter, compared with $971 million in the same quarter last year. The $486 million increase was primarily due to stronger crack spreads in our markets and the favorable effects of Contango in the crude oil market in the third quarter of 2015.","You may recall the crack spreads we provide in our market metrics on our website are calculated using prop product and crude prices. The price we pay for crude, on the other hand, is established 30 to 45 days prior to the prop month. This price difference is reflected in the $226 million favorable Contango reflected as market structure on the walk. Partially offsetting these increases was less favorable crude acquisition costs relative to our market indicators and lower dollar base refinery volumetric gains resulting from overall lower commodity prices, both of which are included in the $325 million other gross margins column on the chart.","On slide 7, we provide the Speedway segment earnings bridge for the third quarter. Speedway's income from operations more than doubled from the same quarter last year. Speedway's newly acquired locations were an important part of that increase, contributing additional income of approximately $66 million to the quarter's results or approximately $98 million of EBITDA in the third quarter.","For the legacy Speedway locations, light product gross margin was about $48 million higher in the third quarter 2015 compared to the same quarter last year. This increase was primarily due to higher light product demand and a favorable pricing environment during the quarter. Overall, the Speedway segment gasoline and distillate gross margin increased by $0.055 per gallon from the third quarter of 2014 to the third quarter this year.","Speedway's merchandise margin in the legacy locations was $16 million higher in the third quarter compared to the third quarter last year, primarily driven by an increase in merchandise and food sales and improved margins. On a same-store basis, gasoline sales volumes increased 0.5% and merchandise sales, excluding cigarettes, increased 3.6% in the third quarter compared to the same quarter last year. As you compare our same-store gasoline sales to industry averages, I would point out that these can vary due to many factors including regional footprint, weather and competition. Speedway continuously strives to optimize total gasoline contributions between volume and margin to ensure fuel margins remain adequate.","As you might expect, total light product sales were almost doubled in the third quarter last year as a result of the Hess acquisition and we're pleased to highlight that gasoline volumes for the legacy Speedway locations were up 2.4% in the third quarter on an absolute basis versus the same quarter last year. Given that we're now one year into the acquisition, October will be the first month our new East Coast locations will be included in our year-over-year same-store metrics. So far for October, total Company gas -- same-store gasoline's volumes are up 1.8% versus October last year.","Slide 8 shows the changes in our pipeline transportation segment versus the third quarter last year. Income from operations was up slightly from the same quarter last year with $72 million of income in this quarter. The increase was primarily due to higher transportation revenue in the quarter, reflecting higher average tariff rates and higher crude and light product throughput volumes, partially offset by increased operating expenses and about $4 million in transaction-related costs incurred as part of the MarkWest combination.","Slide 9 presents the significant elements of our changes in our cash position for the quarter. We had about $2 billion of cash on hand at the end of the quarter. Or, operating cash flow was a $1.5 billion source of cash. The $389 million use of working capital noted on the slide primarily relates to a decrease in accounts payable partially offset by a decrease on accounts receivable. The decrease in accounts payable and receivable were primarily due to lower crude oil and refined product prices during the quarter which created the use of cash given the generally longer terms on the crude purchases.","We continued delivering on our commitment to balance investments in the business with return of capital to shareholders. We returned $327 million to shareholders during the quarter, including $156 million in share repurchases. Share repurchases were slightly lower this quarter as we plan our liquidity needs over the next several months, including the $675 million contribution for the MarkWest combination and, based on current prices, the approximately $180 million to MPLX to maintain our 2% general partner interest after the combination is completed. Share count at the end of the quarter was 534 million shares, reflecting repurchase activity since the spin of about 27% of the shares outstanding at that time.","Turning to slide 10, in the third quarter we paid a $0.32-per-share dividend, representing a 28% increase over the $0.25-per-share dividend paid during the second quarter. It was the fifth increase in our dividend and our dividend has seen a 31.5% compound annual growth rate since MPC became a standalone public Company in mid-2011. Our continued focus on growing regular quarterly dividends demonstrates our ongoing commitment to our shareholders to share in the success of the business. And as Gary highlighted, we're pleased to affirm that commitment with the $0.32-per-share dividend declared yesterday.","Slide 11 shows that our balance sheet continues to be strong and our leverage low, with gross debt at less than one times the $7.2 billion of LTM EBITDA and a debt-to-total-capital ratio of 34%. Slide 12 provides an updated outlook information on key operating metrics for MPC for the fourth quarter of 2015. We're expecting fourth quarter throughput volumes of 1.8 million barrels per day which are down slightly compared to the fourth quarter of 2014 due to more planned maintenance this year. As the fourth quarter begins and we come out of the summer driving season, we expect to see normal seasonal demand levels which are typically lower in the fourth quarter. Our projected fourth quarter corporate and other unallocated items are $130 million, including an estimated $58 million of pension settlement expense in the quarter.","With that, let me turn the call back over to Geri. Geri?","Geri Ewing","Thanks, Tim. As we open the call for questions, we ask that you limit yourself to one question plus a follow-up. You may re-prompt for additional questions as time permits. With that, we will now open the calls to questions. Hilda?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. We have a question from Edward Westlake from Credit Suisse.","Edward Westlake","Appreciate obviously most of your questions this morning are probably going to be on MarkWest. The -- some form of support -- obviously a drop-down would help, but talk me through what other forms of support you have. And then I have a more general question on MarkWest.","Gary Heminger","So, Ed, as you know, as we have talked on this call before, we have many forms of support. Let me back up really and talk about this transaction and the overall market. I still continue to be surprised at how the overall market has performed, especially how MPLX has performed.","In a higher yield environment, of course, we need to talk about possibly support earlier than we had initially planned than later. But I think the industrial logic is still so strong with the combination of these two companies, MarkWest having just an outstanding suite of assets and growth opportunities and MPLX having a tremendous backlog and a growing backlog of EBITDA that is eligible for drop-downs as we go down the road. Of course, we have tremendous flexibility. I'm not going to tie us down to just one.","But we can incubate projects and that's our plan going forward and we have been very specific about that plan going forward. And when I step back and look at the overall environment in this MLP world today and look at how strong MPLX is and you compare us against other MLPs that were just a drop-down story before, we still compare very, very favorably, if not one of the best in industry and now we're tying it to a very strong growth profile.","And so I step back and look at it at, Ed -- I really don't look at it as whether it's a gathering of processing, whether it's a natural gas MLP, whether it's a refined products MLP, a retail MLP. It's what is your backlog and what's the quality of the EBITDA that you have. And I believe that we have, again, one of the best-quality inventories of EBITDA that can go into this sector going forward. And as I said, we looked at incubating projects. We take the backlog of projects that MarkWest has, we can incubate those projects inside MPC, drop them in at the right time.","We can do many other things. Look at the multiples on how we drop down assets, other commercial arrangements where we do intercompany loans, IDR givebacks, the list goes on and on of the flexibility. But on the front side, we now -- based on the yield environment of MLPs and I do expect that our yield will improve substantially as the market gets more comfortable that this combination is going forward.","Edward Westlake","And then on the yield comfort, obviously there's a big move in the spreads of the overall index. But the upstream in the Northeast is under stress because gas prices are low and NGL prices are low. And when you look at MarkWest, although they have a lot of capacity and acreage dedication, the MPCs, the volume protection is relatively low on some of the new areas. So just give us some color as to how much diligence you've done on the ability of the MarkWest EBITDA to deliver against your expectations. And then if it does fall short, what would be the plan to support the overall combined EBITDA to the extent that volumes in the Northeast disappoint?","Gary Heminger","Right. And we did do, obviously, a tremendous amount of due diligence before we ever signed this agreement. But step back, Ed and look at the Marcellus and the Utica. And you look at -- you all and everyone on this call is very familiar with some of the major producers in these regions and the success that they continue to have in the Marcellus and the Utica at this time. The areas of -- and just some of the wells that have been made public recently are very large wells in the acreage positions that we have.","I will let Frank talk about his current environment more when he has his earnings call next week. So I'm not going to go overstep my bounds here with his current business, but we did a lot of work on the due diligence. We believe the break-even cost in the Marcellus and Utica which is the predominant area of influence of MarkWest, continue to be some of the best basins in the country. And if there is a slowdown, as we've already indicated, we will consider dropping down earlier. ","And we've talked about this $1.6 billion of project backlog or EBITDA backlog we have inside MPC and that continues to grow as we go forward. The key, though, that we're very interested in and the logic behind this deal on a combination is we have the balance sheet and the financial strength to really take the backlog of projects within MarkWest and bring them to the table. And I think that will overshadow any drop-off in -- from the producer side.","Operator","We have a question from Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs.","Neil Mehta","Gary, I wanted to give you the floor a little bit on the oil macro which you are always great about reflecting on. I wanted you to talk through your views on Brent LOS and some of these key crude spreads in a potentially lower production environment. And also views on the flat price as we get into the OPEC meeting in December.","Gary Heminger","Wow, I don't know that I have enough time to talk about that, Neil. But anyway, let me -- I believe the last time we were together, the market continues to illustrate that we're going to be lower for longer. I believe especially as you see the trade flows and you look at the crude resources that are coming from the Middle East, West Africa that is moving into the East Coast today.","But specifically those crudes -- and we're finding some other supply sources, mainly Iraqi crudes -- I can have Michael Palmer, who's with me today, address this more -- but Iraqi crudes that are coming into the Gulf. And I think what this is going to illustrate for a longer period of time, you're going to see the influence of imports on top of continued domestic production.","While domestic production has somewhat flattened out, especially in the Permian and the Eagle Ford, we're continuing to see -- and we see this through our ownership in LOOP, we're continuing to see good growth in offshore Gulf of Mexico production.","So for the remainder of the year and into next year, we're still looking probably in the $50 to $55 range. You might get up into the higher 50s mid-to-later next year. I think we're going to be probably range-bound in that arena for most of 2016 and probably into 2017 until you start to see -- because you're going to have to see not only some domestic production, but you're going to have to see a balancing of this incremental Iraqi production coming on.","And you also have to watch where Russia is taking some of their production and how they have been taking some of their production out of strategic petroleum reserve into other parts of the world and the effect that has on the Asian markets. So I would keep all those things in mind when you look at those, Neil. Bringing it back, then, to spreads here domestically, I think with the incremental production, as I just mentioned, coming in from the Gulf Coast, I think that bodes well for the supply side.","We're coming down off the high-demand quarter here in the U.S. as far as refining capacity and the crude that is needed to satisfy the refining capacity in the U.S.. And I think here as we get into the latter part of the fourth quarter -- first quarter, you're going to see spreads widen out -- Brent, Tuck-in and I will let Mike Palmer, who is the expert on the spread market, add anything to it.","Mike Palmer","Gary, I couldn't have said it better myself. The one thing I guess I would add is just, again, in the third quarter, we did run a little more sour crude than we did in the quarter before or the third quarter last year. And I think one of the things that we're seeing, of course, is that the Gulf of Mexico production continues to increase. And then in addition to that, we have seen -- as Gary pointed out, we have seen some foreign cargo opportunities into the Gulf Coast that we've taken advantage of and others have as well.","And I think that's likely to continue, as, again, Gary pointed out the Iraqi crude is being produced. There is certainly the possibility that we will have some Iranian crude that we will be trading in the world -- increased volumes next year. And I think that will continue to have some pressure against sour grades that should look attractive.","On the other hand, the sweet crude, as we have talked about before, on the Gulf has been a little more expensive. There is not a surplus in this light-sweet crude waiting to find a home. The producers have many avenues to clear it. So, again, that to me points toward probably a little more sour crude that we will run.","Neil Mehta","The second question is more of a housekeeping question. The buyback was a touch lower than we were expecting in maybe the previous quarter as well. Was that related to MarkWest and some of the processes going on there? Anything you can speak to in terms of the quarterly buyback.","Tim Griffith","Again, there has been no sort of philosophical change around the way that we've approached capital return to shareholders. I think in any given quarter we're going to plan carefully in the liquidity. We obviously have a contribution that MPC will make to the MarkWest transaction that we certainly are thinking around. But if you look at cash balances, things are generally in line with where we're at. So, no change to behavior, no change to belief. I think just circumstances in the quarter were suggestive of a little bit lower activity.","Operator","We have a question from Chi Chow from Tudor, Pickering, Holt.","Chi Chow","I guess just on MarkWest, there has been a lot of speculation on the acquisition price given the decline in both MPLX and MarkWest unit prices. How comfortable are you with transaction as it is currently structured? And are there any actions you are considering to support the closing of the deal?","Gary Heminger","Well, Chi, I believe this deal is still very, very compelling. We've already -- I think the biggest and most positive action, we announced today when we reaffirmed guidance. But you just step back and look at the strength of MPC's balance sheet, MPLX's balance sheet, the financial position we're in -- it bodes very well to take this combination which I think sets us up on a pedestal as the best combination in the business going forward. And we feel it's a compelling enterprise. We have a number of options that I already talked about. And we believe, in effect -- we think today, tomorrow, we will go effective with a proxy and it will be sent out shortly.","Chi Chow","Okay. I guess the timing of closings here -- by moving the analyst day back one day, is that corresponding to when you expect to be able to be closed?","Gary Heminger","Right. And that's what -- maybe not necessarily closed, Chi; it just depends on the timing. But Thanksgiving and another bank holiday or I guess it's Veterans Day, that is coming up, we lose two business days. So, unfortunately, that's just the way the timing worked; it moved us back just the day to be able to have the analyst meeting. So, yes, that's as we would expect to have the vote in the first, second of December time frame.","Chi Chow","And I have a couple questions following up on Neil's questions on the crude markets. Can you talk about what you have seen on the heavy crude markets both -- what's going on in Canada with the new Detroit coker? Are the spreads for WCI still attractive? How do you see that market playing out? We've got pipeline access now all the way to Houston. You've got upgraders -- I guess [indiscernible] can cut on upgraders. How do you see the heavy Canadian market and then, conversely, the heavy market in the Gulf Coast as well? Any views on how supply demand will look going forward here?","Mike Palmer","Yes, Chi, I'll give you some thoughts on that. The heavy Canadian market continues to be very attractive. We've seen differentials to TI that have been gyrating around that minus $15 mark. By historical standards, that's a pretty good discount in a $45, $50 environment. And, again, this market is influenced by many things that take place. We saw a great opportunity on the heavy Canadian this summer during some turnarounds that were taking place. The spreads went a little wider and we really took advantage of that. We brought quite a bit more Canadian into our system and we were able to move record amounts down to Garyville.","So, going forward, again, I don't see any reason to believe that that's going to change. We think that the differential will stay in that kind of a range and we will continue to take every advantage we can. We're continuously looking at foreign cargo opportunities that we can bring to the Gulf Coast. We see opportunities coming in from Brazil with some of their heavy sweet crudes. We oftentimes find very good values in crudes that are more difficult to run. They are either high TAM or they've got some other issue. The Mexican crude has been relatively attractive as well.","So the heavy market looks pretty good right now and I don't see any reason why that should change.","Chi Chow","Does the agreement with Pemex on the crude swap -- does that open things up a bit more or any impact there?","Mike Palmer","No, I don't think so. As you know, I think what's been approved is 75,000 barrels a day. It's really a relatively small amount. I really don't see that changing the market for us at all.","Operator","We have a question from Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley.","Evan Calio","Maybe just a follow-up there, I presume you will use a proxy solicitor that will inform you how the vote is going through that solicitation period and utilize that data to determine or consider your options as it relates to the offer. Is that fair?","Gary Heminger","Yes, sir. That's correct.","Evan Calio","And then if the transaction were voted down which I know is in your base case or ours -- but I presume into that scenario, you just revert back to your prior drop-down strategy given your significant potential at the parent and you source growth internally. Is that your thoughts?","Gary Heminger","Well, you're right in your first statement. That certainly is in our base case. We're very confident that this creates a -- just a stellar position in the marketplace, one with a strong financial position, a tremendous growth profile. But if for some reason it did not go through, you're absolutely right, we would revert to MPLX 101.","Evan Calio","I think it will be a great transaction for MPC and MPC shareholders. Different question, can you discuss pipeline committed volumes in your two Bakken pipelines? And how do you think about the risk to MPC or your exposure in an environment where Bakken is in decline? And I know pipeline should have -- should be superior to rail in that environment, but what are your thoughts here, maybe any actual exposure?","Mike Palmer","Yes, I will answer that, Evan. So let me first mention that our Southern Access Extension Pipeline, SAX, a joint venture with Enbridge, it's a completed project. We're going to be filling line fills and tank bottoms in early December and then by January, we will be fully operational and online.","We're already purchasing crude for that pipe. We fully expect that we're going to be at planned rates. It will be a combination of not only the North Dakota crude, but it will have a variety of various Canadian crudes. We're really excited about having this SAX pipeline open. It creates some flexibility and some optionality that we were out of and I think we're going to see some real strong earnings coming from crude that will be coming down that pipeline to our Patoka hub.","With regard to Sandpiper, I guess I would say that probably -- exactly what you said earlier, we think that North Dakota crude is going to continue to be very attractive for those that have pipeline space. We're the best option in the market. We also think that as we continue to have fairly narrow Brent TI spreads, what you are really going to see is that the East Coast players that have been railing so much North Dakota light, we really do believe that those volumes are going to decrease.","And as the commitments kind of run out -- they will be canceled and probably won't be re-upped. So we think that's going to create -- it's going to take some of the pressure off North Dakota light maybe that you see today. So we think Sandpiper is going to be another great vehicle for us. It will create flexibility and optionality in a market that we're sure will increase production down the road.","Gary Heminger","And Evan, the other thing about those two pipelines -- and Mike was speaking to the tremendous advantage to MPC -- is that gives a great cash flow EBITDA stream then back to MPLX down the road.","Evan Calio","All right, exactly. Maybe if I could one more, Gary and thanks for the macro views on the oil side. But in the past, you've also shared your macro views on the other side of the equation demand. Any comments on demand as you see it either through retail, export -- what's your thought there given that's an increasing concern in the market? I will leave it there.","Gary Heminger","As Tim mentioned in his script today, we're very pleased here -- October year to date, we're up 1.8% in Speedway on the gasoline side. And you will recall when we spoke last year about this same time, we were looking for an increase in gasoline demand. However, we were in the shoulder quarter and it really didn't kick off until early into the second quarter. I think the consumer really had some confidence that this gasoline price was here to stay.","And gasoline demand has been very robust over the second, third quarter and now starting into the fourth quarter. On top of that, you look at exports for both gasoline demand and distillates demand and we, too, set a new record here in this quarter for our refined product exports with 333,000 barrels per day. So -- and we will continue to ramp up our gasoline exports as we've completed a couple of gasoline tanks, both in Garyville and continuing to improve in Galveston Bay, with our logistics to be able to move out the gasoline.","So we think that going into 2016 here -- and as I mentioned earlier on the macro side of crude, I think that stands to benefit the consumer very well and you will continue to see good gasoline incremental demand.","Turning to the distillate side, global distillates have been a bit flat. And I would say it's because -- if you look at over-the-road diesel here in the U.S., it still -- and we have pretty good optics through all of the travel centers and commercial fueling locations that Tony has done at Speedway. So we have a pretty good feel of overall gas or distillate demand and our distillate export demand continues to be strong.","I think what you're seeing is that, across the globe and how some of the regions in the globe have changed, some of the exports and the globe in which they are hitting have slowed down a little bit. Our distillate demand exports continue to be very strong. But it appears on a macro basis, some parts of the globe, distillate demand has slowed a little bit.","Operator","We have a question from Doug Terreson from Evercore ISI.","Doug Terreson","So Gary, I just wanted to see if you could clarify the last point that you made about distillate demand. I think you highlighted that there were a couple of regions that had been a little bit spotty recently. Could you provide a little bit more color on which ones those might be?","Gary Heminger","Well, it appears as though there's been a slowdown in Asia and all of us have seen that. And then, obviously Brazil has had some bit of a somewhat of a slowdown. Europe continues to be robust. The Latin American countries for the most part continue to be strong. And you are seeing more of an incremental gasoline pickup in the Latin American countries than other parts of the world. So the markets in which we serve continue to be very strong. But I was answering that question, Doug, on a global basis -- and the new refineries that have come on in Saudi Arabia, some in China and I think that is just the material balance. The way it's moving around the world is where you are seeing some softness.","Doug Terreson","Okay, I just wanted to be sure. And then also, Gary, a few minutes ago you talked about Speedway and how that business is well ahead of expectations as it relates to synergies you thought you would have when the acquisition was consummated. So my question is between the major sources of synergy which at the time were light product supply and logistics and marketing enhancements and then SG&A. Which ones are driving the positive surprise versus the original expectations? And the second question is how are light product breakevens trending as well and are they similarly surpassing your expectations at the outset of the transaction?","Tony Kenney","The synergies in all the categories are ahead of pace in each one of those that you mentioned, the light product supply; the marketing enhancements; and the operating and G&A costs. What I plan to do, Doug, at analyst day is to provide more detail and more color in each of those areas. So, going back to Gary's comments -- opening comments, we're 2 times ahead of where we thought we would be in 2015 on synergies and I will provide more detail on that at analyst day.","Gary Heminger","And a light product breakeven, Tony?","Tony Kenney","Yes and with respect to light product breakeven, we're about a penny ahead of where we thought we would be when we originally put our forecast together. So, again, that's a combination of the business just performing well but also the enhanced synergies that we're realizing as well.","Operator","We have a question from Paul Cheng from Barclays.","Paul Cheng","A number of quick questions, hopefully. Gary, just curious, fourth quarter the turnaround seems unreasonably heavy for you guys. Are those primarily in the crude unit or conversion? And also that 2016 -- the turnaround cycle, are they going to be somewhat similar to 2015 or higher or lower?","Rich Bedell","The turnarounds in the third quarter, what we've had is Robinson has been primarily around a hydrocracker and its revamp. In Catlettsburg and the Robinson one is finished. In Catlettsburg, we do have a crude unit now. We're doing a revamp to that one to recover more gas oil. So that has impacted the crude runs at Catlettsburg. We also had a shutdown planned at Detroit to do some coker cleanout and catalyst changes there and that one is wrapping up right now. So those were the major turnaround activities here in the third quarter for us.","Paul Cheng","How about which 2016 is the turnaround cycle going to be comparable to? 2015? Or that we should assume it's going to be higher or lower?","Rich Bedell","Paul, you know, our policy is we don't talk about turnarounds into the future.","Paul Cheng","Okay. And maybe this is for Gary. There's a lot of movement in the MLP sector in terms of valuation have dropped quite a lot over the last six months. And then we have also started seeing the lower production. So, some of the MLP operators start to voice concern, the industry may have seen, at least short-term or medium-term, over-investment in the lot logistic outset. Do you share the same view and whether that -- in any shape or form, that may have changed your view on that market? Or how you are going to -- going forward in terms of your organic investment?","Gary Heminger","No. In fact, Paul, I'm glad you brought that question forward. We believe that is the most important part of our platform of this strategic combination is that we're running -- all of our midstream assets are running very well. We do not see stranded investment. And as a number of peers and members of the industry within the MLP community are starting to talk about lowering their guidance and reducing their investment, lowering their guidance going forward, we just reaffirmed again this morning, I believe this is now the third time since we announced this transaction that we have reaffirmed our guidance and where we believe to go or where we're going to go with this with our midstream.","And it's based on the fundamentals of our business. We have such a backlog and projects within MarkWest. We have a backlog with some projects within MPC. And a lot of the barrels that are going to move through some of these projects are barrels that we already control. So, as I said, many are backing up on their growth. And from Ed Westlake's first question this morning is why I wanted to speak to that. Is we have a very, very strong case and I believe we deserve to be -- our yield deserves to be much lower and priced with the high drop-down, high-value MLPs in the business. And let me ask Don Templin to make a few comments as well.","Don Templin","Yes, Paul, I think one of the things that is really intriguing to us and excites us is that, particularly in Utica and Marcellus, there is clearly more production that exists now than there is a reasonable take-away capacity. And so you're finding the producer customers are very constrained in terms of their ability to get their product to a market where they can get an appropriate realization.","And so we look at that as being a real strategic opportunity for us to be able to meet the need of the producer customers. So those are projects that are ripe for investment, where there's already production and we believe there will be -- in continuing production, but there's already production and a need for take-away capacity. So our ability to take on projects that allow producer customers to move their NGLs to a market where they get a higher netback is a high priority for us and a real opportunity.","Gary Heminger","And Paul, we're one of the few MLPs that have the financial strength to be able to get this done. Those projects, the back-up that's in the Utica, the Marcellus, they don't get done unless you have a strong balance sheet. And you can incubate these projects over time. That's where the strategic logic is.","Paul Cheng","And Gary and Don, I think I have two final questions. One on the Galveston Bay -- I think that previously you guys have been talking about the opportunity now that you sort of like the Galveston Bay version two. You already fixed a house and now that is looking for the opportunity to grab the low-hanging fruit or other opportunity set. Is that any -- maybe the update you can provide in terms of quantifying roughly what is that opportunity set may look like for the next two or three years?","And secondly, that when you did the write-down this morning indicate that some related to the long lead-time equipment. Is there any alternative use of those equipment or that you are totally -- the reason that you have a write-down is that you are not taking delivery at all? And also that from that standpoint, is there any change in your future FID pull sets so that you will not have this type of situation in other words that the timing of when you are supposed to order the long lead-time equipment?","Gary Heminger","No, that's a fair question, Paul. I will take the latter question on the ROUX first and then I will come back to GVR. On the ROUX, we continue to look to see if there's -- if we have use of some of this long lead equipment. It's specifically designed and it's called long lead because it takes three or four years to be able to fabricate some of this. So, for the most part, what we did is we stopped the fabrication early in the stages. Therefore, it would not have -- for the most part, it's not in a finished state. So it would have very little lead.","The majority of that $144 million was the preliminary engineering. Of course, all of that has value down the road as markets turn around. And we'll reevaluate -- I said in my talk earlier, this still is a very strong project and makes a good strategic process platform inside of our system. But the markets have certainly turn south. And if the spreads aren't going to be there, it doesn't make sense to go forward.","As far as our FID process, our FID process worked very well here in that we didn't force something to go through and we minimized all of the fabrication expense. We have not done any work in the field as far as any construction or any earth-moving whatsoever in order to be able to start this project. Our FID process and the steps that we go through to make that final decision worked very well. But as always, Paul, we try to certainly back-end load any type of equipment, any long lead time until we have clearly a final decision. When we made that decision two years ago, this was a 25% recurring project and the market certainly has turned the other direction.","And then your first question about Galveston Bay, you stole our thunder a little bit. That will be the centerpiece of what we will talk about on analyst day. We're going to talk about Galveston Bay, we will talk about our midstream business because it's going to be a combination analyst day meeting with MPLX. We will spend a lot of time on midstream and then obviously spend a lot of time, Tony already mentioned -- Speedway. So we will be giving a lot of those, as you say, low-hanging fruit, how we will harvest. And the type of projects we're looking at Galveston Bay will have quick returns and quick returns of EBITDA and they won't be long-lead projects of capital that's many, many years out before you start getting your return.","Operator","We have a question from Brad Heffern from RBC Capital Markets.","Brad Heffern","And Speedway, just circling back to an earlier question, I was wondering if you could put a finer point on the synergies generated to date. Has it been the overall pool of synergies has expanded or have they been just coming in faster than you would expect and perhaps the 2017 goal now becomes the 2016 goal? But the overall synergies are not more than you originally expected?","Tony Kenney","Yes, so originally we had indicated that we would generate $75 million of synergies in 2015. And as Gary mentioned, that's about 2X that number that we've seen so far. So what's happened is, again, alluding back to Gary's comments, when you think about the accelerated conversions, the back-office platforms, the operating platforms, the benefits we get to really marketing the stores along the same lines as we do our legacy stores, those are all generating additional synergies that we're realizing from that activity.","When you add in the number of remodels that we've completed -- so these are projects we're spending $300,000 to $500,000 to go into the stores and really redesign how we're merchandising the key areas of the store. And, again, those are giving rise to synergies on an accelerated basis. And then, lastly, I would say that the -- just the overall integration of the operations, the people have been tremendous.","The amount of time it's taken to train thousands of employees on new systems and procedures has really exceeded our expectations. So, again, from an operating expense standpoint and then overall from the G&A standpoint, we have been able to take advantage of those savings as well.","Brad Heffern","And then just thinking about Speedway in general and its place in the portfolio, obviously it is a very valuable asset. At this point, the head stores are not mature. But fast-forward a couple years, if you feel that you are not getting the credit that you should for Speedway in the share price, how do you think about unlocking that?","Gary Heminger","Well, we will just continue to follow that through, Brad. We continue to believe Speedway, as you said, is a very, very strategic part of our portfolio along with our refining system and our midstream and how everything works and we move those volumes through our integrated logistics space, but we will cover that down the road.","Operator","We have a question from Phil Gresh from JPMorgan.","Phil Gresh","The first question, just one more on MPLX, could you talk a little bit more about the interplay between the drops that you're not talking about in the organic growth that you see from MarkWest and other opportunities? How should we think about the mix of those two things when you look at 2016 in order to hit that 25% distribution growth target?","Gary Heminger","Well, you look at MarkWest by itself today -- and they've stated publicly, they have about $1.5 billion of CapEx in their plan this year. That will be coming on some work they already had going on. And as fields mature -- and the other thing is how they are improving utilization of the assets that they already have in place. You take on top of that the assets that we have already put into the MLP, how they continue to grow.","And then one of the things that is kind of a flywheel, if you look at it, is how we move refined products. Sometimes it makes more sense to move refined products out the exports. Sometimes it makes more sense to take them through our pipeline systems. And we take that all into account. And then you couple that with possible drop-downs that we may look at. The other thing is -- let me turn it over to Pam. Pam Beall is here with me. Pam is managing all of the transition between MPLX and MarkWest, so let me have Pam give you some of her thoughts.","Pam Beall","Gary really elaborated extensively early on the call about the many different ways that the parent can support the distribution growth for MPLX going forward. So it's not simply a combination of drop-down and organic growth. And we will determine as we move through 2016, based on a lot of different considerations, what we think is the best combination of the many tools that MPC can lend to the partnership to support its distribution growth.","Don Templin","Phil, this is Don. I think the other really important factor in there is the yield environment. That will impact how the trajectory of where the EBITDA sources are and how that works going ahead. So what we feel great about is that we have a lot of options and tools to be able to manage whatever yield environment that we're in to be able to reach the distribution growth guidance that we've articulated. And we think that differentiates MPLX from many of MLPs that are out there. So I can't tell you the exact percentage, but I can tell you we have all the tools that we need to meet that distribution growth guidance and that is a differentiator.","Phil Gresh","Yes, okay. And then on the capital spending, if I think about the core business outside of the MarkWest, number one, you're tracking well below the full-year guidance. And number two, I'm just wondering how you are thinking about that as you compare it against how you're thinking about 2016, again, outside of MarkWest. How are you thinking about that today? And if you could maybe tie that to how you're thinking about return of capital as well -- the availability of cash flow to returning capital to shareholders -- again, this quarter being a bit lower. How are you thinking about that?","Gary Heminger","Phil, are you speaking to MPC?","Phil Gresh","Yes.","Tim Griffith","For capital spending through third quarter, we're not terribly far off our expectations and would expect that our full-year 2015 will be about where we expected. So -- and that's not unusual to see a little bit heavier of a capital spend in the fourth quarter. That includes all elements of the business. Obviously we've got some continued investment on the pipeline projects that we're working on within refining and within Speedway. So I think for the full year we will get there.","We're really not at a position right now to talk about 2016. Hopefully you can join us for the investor day in December. I think we intend to give you a little bit more color around our intention and exactly where we're going to devote resources for next year across the entire business.","The return of capital piece is another good question. I think you've seen from us and will continue to see from us a very balanced approach. This is not an all-in, one-way-or-another. We think that we -- it's carefully and then with a pretty disciplined approach invest in the business where we think it makes sense and do that with a focus on shareholder returns as well. We believe that the dividend and share repurchase are part of the overall value equation for investors and that's something we're going to remain committed to.","Operator","We have a question from Ryan Todd from Deutsche Bank.","Ryan Todd","Maybe if I could just follow up with one follow-up on the ROUX product cancellation. You discussed it a little bit, but maybe if you think about general capital deployment going forward, is this just more of a project-specific? Should we think about it in terms of the specific economics of this project? Is it a comment on relative gasoline versus distillate cracks going forward? Or if we think about it, can we view this as -- when you think about capital allocation within your portfolio, as better opportunities outside of refining or are there other opportunities within refining if these spreads aren't going to work where you can maybe shift capital going forward?","Gary Heminger","It's, first of all, a specific project, Brian. And it's the market conditions that we're seeing today. This project was all about taking heavy residue [ph], upgrading it through the ROUX and making [indiscernible] for diesel. And it's a spread from that. And we all know where crude prices have gone, therefore where the product price has gone and the spread has collapsed significantly.","As I stated at one time, this specific project had a 25% return. It's going to have about $800 million to $1 billion of annual EBITDA and our FID process work, we're on top of that. And it suggests that the market conditions if they are going to be lower for longer, now is not the time to invest in them. But we believe that the backdrop to that is we have superior projects specifically around Galveston Bay that are higher rates of return, much quicker returns of capital into our marketplace that makes more sense.","So, yes, we wrote this off. We shelved this for the time being. But when the markets come back, we have all the engineering done, complete and we can pull it off the -- you don't say shelf anymore, you pull it out of the computer and away you go. So the right decision from a capital discipline approach, but it gives us the available capital. There are other projects in refining and, of course, other good returns that we have either in the midstream or in the Speedway space.","Operator","We have a question from Doug Leggate from Bank of America.","Doug Leggate","So, look, a lot of stuff has obviously been asked, but I have two things. And then maybe you want to save this for the analyst day. Gary, you've been pretty open and active about finding ways to release value over the years. And obviously one of the big slugs of your business now is retail following the acquisition, obviously, a year or two ago.","What are your longer-term strategic thoughts for retail in terms of what -- if you look at peers in the street, you could argue it gets a higher-multiple business that's embedded in a lower-multiple refining business. So I'm just curious about your broad thoughts on that. As I say, maybe it's an issue for the analyst day. And I've got a follow-up, please.","Gary Heminger","Right and I just had a similar question to that. We've been very clear -- you and I have traveled and talked about this in the past. Speedway is a very strategic part of our business. Our strategies are we want to have a very high-control volume out of our refinery specifically for gasoline. And as Speedway continues to grow the diesel part of its business, it is certainly continuing to help that. I think if you want to look at the capture rate from our refining and the margins that we get from some of our refining, it certainly helps having Speedway in order to have a very ratable demand source that has taken your refined product.","Lastly, as I said last year when we did the acquisition of the Speedway East, that we want to grow Speedway to be a $1 billion-a-year EBITDA business and I will knock on wood and we will share more with you at analyst day, but I think we're pretty much going to be there in the first year of operations. So, it illustrates that our strategy -- the tremendous execution by Tony and the Speedway team in order to be able to accomplish this, to get about twice as many stores reconverted in the first year than we had anticipated is very, very strong. But we will share more with you at analyst day. I think your real question is are we thinking about spinning Speedway off and the answer is--","Doug Leggate","Yes, I didn't want to be that obvious. But, yes, that's pretty much it.","Gary Heminger","The answer is no. This is a very, very key part of our strategy going forward.","Doug Leggate","Gary, my follow-up is really, I guess we started off the call talking about MPLX or maybe I could just finish it up there. Clearly, the share price of MPLX is not under pressure. I think that's a wider market issue than just a Marathon issue. But leaving that aside, what does it do to your view on what you think you can attract by way of acquisition multiples for your midstream assets? And I'm thinking more the longer-term refining drops. A lot of you still think that sort of 8 to 10 multiple is still reasonable. And if so, when do you think we can start to see that process kickstart again?","Gary Heminger","Well, I will answer that from a very macro viewpoint, Doug. As we look across the entire midstream space, I still think you're going to see consolidation in the midstreams. I think you have to. The pressure on balance sheets of certain midstream companies -- that's why this is a compelling combination. And the industrial logic is our strong balance sheet with a company that has a tremendous backlog of projects and can't do all of them on their own. So that's number one. I think you're going to continue to see additional combinations in this business.","The next point, when you look out at assets that are available, high-quality assets that are attractive in the marketplace are still demanding an 8, 10 and sometimes even a higher multiple when you are competing for those assets in an open auction. So I think the market -- because what we're talking about that is available to be dropped into the MLP are very high-quality, very high-sustaining cash flow assets and they will demand a premium in the marketplace. So I still think that market is good. Don, do you have any comments?","Don Templin","Well, maybe the other just observation, Doug, is in an environment where the yields have widened as much as they have, there is probably going to be some pressure just around the market in general on multiples. I mean, if you have a higher cost of capital on a higher yield, what you are able to pay for at acquisition, I think, does go down over time.","Operator","We have a question from Roger Read from Wells Fargo.","Roger Read","Can we talk about the export a little bit? You mentioned doing some things to expanded and if you could go just a little further than record volumes but where do you think volumes can go given the expansion? And as you mentioned earlier, some competition picking up and probably not anything we would call core markets of yours. But there is some capacity coming on in Latin America in fits and starts, let's say and a lot of downtime in that region as well that may not resume anytime soon. Just give us an idea of where that -- I think it was 330,000 you mentioned.","Gary Heminger","Yes, we did 333,000 this quarter. Let me ask Rich Bedell and Mike Palmer may have a few comments as well.","Rich Bedell","As far as the projects that we have to increase our export capacity, there's -- two are ramping up this year. One is done at Garyville and that was to increase the gasoline portion. In Galveston Bay, we're doing something to increase the distillate portion.","And then looking down the road by about 2018, I think right now we will take that up to about 395,000 will be our stated capacity on exports. But then we go up to a little above 500,000 with a project that we will complete in 2018 at Galveston Bay that really takes the old crude import docks and makes them into gasoline and distillate export docks. So Mike, you can talk about the bigger scale of the demand.","Mike Palmer","Sure. Roger, here's what I would say. This export market is extremely dynamic. It's very complex. Every time we start to see maybe a little slowdown in one area, the strength shifts and it goes somewhere else. The predominance of our business ends up today in Europe or in Latin America. But in addition to that, we actually have cargoes they go all the way to Asia.","There are all kinds of different needs out there for different specs and different-sized cargoes. And as I say, the market is extremely dynamic. We honestly have had -- we haven't missed a step since these big export refineries have come on and no reason to believe that we won't continue to have the advantage that we've had in the past.","Roger Read","And one follow-up on that, you mentioned weak diesel demand overall domestically, globally. It seems to me any sort of pickup in that is going to tighten the distillate market fairly quickly. And I don't know exactly how to name the timing of that. But do you see that there is any, especially given the shift to gasoline this summer that there is a substantial amount of excess distillate capacity that's not being used out there?","Gary Heminger","No, we don't think there's that much. In fact, a lot of upsets around the world in refining over the last quarter have been able to soak up a lot of that excess inventory in the marketplace. But you are right; it goes back, Roger, to basic economic theory. It's not going to take much to turn that distillate market around. Whether it's 50,000 barrels a day or 100,000 barrels a day, it's fairly balanced today. And so it's not going to take much to happen. A little bit of pickup in Asia, a little bit of pickup in Brazil that I was mentioning earlier. Europe continues to remain strong. So it's not going to take much to, I think, put things in a positive position on the distillate side of the equation.","Operator","We have a question from Jeff Dietert from Simmons and Company.","Jeff Dietert","My question is related to high-octane gasoline and I was wondering if you could comment on your flexibility to increase production of high-octane gasoline within your system. Are you seeing retail sales and high-octane gasoline grow more rapidly? And then the regular 87-octane gasoline?","Rich Bedell","From the refining standpoint, we've seen that octane demand has gone up. Primarily, I think it's related to running the shale crudes and the Canadian crudes with the diluent. So you are using your octane, you're blending it up in the refinery. Our octane knobs -- Marathon's refinery, we have a pretty high percentage of reformer capacity and we utilize it fully. So we're generating octane there. We're also looking at projects to generate additional octane through our cat crackers and alp units. But we've -- look at our product slates and we optimize our refineries around that. Mike, do you want to take a little bit around some of the octane sales?","Mike Palmer","And Jeff, I will finish the call here with one of the key things that we will talk about with the MPL and MarkWest combination is we're looking at a project that has an alkaloid-type unit down the road that can take the butane that is in the Marcellus -- so the Marcellus Utica regions are long butane. We can take butane, put it through an alkylation unit and make a high-octane blend stock. And that's one of the key things that -- one of the real strengths we bring to the table in this combination that helps the producers. It helps us being short octane and helps the industry and the consumers. So that's a big part that we will talk about in December as well.","Operator","Thank you. We show no further questions.

Ms. Ewing, you may begin.","Geri Ewing","Thank you, Cynthia. Welcome to Marathon Petroleum Corporation's First Quarter 2015 Earnings Webcast and Conference Call. The synchronized slides that accompany this call can be found on our website at marathonpetroleum.com under the Investor Center tab. On the call today are Gary Heminger, President and CEO; Don Templin, Executive Vice President of Supply, Transportation and Marketing; Tim Griffith, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Mike Palmer, Senior Vice President of Supply, Distribution and Planning; Rich Bedell, Senior Vice President of Refining; Pam Beall, Senior Vice President of Corporate Planning, Government and Public Affairs; and Tony Kenney, President of Speedway.","We invite you to read the safe harbor statement on Slide 2. It's a reminder that we will be making forward-looking statements during the presentation and during the question-and-answer session. These results may differ materially from what we expect today. Factors that could cause the results to differ are included here as well as in our filings with the SEC.","Now we turn the call over to Gary Heminger for opening remarks and highlights.","Gary R. Heminger","Thank you, Geri, and good morning to everyone. I appreciate you joining our call.","We are pleased to report record first quarter results with $891 million of earnings. The outstanding results demonstrate our ability to take full advantage of favorable market conditions. MPC's extensive logistics and retail networks give us tremendous flexibility in feedstock acquisition, and the ability to optimize refining operations and product distribution throughout our marketing footprint. MPC's integrated refining system made a significant contribution to the quarter's earnings, with Refining & Marketing segment generating $1.3 billion of income during the quarter. Our refineries operated very well, and we were able to capture the strong Gulf Coast and Midwest crack spreads.","First quarter results also benefited from lower maintenance activity relative to the first quarter of last year. I am particularly proud of dedicated employees at both our Catlettsburg and Galveston Bay refineries for operating our facilities safely, efficiently and without production impact during the recent work stoppage, which has ended at Catlettsburg but continues at Galveston Bay. We look forward to a successful resolution at our Galveston Bay complex in the near term.","Speedway, MPC's retail segment, also performed very well during the quarter. Speedway's earnings, independent of the contribution from newly acquired retail operations, resulted in a record first quarter. Speedway continues to make excellent progress transitioning its new retail locations to the Speedway brand.","As of today, we have converted more than 400 stores, including 260 completed, during the first quarter. The comprehensive transition for each store not only includes the changing of signs and canopies, but it's a complete system changeover, which includes the back office, point-of-sale and inventory control systems, as well as integration of the Speedy Rewards Loyalty Program.","With the majority of the Florida stores now converted, crews have been focused on convergence in the Northeast for the past month. This rapid pace of store conversions contributes to our confidence that we will achieve the synergies and marketing enhancements we expect as we integrate this business.","I am pleased to announce that MPC's board has authorized the sale of its marine logistics business to MPLX, which we expect to close in the next several months. MPC's marine transportation business is a fully integrated waterborne transportation service providing -- provider, consisting of 18 towboats, 203 tank barges and related assets supporting movement of light products, heavy oils, crude oil, renewable fuels, chemicals and feedstocks throughout the Midwest and Gulf Coast regions of the U.S. The addition of the marine business to MPLX, along with its very stable earnings and cash flow, would support our plans to accelerate the growth of partnership and provides increased asset diversity as the MPLX continues to grow rapidly.","MPLX also completed a binding open season for its Cornerstone Pipeline project, which is being increased in diameter to 16 inches to provide an industry logistic solution, including opportunities to connect many Midwest refineries to production from the Utica Shale, with potential to ultimately reach Chicago area refineries and pipelines that supply diluent to Western Canada. This type of organic growth, in addition to both MPC-sponsored drop-downs and third-party acquisition opportunities, demonstrates our commitment to grow MPLX into a large-cap diversified MLP with an attractive distribution profile.","In addition, MPLX declared a $0.41 per common unit cash distribution last week, which puts MPC's general partner interest -- in the highest tier of the incentive distribution rights. The long-term growth profile of MPLX provides significant value to MPC shareholders over time.","We continued our commitment to capital returns in the first quarter, with $209 million of shares repurchased in addition to $136 million in dividends. In addition to the $0.50 per share dividend declared yesterday, our board also announced yesterday a 2-for-1 stock split in the form of a stock dividend to be distributed to MPC shareholders on June 10.","MPC has performed very well for its owner since we became an independent company in mid-2011. Our share price has increased substantially since the spinoff, and this stock split reflects our confidence in MPC's continued value creation, making our shares more affordable for a wider range of investors. The stock is expected to begin trading on a split basis on June 11.","MPC's geographic footprint and large integrated platform, coupled with favorable market conditions, create a positive outlook for the business. Our large integrated platform provides us excellent access to price-advantaged domestic crude oil and low-cost natural gas. And the significant plant maintenance activity we performed in 2014 has positioned us to run at high utilization for the balance of the year.","We also continue to invest in refining margin enhancement projects, with approximately $830 million of ongoing capital investment over the next 3 years for projects focused on increasing our light sweet crude and condensate processing capacity, expanding our export capabilities and increasing our distillate production. These projects are expected to generate approximately $650 million of annual EBITDA and exemplify the high-return capital projects available across our system.","We are pleased with the startup of the condensate splitter at our Canton refinery in December, which is already operating above its 25,000 barrel per day design capacity. We look forward to the startup of the 35,000 barrel per day condensate splitter at Catlettsburg, which is expected to be online by the end of the quarter, positioning us very well as condensate production in this region continues to grow.","Our efforts to accelerate the pace of growth at MPLX, grow our retail segment and enhance refining margins support the diversified earnings power of the business, and we remain confident in our ability to deliver long-term value for our shareholders.","With that, let me turn the call back to Tim to walk through the first quarter results and an update of our financial position. Tim?","Timothy T. Griffith","Thanks, Gary. Slide 4 provides earnings both on an absolute and per-share basis. As you can see in the green bars in the chart, our financial performance for the first quarter is quite strong. MPC had earnings of $891 million or $3.24 per diluted share during the first quarter of '15 compared to $199 million or $0.67 per diluted share in last year's first quarter.","The chart on Slide 5 shows, by segment, the change in earnings from the first quarter of last year. The primary drivers for the change was the $954 million increase in Refining & Marketing and the $110 million increase in Speedway income, partially offset by higher income taxes associated with those higher earnings.","Turning to Slide 6. Refining & Marketing segment income from operations was $1.3 billion in the first quarter of 2015 compared to $362 million in the same quarter last year. The increase was primarily due to a higher crack spreads in the U.S. Gulf Coast and Chicago regions as well as lower turnaround and other direct operating costs in the business. The higher blended crack spread had a positive impact on earnings of approximately $449 million. The blended crack spread was almost $2 per barrel higher at $9.69 per barrel in the first quarter compared to $7.85 per barrel in the first quarter of 2014.","The $503 million year-over-year benefit in direct operating cost relate primarily to the substantially lower turnaround activity in the first quarter versus the first quarter last year. Turnaround and major maintenance costs decreased to $0.79 per barrel in the first quarter from $3.15 per barrel in the same period in 2014. The lower turnaround activity also benefited throughputs, which were 202,000 barrels per day higher than the same period last year.","During the quarter, we recognized a reduction in our projected refined product inventories. The cost in these inventories was based on prices in early 2014, which were much higher than current prices. As a result, we recognized a pretax charge of approximately $30 million in connection with this LIFO inventory reduction.","On Slide 7, we provide the Speedway segment earnings walk for the first quarter. Speedway's income from operations was $110 million higher in the quarter than the first quarter of 2014. Speedway's newly acquired locations are performing better than expected, contributing income of approximately $36 million to the quarter's results or approximately $68 million of EBITDA during the period.","For the legacy Speedway sites, the light product gross margin was about $70 million higher in the first quarter of '15 compared to the same period last year. Overall, the Speedway segment's gasoline and distillate gross margin increased by more than $0.08 to $0.197 per gallon in the first quarter versus the same quarter last year. Merchandise gross margin was $22 million higher in the first quarter of 2015 compared to the first quarter of 2014 for those legacy locations.","On a same-store basis, which excludes locations acquired within the past year, gasoline sales volumes decreased 1.2% over the same period last year. Merchandise sales in the quarter, excluding cigarettes, increased 6.2% on a same-store basis on a year-over-year basis. In April, we have seen no change in same-store gasoline volumes compared to last April.","Slide 8 shows the changes for our Pipeline Transportation segment versus the first quarter of last year. Income from operations was down $5 million to $67 million in the first quarter. The decrease was primarily due to increases in various operating expenses and lower pipeline affiliate income, partially offset by higher transportation revenue in the quarter.","Slide 9 presents the significant elements of changes in our cash position for the quarter. Cash at the end of the quarter was $2.1 billion. Core operating cash flow was a $1.2 billion source of cash. Working capital was essentially flat for the quarter. Long-term debt was $103 million source of cash during the quarter, which was driven by MPLX's issuance of its first public debt during the quarter. Proceeds from the upside debt offering were used to pay down its revolver as well as for the continuing growth of the partnership. We continue delivering on our commitment to balance investments in the business with return of capital to our shareholders.","We repurchased 209 million of shares and paid 136 million of dividends in the first quarter. Share count at the end of the quarter was 272 million shares, reflecting share repurchase activity since the spin of about 25% of the shares outstanding.","Slide 10 shows that we had $2.1 billion of cash and approximately $6.7 million of debt at the end of the quarter. With EBITDA of about $6.5 billion during the last 12 months, we continue to be in a very manageable debt position with about 1 turn of EBITDA and a debt to total capital ratio of 36%. The strong cash generation of the business, highlighted by the $1.2 billion in the first quarter, continues to provide great flexibility as we pursue this balanced approach in our capital allocation.","Turning to Slide 11. We have generated $3.5 billion in cash from operations and $1.4 billion of adjusted free cash flow during the last 12 months. Over this same period, we've returned about $2.2 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases for approximately 1.6x our adjusted free cash flow.","During the first quarter of '15, we repurchased 2 million shares for $209 million through open market repurchases. It's our intention to continue returning capital to our shareholders that is not currently needed to support the operational and investment needs of the business, and we continue to believe share repurchases are the most efficient way to do so.","Slide 12 provides an updated outlook information on key operating metrics for MPC for the second quarter. We are expecting second quarter throughput volumes to be up about 93,000 barrels a day compared to second quarter 2014 and up about 75,000 versus first quarter of '15 due to less planned maintenance. Since we have no comparable 2014 data that includes the newly acquired Hess locations, we'll continue to provide Speedway outlook information by quarter for 2015. For the second quarter of '15, we project Speedway's light product sales volume will be approximately 1.5 billion gallons.","With that, let me turn the call back over to Geri.","Geri Ewing","Thanks, Tim. [Operator Instructions]","With that, we will now open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","My first question. Gary, could you elaborate on your opening comments regarding the favorable market conditions that you referenced? And as there's always investor apprehension around early summer margin compression? Do you see any industry elements that reduce margin volatility, and more particularly, MPC's ability to perform better through those periods of seasonal weakness given willingness return to cash to shareholders and generate additional proceeds via drop-downs?","Gary R. Heminger","Sure. And Evan, if you -- first of all, on the market conditions. Yes, we had a very strong first quarter. There are turnarounds in the Gulf Coast as well in the Midwest. I think a little bit earlier in the Midwest than we have seen historically helped us. And as we've been able to illustrate, and as we've talked about with investors, we do very well when you have volatility in the marketplace and being able to capture margins because of the logistics systems that we have. However, in this first quarter when you compare against our prior quarters, we didn't have that big other net adjustment that -- I shouldn't say, adjustment but that other revenue gross margin that we have illustrated in the past because it was more of a stable quarter from crude prices and -- but there were some upticks in different wholesale margins. Going forward, though, to your question, as we look here in the second quarter, Mike Palmer can get into this in more detail than I. The -- we continue to have a very robust export market. And I think the export market is going to continue to give, not just Marathon, but the industry, a solid performance going forward because of those export markets. We are being very careful to watch inventories across the regions that we operate to keep an eye on inventories because certainly, refiners want to run full out with the crack spreads that we have seen to date. But I think the ability of us being able to reach the export market and capture the margins both on the crack spread. And the differentials that we're seeing in the marketplace are going to help us. Mike, do you want to add any color to the exports?","C. Michael Palmer","Gary, I think you addressed it pretty well. As you said, I think that the export market for us continues to be as good as it has been. We continue to grow volumes, and we don't expect that to change. So I think looking at the second quarter, the product inventories have been pretty well behaved relative to the crude inventories that have grown a lot. So right now, the second quarter looks pretty good.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Great. That's great. The domestic market looks pretty strong as well. Let me -- my second question. Can you give us an update on BP Texas City integration now it's operating? I mean, it appears you're capturing a higher percentage of your benchmark now for several quarters, and I was just wondering if you're seeing upside to your synergy since the acquisition and integration. Any comments there?","Gary R. Heminger","Rich, would you handle that, please?","Richard D. Bedell","Sure. I mean, we were in the middle of some of the integration projects of tying the 2 plants together. In fact, pipe rack is getting ready to go across between the 2 plants. But we have also been able to capture some synergies on crude and storage and utilizing the gas, oils and the cat crackers. So those items have all come to fruition. I don't know if, Mike -- if you have any other comments about -- shaking his head no. So -- but yes, we've been very pleased with the performance of Galveston Bay.","Gary R. Heminger","And the other thing that I would add to that, Evan, is in my comments, I talked about $830 million of CapEx with $650 million of EBITDA. Part of that comes from Galveston Bay. And if you recall, in the first 2 years we operated in Galveston Bay, we really were going in and doing turnarounds, trying to get the plant operationally headed towards our method of operating and some of our operational excellence metrics. So we're just now starting into the process of being able to capture some of these low-hanging fruits that we think have outstanding returns. And that's why I stated $830 million of CapEx was $650 million of EBITDA per year. Part of that is coming from Galveston Bay. And as you can recognize, those are very high returns.","Operator","And our next question comes from Ed Westlake with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And also good to see the operating cost performance coming through as you run the operations more fully this year. 2 questions. You gave us the Cornerstone update that looks like it's moving ahead. Any updates on Sandpiper-SAX that you could share, and obviously, the proposal to reverse Capline?","Gary R. Heminger","Mike, do you want to take Sandpiper-SAX, and I'll handle Capline.","C. Michael Palmer","Yes. Okay, Gary, that sounds fine. Yes, Ed. With regard to Sandpiper and SAX, it looks very positive for us. SAX, I think, we've cleared all the permitting hurdles that we've had. Construction is going to begin this summer. We would expect to see SAX operating sometime in the fourth quarter. With regard to Sandpiper, I think as we've talked about, we did have some permitting delays in Minnesota, but in April, the administrative law judge did basically rule in favor of the certificate of need. He made a recommendation to the Minnesota PUC that the project go forward and the certificate of need be granted. So that was very, very positive. And we're waiting on that ruling that will take place within the next couple of months, and then it will go into a routing hearing as well, but things look very positive to-date.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Good to hear.","Gary R. Heminger","And Ed, on Capline, really no news from when we spoke last. As I've stated before, technically, it's not very complex to reverse a pipeline like this. It just takes time, and you have to have everything in order, so that you can continue to move barrels from the South to the North, if you were to reverse this. But as I've said -- as I've stated before, and I gave a speech at the CERA conference last week, where we had a few questions on this as well. We're still in the throes of discussing with the other owners the interest in doing so, and it's going to continue to take some time, I believe, to get all of the owners on the same page that this appears to be the right thing to do.","Operator","And our next question comes from Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So the first question relates to the retail business. Clearly, the integration is going very well with Speedway. And just, Gary, I want to get your thoughts on potential monetization of those retail assets. And are there ways or other structures in which you can get the full value of those assets that might not be fully reflective of the [indiscernible] right now?","Gary R. Heminger","Well, clearly, Neil, there are different structures and avenues that you can take. We have looked at those over time, and they do not make sense to us at this time to consider other types of structures. First and foremost is to get the what we now call Speedway East fully transitioned, converted over into the type of operation that Tony runs, which I'm very pleased with how the progress that they're making, both in getting the stores converted, and secondly, the inside sales results bump that we're starting to see. So those are the key things. And we started an MLP with -- back in 2012, and that has been very fruitful for starting that, and we've talked about the fuels distribution. And in order to be able to do a fuel's distribution piece inside our MLP is we're counting on these volumes to be there. So I would just say that we remain flexible, we have many options that we could play down the road if we wanted to, and we'll just continue to analyze.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","All right, Gary. And then second was more of a macro question here. LLS brand has looked tight here. Just from -- you have a unique vantage point on this and potential bottlenecks between Houston and St. James. Curious on your thoughts in terms of the dynamics there and what's needed to get the spread to be [indiscernible]?","Gary R. Heminger","Certainly, a very timely question, and let me have Mike address this.","C. Michael Palmer","Okay, Neil. Yes, the LLS brand differentials of late have been near parity back and forth. I think currently, we're at about $1 spread with LL under Brent. If you look at the forward market, the forward market suggests that it ought to be in the $3 kind of range, and I think that's plausible. I do think that we still have some logistical constraints moving all of the light sweet down through Houston and of course, into the St. James area. And companies are working on that continually, but there is also, I think, a misconception in the market that we have this large overhang [Audio Gap] somewhere of this light sweet shale crude. And I guess, what I would say to you is, I don't think that's really the case. I think that -- first of all, I think the refiners have been doing a very good job of keeping up with the light sweet production that we've got in this country. We're running more than we've run in the past. We're not saturated within our Gulf Coast plants on the amount of light sweet that we could run. And I also think that the producers have done a better job of clearing the market than maybe, what, many people in the trade press understand. There's a lot of this light sweet crude that is going on foreign flagships to Canada. The number is in excess of 400,000 barrels a day. We've got another 50,000 barrels a day plus that goes on Jones Act vessels into the East Coast. That number fluctuates depending upon what the ARB is. But in addition to that, we've got another roughly 50,000 barrels a day of condensate exports that are occurring under the BIS rulings. So I would argue that the producers have done a pretty good job of clearing that market. I do think that as inventories continue to build mid-continent and more of those barrels maybe go to the South, you should see the differentials widen. And then again, that $3 level makes sense to us.","Operator","And our next question comes from Paul Cheng with Barclays.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Gary, one of your competitors, when they pre-announce a negative earnings for the first quarter, one of the reasons cited is that, given the strike, that the one of their recently bought facility. In this case, that will be Carson because they didn't have enough people in the headquarter that have worked in that facility. And so as a result even though they've been able to run it, that there's a huge degradation or efficiency loss. Wondering that, in your case, that in Galveston Bay, did you experienced any of those kind of yield degradations or efficiency loss? In other words, that when the strike is over, should we assume we could have another improvement in the operating performance?","Gary R. Heminger","Yes, Paul. First of all, I again want to recognize our team, both in Catlettsburg and Galveston Bay, but you're specifically asking about Galveston Bay here. And a gentleman who I went down to the plant, Rich and I went together, went down and visited the plant just a few weeks ago. And I was really impressed by of our management and the ship foremen and the superintendents who were running the facility. This is something that we train. We train diligently to be prepared. And from day 1 of taking over this refinery, this was our plan to make sure we always had a trained workforce, no matter what the event that could come in and help out. So I would say, and I will let Rich talk about it in more detail, but we have set new records on a number of process units, and we have been able to get a backlog of maintenance completed and doing it all in a very, very safe manner. And Rich, do you want to go into some of the details?","Richard D. Bedell","Yes, well, I think we run both Catlettsburg and Galveston Bay, basically, ran them full out through all this time period. We have a lot of people in the refining organization within the company. We've got waiting lists of people to go in if need be. So we're well-equipped to staff Galveston Bay for as long as it takes. And like Gary said, we've run -- we set production rates. We've lowered our -- I mean, our costs are down, our rates are up. So it's been doing a great job by the people at Galveston Bay and Catlettsburg.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","My second question. Gary, do you have any insight in terms of the U.S. economy when you're looking -- even though today, you no longer do as much of the diesel sales, but when you're looking at your retail network, any insight you can provide, and also whether you would be able to give us what is the RIN cost to you in the first quarter?","Gary R. Heminger","Okay. I'll let Don or Mike handle the RIN cost. As far as the U.S. economy, we're continuing to see strong diesel demand across all the pads, kind of 1.3% to 1.5% increase in distillate demand, which I think is really a precursor to how the economy continues to move. And these are -- I think these are good increases based on last year's substantial increase as well. So the thing that is a bit of, I wouldn't say concerning. But as we tried to reconcile the numbers that come out from a number of the government agencies and other groups who put out numbers, I think the gasoline demand, I don't believe, and it's just not Marathon's numbers -- look at what other competitors are saying in their earnings calls and talking to a number of our jobbers as well. The numbers are coming out from the EIA, on gasoline demand did not quite sync with what we really believe the gasoline demand is looking like. I think they are a bit overstated. But when I look back then at Tony's merchandise sales and customers in the store, we certainly are capturing increases in merchandise sales across his entire chain, which tells us that the customers are there. And I think especially here in the first quarter, we had so many areas that were hampered by very challenging storms, both Midwest, Northeast. And then in the Southeast mid-first quarter, we had a number of stores that were closed because of weather. So I think as we get out into the second quarter, we're going to have a much better barometer on how gasoline demand is going herein. Starting off in April's business, we're up a little bit on gasoline demand so far in the month. So I'll turn it over then to Don to talk about the RINs.","Donald C. Templin","Sure. RIN expense for the first quarter was $41 million, Paul.","Operator","And our next question comes from Chi Chow with Tudor, Pickering, Holt.","Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Got a couple of quick questions on the marine business. Can you give us any sort of annual EBITDA estimates for those assets? Do you -- is the business all MPC-related? Or do you have third-party business flowing through those assets? And any comments on the tax basis on the assets?","Gary R. Heminger","Okay, Don?","Donald C. Templin","Sure, Chi. The EBITDA, annual EBITDA, is about $115 million, and that is all related to MPC activities. So essentially, we also charter out, but those assets -- those specific assets would be dedicated entirely to moving MPC volumes. So that's kind of the EBITDA perspective. What was the last question, I'm sorry, Chi?","Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","The tax basis.","Donald C. Templin","The tax basis, yes. They have a relatively low tax basis, and that's not inconsistent with some of the other assets that we have, that would ultimately be dropped into MPLX. But yes, relatively low tax basis.","Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","But obviously, still tax efficient on the MPC level. Okay. So another question on MPLX, and I don't know if I'm doing my math right here. But I believe your guidance on EBITDA run rate coming at the tail end of '15 is $450 million. Is that correct on annualized run rate?","Gary R. Heminger","That's correct.","Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","And so you also have a 29% distribution growth target at least for this year. It seems like there's a mismatch on my numbers, and it suggests that you may end up with a coverage ratio that's well above industry averages. Am I doing the math right there? And is that the intention?","Timothy T. Griffith","Yes. Chi, this is Tim. I don't think your math is flawed. Ultimately, the -- our interest was to grow the partnership pretty substantially so that it had a base of earnings and the size and scale that would allow to pursue projects on its own. So it is possible that in the first couple of years, the coverage will run a little higher than our 1.1 target over that time period.","Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","And is there some thoughts on the pace of bringing that coverage ratio down to really drive the -- what I'm looking at on the MPC side is the GP distributions, the IDRs?","Timothy T. Griffith","Well, there will be a natural migration back to about 1.1 over the course of the next several years. But again, over these first couple, you could well see a coverage ratio that's well above. So for how we have dropped assets thus far and our anticipated growth for MPLX, we'll see an earnings growth that probably will outpace the distribution growth early on and then those will sort of converge over time.","Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Okay, great. And maybe just one final question. Any update on the Garyville hydrocracker decision?","Gary R. Heminger","We still would -- we pretty much have finished all the front-end engineering, and we won't look at this again until the fourth quarter. We are working on the budgets for next year and the years following. And Chi, as you can recognize it, it's all -- is going to be revolve around where we see the overall commodity price going over the next number of years.","Operator","And our next question comes from Paul Sankey with Wolfe Research.","Paul B. Sankey - Wolfe Research, LLC","Could we just go back to your direct operating cost for a little bit more analysis, if that's okay? On Slide 6, you show that year-over-year, it's about half of the uplift that you got from refining earnings. I just was wondering, can you break out a little bit how much of that was just the volume increase that we saw in that period and whether or not you can quantify some of the other issues? And I'm thinking, I guess, of fuel cost as helping against any other impacts there may have been.","Gary R. Heminger","Tim, you want to handle that?","Timothy T. Griffith","Sure. Paul, the -- I think the biggest piece of that $503 million that we show in direct operating costs were just, frankly, the absence of a lot of the turnaround costs that were recorded in the first quarter of last year on the year-over-year walk. The volume impact on that, we'll have to come back to you on specifically, but that -- by far, the biggest driver there was just the absence of turnaround activity relative to first quarter last year.","Paul B. Sankey - Wolfe Research, LLC","Yes, I get that. And so obviously, there's a double cost that you were running less with the additional cost, and that would be the vast majority of the uplift. I was wondering, is there anything to add on? I guess, particularly, your sensitivity to natural gas prices, which I guess didn't change a whole lot, but also where the lower oil prices also would boost your -- or rather reduce your operating expenses?","Gary R. Heminger","Paul, the operating energy costs were down in Q5 -- or Q1 '15 about $80 million.","Paul B. Sankey - Wolfe Research, LLC","Okay. And then just totally separately the buyback, I guess, it's our forecast and it's our miss, but it was behind what we were thinking. Could you just talk a bit about how you're looking at the attractiveness of buying in more stock, the pace at which you're doing that and whether or not it's a competition against, for example, higher CapEx?","Gary R. Heminger","Sure, Paul. I think our primary drivers around how we're viewing that is, again, how we're situated on a core liquidity perspective as sort of our first prime mover. Core liquidity, in the environment of lower prices, that actually declines to some extent, but again, we'll continue to manage the cash position of the corporation in accordance with the needs. The slightly slower pace in first quarter is not reflective of any change in approach or belief that the shares were appropriately valued. Or otherwise, we still think the shares are substantially undervalued. And again, we'll continue to assess our capital and cash situation as we go and make adjustments. Share repurchase certainly affords us the best lever to make those adjustments, and we'll continue to use it as such.","Paul B. Sankey - Wolfe Research, LLC","I think your debt came down a bit in the quarter, but I assume that you're not -- you're very much in the range of where you want the debt ratios?","Gary R. Heminger","Yes. I mean, the debt was, at a static level, unchanged, but with the role of LTM EBITDA, we actually had more earnings. So the debt-to-EBITDA decline really as a result of earnings growth as opposed to debt reduction. But yes, Paul, we're very much in the comfort zone with regard to where we think we need to be on maintaining an investment-grade profile, and we'll continue to manage it that way.","Operator","And our next question comes from Doug Terreson with Evercore ISI.","Douglas Terreson - Evercore ISI, Research Division","Gary, just to clarify your comments on Galveston Bay, it sounds like not only has the work stoppage not led to a reduction in output, but that production and efficiency have been pretty resilient and may have increased during the work stoppage. Is that the correct way to think about that situation?","Gary R. Heminger","Yes, it is, Doug.","Douglas Terreson - Evercore ISI, Research Division","Okay. And then also, global oil demand growth has been surprisingly strong this year, and you made some comments a few minutes ago about export markets. And I just wanted to see if we can get some more color on the regional demand trends that the company is seeing and whether or not there is any highlights or drivers in the improvement that we're seeing that you may -- that you think may be at work outside of the United States.","Gary R. Heminger","Yes. In fact, if you look at some of the announcements yesterday about how Saudi Aramco is going to really increase their supply efforts, and I think try to increase the market share into the Asian market, namely China. There are big questions about the Yanbu refinery coming up in Jubail soon to be operating, if that's going to affect the U.S. market. I was over there just a few weeks ago, and it's clear to me that the output from those refineries is going to head east. They have the best economics because they have the best transportation costs to go east with that product, and I think that's directionally where it is expected to go. And even though China has global markets, when you look at the global markets and specifically at China, that demand within their economy has fallen a bit. It's still up year-on-year, and I would -- we would love to have those types of increases here in the U.S. of continued to -- how they are achieving growth in their markets. So if you go back to the crude side though, and I've said this on the call we had for the fourth quarter and in several energy conferences, you still need and I think, investors need to look at where the crude is moving in the world. We're continuing to see very strong markets for imports of crude into the U.S. You're seeing more of the medium sours coming in. And those who have the equipment to be able to run medium sour, you look at our numbers for this quarter, we ran about 56% medium sour. That's up from where we've been. And the reason being, it's every day we're buying the best barrel in the marketplace, and medium sours certainly have been a very, very attractive barrel for us. When it comes back to say that there's still, I think -- I know Marathon, I don't know about all the other refiners, but it would suggest there's still -- we have a lot of opportunity to run other light sweet crudes if they are marketed competitively with these medium sours. And therefore, these medium sours are coming in from foreign locations. So what that tells you is we believe we're going to continue to see inventory growing in Cushing, in PADD III. And as inventory continues to grow, as you can see the contango market out there, we're pretty close, I think, to the top end of operational capacity, Doug, in the tanks and Cushing and some other markets. And why I say operational capacity is, as a refiner, we want to be very careful that we don't degradate a type of crude that we're buying, that ends up getting blended in with other crudes if you are sharing tankage. So we're pretty close to, I would say, to the high end of operating capacity. And I think then from watch foreign imports, watch the inventory growth, and I still believe that you're going to see here in the second quarter, spreads start to widen out.","Operator","And our next question comes from Phil Gresh with JPMorgan.","Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First question is just on the midstream side. Given your desire to be a diversified MLP in the long term, how do you think about the opportunity for M&A at this stage? And if we think about the potential for slowing crude oil production growth, could that accelerate the M&A in this space or just -- how are you thinking about this over the next couple of years?","Gary R. Heminger","All right. Pam, you want to take that?","Pamela K. M. Beall","Sure, happy to do that. Well, I guess, first, I would say, when we saw the crude prices fall, we thought that, that could potentially put more midstream assets on the market that may be captive to some producers. We saw -- we've seen a little bit of that, but not a lot. And I think what we have seen is despite the fact that crude commodity prices have been volatile and crude prices have declined, there's a lot of capital out there to help support producers and help support midstream companies that may be more exposed to commodity prices. So I would -- probably a few exceptions, I wouldn't say that we are seeing any distressed selling in the marketplace today from that standpoint, but we continue to evaluate opportunities, M&A, acquisitions, opportunities, in addition to the drop-downs from MPC. We're looking across the spectrum, as I've said before. Those opportunities that would benefit both MPC and MPLX will always rise to the top of our interest list, but there certainly are a lot of different avenues that we could pursue to grow MPLX through acquisition, and we've got a team of people that are very actively evaluating a lot of opportunities.","Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And as you evaluate the M&A opportunities, would you likely use MPC as a source of funding? Or do you feel like a MPLX is large enough at this point to do sizable M&A as you think about the tradeoff between drops and M&A?","Pamela K. M. Beall","Well, I think each opportunity really will be fact and circumstance-based. It's hard to make that general comment. Of course, one of the reasons we are committed to accelerating the growth of MPLX is to position it so that it could take on larger opportunities directly.","Gary R. Heminger","That's what's good, Phil, is that we have the optionalities and the flexibility to go either way. We aren't beholden to -- like some who are not -- maybe do not have the balance sheet to be able to do certain acquisitions. We have that flexibility. If you go back to the color I just answered on Doug's question, if there is -- if we look at wider spreads going forward into the second quarter, there could be pressure as we go out into the second, third quarter. We'll see where our crude prices go, but there could be some further pressure that may open up the M&A activity a little more.","Pamela K. M. Beall","A lot of private equity out there chasing opportunities.","Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Understood. On the retail side, with respect to the synergy capture it has, Gary, maybe, you could just talk a little bit about where you stand today and what you think the biggest incremental source of upside could be as you look ahead with where you're at in the process?","Gary R. Heminger","Sure, Phil. And we have Tony on the line who's operating these stores every day. And so let me have Tony handle that.","Anthony R. Kenney","Thanks, Gary. As commented earlier, we're very pleased with the progress we're making on the conversions to the Speedway brand. And along with that includes the implementation of our merchandise programs inside the stores, which is a real source of synergies down the road. To date in 2015, we feel very good on the progress that we're making. We're going through the best practices of both companies that we committed to. And that is in and of itself is a good source of the synergies that we're experiencing, primarily, right now on the expense side of the business. So as we continue to go forward, we're going to start to realize some marketing efficiencies as well. So on a full year basis, in 2015, we're right on plan with where we expect to be on the synergy capture in 2015.","Operator","And our next question comes from Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets.","Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Sort of staying right there, I was wondering if you could give an update for the Hess stores that have been converted. Has there been any noticeable loss of customers? Or going the other way, have you been able to pull in more customers from other areas in Florida?","Anthony R. Kenney","Yes, I'll take that. The benefit that we have with the conversion is our loyalty program. So -- and these are the markets, Florida, in particular, as we move into the Northeast. It really not had a strong presence on a retail loyalty program. So what we're getting is a lot of good interest in customers signing up for our loyalty program, which is probably the best benchmark we have right now in terms of how we're attracting new customers. There's a lot of dynamics in play. Retail price, as the gasoline prices come down, I think that's driving traffic as well. So we're very careful on how we're analyzing that, and we've only got a little over -- we did the deal, it's 7 months old, and the conversions in Florida are probably 3 to 5 months old. So we have limited data at this point, but we're getting some very, very good feedback from our customers in terms of the loyalty and the offers that we have once we convert to the Speedway brand.","Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. And then thinking about SAX, I was wondering if you could go through maybe the ways in which SAX is going to change the crude sourcing in the Midwest, or is it really more providing optionality?","Gary R. Heminger","Mike?","C. Michael Palmer","Yes, Gary. Yes, Brad, it's going to have a significant impact for us. As you know, that pipeline runs from Enbridge's system in South Chicago down to Putoco, which is our hub. And today, if you look at our flexibility of bringing in either the Bakken crude or other Canadian crude, we pretty much limited that out with the logistical capability that we have today. And SAX, even before Sandpiper is completed, is going to give us that flexibility to increase the amount of crude that comes in from both of those sources. So it's a big deal for us. It's going to help the bottom line, certainly.","Operator","And our next question comes from Doug Leggate, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Gary, I don't know if I picked up on this earlier, but back to Paul Sankey's question on gas sensitivity. I was looking back at the operating cost question. I was looking back at the presentations from the last year and the Q1 delta last year was a negative 605 versus the prior first quarter 2013, and of course, gas was very strong last year. And this year, you had, obviously, had a big operating cost benefit of over $500 million. So I don't know if I picked it up wrong, but can you just walk through again what your gas sensitivity is, because obviously if gas prices remain low, those cost benefits are, probably, going to be quite sticky, I'm guessing?","Gary R. Heminger","Okay. Let me turn this over to Don or Rich. I don't have any of those numbers with me here.","Richard D. Bedell","Sure, Doug. Our gas sensitivity -- so $1 change in the natural gas prices is around $140 million after-tax on an annual basis. And with respect to the first quarter of '15 versus the first quarter of '14, there was about an $80 million benefit in the other manufacturing cost line related to the lower energy costs.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. I guess I don't want to labor -- maybe I can take it offline, but what I'm really kind of looking at is the full-year cost hit last year, looked year-over-year was about $913 million according to the presentation. So I'm trying to understand what caused the cost uplift last year because it's an absolute number, not a unit number obviously, and what's reversed to come back out in the first quarter is what I'm trying to understand, see how sustainable it is.","Gary R. Heminger","I mean, which -- I'm sorry, which quarter are you comparing...","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","For the first quarter year-over-year, you had a little over $500 million of benefit in the presentation. But the full year, last year, the direct operating cost negative impact was $913 million, most of which was in the first quarter, which is when gas prices were $5. So I'm trying to understand what the moving parts are. Like I say maybe I need to take it off-line, but what reversed out that gave you $913 million negative last year that gave you a $500 million positive in the first quarter, I guess, is where I'm getting at. I don't know if that's complicating the question too much.","Richard D. Bedell","The big piece of it last year, I think, was all the heavy turnaround activity that we had, Doug. So we can walk through individual components, but last year, you will recall, we had very, very heavy turnaround activity, which was a detriment to that quarter. And this quarter really is the absence of all of that turnaround activity.","Gary R. Heminger","And Doug, it's both cost and volume this quarter.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Right. You do not put through the maintenance, through CapEx, is that right? You expense it?","Gary R. Heminger","That's correct. Maintenance goes through expense, not CapEx.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. So that probably explains the bulk of it. Okay, that's really helpful. My follow-up, Gary, is really more of a micro question. Again, it's -- we're looking at you guys saying you can raise your utilization by 6% or so, and obviously, the industry as a whole has been running pretty hard. But we're starting off with very, very high gasoline inventories, I guess, for the U.S. And what I'm kind of thinking, well, I guess, I'm somewhat concerned about is when we looked at what happened at the end of last year, gasoline margins sunk on very, very high gasoline production. So I'm just kind of curious, how do you see the macro playing out? Obviously, your market is a big beneficiary of imports from other regions. So given those robust gasoline inventories, what's your prognosis on how you see things playing out this -- in this higher utilization environment?","Gary R. Heminger","Well, as I stated, I think it was on the first question. Something that we're watching very carefully. The inventories and the product exports still within the industry are much more skewed to distillate then to gasoline. However, gasoline is picking up namely to Latin America countries. And we see that, that is going to continue. But you're right, and that's why, when I stated earlier, also, to keep an eye on the EIA numbers that come out and what demand appears to be. We're not seeing, and I still think it comes down to being able to reconcile all the exports back to -- within the government numbers within their model. So it -- you make a good point, something that we manage and we watch every day, is to watch how the inventories continue to move. The key is going to be clearing out all the bad weather we had in the first quarter, and hopefully, getting down to a clean second quarter, where we really can measure what the gasoline demand is across the U.S. And once I have those optics, obviously, I'm going to be able to answer your question better, but we're watching inventories very, very carefully. But also, I'm seeing very significant growth in the export market.","Operator","And your next question comes from Roger Read with Wells Forgo.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I guess, I'd like to follow up a little bit on the light sweet crude. Obviously, you discussed a lot of the pipeline issues and sort of the storage issues. Previously, I think you mentioned as much as 65% of the volumes that you have at hand, could be light sweet crude. Can you let us know what we need to see? Is it the wider differential? Is it more pipeline access in order to get to those volumes?","Gary R. Heminger","Mike?","C. Michael Palmer","Yes, Roger. I think, what we need to see is we need to see differentials, say, versus medium sour that are more compelling than what they've been. When we're constantly in the market, it is every day trying to optimize our crude slates, and we do that on a day-to-day basis with domestic barrels. So we have this option to buy light sweet crude. We have this option to buy medium sour crude, for example, at Garyville. And so we're constantly looking at the differentials to see which makes a higher margin. And honestly, between the light sweet crude that so many think has this huge overhang in the market. And therefore, you think it would be priced so that it was compelling to bring in, that's just simply not the case. We go back and forth between buying the medium sours versus the light sweet. So at some point, if the production rises enough and the producers don't clear it to another market, then we would see numbers that would allow us to run higher volumes of light sweet.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. But doesn't that, by itself, sort of create the pressure for the export call? In other words, I get that you don't want to run the crude unless it's economically profitable, but if you have a differential at $7 or even, say, $10, that puts more pressure kind of within the system to call for the export volumes. So do you think it's a number closer to, as you mentioned, with LLS, $3? Or is it something that we need to see in a $5 to $7 range in order to clear the market if we have more crude on the market from the lower 48 producers?","C. Michael Palmer","Well, I think what we tend to look at, again, is the differential of LLS versus our other alternatives. So of late, I think, again, when I talk about the competition with the medium sours, I mean, we've been seeing a differential between LLS and Mars, it's been in the $3 range, $3 to $4. So again, if that differential came into something less, then we would run more -- we would try and run more light sweet at those more economic numbers. But that's primarily what we look at.","Geri Ewing","Cynthia, with that, we'll close the question-and-answer. I want to thank everyone for joining us today, and thank you for your interest in Marathon Petroleum Corporation. Should you have additional questions or, like, clarification on the topics we have discussed this morning, Teresa Homan and I will be available to take your calls.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
