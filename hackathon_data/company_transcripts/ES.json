My name is Vanessa and I will be your operator for today\u2019s call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question and answer session. During the question and answer session, if you have a question, please press star then one on your phone. Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Mr. Jeffrey Kotkin. You may begin, sir.","Jeffrey Kotkin","Thank you, Vanessa. Good morning and thank you for joining us. During this call, we\u2019ll be referencing slides that we posted last night on our website. I\u2019m Jeff Kotkin, Eversource Energy\u2019s Vice President for Investor Relations. ","As you can see on Slide 1, some of the statements made during this investor call may be forward-looking as defined within the meaning of the Safe Harbor provisions of U.S. Private Securities and Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties which may cause the actual results to differ materially from forecasts and projections. Some of these factors are set forth in the news release issued yesterday. Additional information about the various factors that may cause actual results to differ can be found in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 and the 10-Q for the three months ended September 30, 2017. Additionally, our explanation of how and why we use certain non-GAAP measures is contained within our news release and the slides we posted last night, and in our most recent 10-K. ","Turning to Slide 2, speaking today will be Jim Judge, our Chairman, President and CEO; Lee Olivier, our Executive Vice President for Enterprise Energy Strategy and Business Development, and Phil Lembo, our Executive Vice President and CFO. Also joining us today are Jay Buth, our VP and Controller, and John Moreira, our VP of Financial Planning and Analysis.","Now I will turn to Slide 4 and turn over the call to Jim.","Jim Judge","Thank you, Jeff. I want to thank everyone who is joining us this morning for our recap of the year that we just completed and a comprehensive look at our opportunities and financial outlook for the next four years.","To start, I want to congratulate our 8,000 employees for the great progress we made over the past year in achieving our vision of being recognized as the best utility in the country and as a catalyst for clean energy development in New England. Our region is mandating a 75 to 80% reduction in carbon emissions by the year 2050 and we plan to play a central role in helping New England reach its targets. Older coal, oil and nuclear plants continue to retire, only to be replaced by renewables and natural gas.","Two large and economic new sources of renewable energy are hydroelectric power in Quebec and offshore wind southeast of Massachusetts. Through Northern Pass and Bay State Wind, we expect to be deeply involved in accessing both, and Hydro Quebec and Orsted are great partners. ","We continue to believe that Northern Pass is uniquely designed to significantly lower the region\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions, reduce energy costs, and reduce our growing and increasingly ominous dependence on natural gas for power generation. We were surprised and disappointed, and I\u2019m going to say humbled by the recent decision from the New Hampshire site evaluation committee rejecting the project. Clearly we have not fully addressed all the major concerns in New Hampshire yet. We expected the process to allow us to address what were legitimate concerns raised during the proceedings. If allowed re-hearing, we expect there may be an opportunity to address those concerns. In a couple of minute, Lee will discuss the steps we are taking to move the project ahead.","At the same time, we continue to lead the way in bringing other cost effective energy solutions to customers in the region. We have completed the sale of our fossil plants, are well underway in the construction of 62 megawatts of additional rate-based solar, are beginning to build our first two utility scale battery storage facilities, are developing the infrastructure needed to expand access to electric vehicle charging stations in the region, and we are continuing to run the nation\u2019s number one ranked energy efficiency programs. We also acquired Aquarion, adding a long term opportunity to move into the water delivery business. ","Rates are fully decoupled at our FERC-regulated transmission business, and on the distribution side we now have full revenue decoupling for more than 3 million of our 4 million customers. This allows both our customers and our shareholders to benefit from the implementation of our aggressive energy efficiency programs and not be hurt by them financially.","Moving from our strategic initiatives, we also achieved significant operational, financial and regulatory successes over the past 12 months. We are working with regulators in each of the states that we serve to identify the investments needed to modernize the electric grid and improve its capabilities and resiliency. We have doubled the pace at which we are replacing older natural gas pipelines and are accelerating Aquarion\u2019s water main replacement program. We also have a group of new commissioners at FERC who clearly favor infrastructure enhancement.","We had a record-setting electric reliability and employee safety performance, our best year ever on both measures and are well within the top quartile of our industry peers. On the regulatory side, we achieved constructive outcomes to eNSTAR\u2019s first fully litigated Massachusetts distribution rate case in over 30 years and recently negotiated and filed with regulators in Connecticut the first settlement of our Connecticut Light and Power distribution rate case since 1986. ","Turning to Slide 5, we reported GAAP earnings of $3.11 despite a very mild summer. We also reiterate our 5 to 7% EPS growth now using the 2017 earnings level as our base. We have both the investment opportunities and the balance sheet capacity to deliver on that outlook. ","Slide 6 shows that over one year, three year, five year and 10-year periods, our shareholders have benefited from our strong execution of our business strategy. Our total return has consistently exceeded our peer averages. In 2017, Eversource\u2019s return to shareholders was 60% higher than our EEI peers and over 10 years nearly two times our peers\u2019 performance. ","Part of that strong total return profile has been a rising dividend. We are committed to raising our dividend at a pace that is above the industry average and consistent with our earnings growth. As you can see on Slide 7, we announced a 6.3% increase earlier this month. ","In December, we were upgraded by S&P to A-plus, resulting in a two-notch difference between us and the second highest rated electric utility. We have the financial strength and the knowledge and skills to help our region meet some very significant energy-related challenges. ","Turning to Slide 8, the cold snap in late December and early January reminded us just how fragile New England\u2019s wintertime energy supply situation is today and how it\u2019s likely to worsen due to additional plant retirements before it improves. During that period, New England\u2019s natural gas prices were the highest, not just in the U.S. but the highest in the world while just 200 miles to the east of us natural gas prices were the lowest in the world. This differential cost our region approximately $500 million over less than a two-week period. ","As Lee will discuss in more detail, the issue is not just economic. Running the region\u2019s oil, coal and diesel fleet flat out for two weeks added over a million tons of carbon emissions, highlighting the critical need for additional wintertime natural gas capacity in New England. These challenges require a solution and we\u2019re well positioned to lead in this effort.","Before closing my remarks, I want to stress that each day our employees are on the front lines making us a trusted partner in our efforts to reduce energy costs, providing a top tier level of service and promoting our region\u2019s energy policies. There\u2019s no finer group in the industry and they are the primary reason I\u2019m so optimistic about the company\u2019s future.","Now I\u2019ll turn over to the call to Lee.","Lee Olivier","Okay, thanks Jim. I\u2019ll provide you with an update on a major project, expand on Jim\u2019s comments on the New England winter supply situation, and then turn the call over to Phil.","I\u2019ll start with Northern Pass. Following our November earnings call, we received a string of good news about the project with various federal and state approvals listed on Slide 10. In late January, a combination of Northern Pass transmission and Hydro Quebec\u2019s all-hydro energy offering won the entire Massachusetts clean energy RFP over more than 40 other clean energy projects of various scales and technologies. The RFP sought nearly 9.5 terawatt hours a year of clean energy for up to 20 years, and our bid was the sole winner. Clearly NPT is the best clean energy solution for the region.","However, on February 1 we experienced a setback. The New Hampshire SEC had commenced deliberations on January 30 and had determined that Northern Pass possessed the financial, technical, and managerial capability to construct, operate and maintain the project. When the SEC members began discussing criteria known as orderly development, they noted the benefits Northern Pass would have in multiple areas, including promoting economic development, job growth, and increased property tax revenues, but the members indicated they were concerned about other items such as tourism, property values, and the impact on municipal development plans. Without discussing the potential conditions that could have been imposed to address those concerns, the SEC ended deliberations and voted unanimously to reject the project. Left un-discussed were key topics such as whether Northern Pass would serve the public interest, whether it would have an unreasonable adverse effect on aesthetics, historic sites, air and water quality, and the natural environment and public health and safety. ","As Jim said, we were deeply disappointed by the committee\u2019s decision. We had a compelling case about the key benefits of the project, including more than $3 billion of economic benefits to the state over the life of the project, the elimination of 3 million tons of carbon emissions in New England each year - that\u2019s the equivalent of taking about 670,000 cars off the road, the creation of 2,600 jobs in New Hampshire during construction, the $600 million of annual regional cost energy savings, including $62 million a year in New Hampshire, the additional $30 million in property tax revenues in New Hampshire annually and an average increase in New Hampshire\u2019s GDP of $162 million a year, and a commitment to fund $200 million over 20 years for New Hampshire communities, tourism, clean energy, and economic development. ","We will ask the New Hampshire SEC to reconsider its decision shortly. If the committee reconsiders its decision and votes to approve the project, we expect to begin construction this year. The SEC decision has been reviewed by evaluators in the Massachusetts clean energy RFP. On February 14, the electric distribution companies with the Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources and the RFP\u2019s independent evaluator notified Northern Pass that they will continue negotiations with the project through March 27, 2018, but in parallel they will negotiate with a runner-up project. ","Hydro Quebec leadership continues to support the project as by far the most advanced initiative to boost the sale of Quebec hydroelectric power into New England. We continue to work to advance the project forward and we will update you as we move ahead.","From Northern Pass, I want to move to Slide11 and Bay State Wind, our 50\/50 partnership with Orsted, the world leader in the development of offshore wind. Bay State Wind seeks to construct and operate at least 2,000 megawatts of offshore wind facilities 15 to 25 miles south of Martha\u2019s Vineyard. Our site is very well situated to serve four states that are currently pursuing long-term contracts for renewable energy, including offshore wind. ","Turning to Slide 12, in December we submitted two bids into the RFP overseen by the Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources and the state\u2019s three electric utilities. The RFP required all three bidders to submit a proposal for 400 megawatts of offshore wind but also provided an option to submit a second bid for as little as 200 megawatts and for as much as 800 megawatts. Bay State Wind submitted highly compelling bids for both 400 megawatts and 800 megawatts. The two other bidders submitted proposals for offshore wind generation and the bid\u2019s evaluators are due to make their selection by April 23 and to submit contracts to the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities by the end of July. ","We believe that our Bay State Wind partnership, the combination of the world leader in offshore wind development with New England\u2019s leading transmission developer will provide evaluators with two very attractive options to consider. If we are chosen we would initiate the federal and state permitting processes in late 2018 and expect to be in service in the early 2020s. This RFP is just the first of multiple offshore wind RFPs in which we expect Bay State Wind to bid. Massachusetts is required to contract for 1,600 megawatts of offshore wind by 2027, but it is seeking no more than 800 megawatts in this RFP. ","Three weeks ago, Connecticut issued an RFP for certain Class 1 renewable resources, including nearly 200 megawatts of offshore wind. Rhode Island has indicated an interest in contracting for up to 1,000 megawatts of additional renewables by 2020 and announced a plan for a 400 megawatt RFP later this year. Finally, New York has indicated that it will seek proposals for 800 megawatts of offshore wind over the next two years. Bay State Wind\u2019s favorable geographic location would allow it to bid into all of these RFPs, but due to competitive reasons, we have not provided investors with specific levels of expected investment in Bay State Wind at this time.","Offshore wind is particularly favorable in New England during the winter period when wind speeds along the Atlantic coast are higher and more consistent and when the region has the greatest challenges for related fuel supplies. Furthermore, Bay State Wind\u2019s facilities can be interconnected into our 345 KV AC system with minimal upgrades onshore. While offshore wind facilities would improve the region\u2019s fuel diversity particularly in the winter, they are not nearly enough to offset the need for additional natural gas pipeline capacity.","Moving to Slide 13, Jim earlier reviewed some of the cost and environmental impacts resulting from the late December and early January cold snap. The extended cold snap was similar to the polar vortex in 2013 and \u201914. Natural gas prices soared as available supplies were directed not to power plants but to heating homes and businesses that had paid for firm capacity. Without adequate supplies of natural gas, New England grid operators turned to older, inefficient, costly and high carbon emitting oil and coal plants to keep the region\u2019s lights on. ","During the cold snap, as little as 2,500 megawatts of the region\u2019s 18,000 megawatts of natural gas generation was available to run on natural gas, a situation that drove the increased oil and coal usage. The intensive oil consumption meant that many of the region\u2019s oil units were within two days of running out of oil by the time that the cold weather snap broke. Massachusetts\u2019 Energy Secretary, Matt Beaton described the impact on air emissions as a disaster. Slide 14 illustrates the tremendous reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in New England that they have achieved since 2001, largely because of the switchover from oil and coal to natural gas. There is no question additional access to natural gas in the winter is critical to ensure reliability, lower customer cost, and to meet the region\u2019s greenhouse gas reduction goals.","We continue to discuss the supply situation with various stakeholders in New England and Washington to identify a path that will allow a brownfield project to move forward. We know that ISO New England is increasingly concerned about this wintertime vulnerability which will be further challenged when Pilgrim\u2019s 700 megawatts of nuclear generation facilities retires next year. An important fuel security report that ISO New England published last month indicated that no later than the winter of 2024 and 2025, New England would likely require load shedding six days a winter for a total of 14 hours, and that was a reference case. In a severe case, that load shedding would become more frequent. ","In the 2018 Regional Electricity Outlook published last week, ISO New England\u2019s chairman and its CEO wrote, and I quote, in the coming years as more oil and coal and nuclear plants leave the system, keeping the lights on in New England will become an even more tenuous proposition. A new group of Massachusetts business and civic leaders from across the Commonwealth, the Mass Coalition for Sustainable Energy, wrote Governor Baker and the state legislature leadership on February 7, expressing deep concern about, and I quote, the existing and rapidly increasing shortfall of reliable and affordable energy in New England. They noted, again I quote, by boosting our supply of natural gas, we can stabilize energy prices, reduce cost to ratepayers, attract jobs and new businesses while also speeding our transition to renewable energy and advancing our position as a climate change leader. ","We firmly believe that periodic load shedding during bitter winter days would be a terrible development for the region. We will continue to develop strategies that would allow for a pipeline expansion to proceed and plan to update you later this year on that progress.","Now I\u2019m going to turn the call over to Phil.","Phil Lembo","Thank you, Lee. Today I\u2019ll cover our fourth quarter and full year 2017 financial results, our new four-year capital expenditures and rate base growth forecast, the status of our key regulatory dockets, and discuss the impact of tax reform.","I\u2019ll start with our fourth quarter results on Slide 16. Earnings were $0.75 per share in the fourth quarter of \u201917 compared with $0.72 per share in the fourth quarter of \u201916. The primary driver for the increase was improved electric distribution results where earnings were $0.33 per share compared with $0.26 per share for the same period in 2016. The earnings increase was due primarily to a lower effective tax rate, lower non-tracked operations and maintenance cost, and modest revenue growth, and these were partially offset by higher depreciation and property tax expense. ","Our electric transmission segment earned a total of $0.32 per share in the fourth quarter of \u201917 compared with $0.33 in the fourth quarter of \u201916. The decline was due to a $0.05 gain we recorded in 2016 as a result of FERC\u2019s approval of a settlement allowing us to recover certain merger costs through transmission rates. There was no such gain in the fourth quarter of 2017. We did benefit also from higher transmission rate base due to continued investment in our infrastructure. Transmission capital expenditures totaled $932 million in 2017 compared to $897 million in \u201916 and $807 million in 2015. ","Earnings at our natural gas distribution segment totaled $0.08 per share in both the fourth quarter of 2017 and \u201916. A 4.7% increase in the fourth quarter sales in \u201917 was offset by higher depreciation, O&M, and property tax expense. ","At Eversource parent and other, we earned $0.02 per share in the fourth quarter of \u201917 compared with $0.05 per share in the fourth quarter of \u201916. The decline was primarily due to a $0.05 benefit in the fourth quarter of \u201916 related to tax deductions on certain executive comp payments. ","Turning from the fourth quarter to full-year results, we earned $3.11 per share in 2017 compared with $2.96 per share in 2016. Our electric distribution business earned $1.57 per share in 2017 compared with $1.46 per share in 2016. The improvement was primarily due to a lower effective tax rate and lower operations and maintenance costs partially offset by higher depreciation and property tax expense. Our transmission segment earned $1.23 per share in 2017 compared to $1.16 in the prior year. The improvement was due to an increased level of investment partially offset by the absence of the merger cost recovery item I mentioned earlier. Our natural gas distribution segment earned $0.23 per share in 2017 compared with earnings of $0.24 in 2016. The slight decline was due to higher depreciation, O&M costs, and property taxes, and nearly offset by a 3% increase in sales. The Eversource parent and other earned $0.08 per share in 2017 compared with $0.10 in 2016. The decline was primarily due to the 2016 tax benefit I mentioned previously.","Turning from 2017, let\u2019s take a look at 2018 and our guidance. As you can see on Slide 17, we project earnings this year between $3.20 and $3.30 per share. Positive year-over-year drivers include investments in our electric transmission segment where we expect to invest approximately $900 million again this year on reliability projects and the addition of Aquarion Water, which we closed near the very end of 2017. We also expect to benefit from the improvement of results in our western Massachusetts operations which had been under-earning in recent years but implemented a modest rate increase at the beginning of this month. I\u2019ll talk about our rate proceeding in a minute.","Partially offsetting these benefits are expected increases in property tax and depreciation expense in the absence of PSNH generation earnings. As Jim talked about, we divested of the thermal business early in 2018. We completed the sale in January and expect to complete the sale of the hydro plants in the coming months, and the securitization of remaining stranded costs in the spring. We expect total operations and maintenance costs to decline by about 1 to 2% in 2018. ","From 2018 guidance, turn to Slide 18 and our new four-year capital expenditure and rate base growth forecast. As you can see, we expect to invest nearly $11 billion in our infrastructure over that four-year period. It is significantly higher than the $9.6 billion four-year plan we showed you last year. I\u2019ll discuss some of the major contributors to that increase.","First is our new water segment as a result of our Aquarion transaction. We project approximately $435 million of capital expenditures at Aquarion over the next four years. This compares to approximately $300 million of capital expenditures at Aquarion over the previous four-year period. The increase is due primarily to accelerated water main replacements and a major project to increase our ability to move water from Bridgeport, Connecticut area to address the growing needs in the Stamford-Greenwich area of the state. ","In the natural gas segment, we now project more than $1.6 billion of capital spending in our new four-year forecast compared with $1.45 billion in the previous forecast. Much of this investment is related to more rapid replacement of our older cast iron, bare steel and other mains and services. As a result of constructive regulatory frameworks, we are now able to complete replacement of these mains and services in 15 years in Connecticut and 22 years in Massachusetts, as the system has a larger inventory of pipes to be replaced. These needed investments will be recovered largely through capital tracker mechanisms. In both states, we have doubled the rate of replacement over the past five years, an investment that will help us lower our O&M costs by reducing the number of repairs and reduce also methane emissions, a measure which is followed closely by us and by the growing number of ESG investors we have. ","Within the transmission segment, we\u2019ve split our reliability projects at CL&P, eNSTAR Electric and PS&H from Northern Pass. Reliability transmission spending is projected at $2.6 billion through 2021, an increase of nearly $680 million in the years 2018 through 2020, plus another $525 million in 2021. Since last year\u2019s forecast, we have increased transmission capex at the T&D utilities by approximately $141 million in 2018, $260 million in 2019, and $280 million in 2020. These increases reflect projects that have already completed their required regulatory reviews or are currently already going through the necessary processes.","Turning to Slide 19, you can see that we ended 2017 with about $16.7 billion of rate base, and this reflects the addition of Aquarion and the removal of the New Hampshire generation, so we added about a billion dollars of rate base in 2017 in infrastructure. The $16.7 billion total includes about $8 billion of electric distribution rate base, $6 billion of electric transmission rate base at the three T&D utilities plus $200 million at Northern Pass, $1.7 billion of natural gas distribution rate base, and nearly $800 million of water utility rate base. ","By the end of 2021, we expect rate base to total nearly $22.8 billion, including the $1.6 billion for NPT. In total, that represents more than an 8% rate base compound average growth rate from 2017 through 2021. NPT represents only 1.5% of that total compound annual growth rate. ","We know that many of those on the call will take our capex and rate base forecast models and compare them to what we provided previously. Slide 20 is designed to help you out by comparing our currently projected rate base at the end of 2020 of $21.8 billion with the $19.7 billion we projected a year ago. The additional $2.1 billion comes from three primary sources: Aquarion represents $920 million of rate base by the end of 2020 - this wasn\u2019t in our forecast a year ago, additional transmission and distribution investments at our electric and natural gas utilities added nearly $600 million, and tax reform also added nearly $600 million for reasons I\u2019ll discuss in a minute. Our Northern Pass estimate is roughly the same in both years, so had no impact on the increase.","As a result and as Jim mentioned, we have confidence in our ability to achieve our earnings per share growth rate of 5 to 7% through 2021 using our base of $3.11 per share that we earned in 2017. We consider the 5 to 7% growth rate to be very resilient under a wide range of scenarios. We understand that the market is currently giving us very limited, if any credit for future Northern Pass earnings, but our message today is that our company has a wide range of levers to achieve its earnings growth objectives with or without Northern Pass. Our new end-of-year 2020 rate base forecast even without Northern Pass is about $500 million higher today than it was a year ago with Northern Pass.","Also, we have a track record of identifying additional capital expenditures opportunities as we move through the forecast, and our 5 to 7% growth rate assumes that O&M costs will remain essentially flat over the forecast period as compared to our five-year O&M reductions that have averaged greater than 4%. Also, unlike some of our peers, we do not need to issue equity as a result of tax reform. Our solid financial profile combined with constructive regulatory environments, fully regulated T&D business profile, our exit from generation and the addition of water distribution assets al support low-risk business profile and strong credit ratings, and we expect those ratings to remain strong going forward. ","Slides 21 and 22 show how we expect the benefits of tax reform to flow overwhelmingly to our customers and be relatively neutral to us. The new distribution rates in fact that took effect this month for our 1.4 million Massachusetts electric customers reflect about $56 million of annual benefits from the reduction of the federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. Similarly, the three-year settlement we reached last month in CL&P\u2019s distribution rate case is expected to reflect about $45 million to $50 million or a similar amount of annual customer benefits from the lower tax rate. The majority of our excess accumulated deferred income tax balances will be returned to our distribution customers over a longer period of time in accordance with IRS regulations, very similar to the current process for tax purposes. We will file details with our regulators on how the lower corporate tax rate will benefit customers across all of our operating companies over the next several months.","We expect very minor impacts from tax reform on our bottom line in 2018. There will be a smaller tax shield from interest on our parent debt, but that will largely be offset with other items. We project an effective tax rate in 2018 of between 23.5 to 24.5%. We also project paying federal and state income taxes of between $100 million and $120 million in 2018, and unlike most or some of our peers, we were a cash taxpayer in 2017 as well. ","Over the longer term, phasing out the impact of bonus depreciation beginning this year and the build-up of new deferred income taxes at a lower rate will lead to rate base growth at a more rapid rate since accumulated deferred income tax balances are used in all our regulatory jurisdictions as offsets to rate base. ","Turning to Slide 23 and recent regulatory developments, at the beginning of this month we implemented new rate schedules for our Massachusetts electric utilities, including the initial impact of the tax reform that I mentioned. The distribution rates for customers in Massachusetts actually declined by nearly $19 million. As a result of the Massachusetts rate decision, the Mass Department of Public Utilities approved the merger of Western Mass Electric into nSTAR Electric effective at December 31, so you will no longer see standalone Western Mass financial statements. The order also approved full revenue decoupling, an inflation-based adjustment mechanism that will allow modest annual increases at the beginning of each year for the next four years, beginning in 2019, and a 10% ROE. The rate decision also approved $45 million for the initial build-out of electric vehicle infrastructure and another $55 million to build battery storage on Cape Cod and Martha\u2019s Vineyard, both over the next five years. ","Turning to Slide 24, in Connecticut we reached our first settlement of a CL&P rate case in about 30 years, as Jim mentioned. The settlement with the Office of Consumer Counsel and the prosecutorial unit of PURA was filed with the Commission last month and hearings on the settlement were held this month. The settlement terms call for a 9.25% authorized ROE with 53% equity. WE are hopeful that the settlement, which includes a resiliency tracker will allow us to avoid new distribution rate filings for a full four-year period. A draft decision on the settlement is scheduled for next month with a final decision on April 18. New rates would be effective May 1.","In both Massachusetts and Connecticut, we believe we were able to achieve constructive outcomes. We were able to demonstrate a strong ability to provide outstanding customer service reliability while also effectively controlling our costs. On average as I mentioned, our O&M overall has declined by more than 4% annually since our merger was consummated nearly six years ago, including a reduction of about 3.5% in 2017. Our reliability and safety metrics are also solidly in the top quartile of our industry peers as we achieved our best-ever operating performance in 2017. These constructive rate case outcomes allow us and enable us to continue to drive high levels of performance for our customers.","Turning to Slide 25, we and the other New England transmission owners continue to litigate the fourth transmission ROE complaint before the FERC. Hearings were held in December and an ALJ recommendation is due next month; meanwhile, we are awaiting a ruling from the commissioners on how they will address the court-ordered remand of their decision in the first complaint, as well as initial rulings in the second and third complaints. Our results and our guidance reflect the current 10.57% base ROE the FERC approved four years ago when it decided the first complaint.","Turning to Slide 26, at the same time we are completing our New Hampshire generation divestiture, we concluded the purchase of Aquarion, moving out of a regulated business line with a declining rate base and into a business line with growth opportunities. Beginning in 2018, we\u2019ll report Aquarion earnings as a separate business segment. At the end of 2017, its rate base, about 90% of which is from its Connecticut operations, totaled about $770 million. We expect that rate base will grow by 6 to 7% organically primarily through connecting new customers, replacing older pipes, and embarking on a new five-year project to move additional water supplies into the growing Stamford-Greenwich area. ","In addition, in Massachusetts for Aquarion, we have filed for an infrastructure capital tracker to accelerate main replacement and other reliability improvements. We are proposing to use the deferred income tax flow-back to fund these investments and mitigate the rate impacts to customers. ","Aquarion\u2019s capital expenditures are projected to total $100 million this year, rising to $125 million by 2021. Additionally, we expect Aquarion to continue to grow through future acquisitions of smaller water systems. Aquarion had added about 11,000 customers through 2011 through 17 acquisitions totaling 67 separate, relatively small water systems. All of these acquisitions were in Connecticut with one minor exception. The full purchase price of all of these acquisitions is currently reflected in rates. Aquarion has another four small water company acquisitions currently pending before the Connecticut utility regulators. ","Aquarion has an impressive track record for outstanding customer service. It\u2019s JD Power scores consistently rank at the top of the water utility industry, and it\u2019s viewed as one of the top places to work in Connecticut. It\u2019s also a great fit for us in support of our longer term growth and environmental goals.","Before turning the call back to Jeff, I\u2019ll turn it to Slide 27. In December, S&P raised its corporate credit rating on the Eversource system to A-plus, meaning that we are now two notches above any of our electric utility peer holding companies. Last month, Moody\u2019s also commented favorably on our Connecticut rate settlement.","Just to summarize on Slide 28, we\u2019re a company that has a very long history of delivering on our commitments and a very strong track record. Our earnings and dividend growth have outperformed the industry, and as Jim pointed out, our total shareholder return has significantly outperformed the industry over many time periods. Our ability to reduce costs since the merger by 4 to 5% each year while also at the same time providing improved and top tier service also sets us apart. Our credit ratings have been raised repeatedly over the past five years, attesting to our strong focus on financial condition. We continue to invest in our electric transmission and distribution infrastructure and we are rapidly replacing older natural gas pipes and connecting new customers. Finally, we are a close partner with our states and communities, executing on important clean energy initiatives. Our 8,000 talented employees will work in lockstep with our nearly 4 million customers, providing great customer service to ensure their and our future success.","I guess in recap, our major takeaway from this morning is we continue to work on siting and building Northern Pass for all the benefits that have been described for what it brings to New Hampshire and the region. We are confident in our ability to achieve our 5 to 7% long-term earnings growth rate. We have a plan to do that - this will be achieved with an $11 billion capital plan which is an 8.1% rate base CAGR, of which just 1.5% is from Northern Pass, so we have confidence that we\u2019ll be in the 5 to 7% range in either scenario. Long term electric distribution rate plans are now in effect in Massachusetts and expected to be approved in the near future in Connecticut for implementation in May. We have a long track record of being an excellent utility system operator, effectively managing, controlling, and I\u2019d say reducing costs and providing very high levels of reliability. We have a strong balance sheet, one that supports a tremendous amount of optionality to address new opportunities as they arise. Finally, we are not significantly impacted by tax reform. Our customers will reap the benefits of lower tax rates and our credit profile will remain strong, and additionally we have no need to issue equity related to tax reform.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Jeff.","Jeffrey Kotkin","Thank you, Phil, and I\u2019m going to turn it back to Vanessa just to remind you how to enter your questions. Vanessa?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions]","Jeffrey Kotkin","Thank you, Vanessa. Our first question this morning is from Shar Pourezza from Guggenheim. Good morning, Shar.","Shar Pourezza","Good morning, guys. Phil and Jim and everyone, let me just bring this point again - without Northern Pass, you are comfortable with 5 to 7% growth, with or without this project, so in light of what you\u2019re seeing with the rate base jump on Slide 20, how does the growth look with Northern Pass, because you seem to be comfortable without it at 5 to 7%, so I\u2019m curious if Northern Pass does move forward, where you do land within your growth rate? Then as you think about your trajectory post how you\u2019re guiding, is there enough projects for you to continue to be able to reiterate the 5 to 7%, given what seems to be perpetual infrastructure needs?","Phil Lembo","Right. So I guess--you know, with anything, Shar, there\u2019s many factors that influence where you end up in the range, and certainly with Northern Pass in there, that\u2019s more infrastructure investment; without Northern Pass, that\u2019s a little less infrastructure investment. So just be definition, that would probably put you higher in any calculation range.","But you know, you have capital plans. We\u2019ve demonstrated the ability over many years to add or find needed reliability projects. I think I\u2019ve been asked in the past, where is our list of projects to pull out, and my answer is always, there\u2019s not a list, it\u2019s dependent upon the reliability needs of the region, and we feel that we are in the best position to address them. We\u2019re good at identifying and moving those projects forward, so I feel confident that that will continue moving forward.","We have a great team in place to do that, and as each of these projects goes in, it improves the reliability and helps lower costs to customers, so you have that. You have an ability to control costs that moves you around in the range. You could have rate case outcomes. Certainly our set Massachusetts case and hopefully soon we\u2019ll have approval in Connecticut, certainly provides a nice strong, consistent framework that you can count on, but there\u2019s always other rate decisions - we talked about the FERC decision that\u2019s pending out there. So we\u2019re comfortable for all those reasons that we\u2019ll be in that range.","Shar Pourezza","Okay, good. That\u2019s helpful. Just on Aquarion, Connecticut regulators clearly highlighted to us that they were big fans of the transaction, so they touted it several times. There are roughly 31 regulated water utilities that are within the state, so I\u2019m curious how you\u2019re thinking about inorganic opportunities when it comes to water, within the state or outside.","Jim Judge","Shar, this is Jim. I\u2019d just say that we just closed on this transaction two months ago, and we continue to like the company that we acquired. We continue to like the water platform and the growth opportunities, whether it\u2019s growing up small communities or municipals, which they continue to do, looking at larger transactions potentially, even public water companies that are out there, so I think that there\u2019s plenty of growth opportunity. ","What you need to keep in mind is this is a company, Eversource, that I think has a long track record of doing deals that are smart for our shareholders, so we will be deliberate about what we do in terms of our next transaction, always with the shareholders\u2019 interest in mind. ","It\u2019s a very fragmented space, as you indicated. There\u2019s something like 50,000 water companies, entities nationwide, so a lot of opportunity for rolling up additional companies and creating some standardization and efficiencies.","Shar Pourezza","Got it, that\u2019s helpful. If you don\u2019t mind me asking one last one, thoughts on the competitive process for wind going into the RFP without Northern Pass. What I\u2019m asking is if Northern Pass ends up going to someone, one of your neighbors for instance, because Massachusetts can\u2019t wait for New Hampshire, does that actually indirectly position Eversource better for the next Massachusetts RFP? I\u2019m sort of--you\u2019re sort of like the home team and you could be left without any skin in the game, so how should we be thinking about this as an indirect read through the RFPs?","Jim Judge","I think we\u2019ve always claimed that Northern Pass was not dependent upon any specific RFP. You get a sense from our comments earlier and statements that you read coming from policy makers in the region that there\u2019s a tremendous appetite for clean energy solutions in the region. We were thrilled to see the evaluation in Massachusetts conclude that the Northern Pass project was the most advanced and low-cost alternative out of the 46 that were bid, so that tells us that we\u2019ve got a very attractive project. There are about 20 major permits that are necessary for a project like Northern Pass, and we literally are down to the final two or three, so I think from a--including the two and a half years for a Canadian approval, so we have a project that is very advanced, very cost effective for customers. It was proven that way in the competitive solicitation, so there will be an opportunity interest in receiving power over that line. It\u2019s just that we need to obviously make sure that we address the conditions and concerns that continue to exist in New Hampshire. Our goal would be that the re-hearing would give us an opportunity to do that.","Shar Pourezza","Thanks very much, guys. Appreciate it.","Jeffrey Kotkin","Thanks Shar. Next question is from Caroline Bone with Deutsche Bank. Good morning, Caroline.","Caroline Bone","Hey, good morning guys. On Northern Pass again, just to follow up on that, is there going to be any waiting here for a final written order, and how quickly do you expect the reconsideration process to go?","Lee Olivier","Caroline, this is Lee. We would expect to file for reconsideration very soon, and the SEC essentially identified three areas that they believe were deficient. We will file in our reconsideration with cures that we believe would resolve their deficiencies, and that should take place over the next 10 days.","Caroline Bone","You mean, when you actually file--","Lee Olivier","Yes.","Caroline Bone","--or when they respond, sorry?","Lee Olivier","They have 10 days. Once we file, they have 10 days to respond.","Caroline Bone","Okay, so even if you guys file something new with these cures, would they have to respond to that in 10 days? I guess the response could be something like, interesting - we\u2019ll continue to look at this, or will they have to give you a decision?","Lee Olivier","What they do is they have to acknowledge whether they accept our reconsideration motion or not, and then once they accept the reconsideration motion, then they would put together a schedule.","Caroline Bone","Okay, got it. Then just back to Lee, you mentioned that you were working with--and this is on, I guess, a gas pipeline solution, that you were working with stakeholders in DC and New England. What sort of solutions are under discussion, and are you still focused on Access Northeast or is there another project you might be working on too?","Lee Olivier","Yes, I mean, I think the big picture on this one is that there is a growing emergence of leadership in the region, obviously ISO New England but particularly key stakeholders inside of Massachusetts that realize that gas is not the enemy, gas is part of a solution, and if you want to ensure reliability and keep costs down and integrate renewables, then you want more gas, which is why we put those slides in there. As I\u2019m sure you know, all you have to go do is look at Texas, which is the fastest growing economy in the U.S. - energy use is going up, costs are going down, and carbon is going down, so the integration of renewables, particularly wind and gas, provide that certainty about the economic future of the region. ","So again, in terms of projects, clearly it has to be a brownfield project. Our Access Northeast project was essentially mostly brownfield. We are looking at that to make that even more compatible and to have less of an impact on the environmental footprint that we have here in New England.","Caroline Bone","But how do you get around the issue around how it gets paid for? How are you addressing the issues that you ran into in the past?","Lee Olivier","There\u2019s two paths there. Obviously there\u2019s the state pass inside of Massachusetts, where you need legislation. We have ongoing litigation in New Hampshire that we believe could resolve that issue at the Supreme Court, and then there\u2019s always the federal path. It\u2019s a longer, more complex path, but there is the federal path through FERC and ISO New England to put in place a tariff that would ensure sufficient fuel supplies and reliability. So there\u2019s two paths there. The state path I think clearly is more preferable just from the timing standpoint, so we continue to work both. Jim has met with FERC commissioners and FERC staff recently to discuss this issue, so there is just this growing awareness that something has to get done, and we continue to help to provide really information that is educational, that really gets people to understand gas is part of the solution, not the problem.","Caroline Bone","Okay, thank you. Maybe just one last minor one on--I think Phil mentioned that you expected to pay $100 million to $120 million in federal cash taxes in 2018. How does that compare to your expected book taxes?","Phil Lembo","For 2018, Caroline?","Caroline Bone","Yes, I\u2019m just wondering, that seems low. I guess I would have expected your book taxes to be higher. I mean, what\u2019s allowing you to defer federal cash? Do you guys have some sort of NOLs or credits that might be driving the difference, or maybe I\u2019m just calculating it wrong?","Phil Lembo","Just regular timing differences that we expect the book to be higher, Caroline.","Caroline Bone","Okay, all right. Thanks very much.","Jeffrey Kotkin","Thanks Caroline. Next question is from Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs. Good morning, Michael. ","Michael Lapides","Hey guys, good morning. Two questions. One, if the New Hampshire Site and Evaluation Committee does not selection Northern Pass after the reconsideration process, how do you think about the use of that capital that frees up on the balance sheet, given you wouldn\u2019t be making the capex tied to NPT?","Phil Lembo","Michael, I think what we\u2019ve always talked about and I would still say, that we\u2019d look first to redeploy that into infrastructure investments. We talked about that over the last year or so in terms of if we had cash, and we\u2019d use cash from the proceeds from the generation sales to invest in infrastructure with our Aquarion water transaction. So our first look would be to develop additional regulated infrastructure. ","Jim Judge","Michael, this is Jim. I think as Phil\u2019s comments earlier mentioned that the four-year plan without Northern Pass, if you adjust out Northern Pass, it\u2019s actually a higher capital plan than what we had a year ago, so we found some projects there. I mean, if what you\u2019re getting at, would you possibly use it for a share buyback, that is obviously an option that we have. We\u2019re not announcing it. We don\u2019t think that we need it necessarily to hit the 5%, but it\u2019s a nice tool to have given our extremely strong balance sheet and our credit rating. So I think we have a lot of optionality in terms of how we can deliver, as we have in the past, on our guidance.","Michael Lapides","Right, thank you for that, Jim. That actually falls into my next question, which was how do you think about what the right credit rating is for a company of your risk profile? How do you go through that quantitative analysis of what\u2019s the optimal credit rating for Eversource?","Jim Judge","We don\u2019t actually have as a target an optimal credit rating. I think the recent [indiscernible] tax reform has sort of indicated that a lot of companies probably wish they hadn\u2019t levered as much as they had. We\u2019re fortunate to be sitting where we are - no equity issuances needed going forward. What we have offered in the past is top tier financial performance, and certainly the total shareholder slide that we have indicates that we\u2019ve been able to achieve that. Coupled with that top tier financial performance is the number one financial condition, our lowest risk it the industry. That\u2019s an offering that we continue to have and we\u2019ve enjoyed and our shareholders have enjoyed, having that balance of a strong financial condition along with the performance. ","So clearly--you know, do we need to be an A-plus, two notches removed from the next best credit in the industry? Probably not, but we\u2019ve been able to sustain that while putting up the earnings, dividend and share price growth. It\u2019s a long answer there, but basically we don\u2019t have a targeted minimum credit rating that we\u2019re striving for. We\u2019re going to continue to maintain a very strong financial condition while we put up good numbers.","Michael Lapides","Got it. Last item, and I hope Jeff doesn\u2019t kill me for asking three instead of two, how do you--Jim, how do you and how does the board think about the environment for utility sector M&A, given a, higher rates and therefore potentially higher cost of debt; b, the impact of tax reform and really what it\u2019s doing to your competitive balance sheet position versus other people\u2019s balance sheet positions; and c, the pullback we\u2019ve seen a little bit in the equity of utility stocks?","Jim Judge","Yes, I guess it\u2019d be situation specific. I think our board is thrilled with the outcome of the merger between Northeast Utilities and eNSTAR. I think we\u2019ve exceeded their expectations. I think the water acquisition continues to pay dividends and is an accretive transaction, so we have a balance sheet and a currency that will continue to be strong. But again, we have been a very, very disciplined player in that realm and will continue to be. It\u2019ll be, as I said earlier, transactions that are in our shareholders\u2019 best interests rather than just growing for growth\u2019s sake.","Michael Lapides","Got it. Thank you, Jim. Much appreciated, guys.","Jeffrey Kotkin","Thank you, Michael. Next question is from Paul Patterson at Glenrock. Good morning, Paul.","Paul Patterson","Good morning. A lot of my questions have been answered, but just back to Northern Pass, what\u2019s the viability of Northern Pass without the Massachusetts RFP?","Lee Olivier","Well you know, as Jim said earlier, Paul - this is Lee, we believe Northern Pass will be viable because if you look at the region and the region\u2019s goals around carbon reduction and renewable energy, and here we are with essentially almost all of the permits complete - again, almost 20 permits, we really are down to the SEC permit and the Army Corps of Engineer permit comes after that, so we\u2019ll have a project that will essentially be ready to go; however, obviously we need the SEC siting. So we believe just looking at the Connecticut energy strategy, and if you go look at the draft bills that are inside the Massachusetts senate, all of them call for more hydro, more renewable energy, so there will be a home, as we\u2019ve said many times in the past, for Northern Pass. We just have to figure out what the timing of that is.","Paul Patterson","Okay, so assuming that the NH SEC may not get back to you before the 27th and they go with whatever it is - the New England Clean Power Link, whatever it is, they go with the alterative, Massachusetts does, what would happen in that scenario? Would you guys continue, would you start construction and everything if after that you got the New Hampshire Site Evaluation Committee--in other words, if the NH SEC gave approval after the Massachusetts RFP had been selected, had gone with somebody else, would you guys proceed with construction and what have you, or how would things proceed in that situation?","Jim Judge","Paul, this is Jim. Remember we have a partner here in Hydro Quebec. Hydro Quebec has expressed publicly a number of times their interest in exporting more energy in particular into the region. I think they would be interested in doing three Northern Passes, so as long as they continue to look to grow their bottom line by exports to New England, they would be interested in continuing with the project, so we can\u2019t sort of speak independently about what that would look like if the Mass RFP went by the boards.","Keep in mind that projects that are being considered for that Mass clean energy RFP still have a long way to go, including the beginning of the process on the other side of the border that took us two and a half years to get the Quebec approval. So I don\u2019t think we need to address that contingency now, other than to say that we\u2019ve got a project that\u2019s cost effective, we\u2019ve proved that in the Mass energy RFP, and we have a partner in Hydro Quebec that\u2019s very committed and interested in exporting hydro power to our region, so that bodes well for this project going forward.","Paul Patterson","Okay, then just finally, I apologize if I missed this, what was the weather-adjusted sales growth for 2017?","Phil Lembo","For electric, Paul?","Paul Patterson","Yes, for electric. Yes.","Phil Lembo","It was slightly negative - you know, less than 1%.","Paul Patterson","Okay. Thanks again, guys. Hang in there.","Jeffrey Kotkin","Thank you, Paul. Our next question is from Greg Gordon from Evercore ISI. Good morning, Greg.","Unknown Analyst","Hey Jeff, it\u2019s actually [indiscernible] on for Greg. Good morning. ","Jeffrey Kotkin","Hi, how are you?","Unknown Analyst","Good, excellent. Just wanted to follow up, I think you stated this in your prepared remarks, but the rate base on Northern Pass is roughly 1.5, 1.6 billion, right, and then the new rate base for 2020 with the tax reform and all the capex is roughly 2 billion higher, so are we thinking about this the right way, that basically the reason why you\u2019re still comfortable with your 5 to 7% is essentially you have a 2 billion higher rate base number on the back of capex and tax reform, so even if you don\u2019t go ahead with Northern Pass, you can still hit your \u201920 rate base numbers and your 5 to 7% earnings score? Is that the right way to put it?","Jeffrey Kotkin","Yes, it is. That\u2019s the correct way to look at it.","Unknown Analyst","Excellent, thank you.","Jeffrey Kotkin","All right, thank you. Next question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America. Good morning, Julien.","Josephine Moore","Good morning, it\u2019s actually Josephine here. How are you guys?","Jeffrey Kotkin","Hi Josephine. ","Josephine Moore","I know we\u2019ve talked a lot about the Northern Pass already, but I was just curious how much Northern Pass earnings, if you do see it, is in the 2018 guidance?","Phil Lembo","What we\u2019ve said is--I think Lee mentioned in his remarks, if everything were to progress during the year, there might be a small amount of capex, $300 million or so, started in 2018, there\u2019s probably a few cents related to AFUDC related to that.","Josephine Moore","Okay, then could you comment on where ROEs are trending at Public Service New Hampshire and Yankee Gas after this cold winter, and your thoughts on going in for a rate case on those jurisdictions?","Phil Lembo","Yes, so we have not announced any plans to go in, but we do have-- I mentioned in my remarks that in each of the jurisdictions, we\u2019re looking to develop plans to--how we\u2019re going to credit back the ADIT to customers, so that could be an opportunity that during those--during that process, that those two things could be tied together, but we don\u2019t have plans there. I would say that they\u2019re trending close to their allowed--they're probably under-performing just slightly in both those areas. Neither one of those have decoupled rates - that would be something that we\u2019d look to do if we went in. Certainly in New Hampshire where we\u2019re divesting of the generating assets, it makes sense at some point in the not-too-distant future to make sure all the rates are re-coordinated, that reflects the absence of generation.","Josephine Moore","Great. Then just one last question - I know it\u2019s late here already, could you just comment on where your FFO to debt metrics are currently and how much latitude there is for any transactions or returns of capital to shareholders? ","Phil Lembo","Sure. The FFO metrics for our rating, we deliver in the high teens, so that\u2019s where those metrics are. So as Jim said, the balance sheet has capacity for optionality, and we could take advantage of that, but they're in the high teens, above the target ranges.","Josephine Moore","Got it, okay. That\u2019s all on my end. Thank you very much.","Jeffrey Kotkin","Thanks Josephine. One more question, and I think he\u2019s still online. Is Praful Mehta from Citi still on the line? I think that\u2019s probably a no. So alright, with that, we don\u2019t have any more questions. Thank you for joining us this morning. I know we went over a bit, but if you have any follow-up, please give us a call this afternoon. Take care.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference.

Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Jeffrey Kotkin. You may begin.","Jeffrey R. Kotkin - Eversource Energy","Thank you, Christine. Good morning and thank you for joining us. I'm Jeff Kotkin, Eversource Energy's Vice President for Investor Relations. As you can see on Slide 1, some of the statements made during this investor call, may be forward-looking as defined within the meaning of the Safe Harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.","These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations, and are subject to risk and uncertainty, which may cause the actual results to differ materially from forecasts and projections. Some of these factors are set forth in the news release issued yesterday. Additional information about the various factors that may cause actual results to differ can be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, and the 10-Q for the three months ended June 30, 2017.","Additionally, our explanation of how and why we use certain non-GAAP measures is contained within our news release and the slides we posted last night on our web site under Presentations and Webcasts, and in our most recent 10-K.","Turning to Slide 2, speaking today will be Phil Lembo, our Executive Vice President and CFO; and Lee Olivier, our Executive Vice President for Enterprise Energy Strategy and Business Development. Also joining us today are Jay Buth, our Vice President and Controller; John Moreira, our Vice President of Financial Planning and Analysis; and Christine Vaughan, our Treasurer and Vice President for Regulatory.","Now, I will turn to Slide 3 and turn over the call to Phil.","Phil Lembo - Eversource Energy","Thank you, Jeff. Today, I'll cover our third quarter and year-to-date financial results, the status of key regulatory dockets, the status of our Aquarion Water Company transaction, and give an update on our capital plan and several of the transmission projects.","So, let's turn to our quarterly financial results on Slide 3. Earnings were $0.82 per share in the third quarter of 2017 compared to $0.83 per share in 2016. The primary drivers of our results were higher Electric Transmission earnings, being offset by lower Electric Distribution results.","Our Transmission segment earned $0.31 per share in the third quarter of 2017, compared with $0.28 per share in the third quarter of 2016. The primary driver here for these earnings was higher transmission rate base. We've invested $600 million in our transmission system this year through September and our transmission capital plan for the year is just under $1 billion.","On the Electric Distribution side, we earned $0.50 per share in the third quarter of 2017. This compares to earnings of $0.53 per share in 2016. This decrease was primarily due to lower sales, reflecting much milder weather we experienced in July and August this year compared to 2016. This primarily impacted NSTAR Electric and our New Hampshire -- Public Service of New Hampshire operation, neither of which has yet to implement revenue decoupling.","In Boston, for example, cooling degree days were down nearly 34% in the third quarter of 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. This is nearly 8% below normal in terms of cooling degree days for the third quarter. And not only was it mild overall in the summer, but additionally, we never really had a hot stretch of weather or a heat wave, so to speak. So, peak loads were modest and demand-related revenue also declined.","So in addition to lower electric revenues, we recorded higher property tax, depreciation and interest expense in the quarter. We're able to offset much of these impacts with our continued success in controlling our cost. Lower non-tracked O&M cost added $0.02 per share to our third quarter results.","On the Natural Gas Distribution side, we lost $0.02 per share in the third quarter of 2017, which was comparable to last year. The Eversource Parent and Other, we earned $0.03 per share in the third quarter, and this compares to earnings of $0.04 per share in 2016. The decline was primarily due to higher interest expense resulting from higher levels of debt and higher interest rates on short-term debt, reflecting the impact of recent Fed interest rate hikes.","Turning from the third quarter to the nine-month results, we earned $2.36 per share for the first nine months of 2017, compared with $2.24 per share last year. Improved results were due to higher Transmission earnings, improved results at the Parent, and lower O&M cost. In fact, lower O&M costs added $0.06 per share to our year-to-date results.","For the full year, we expect to earn between $3.05 and $3.20 per share. And for the long-term, we continue to project 5% to 7% long-term EPS growth. We are pleased with our results to-date and remain comfortable with our 2017 guidance, although I'd like to see some very cold weather in November and December and that would really help us reach the higher end of our earnings range for 2017.","From the financial side, I'd now turn to our regulatory activity on Slide 4 and start with our New Hampshire generation divestiture, which is moving along very well. On October 12, we submitted to the New Hampshire Public Utility Commission two purchase and sales agreements for the sale of our remaining generation assets in New Hampshire for a total purchase price of $258 million. The New Hampshire PUC has opened the docket to review these contracts with approval expected before the end of this year. We continue to expect a closing by the end of the year or very early next year, with securitization activities to follow soon thereafter.","The book value currently on PSNH generating assets, including fuel and inventory, totals approximately $770 million as of the end of September. Under the New Hampshire PUC approved settlement, we will recover through securitization our investment in the plants that's not collected through the sale process. After completion of these transactions and implementation of market-based competitive solicitations for power for our New Hampshire customers, we expect overall energy supply rates to decline going forward.","Turning to Slide 5 and our current distribution rate case activity. As many of you know, hearings and briefings are now complete on our Massachusetts Electric rate case. This has been a very comprehensive case with our proposed merger of NSTAR Electric and WMECO. The movement of NSTAR Electric on to revenue decoupling, proposals for performance-based ratemaking and expansion of our vegetation management program, some significant rate design changes and our grid modernization proposal, including $145 million for energy storage and electric vehicle support expenditures. We're pleased with how the case went and the case that we presented, and look forward to decision by the end of November with new rates taking effect early next year.","In Connecticut, we filed a letter of intent last week stating that later, in November, we'll file a general rate case for CL&P supporting a three-year plan. This case is required by our 2012 merger settlement. The increases we're requesting are being driven largely by higher depreciation, property and other tax expense, much of which relates to the hundreds of millions of dollars we invest annually in Connecticut distribution system that helps achieve top-tier results for customers. This case continues to reflect our ability to move our electric performance higher, while controlling costs for our customers.","From a state regulation, I'll turn to Slide 6 and the various New England transmission ROE dockets before FERC. As you may recall, on April 14 of this year, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals vacated and remanded FERC's 2014 order that lowered the base ROE for the New England Transmission Owners from 11.14% to 10.57%. In early June, the region's transmission owners, including Eversource, filed with the FERC to revert back to the ROE that was approved by the FERC nearly a decade ago which had a base ROE of 11.14%.","FERC did not accept our request last month stating that changes to the billed ROEs now would complicate the computation of any surcharges or refunds or changes once a final decision is issued. As a result, we made no changes to our rates and continue to bill and recognize revenues based on a 10.57% base ROE, until we receive a new order from FERC.","Next, on Slide 7, our pending transaction involving Aquarion Water Company. This also is moving along very well. Regulators in Connecticut and New Hampshire and all relevant federal agencies have signed off on the transaction. As a result, we'll be able to close the transaction once we receive approval from the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities. We have completed all the hearings and briefings before the DPU and are awaiting a decision. We expect to close the transaction before year end.","On Slide 8, we profile our four largest reliability projects underway in our system. We expect all of these projects to be completed in 2019, and we've made considerable progress to date with 28 of the 55 projects associated with Greater Boston and Greater Hartford, those being already in service.","We continue to review our 2018 capital budget. As you know, we'll discuss that in detail in February. But during the last earnings call in July, I noted that we expect to offset some of the revisions to the Northern Pass time line through increased investments in our electric, natural gas and water distribution systems, such that our capital budget would likely remain approximately $2.8 billion.","Since then, we've also identified about $100 million of additional reliability-related electric transmission investments across our service territory that we would expect to complete in 2018. This investment will allow us to further improve transmission reliability and harden our system.","We're also making significant progress on our Massachusetts solar initiative. As many of you know in August of this year, legislation allowing us to build 62 megawatts of solar was amended to provide an additional two years to complete the facilities. As a result and to lower cost for our customers, we adjusted our construction schedule such that a small amount of capital spending for the solar program will take place in 2018 rather than 2017. Approximately 50 megawatts are now under construction, with the remaining 12 megawatts, we'll go into construction by the end of this year. Moreover, we remain well within our $200 million budget.","Finally, turning to financing, in early October, Eversource Parent issued $450 million each in a five-year and seven-year notes with yields of about 2.50% and 2.94%, respectively. The spreads on these debt issuances were amongst the lowest we've seen for parent paper in the industry and we think that speaks volumes to our high credit quality. The generation divestiture, the Aquarion acquisition should continue to solidify the attractive business risk position assigned to us by the credit agencies.","Before I turn the call over to Lee, I want to take a moment to discuss the severe wind and rain storm that struck the Northeast Sunday night into Monday morning. The near hurricane force winds resulted in hundreds of broken poles, dozens of downed transformers and many miles of downed wires. Across New England, approximately 1.3 million electric customers lost power. In our service territory, New Hampshire was the hardest hit with more than 60% of all customers out of power at some point.","While our restoration efforts are largely complete in Massachusetts and Connecticut, and they are progressing well in New Hampshire, I just want to recognize the tireless efforts of our employees and thank our customers for their patience. We'll see many of you on this call at the EEI Financial Conference next week. So, making this call somewhat briefer than last quarter.","But now, I'll turn the call over to Lee.","Leon J. Olivier - Eversource Energy","Thanks, Phil. I'll provide you with an update on Northern Pass, and then turn the call back to Jeff for Q&As. Slide 9 highlights the progress we are making on Northern Pass, cross-examination of our witnesses wrapped up in the early October timeframe, and the hearings are now focused on intervenor witnesses. Our witnesses made a highly compelling case for the New Hampshire Site Evaluation Committee to approve the project as we have proposed it, with 60 miles of underground cables and 132 miles of overhead lines.","They have discussed all the steps we have made to minimize the physical impact of Northern Pass, while at the same time preserving the economic viability of a project that will bring billions of dollars of benefits to the state. We're now nearly halfway through the cross-examination of intervenor witnesses. Once the cross-examination is complete and the record is closed, intervenors will have 14 days to file their final briefs on the project, and we will have another seven days to file ours.","Then, the seven members of the New Hampshire SEC Committee that have been assigned to review the Northern Pass project will vote. A simple majority is necessary to approve Northern Pass. The subcommittee has targeted a vote no later than February 28, 2018 but it could take place sooner. After the vote, the New Hampshire SEC staff council will prepare a written decision consistent with the majority position, which the SEC has scheduled for no later than March 31, 2018.","We consider the New Hampshire SEC schedule to be supportive of the project receiving all of the approvals necessary to commence construction in the second quarter of 2018. In addition to the SEC permit, we need to secure a Presidential Permit from the U.S. Department of Energy. The DOE issued the Final Environmental Impact Statement on Northern Pass in August. In issuing the Final EIS, DOE stated \"The proposed DOE action in the Final EIS is to issue a Presidential Permit to the applicant, Northern Pass LLC, to construct, operate, maintain and connect a new electric transmission line across the U.S.-Canada border in northern New Hampshire.\"","We are now awaiting the Record of Decision and the Presidential Permit from the DOE, and expect both to be issued this year. The project requires two federal permits, two additional ones. And we have made significant progress on both, the U.S. Forest Service issued a Record of Decision two months ago that was supportive of the underground route that we've selected through the White Mountain National Forest. We expect a final order from the Forest Service before the end of this year. We also expect to receive a final permit from the Army Corps of Engineers by the end of the year.","On the state side, we achieved another important milestone yesterday, when we filed a settlement agreed on the terms of Northern Pass' lease with Public Service of New Hampshire for most of Northern Pass' 192-mile route. The settlement was reached with New Hampshire PUC staff and the Office of Consumer Advocate, the two principal intervenors in the case. We expect the New Hampshire PUC approval of the settlement by the end of the year. Taken together, we are very pleased with our current position in the siting process with significant progress being made in all venues.","Turning to Slide 10, we continue to expect our construction to commence by mid-2018 with completion in the third quarter of 2020. At that time, Northern Pass would be fully constructed and our operational testing would commence, allowing the project to enter service prior to the critical 2020-2021 winter period,. Supporting those time schedule of the firm fixed price contracts we have signed with our major suppliers and contractors, including ABB and Quanta Services. All parties involved in this project are primed and ready to commence work once we receive the final approvals.","Finally, before we begin Q&A, I will touch on Bay State Wind and our partner, which has the new corporate name called \u00d8rsted. We are preparing our bid into the Massachusetts offshore wind RFP, which is due December 20. Given the vast experience of \u00d8rsted in European offshore wind and our knowledge of New England markets and transmission, we believe we will be able to submit a highly compelling set of proposals for review by the evaluators.","Now, I'll turn the call back to Jeff for Q&A.","Jeffrey R. Kotkin - Eversource Energy","Thank you, Lee. And I'll return the call to Christine just to remind you how to enter your questions. Christine?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you.","Jeffrey R. Kotkin - Eversource Energy","Great. Thank you, Christine. Our first question this morning is from Mike Weinstein from Credit Suisse. Good morning, Mike.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi, good morning. Hi, Lee, would you mind talking a little bit about the SEC settlement \u2013 or not the SEC, but the New Hampshire Public Utility Commission settlement that you just arrived at. How significant is that for the project and how many miles of the line is covered by those Rights of Way? And also, at the SEC, what's your impression, I guess, now that the cross-examination of intervenor witnesses has started, what's your impression of their ability to delay the process in some way or get the vote done on time in February?","Leon J. Olivier - Eversource Energy","Yes. Hi, Mike, this is Lee. In regards to the Right of Way or essentially is all of the Right of Way with the exception of the underground and the Northern part which is a private lease on about 22 miles of land. So if you add the underground and then private lease, that's about 82 miles. So the rest of it is what remains of 193 miles. So it's very, very significant because obviously earlier the PUC approved Northern Pass as utility, and part of what they had to do to do that is to say that Northern Pass would be in the public good to become the utility in the state.","So this now giving us the rights to use the Right of Way where there is other existing PSNH or Eversource New Hampshire Rights of Way is very, very important, is one of the last major steps. It obviously, by the conclusion of that, again it lends the credence to the project itself because that will be approved by many of the same members that sit on the SEC. So we feel very good about that.","I would just say in regards to the SEC hearing, those meetings have proceeded very well. I think the SEC has been very judicious in terms of allowing opposing cross-examination and ensuring that the cross-examination is timely, it's constructive and is not meant to be essentially kind of jarring on or keeping the process going.","So I think, the SEC is determined and focused to bring this thing to a conclusion no later than earlier this year. And the schedule as we have right now would support all of the hearings being completed by the end of this year, early deliberations in first quarter, January timeframe, and then an oral vote and then a subsequent written decision.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Great. And in terms of the RFP outcome that's happening in January for the Massachusetts Clean Energy RFP, how significant is that for Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec's support, in your opinion, at this point?","Leon J. Olivier - Eversource Energy","Excuse me. Mike, could you repeat that last part?","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","How significant is the outcome of the Massachusetts Clean Energy RFP for Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec's support of the Northern Pass project?","Leon J. Olivier - Eversource Energy","We talk with Northern Pass on a regular basis. You know, their goal is to double the revenue and double their earnings over the course of the next 15 years and is to further increase imports into the U.S. predominantly, New England, which is their best market. They would like to, if possible, put three Northern Passes into New England. So they are very, very committed to this project. And if you look at this project, we're pretty much through the federal siting, we should have the Presidential permit by the end of this year or sooner.","The SEC process is moving along quite nicely. We have all the contracts laid out. We have an in-service date of by the end of 2020, that's at least two to three years before anybody else. And just looking up the Massachusetts RFP, provided in the RFP is additional credit if you will for projects that will end by the end of 2020, when the state has their mandate to reduce carbon by 20%.","And if you look at Northern Pass, it will take 25% of the carbon out of the electric sector inside of Massachusetts. And then, you have the siting on the Canadian side. We will have the siting on the Canadian side about the end of this year. The other projects that would cross into Canada will take another two to three years of siting in Canada.","So no other project that exists as far along as we are and has the certainty that we have around fixed price contracts with contractors and in-service dates that really meet the needs and goals of the Massachusetts clean air plan.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Thanks a lot, Lee.","Leon J. Olivier - Eversource Energy","Thanks, Mike.","Jeffrey R. Kotkin - Eversource Energy","Thanks, Mike. Next question is from Praful Mehta from Citi. Good morning, Praful.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi, Jeff. Thanks guys. So just following up a little bit on Northern Pass, in terms of the SEC approvals, I guess the timeline is moving well, but just wanted to understand what are the risks here? I mean is there any possibility of delay further or what if the decision doesn't go your way? In that case, what are the options you have at that point?","Leon J. Olivier - Eversource Energy","Yes. I would just say is there \u2013 the answer to the first part of your question, is there opportunity to delay further, I would say no. We have a very strong Governor in New Hampshire that supports this project. The legislature supports this project including the senior members of the legislature. The SEC Chairman has been very efficient and very judicious in the process, so we don't see any delays there. A number of the interveners had tried, previous litigation, it suits all of which have failed.","We think from a long experience with the SEC process that it's quite frankly long, it's very judicious, it's very comprehensive. But when it's complete, it has always withstood legal challenge and we believe so will the Presidential permit. So we do not see delays there. So I am very confident that we will get our decision, it will be in time for the three-state RFP and we will be successful inside of that RFP.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got you, all right. And you've talked about from a growth perspective right, the 5% to 7% you've had \u2013 the 5% to 7% growth platform through 2020. But you've also talked about like the $100 million of incremental transmission CapEx today. Is that helping your move to the upper end of that range? Is that just keeping it at the midpoint? And also wanted to understand what were the approvals required for that incremental transmission spend?","Phil Lembo - Eversource Energy","So the short answer to that is that's a total amount that helps to fill the gap that we had talked about earlier when Northern Pass changed its schedule, so that Northern Pass capital spending was moving out of $18 million and into $19 million and $20 million. So that's just one more element of the package that we've discussed that will support the capital spending plan in 2018 as Northern Pass moves over. So I'd say it just replaces that, it doesn't sort of enhance the number at this stage.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got you, thanks. And then finally in terms of Aquarion growth opportunities, what is that growth profile within your 5% to 7%, is that a higher growth profile versus the rest of the business, or is it similar?","Phil Lembo - Eversource Energy","It's similar, but a little bit on the higher end of that \u2013 of that range, so it does enhance the number.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got you. Thanks, guys.","Phil Lembo - Eversource Energy","All right, thank you.","Leon J. Olivier - Eversource Energy","Thanks, Praful.","Jeffrey R. Kotkin - Eversource Energy","Next question is from Travis Miller from Morningstar. Good morning, Travis.","Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Good morning. Thank you. Just a quick one here that $0.04 down on the retail electric revenues, how much or is all of that due to weather and if not what else is going on in that number?","Phil Lembo - Eversource Energy","No, that's pretty much due to weather. I mean if you looked at sort of normalized, it's down slightly, so I guess there's a little bit more going on there relating to energy efficiency, et cetera. But it's \u2013 as I said, we had 34% fewer cooling degree days in Boston. You know, that's \u2013 you know that versus the previous year, the previous year was pretty warm. So even versus normal, they were down 8%. So it was just a bad weather quarter and it really was the driver of that number.","Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Okay. That's all for now. I appreciate it.","Phil Lembo - Eversource Energy","Thank you.","Leon J. Olivier - Eversource Energy","All right.","Jeffrey R. Kotkin - Eversource Energy","Thanks Travis. Next question is from Jerimiah Booream from Bank of America. Welcome back.","Jerimiah Booream - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you, Jeff and hi everyone. Good morning.","Phil Lembo - Eversource Energy","Good morning.","Jerimiah Booream - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I just wanted to touch on the FERC decisions coming your way, do you have any idea of the timing for when you could see a revision to Opinion 531? And also, given that the NETOs have requested basically for all the complaints to be vacated. Is there a chance that that could come at the same time and do you have any insight into kind of the process at the FERC, does it seem like they're triaging some of the issues here?","Phil Lembo - Eversource Energy","Well, I think your last statement there is probably a good portrayal is that there probably is still some triaging going on above the highest priority items. And even though the FERC currently has a quorum, it's not filled out with all the commissioners. So, I think that predicting the timing of when we'd get a decision is probably not a good item for any of us to be doing. But I wouldn't expect that we would see something until 2018, if I had to guess so.","So, we've long looked for all of these to be handled together, and in fact a couple of the complaints were combined complaints 2 and 3, but then a complaint 4 came up. So we think that it really doesn't do anybody any good to keep pancaking these types of complaints over and over again for an investment that's 40-year, 50-year, 60-year investment. It does provide some uncertainty there. So that's the approach we'd like to take and that's why we filed it. But in terms of predicting when it will be decided, probably not in the very near-term, would be my guess.","Jerimiah Booream - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Yes, that's fair. And then just housekeeping question, is there any reason to think that you guys would have other rate cases coming up in any of your other jurisdictions that we haven't talked about already?","Phil Lembo - Eversource Energy","Well, the only ones that we've announced are the ones that I talked about today in terms of Massachusetts, and we filed a letter of intent in Connecticut. So we're always evaluating that. Some of the \u2013 as you can imagine, some of the rate cases are driven by what the returns are in those jurisdictions, some are triggered by regulatory agreements that we have, things like that. So the only ones that are on the table are the Massachusetts and the Connecticut electric ones.","Jerimiah Booream - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks very much.","Jeffrey R. Kotkin - Eversource Energy","Thanks, Jerimiah. Next question is from Caroline Bone from Deutsche Bank. Good morning, Caroline.","Caroline V. Bone - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, good morning, guys. So this is a follow-up on Northern Pass. So it does seem like you guys are pretty well positioned for the Massachusetts RFP. But are there any other RFPs in the pipe in the region, in which Northern Pass could participate in, if Massachusetts doesn't go your way?","Leon J. Olivier - Eversource Energy","Well. If you look at the region, Caroline, there is a number of states. I mean you've got Massachusetts, I mean Connecticut has 1,000 megawatts approximately of authorization, much of which could be hydro. They haven't gone out for an RFP for that.","Rhode Island has essentially an authorization of about 1,000 megawatts as well for clean energy. The Governor has a mandate to have that in service by 2020, which could probably be difficult, but at least there is an authorization there. They have just not initiated the RFPs on those yet.","So there are other authorizations and they're really awaiting RFPs, I think that's one of the reasons why, quite frankly, when we talk to the folks from Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec, they really feel that they could do three Northern Passes. They could do at least two more of them into the region.","And, of course, as the region moves forward and ISO New England will issue its fuel security report, that's a little bit held up because of the FERC NOPR around coal and nuclear. But when they issue that, I think that will lead to say that the region has to have more firm fuel, not only potentially gas, but hydro as well as the older plants, including nuclear retire over time.","Caroline V. Bone - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And so, I mean, do you know what's holding up Connecticut and Rhode Island, given I guess if Rhode Island has this target by 2020, why haven't they launched something?","Leon J. Olivier - Eversource Energy","I just think, in the case of Connecticut, they are shall we say they're busy with other issues.","Caroline V. Bone - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yes, I get Connecticut.","Leon J. Olivier - Eversource Energy","They're busy with other issues. Hopefully, get through those other issues, and they'll have a budget and they'll be able to move on. As you know, they also have a offshore wind authorization of 200 megawatts. We've talked to folks there. They say offshore wind is really a bright future for the state, not only because again it's close to load, but they have seaports there that could be very constructive, particularly New London, in servicing an offshore wind businesses.","They have essentially almost 800 megawatts of open access on the transmission system that interconnects from the Millstone facility into the 345 kV system into the region. That's really because Unit 1 was shut down. So they see a lot of opportunities. They're working through those opportunities. In regards to Rhode Island, I really can't speak for where they are. I really can't speak to that.","Caroline V. Bone - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, okay. And then, just maybe one last one and this one is for Phil. And I know you guys are going to provide guidance on the Q4 call, but I'm just wondering if you can at least talk to some preliminary drivers that we should be thinking about, particularly around the rate cases, Aquarion, all of these kind of moving pieces?","Phil Lembo - Eversource Energy","Well, without giving guidance that we're not going to give till February, that is a little difficult, Caroline. I mean, but I think that certainly the levers that we've talked about in the past with you and others in terms of our transmission growth and our ability to keep costs under control and a manageable level of rate expectations, I think those are \u2013 certainly a key assumption will be what kind of \u2013 the issue we talked about earlier, the FERC ROEs, how those get settled and what the rates on that are going forward.","So I think that we've spent a lot of time over the last couple years talking about the weather impact on our sales and whatnot, but the outcome of the Massachusetts rate case will remove a great part of that. I mean, we'll have most of our jurisdictions with electric and gas mostly de-coupled after this. So that I think removes a bit of sort of the variation and the risk on the sales side. So that might be a little bit easier prediction. So I mean, I think the drivers would be consistent. I think we still have a good pipeline of projects that we'll probably be able to discuss. And the key assumption I think would be maybe what comes out of the FERC ROE.","Caroline V. Bone - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And did you guys just say \u2013 one last follow-up on that, did you say what the weather versus normal impact has been year-to-date? Apologize if I missed that.","Phil Lembo - Eversource Energy","Well, we talked about it for the \u2013 I mean, for the quarter. So for the quarter, this past quarter is more about cooling. So we did talk about the quarter being down about 34% in terms of cooling, and it's off 7%, 8% in terms of normal. If you get into the rest of the year, then you've got to talk about heating and cooling. But about $0.03 would be the weather impact. If you added everything up for the year, weather has hurt us by about $0.03.","Caroline V. Bone - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Okay, that's helpful. Thanks so much.","Jeffrey R. Kotkin - Eversource Energy","Thanks, Caroline. Next question is from Paul Patterson from Glenrock. Good morning, Paul.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Good morning. So just to follow up on Northern Pass finally, I would agree that it's been a very lengthy process, certainly a lot of due process. What I was a little interested in was apparently there were some comments by the Vice Chair regarding, I guess, the differing economic analysis and sort of hinging on the capacity market scenarios.","And I was just wondering when we might get some clarity? I think that happened on Friday, when we might, I guess from what I read, my understanding is that that will be resolved hopefully shortly. Do we have any \u2013 will there be a document filed or anything that sort of goes over that issue?","Leon J. Olivier - Eversource Energy","Paul, this is Lee. No, we're working with our partner HQ on that, and HQ has already made a statement that they have extensive experience in the forward capacity markers. They have ongoing conversations with ISO New England and the Market Monitor. They are confident they will be able to receive capacity credit.","The line is designed and built without any additional upgrades. 400% deliverability could get over 800 megawatts, would be entitled to over 800 megawatts of capacity. And so, I think really the plan here is to take that and reinforce that statement. And then early next year, we would -HQ would notify ISO of their intent to enter into capacity markets.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay, awesome. That's great to hear. And then on the sales growth, just to follow-up on Travis' question, what was the sales normalized \u2013 the normalized sales growth year-to-date on electric?","Phil Lembo - Eversource Energy","Just about 1% down.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And then finally on the transmission, we haven't seen any big \u2013 any of these big cases fully litigated, but we have seen some settlements. I'm sure you guys are aware of them on transmission ROE, base ROE and the adder. How should we think about those or how do you guys think about \u2013 how should we think about those in the context of what \u2013 with respect to what might happen with the transmission rate case for New England?","Phil Lembo - Eversource Energy","Well, I think that, just part of the general FERC process, Paul, is there is settlement discussions you know always as a first step and as an effort to reach agreement. So obviously we've gone through those steps in these processes and hadn't been able to do that. So we're -- our track record is if something is reasonable and we think it's in everybody's best interest, settlements are certainly something we're open to, but they have to be a reasonable outcome. And as I said, they're generally part \u2013 they're part of the general process in the FERC proceedings, and so we engage with others on an ongoing basis there.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. But the ones that we've seen so far, you don't think that they're applicable at all or out, I mean, in terms of just us, from us looking afar here in terms of we haven't seen decisions, but we have seen a number of different settlements across the country on sort of base ROE and I'm just wondering, how should we think about that in the context of New England, or is there anything that we should think about being different there because of geography or something or...","Phil Lembo - Eversource Energy","No, I wouldn't expect that at this stage, we'd reach any settlement. And as I said, we've gone through various processes in the past and we are where we are right now. So unless there is more cases or something like that, which I'm hopeful that that won't happen, but in the cases that exist now, they're pretty far along. The fourth case is the least far along I guess of the cases, so I guess that there could be some opportunities there. But it's hard, once \u2013 when you have an open case from many years ago, how do you settle something that's later until you get the one that's earlier. So I think we have to see what comes out of this complaint one and hopefully that will set the trend for the rest of the cases.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. I appreciate it.

Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Jeffrey Kotkin. Mr. Kotkin, you may begin.","Jeffrey R. Kotkin - Eversource Energy","Thank you, Sylvia. Good morning and thank you for joining us. I'm Jeff Kotkin, Eversource Energy's Vice President for Investor Relations. As you can see on slide 1 of the slides that we posted last night, some of the statements made during this investor call maybe forward-looking as defined within the meaning of the Safe Harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risk and uncertainty, which may cause the actual results to differ materially from forecasts and projections. Some of these factors are set forth in the news release issued yesterday. Additional information about the various factors that may cause actual results to differ can be found in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, and the 10-Q for the three months ended March, 31, 2017.","Additionally, our explanation of how and why we use certain non-GAAP measures is contained within our news release and the slides we posted under Presentations & Webcasts, and in our most recent 10-K.","Turning to slide 2, speaking today will be Phil Lembo, our Executive Vice President and CFO; and Lee Olivier, our Executive Vice President for Enterprise Energy Strategy and Business Development. Also, joining us today are Jay Buth, our Vice President and Controller; John Moreira, our Vice President of Financial Planning and Analysis; and Christine Vaughan, our Treasurer and Vice President for Regulatory.","Now, I will turn to slide 3 and turn over the call to Phil.","Phil Lembo - Eversource Energy","Thank you, Jeff. So today I'll cover second quarter and first half financial results, the status of key regulatory dockets, the status of our Aquarion Water Company transaction, and an update on our capital plan and several transmission projects. So, let's start with the financial results for the quarter in slide 3. Earnings were up $0.08 per share in the second quarter of 2017 compared with the second quarter of 2016. We earned $0.72 per share in the second quarter, compared with $0.64 per share in the second quarter of 2016. On the electric distribution and generation side, we earned $0.38 per share in the second quarter of 2017, and that compares to $0.32 in the second quarter of last year. This increase was primarily due to lower operations and maintenance costs. We also benefited from higher demand revenues due to warm weather, warmer weather than the last \u2013 than the prior year.","Our transmission segment earned $0.30 per share in the second quarter of 2017 and this compares to $0.29 per share in the second quarter of last year. The primary driver of this earnings growth was higher transmission rate base, as we continue to invest in transmission projects that enhance the reliability of the New England power grid. I'll provide an update on key transmission projects that are driving this in a moment. The benefits from the greater transmission investment were partially offset by our annual reconciliation of costs and revenues from the prior year in accordance with FERC tariffs. This reconciliation takes place annually in the second quarter.","On the natural gas distribution side, we earned $0.01 per share in the second quarter of 2017. This compares to earnings of $0.03 per share in the second quarter of the previous year. Lower earnings were due to several factors, milder early spring weather, high depreciation and higher O&M costs. At the Eversource parent and other, we earned $0.03 per share and this compared to a relatively flat results in the second quarter of 2016.","The primary driver was related to earnings from a long-held investment in a fund that invests in renewable energy projects. In total, through 2016, the earnings from this investment were pretty much breakeven. However, the market for renewable projects has matured and performed well over the past year, resulting in higher equity earnings in the second quarter from this investment of about $0.02 per share, and this compared to a small loss of about a penny per share in the second quarter of last year. So going forward, we don't expect ongoing earnings from this investment will have a material impact on the earnings.","Turning to the second \u2013 turning from the second quarter to the first half results, we earned $1.54 per share in the first six months of 2017, compared to a $1.41 per share in the first half of last year. Improved results were due to higher transmission earnings, higher distribution revenues, lower O&M and improved results of the parent. For the full year, we continue to expect to earn between $3.05 and $3.20 per share, and for the long-term, we continue to project 5% to 7% EPS growth. From operations, I'll turn it to our regulatory activity and start in Massachusetts with the Massachusetts rate case and this is on slide 4. Hearings have concluded on the rate case, except for rate design topics.","We expect a decision on the financial aspects of the case by the end of November, with the rate design decision around year end. New rates would be effective in January of 2018, and to date we've no surprises in the rate review process.","In New Hampshire, binding bids on our public service in New Hampshire generation fleet are due next month. And there too, the overall divestiture process is moving along well, and we expect regulatory approval of the sale by the end of the year, with securitization activities to follow soon after the closing. From our state regulation, I'll turn to slide 5, and the various New England transmission ROE dockets before FERC. As you may recall, on April 14th of this year, this DC Circuit Court of Appeals vacated FERC's 2014 order that lowered the base ROE for the New England transmission owners from 11.14% to 10.57%.","Now before FERC commissions is not only the vacated order from that compliant one, but the ALJ recommendations from complaints two and three, which have not yet been decided. So, it's unclear whether FERC will issue orders on all three complainants at the same time or what the timing is of when this will occur. We've been conferring with other New England transmission owners about the appropriate billing for transmission service in New England in light of this April court decision and the four pending complaints.","And in June, the regions transmission owners, including Eversource filed with the FERC to revert back to the last approved ROE that was approved at 11.14%. In the filing, the transmission owners proposed that the rate be effective on June 8, and billing on the new rate to customers would not start until 60 days after FERC has a quorum. And as we all know, that has not occurred at this time. The financial results we reported last night still reflect the 10.57% ROE and the 11.74% cap on incentives that was vacated by the court. Our transmission revenues are based on what we bill to customers. Therefore there will be no change in our transmission revenues until our rates are changed perspectively. As a remainder, every 10 basis points of change in transmission ROEs, results in about a $3 million after tax earnings annually.","Next I'll turn to Slide 6 and the exciting announcement we made last month. On June 2, we announced an agreement to acquire Aquarion water company from Macquarie Infrastructure Partners and others for approximately $880 million in cash and assumption of $795 million of Aquarion debt. Aquarion is a very well managed water company with operations in the three states we already serve, Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Hampshire, with 90% of the operations being Connecticut. Several weeks ago, we filed regulatory applications in each of the states, seeking permission to consummate the transaction, and we expect to close the deal by the end of this year. Connecticut as I said where 90% of the business is located has already established a schedule with a final decision due before the end of October of this year. This transaction fits very nicely with our strategy to invest in critical infrastructure and to develop clean energy solutions for customers.","Macquarie had owned Aquarion for decade and its decision to sell the business coincides with our divestiture of PSNH's generation fleet. So in addition to being an excellent strategic fit, the timing of the opportunity was also good. We are exiting a generation business that was shrinking because of State statues that precluded us from any expansion, and we're entering a water distribution business that we expect will see decades of growth ahead due to the need for replacement of ageing infrastructure. We expect Aquarion to help, support and extend our projected 5% to 7% EPS growth. We will not be issuing any equity in association with this transaction, the cash portion of the transaction will come largely from the net proceeds from the sale and securitization of our New Hampshire generating assets. And as a reminder, nearly $800 million of gross proceeds are expected as part of that transaction.","We anticipate that Aquarion will operate pretty much as it does now post-closing. As you know, we are not currently in the water business. We also expect Aquarion's earnings to substantially offset the loss of PSNH generation earnings, and we expect Aquarion's earnings to grow over time as we invest needed capital in the business. Connecticut has a constructive regulatory structure for water companies that includes revenue decoupling, an infrastructure investment tracking mechanism and the ability to include a rate base acquisition costs related to the purchase of small financially distressed water companies. There is much fragmentation in the water business today, and over the last several years, Aquarion has acquired over a dozen smaller water systems. And I expect this trend would continue.","We are very excited about the additional business diversity and long-term growth opportunities the water business will provide. We're also very pleased that Aquarion will be located locally and owned locally. Before I turn the call over to Lee for the status report on some of our major projects, I want to provide you with our customary media update on capital expenditure plans. So our capital expenditures totaled about $1 billion in the first half of 2017, up about $100 million from the first half of 2016. Transmission investments totaled approximately $375 million in the first half of 2017 and we continue to target nearly $1 billion in transmission investments for the year.","As you can see on Slide seven, we continue to make progress on a number of the major transmission reliability projects. I wanted to spend some time discussing Northern Pass spending. Northern Pass accounts for $21 million of our transmission capital invested this year, and we expect that number to rise considerably beginning next year. Lee will provide you with an update of the project in a moment, but as you can see in the slides and from the press release relating to our Massachusetts RFP we issued yesterday, we're now anticipating a second half of 2020 as the in-service date for the project. We expect that the vast majority of the work on Northern Pass will be completed in 2018 and 2019, but we do expect a few hundred million dollars of the project will move into 2020.","We are currently developing detailed operating plans for 2018 and beyond, and we fully expect to provide an overall capital spending plan for 2018 that is consistent with the plan we released earlier this year. We expect to offset the lower level of expenditures in Northern Pass in 2018 with increased investments in electric resiliency programs, natural gas infrastructure capital and natural gas expansion projects.","We also expect, depending on the exact closing of the timing of the Aquarion transaction, nearly $100 million of capital expenditures at the water business. We'll provide you with specific capital expenditure levels for 2018 through 2021 for all segments when we update our long-term forecast in February. We expect these investments to fully support our projected 5% to 7% long-term EPS growth rate.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Lee.","Leon J. Olivier - Eversource Energy","Okay. Thanks, Phil. I'll provide you with a brief update on our major investment initiatives and then turn the call back to Jeff for Q&A.","Let's start with Northern Pass on Slide eight. The New Hampshire Site Evaluation Committee has completed more than 20 days of final evidentiary hearings for the project. Remaining hearings are scheduled to run through September and we've been quite pleased with how they have proceeded so far. We consider the New Hampshire SEC schedule to be supportive of the project receiving all of its approvals necessary to commence construction in early 2018.","Hearings in June and July focus on construction of line, its impact on the regions power prices, and the considerable effort we are devoting to minimize environmental impact of the project. We believe our witnesses have made a very persuasive case as to why the project should be approved as proposed. It will bring billions of dollars of benefits to the state of New Hampshire, including an estimated $60 million a year in electric market savings, $30 million to $35 million a year in property tax revenues, $200 million over a 20-year period is probably (15:28) New Hampshire economic development and clean energy fund, and up to 2,600 jobs during the construction period. We have pledged to give priority to New Hampshire residents and businesses for construction work. In addition to the SEC permit, we need to secure a presidential permit from the U.S. Department of Energy. According to its website, the DOE expects to issue a final environmental impact statement in August. That will position the DOE to issue a presidential permit by the end of this year.","We continue to expect Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec to receive its final national and provincial permits for the Canadian portion of the project later this year. The New Hampshire PUC already has reviewed a number of items related to Northern Pass. Last year it authorized Northern Pass transmission to operate as a utility in the state of New Hampshire. In June, the New Hampshire PUC approved NPT's licenses to cross public waters and lands. Additionally, both the New Hampshire Department of Transportation and the State Department of Environmental Services have approved the necessary permits to construct Northern Pass subject to final approval by the New Hampshire SEC.","Receiving the New Hampshire SEC and presidential permits by year end would support commencing construction in early 2018. You may recall that during our first quarter earnings call we noted that we expected to firm up our construction schedule around this time, after concluding a comprehensive review of the project with our important vendors and contractors. We have now completed that review with a particular focus on the timing and cost of the converter station and the 60 miles of underground cable. We also wanted to get through certain key elements of our New Hampshire SEC testimony, particularly the seven days of hearings on construction, which ended in June.","Based on our firm contracts, we expect that if we receive final permits for the project by the end of this year, we can complete the project in the third quarter of 2020. At that time, Northern Pass would be fully constructed and operational testing would commence, allowing the project to enter service prior to the critical 2020 to 2021 winter period. We believe the schedule would put us significantly ahead of any other major project to import Canadian hydro into New England. Our confidence in the construction schedule is also supported by the firm contracts we have with two of the most preeminent firms in the world, in terms of electric transmission design and construction, ABB and Quanta Services.","Turning to Slide 9, yesterday Eversource Energy transmission ventures and Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec jointly bid Northern Pass into the Massachusetts clean energy RFP. We believe that this bid would be extremely competitive in the Massachusetts solicitation due to the advanced stage of our project development. To remind you, by 2022 Massachusetts is required to contract for 9.45 terawatt hours a year of clean energy.","Page 1 of the RFP states that of the total 9.45 terawatt hours of cost-effective clean energy contracts being sought in this RFP, the distribution companies encourage proposals, which include clean energy generation able to commit to begin deliveries prior to the end of 2020, to maximize the commonwealth's ability to meet its global warming solutions act goals.","We believe that these provisions support our joint bid, since we are so much further along the project development process than other bidders. Additionally, Northern Pass would reduce Massachusetts electric sector carbon emissions by 25%, and as a result get Massachusetts pathway to its mandated reduction for the sector by 2050.","The current Massachusetts RFP is scheduled in the case that projects will be selected for negotiations by January 25, with regulatory filings next spring. Separately, an RFP exclusively for offshore wind was issued to the market at the end of June with bids due December 20, and expected contract filings with the DPU by the end July 2018. The RFP calls for interested bidders to submit a conforming proposal for 400 megawatts. It also stated alternative bids of up to 800 megawatts will be considered if bidders can show that a larger project would provide significant net economic benefits to customers. Bidders can also submit an alternative bid for as little as 200 megawatts. Bay State Wind, a 50-50 partnership between Eversource and DONG Energy will bid into this RFP.","Bay State Wind's 300 square mile track off the Massachusetts coast is very attractive location and it's expected to be able to host wind turbines capable of producing at least 2,000 megawatts. In addition to Massachusetts the track could serve three other states that are expanding their solicitations for Clean Energy. In New York, Governor Cuomo announced a goal of procuring 2,400 megawatts of offshore wind with the first RFP expected early next year. Rhode Island Governor, Gina Raimondo has announced a goal of procuring 1,000 megawatts of Clean Energy by 2020. In Connecticut, Governor Malloy signed Public Act 17-144 last month allowing offshore wind to be considered as private by new RFP for Clean Energy resources, which will also include utility rate base fuel cells. So it's going to enable construction of approximately 200 megawatts of offshore wind. The timing of any solicitation will be at the discretion of the State Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, but shows yet another legislative effort by a New England state to bring more Clean Energy resources into the region.","Additionally, earlier this week, the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection published a draft of the states updated Comprehensive Energy Strategy. The strategy focuses on five major themes. They are decreasing carbon emissions, increasing the supply of renewable energy, including expanding the states class I renewable requirements to 30% by 2030, and prioritizing low-cost grid-scale renewable energy investments. Expanding energy efficiency initiatives including procurement of energy efficiency as a resource. Supporting grid modernization and accelerating electrification of the state's transportation sector. We believe Eversource Energy is uniquely positioned to support each of these state policy initiatives.","With Connecticut, Massachusetts, Rhode Island and New York all driving policies that favor efficient offshore wind development, we expect significant interest in Bay State Wind's potential over the coming years, and we have begun to make early progress on citing. About a month ago, the federal Bureau of Ocean Energy Management issued to Bay State Wind, the first approval of an offshore wind site assessment plan in the United States. This will allow us to take critical measurements of wind and wave speeds over the next two years to prepare for project development.","Finally, turning to Access Northeast, we continue to discuss the gravity of New England winter time energy supply situation with policymakers in Massachusetts and New Hampshire. The two states that do not have legislation clarifying Electric Utility's ability to sign natural gas supply contracts. Brayton Point, the region's largest coal and oil-fired generation plant shutdown permanently June 1 and the Pilgrim nuclear plant will shut down in less than two years. ISO-New England continues to express deep concern over the region's ability to meet both gas heating and electrical requirements during winter periods. Later this year, ISO was due to issue a report on the challenges New England will face in future winters, if no significant firm fuel capacity is available for the region.","While we are confident in Access Northeast remains the region's best option for adding needed natural gas pipeline capacity, we also note that the project's ultimate size and configuration will depend on what kind of solution our states want to pursue to ensure electric grid reliability and to integrate renewable power sources into the New England grid.","Because of that lingering regulatory uncertainty, we and our Access Northeast joint developers, Enbridge, National Grid withdrew pre-applications from FERC last month, FERC has a very busy calendar, particularly for signing of natural gas pipelines and we thought it best to withdraw our project from preliminary review until we were able to bring more certainty to the question of who will be the counterparties that will purchase long-term pipeline capacity from Access Northeast. We expect most of the work that we've already done on the project can be used in a future re-filed Access Northeast application. We have no question that the regions winter time gas supply situation continues to worsen with generation such as Brayton Point retiring and more natural gas-fired plants being built, and the regions homes and businesses continuing to install tens of thousands of new natural gas systems annually. However, we need state energy policy to be more consistent across the region, particularly in Massachusetts and New Hampshire. We expect to re-file a preliminary application with FERC for Access Northeast, once we have a clear path to resolving current inconsistencies and policies.","Now, I will turn the call back to Jeff for Q&A.","Jeffrey R. Kotkin - Eversource Energy","Thank you, Lee. And I'm going to turn the call back to Sylvia just to remind you how to enter the questions. Sylvia?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll now begin the question-and-answer session. Now, I'll turn the call back to Jeff.","Jeffrey R. Kotkin - Eversource Energy","Thank you. First question this morning is from Mike Weinstein from Credit Suisse. Good morning, Mike?","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Good morning. Thanks, Lee for that great update. Maybe, we could just talk a little about why \u2013 like why is it a full year delay for Northern Pass, how come not the spring of 2020? What equipment exactly is proving to be critical path items that extend the schedule at this point? And then also separately, how critical is wining the RFPs to keeping the project on track? My understanding is that they are \u2013 it's not critical. What happens if you lose? I understand there is other opportunities in these other states will be coming next year, but how critical is it to keeping the project on track?","Leon J. Olivier - Eversource Energy","Sure. Just to get to the first part of your question, Mike. It's the HVDC converter technologies is the critical path along with the underground, what they call XLPE cables. So these cables that have no oil and those two components are the critical path. And both HVDC converters and that particular kind of cable is in strong demand around the world. There is long lead times for both of those. Each HVDC converter, there is nothing on the shelf so to speak that you can use and you back fit for a particular application. Every design is a completely unique design and it's just the time that we have gotten from the manufacturer ABB of the cable and HVDC converters, and it's really the limiting factor there. So it's just where \u2013 how much they have in the queue, and where we show up in the queue. It's really no more complicated than that.","In regards to the project, whether we win the RFP or not, we are committed to build the project in H2. As I have stated there is a lot of opportunities in all of these states for clean energy. If you look at where the region is and the precarious position of the region, absent a dedicated firm fuel supply, particularly natural gas, you are going to need more firm energy like Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec has to offer into the marketplace. You probably, I'm sure, have seen where the largest nuclear operator in the region is now inquiring through ISO, what it would take to retire those assets, what that process looks like. They haven't made a commitment to go do that.","But I think in any case whether that's done now or later, all of those assets time out and if the region wants to meet its goals around carbon reduction in class 1 renewable energy, as well as clean energy, you will have more hydro coming in from Eastern Canada and Qu\u00e9bec to help satisfy that. So we're confident that the project will get built regardless of the outcome with this RFP.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. And in terms of the FERC transmission complaints, are you in \u2013 is this planned to re-file to revert back to the old ROE? has that been discussed with other interveners in the case? What's your sense right now of how that's going to proceed going forward? Is there going to be a settlement process that ultimately resolves where the ROEs eventually land?","Phil Lembo - Eversource Energy","Sure, Mike. This is Phil. The filing was done by consultation with the New England transmission owners, because we needed to have a way that we could bill customers, and given that the decision of the DC court vacated complaint one, we needed to have a rate on file that we could start billing our customers with. So this was a consultation and a filing with the New England transmission owners that was made in early June and as you know, there's really not a forum or court at FERC at this time to review that. So we have not changed our billing until we move through that process. In terms of settlement, we've tried \u2013 we have \u2013 in each of these complaints there has been settlement process and that's \u2013 the traditional FERC process is to start that we have not in any of those cases reached any settlements. So I guess, one could always be reached in the future, but I guess at this stage we are awaiting a quorum, so that the case be reviewed and we can move forward.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","And one last question, on Aquarion. How far in the process are you right now looking at further acquisitions of distressed assets that are out there? Anyway, is this something that we expect \u2013 should expect to hear within fairly soon after closing the deal, like early next year?","Phil Lembo - Eversource Energy","Yes. I can say Aquarion is a private \u2013 they're a privately held company right now, but if you look at their track record over the last many years, there's about a dozen different smaller financially distressed systems that have been let's call it tucked in under the Aquarion umbrella. So that's about a 11,000 additional customers. There's 230,000 customers now. Certainly, there is more of these types of systems out there, as you get ageing infrastructure, more requirements for clean water, that type of thing. So just given that kind of track record, I would expect that to continue.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","So, I mean if I just do the quick math, 11,000 customers on 230,000 customers now, it's about 5% increase in size. Is that the sort of the opportunity on a dollar basis that you might be looking at as well?","Phil Lembo - Eversource Energy","No, it's very fragmented. There's \u2013 some of these systems maybe five or six customers, some could be a 1,000 or 2,000. So it's hard to say. Certainly, you have to match up the need with the opportunity. So 11,000 over a last kind of five years is just an indicative number as to the process that's out there. And then I think if you look around the country, you'll see that this type of activity goes on.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Yes. All right. Thanks a lot.","Leon J. Olivier - Eversource Energy","Thanks Mike.","Phil Lembo - Eversource Energy","You're welcome.","Jeffrey R. Kotkin - Eversource Energy","Thanks, Mike. Next question is from Paul Patterson from Glenrock. Good morning. Paul.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Good morning. How are you?","Jeffrey R. Kotkin - Eversource Energy","All right. How are you?","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","All right. So, just as a follow-up on Northern Pass, is it safe to say that you guys are going to be participating in the upcoming capacity auction? Is Northern Pass going to be participating in it?","Leon J. Olivier - Eversource Energy","Paul, the is Lee. The capacity auctions, the participation in that will be determined by HQ, and they are in the process of evaluating that option right now and I can't tell you what their conclusion is.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Well, let me ask you this, if you don't clear it, how is capacity going to be provided with respect to the Massachusetts RFP?","Leon J. Olivier - Eversource Energy","Well, the RFP is not hinged on capacity. It's really all hinged up on the things like price suppression, carbon reduction, obviously, the cost of the project. Those are the things that it hinges on. So if it gets capacity as well, that's an added benefit to customers in Massachusetts and into the region.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Right. So, you would think that will be part of the value that the project would provide. So it'd seem kind of strange to me, I am sorry slow on this why capacity wouldn't be something that you guys would want to have, value being reflected in terms of the project.","Leon J. Olivier - Eversource Energy","Thanks Yes. It clearly would be Paul. I just can't tell you exactly right now, where HQ is on that, but it clearly would be part of the value proposition for the state and the region.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay With respect to the determination on MOPR, when would we find out how, ISO New England officially will be treating Northern Pass and the issue of MOPR?","Leon J. Olivier - Eversource Energy","Thanks Well, one of the things that HQ has to do is to actually submit a formal request to ISO New England, to have them evaluate Northern Pass vis-\u00e0-vis the MOPR requirements. And they have not done that at this point.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And then, you mentioned that if the Massachusetts RFP doesn't happen, you feel there is enough opportunity out there, which makes sense for the value of the project. But I'm just wondering, do you think the project would proceed in the absence of some sort of contractual setup such as the Massachusetts RFP or some other state sort of sponsor program or that there is enough confidence that you should simply proceed with the project and hope to get something regardless, if you follow me?","Leon J. Olivier - Eversource Energy","No, I follow you, Paul. I think where we are right now is, we think our project has all the attributes that it will be the winning project in this RFP. And if for some reason, we don't win this RFP, we'll take a pause, we'll take a look, and we'll look at where the other states are in these RFPs, and that process and we'll make that decision at that time.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. Fair enough. And then just finally the sales growth whether adjusted year-to-date, I'm sorry if I missed it, just really busy, but I didn't see anything on that. Could you tell us where for just system wide, you guys are in terms of retail electric sales growth year-to-date, weather adjusted?","Leon J. Olivier - Eversource Energy","Yes, the normalized, Paul, is down, just less than a percent on a normalized basis year-to-date.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. Thanks so much.","Leon J. Olivier - Eversource Energy","You're welcome.","Jeffrey R. Kotkin - Eversource Energy","Thanks Paul. Next question is from Michael Lapides from Goldman. Good morning, Michael.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, good morning guys. Real quick, just trying to think about the offshore wind process, can you talk about what's \u2013 like let's talk about the timeline both, not just for the RFP responses, but then the DOE approvals for the tracks out in the ocean and then kind of the other siting and permitting for where the line would potentially terminate in the U.S. onshore. Like, how do you think about cradle to grave, what the timeline is from the RFP process to actually having an operating asset?","Leon J. Olivier - Eversource Energy","Yes, Michael. This is Lee. In regards to that, I think obviously, we've got a pretty good line of sight around the Massachusetts offshore wind RFP in the process and we've got timelines as issued inside of the draft, and then it really becomes what is the timeline from the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, which falls under the Interior of the Secretary \u2013 Interior Secretary's office and there, there is \u2013 that's kind of \u2013 I would call that kind of work-in-progress that they've got kind of a draft timeline out there. We will be meeting later this year with staff in the office of Ocean offshore management and we need to work with them.","And clearly there's other stakeholders here. There is a lot of offshore wind developers that will be working with the Interior Department as well to finalize what that process is, but I think this is \u2013 this is 2017. I think, that it's realistic to see the first tranche of wind in service by the 2022, end of 2022 timeframe based upon the feedback obviously we have from DONG Energy who has built a lot of this all over the world and so we feel the first part of this wind farm would come on in 2020. And of course, as you know it's not like building \u2013 2022 rather. It's not like building a large power plant. You string six of these things together and the first six of them show up on to the grid and then every time you add another six, six more of them come onto to the grid. So it's kind of a phased in and so you have early revenue production in that process.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. And Phil you talked a little bit about your capital spending plan and budget. And I know you are going to give more detail either at EEI or at our fourth quarter call, but can you just kind of rehash a little bit of that and maybe give a little more clarity, where specifically would you see an uptick in kind of traditional, whether it's transmission or distribution CapEx in 2018, relative to what your prior forecast showed?","Phil Lembo - Eversource Energy","Sure. I guess, I'll preface it by saying, I think we have very good line of sight even as we sit here today without moving through too much time through the rest of the year. We still have our budget process to go through, et cetera. But, really at this time we have a very good line of sight and just to remind you too that we've been repeatedly able to deliver these results. If you think back to our February plan, we added a $1 billion dollars of capital from the previous plan that had been submitted so. So certainly, we have a track record to be able to deliver these results and really with a focus on cost control that's unmatched in the industry. So we can deliver the results, take cost out of the business, improve our reliability, provide great service to customers and these are all great aspects of our company.","So, we do have an experienced team, we have a strong balance sheet. If we look at it, as Lee mentioned, there's going to be additional infrastructure needs, there's going to be likely more clean energy growth opportunities. But to be specific about the things, in terms of electric distribution we have, in our gas distribution business we have these reliability enhancement programs that help to improve that service reliability on both the electric side and the gas side. We have aging infrastructure replacement and our gas expansion program in place that we expect to have incremental spending in both of those categories. That is fairly significant in 2018 from our original estimate. And as I mentioned, the water business, Aquarian, again depending on the exact closing date of that, there is a robust capital spending program in there. So those are really some of the \u2013 some of the major categories. You could see \u2013 you could see others develop as we move through the rest of the year.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. And can you quantify, is there a way to quantify how much incremental CapEx would likely come relative to kind of the movement of Northern Pass?","Phil Lembo - Eversource Energy","What I can say is, we fully expect to replace the spending in terms of the detail level and number. I'll have to hold off on that, but the short answer is, we fully expect to have a good line of sight to replacing any movement of spending out of 2018.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thank you, guys. Much appreciated.","Jeffrey R. Kotkin - Eversource Energy","Thanks, Michael. Next question is from Shar Pourreza from Guggenheim. Good morning, Shar.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Good morning, guys. Let me just touch real quick on Northern Pass, I mean obviously the Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec is actively the competing proposal, and obviously, both lines have relatively strong attributes. Let me ask you, assuming that you don't win these RFPs, when you think about future opportunities, is there an opportunity to partner because most agree that TDI is not going away. And then the other question is, can you just touch a little bit on \u2013 you're committed to building the project whether or not you win the RFP. So how would that work sort of mechanically?","Leon J. Olivier - Eversource Energy","Yes. A couple of things with regards to your question. On partnering obviously, we think we're quite good in partnering, because we had a lot of partners between Enbridge and HQ, and now DONG Energy, and so we think we're good in that. And should an opportunity to partner with these folks ever come up, we'll certainly consider that. That's not out of the question.","But getting back to your second part of your question. Again, I think we'll win the RFP, the Massachusetts RFP, really because our sighting on both sides of the border is just about complete. The other projects we'll have to go, particularly those that interconnect with Canada have a two to three-year process, and which they're going to have to work through and whatever their state sighting processes are. Our engineering work and design is essentially completed. We have got our major contractors lined up, we have firm bids, we have firm place in the queues for manufacturing. And again, building these things poses a lot of risk unless you have the very best contractors, and we have those and particular with Quanta who has done a lot of work for us.","And when you look at the, the Massachusetts RFP gives a special consideration for projects that are in service by the end of 2020, and just the fact that Northern Pass going into service, that have about 25% reduction in the electric sector Co2 emissions, so that we would be right where they need to be by the end of 2020. So it's got all the right attributes. And just to repeat what I said before, Shar we would \u2013 if for some reason we did not win this RFP, still we would sit down with our partners, HQ, assess where we are vis-\u00e0-vis the other states, and then make that decision to proceed. But I think both parties believe the project will get built for all of the reasons that I just covered.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Got it. That's actually very helpful. Let me just, on Aquarion, I know in your prepared remarks you talked about the attribute. Again it's located and doing business kind of locally. Obviously areas around the New England, especially on the water infrastructure side are very prone for acquisitions on the Muni, especially like in states like New Jersey. So when you sort of think about growth opportunities around this business, is there an opportunity to grow outside of New England? So could we eventually see this entity start to acquire Munis in surrounding regions where you have similar legislation or are you pretty much focused on remaining within the New England region?","Phil Lembo - Eversource Energy","Yeah. Yes, Shar. This is Phil. I think that -","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Hi Phil.","Phil Lembo - Eversource Energy","How are you doing? So, first of all I'll say we're just starting our regulatory approval process. So our primary focus in the near term is to effectively move through those processes in the various states and get the approvals and move forward. Certainly you know, as we move forward into that business, we'd have to look at all the opportunities that present themselves, just like we do in all parts of our business, the projects that Lee has talked about, you have to look for those and you have to see what the opportunities are and move on then if they are in the best interest of the company.","So, there's no reason to think we wouldn't do the same thing in all aspects of our business. So right now I'd say our focus is on getting the deal across the goal line in terms of the regulatory approvals, but in any aspect of what we look at, we're always looking for opportunities to grow the business, provide great service, produce returns for investors and results for customers that put us in the top quartile.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Great. Thanks. Thanks, everyone. Have a really good morning.","Leon J. Olivier - Eversource Energy","Thank you.","Jeffrey R. Kotkin - Eversource Energy","Thanks, Shar. Next question this morning is from Steve Fleishman from Wolfe. Good morning, Steve.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Hey, Jeff. Good morning. Sorry. It's been a distracting morning. So there's a little bit of repetition here. Just on \u2013 I saw some local stories where \u2013 does it look like the September 30 date is also going to delayed for approval in New Hampshire?","Leon J. Olivier - Eversource Energy","Yeah. This is Lee. There is going to be a SEC preconference meeting, I think on the 9th of August that will look at the final phase of the hearings. It will be the third one and it will lay out the schedule to the end of the \u2013 end of the hearing process. So, right now, I don't have anything other than the end of September timeframe for you. I think all of our witnesses will be done in their testimony by the end of August.","And then it becomes the witnesses \u2013 the interviewing as witnesses for cross-examination. Obviously, most of that gets done by us. We will determine who we want to cross and who we don't want to cross and how we optimize that schedule. And then it's really written briefs by all parties, and then there will be a deliberation by the SEC and that would be public deliberation and a decision would be made.","There will be an oral decision, which will be followed up by a written decision that would be somewhere between 30 and 60 days. So all of that we believe still falls into the timeframe that basically says that we will have the final EIS, the record of decision from the DOE, the SEC decision, the Presidential Permit by the end of the year, all of that leads us for essentially third quarter 2020 completion of the build-out testing, the remainder of the year within surface (50:51) all of that supports.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. So, let's say, I just started, but just let's say the dates only get them on August 9th or extend it -if it \u2013 you're assuming you're going to have a final order in New Hampshire by year-end. So, we would have to kind of measure against that I guess?","Leon J. Olivier - Eversource Energy","Yeah, yeah. And the ...","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay.","Leon J. Olivier - Eversource Energy","...and the other piece...","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","And do you feel good? Yes.","Leon J. Olivier - Eversource Energy","The other pieces fall right in place with that.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And one question on the Northern Pass, kind of replacement capital that you say you'll come out with. Should we think of that as more moving forward capital that was in the plan and other businesses that was going to be in later years, moving that forward, or should we think about it as more actually just net new capital, new projects?","Leon J. Olivier - Eversource Energy","Yes. I'd say, primarily for the most part, it will be new. So there could be some movement, but I would expect that that would be a smaller portion of it, primarily new.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Okay. Thank you.","Leon J. Olivier - Eversource Energy","Thanks, Steve.","Jeffrey R. Kotkin - Eversource Energy","Thanks, Steve. Next question is from Caroline Bone from Deutsche Bank. Good morning, Caroline.","Caroline V. Bone - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey. Good morning. Most of my questions have been answered. I just wanted to follow-up and I also \u2013 I feel like it's been a busy morning. So I apologize if I missed this earlier. The benefit you guys saw in Q2 from that renewable fund investment, is that something that we should expect to continue or is that just some sort of one-time gain? Can you just elaborate on that a bit more?","Leon J. Olivier - Eversource Energy","Sure, Caroline. I wouldn't consider it a one-time gain. It's been something that's been in our portfolio for many years. I'd say what was unusual was the size of it was probably higher than had been the case in the past. So we don't expect it to be significant going forward.","Caroline V. Bone - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Jeffrey R. Kotkin - Eversource Energy","All right. Thank you, Caroline. Next question is from Praful Mehta from Citi. Good morning, Praful.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi. Thanks. So, actually I was struggling a little bit on the water side. You've talked about acquisitions as one possible opportunity to grow the water business. But if you're buying at multiples that are at the 25 times, 26 times or whatever the water business transactions get done. Where do you see the synergy or where do you see the value creation opportunity that would justify that kind of multiple?","Leon J. Olivier - Eversource Energy","Yes Praful, as I said, in terms of the operations and the asset of Aquarion, they are a very well run, well respected organization, have a number one in JD Power scores for their category. We're focused on growing the business. So I think there are growth opportunities that do exist in the water business. As I said, the small distressed systems are a growth opportunity that, that currently exist. And we see, if you look at the water business in terms of the water business versus the generation business that we're exiting, as I said, you have a business there that has no growth and is declining vis-\u00e0-vis a business that you're replacing that with, that has some potentially significant growth opportunities as we move forward with aging infrastructure and the like. So, we see it as an excellent opportunity and certainly good strategic fit.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got you. Fair enough. And so, in terms of size going forward, what proportion should we think about? Is there a goal in terms of how much of a potential rate base or proportion of rate base of the consolidated business, you want the water business to be or should we look at it as a much smaller part of the whole business? Where do you see I guess the water business going longer term?","Leon J. Olivier - Eversource Energy","Yes. Certainly, if you look at the size of the existing generation business, it's about 3%. If you look at the existing, if you just take Aquarion, it's probably in that same general ballpark. I can't give you a specific targeted number today. But certainly, we do expect that number to grow over time.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got you. Well, thank you guys.","Jeffrey R. Kotkin - Eversource Energy","Thanks, Praful. Next question is from Travis Miller from MorningStar. Good morning, Travis.","Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Good morning, thank you. Just real quick, following up on Aquarion, I was wondering if you could discuss a little bit your regulatory goals, either through the approval process or in the subsequent one, two, three years in terms of things like allowed ROEs, cost riders, other cost recovery, just anything that comes to mind, things that were in your plan, in terms of making the acquisition?","Leon J. Olivier - Eversource Energy","Sure, sure.","Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","...from a regulatory side.","Leon J. Olivier - Eversource Energy","Absolutely, as I mentioned in my remarks, I'll focus on Connecticut because 90% of the business of Aquarion is in Connecticut. And I would consider certainly Connecticut as a state that we're familiar with, that Eversource and Aquarion obviously is very familiar with from there, from the years of dealing in the regulatory space there. The water regulation is constructive in Connecticut. There are trackers for infrastructure programs. This is a so-called Wicca program. That's not my Boston accent, that's actually Wicca and the decoupling programs, that just like the electric industry, that decouples usage from \u2013 from the bill distress system. If you buy distressed systems you're allowed to put that into rate base or get a higher ROE allowance. So, certainly the regulatory's framework is constructive. The ROE in the water business there is at least equal to or better than what we have in our electric and gas business in Connecticut.","So, certainly \u2013 and then if you look at it, you really have, I think local ownership really means a lot, that if you look at the rationale for the sale of the company, it was strictly related to a fund that Macquarie had that was needed to be dissolved. And that could have gone in a lot of different directions. So having local ownership where we expect to keep the existing operations pretty much in place. As I said, we're not in the water business. They have a great track record for operation. So all those things I think will be favorable.","Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Okay. Great. I Appreciate it.","Jeffrey R. Kotkin - Eversource Energy","Thanks, Travis. Next question is from Mike Weinstein from Credit Suisse.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi. guys. Hey just a couple of follow-ups. On Steve's question regarding delays and the possible approvals by September 30, let's say the final approvals don't come until January instead of December, the year end, like at what point does the project get moved into 2021 for completion? Like when is the last possible moment you can get the presidential permit to start construction and still remain on schedule for end of 2020?","Leon J. Olivier - Eversource Energy","Yes. Steve this is Lee.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Mike...","Leon J. Olivier - Eversource Energy","Mike, excuse me. Right now we have got our schedule set-up that we have all of our permits in hand, such that we can get ready to go for construction in the early part of the year and is there some slack in those schedules? Sure. As there on all schedules, and to the extent that if it did get late, would have to go back and would have to assess slack and any ways to optimize the schedule and we would have to make that call at that point in time. But we're really geared up to get all of these approvals by the end of the year, and that meets our schedule and service date in the third quarter of 2020. And we'll just have to assess that as we go. There is some slack in the schedule.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. I guess, one thing I'd be concerned about is that the vendors might \u2013 if the delay is too long, the vendors might say, hey, no we have other customers that need this equipment.","Leon J. Olivier - Eversource Energy","Yeah. No. That's a fair statement.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Yes.","Leon J. Olivier - Eversource Energy","Because this equipment is in demand all over the world.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Right. Hey, a quick follow up on the one-time gain, that $0.04 gain in other income. Is that \u2013 was that part of the 2017 guidance? Is it \u2013 is this something that is an investment that you continue to payoff in future years or is this really just truly a one-time thing that was not included in the guidance?","Leon J. Olivier - Eversource Energy","Yeah, Mike, it wasn't really \u2013 it's not a $0.04. It was really a couple of cents that was in the quarter.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Yeah.","Leon J. Olivier - Eversource Energy","So the total change in that parent line was $0.03 to $0.04, but the incremental per share number related to that investment was just a couple of cents and really the reason it looks different is last year it was a $0.01 loss, this year it was a couple of cent gains. So it's a $0.03 swing. So it's in there \u2013 it's always in the guidance because we do have that investment and then, as I said, it generally is plus or minus a penny in that category. And I don't \u2013 it's not synonymous with, but we have other reconciliation items, I mentioned the transmission reconciliation. That's always in our guidance. That could go plus or minus. We have \u2013 we reconcile our energy efficiency programs, those could go plus or minus. So, it's really part of the ebb and flow.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. And it's not, there isn't some ongoing $0.02?","Leon J. Olivier - Eversource Energy","No. There was, the reason it was a little bit higher this year was, there was kind of a special contract that one of the investments had in 2016, that wasn't there the prior year. So, no, I would say it's not something that we would plan on going forward.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Also it sounds vaguely like there is some reserve of capital projects, that sits out there that?","Leon J. Olivier - Eversource Energy","No, no. No. When you say reserve, what are you referring to Mike?","Jeffrey R. Kotkin - Eversource Energy","Mike, you still there?","Leon J. Olivier - Eversource Energy","Hello. Yeah.","Jeffrey R. Kotkin - Eversource Energy","Yes. So I think....","Leon J. Olivier - Eversource Energy","All right. Maybe I'll move onto that...","Jeffrey R. Kotkin - Eversource Energy","Oh, I'm sorry. Let's take the offline. (62:17) Can you just repeat the question, I think you may have gone on mute.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Oh. I'm sorry about that. Yes, I'm just wondering, it sounds like there is a reserve of capital projects that sit out there, that could be brought in to bear, when there is a delay in other projects. I know there is things being spent when projects are higher priority now, like they were in the past. You put off other things and those things can be brought forward, and brought into the plan, when there are delays. So, is this something that \u2013 should be we expecting a big increase in the capital program at EEI this year?","Leon J. Olivier - Eversource Energy","Well, again, we do announce the capital in our guidance in the February time period, but just like I think any effective financial and business planning operation, we don't just do it one time a year. We're continuously looking at what are our needs for our customers? What do we have on the schedule? Sometimes a project gets a little bit delayed in citing, but another project has progressed faster than we thought. So, we're not creating new activities to do. We're developing a capital program that is responsive to the needs of the region in terms of reliability or it's responsive to our customers.","We're putting capital and our O&M is all directed at providing great customer service, top tier reliability, those types of things. So, but there is an ebb and flow in projects, and we don't just look at them once a year. So there are projects that do move. Some move faster so you can advance them, some move slower so they have to go into another year. But there's not a reserve out there, that we're picking from.","Jeffrey R. Kotkin - Eversource Energy","Mike you, I think we've lost you again. Are you still there? Okay. All right. Let's move on to, I think the last question today, Joe Jiu from Avon (64:14). Joe, are you there?","Unknown Speaker","Actually, it's Andy. How are you guys doing?","Leon J. Olivier - Eversource Energy","Hi Andy. How are you doing?","Unknown Speaker","I'm doing well. Just one last question on Northern Pass. Did you guys ever talked about it, because I guess through the RFP you're saying or just in general that you have 60 miles of undergrounding budgeted, is that correct?","Leon J. Olivier - Eversource Energy","Yes.","Unknown Speaker","Right. And then, once the Site Evaluation Committee comes out with their final ruling sometime this year, is there like a number or meaning CapEx wise or mileage wise on the undergrounding that's kind of make or break?","Leon J. Olivier - Eversource Energy","Andy, this is Lee. I guess, you could say that, obviously by the nature of this process, it's a competitive process and really don't disclose all the parts and pieces of the cost. I \u2013 as I said earlier, we have now firm contracts and places in the queue. Important to note that the department of transportation has accepted our plan for undergrounding. The department of environmental services has accepted the project as is \u2013 as designed and so those are the two key agencies in New Hampshire that issue the reports around the viability of the design. And so we're quite confident in that design and we don't believe that in any way there is a justification to do more than 60 miles. So we think in and of itself, we're in a good place.","Unknown Speaker","I understand that, but I'm just saying is there a \u2013 I guess, what \u2013 the point your making just before I ask my question is that based on those two agencies you don't think the SEC is going to ask you to underground more? Is that your point?","Leon J. Olivier - Eversource Energy","I can't speak for the \u2013 for the SEC obviously. The agencies, there is members of \u2013 the heads of those agencies sit on the SEC, and the agencies themselves have provided final supporting reports that support the design as is, but clearly the SEC members vote independently.","Unknown Speaker","Okay. And but is there \u2013 but I guess because of competitive reasons you're not going to kind of put out a number or mileage number or anything like that, that would make you or HQ feel uncomfortable to move ahead?","Leon J. Olivier - Eversource Energy","Yes.","Unknown Speaker","Beyond the 60 miles that have been stated already.","Leon J. Olivier - Eversource Energy","Yeah. I think that's fair to say, Andy.","Unknown Speaker","Okay. That's fair. And then \u2013 just as far as how that relates to Massachusetts RFP, because I'm not that familiar with the process. So when you bid into the RFP, the amount of undergrounding, is that part of the kind of the economics of the bid or not?","Leon J. Olivier - Eversource Energy","No. No, actually it isn't. You're basically going to bid a project and that has a number of attributes. Clearly it's going to be the cost of the project, it's going to be the deleverage cost per megawatt hour of the project and the energy, right. So you end up with a total cost and that has to be competitive. It's going to be \u2013 does the owners have site control, do they have the requisite experience in building these, do they have the financial ability to do it. How much risk are the developers asking to be placed on the EDC customers and so forth. And exactly when will it be in schedule, what are the attributes, the operational attributes in terms of things like deliverability, the voltage and so forth, does it have black start capability which Hydro does. Does it have the ISO-New England approval? So, they're going to look at all of those things and they'll have a grading process of approximately 100 points and they will score each project in accordance with that grading process.","Unknown Speaker","Okay. I understand. So really in a sense the undergrounding affects the economics of the program, but it's really more for you guys relative to what it's going to cost the rate payer or the customer or the consumer to this Massachusetts RFP?","Leon J. Olivier - Eversource Energy","Yes. That's true, Andy.","Unknown Speaker","Okay, great. Thank you, guys.","Leon J. Olivier - Eversource Energy","All right. Thank you, Andy.","Jeffrey R. Kotkin - Eversource Energy","That's the last. I think some folks have already moved on to the 10 o'clock calls.

May - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, everyone. I have the easy job this morning of making the introductions and let me start by saying surprise, surprise. We've had another great year. Jim, in a minute, will take you through all the numbers to explain that. And Lee will take you through the significant big capital projects that we have. And they will both report on great progress. So, we're moving along quite nicely.","One of the things that we have been focusing on for the last four years is customer service. Those of you that know me, I'm a nut about customer service. And I think that in 2016, operationally, we had the best ever year with record reliability, record number of customers we were able to connect into our gas system. And we think we did that at a time when the delivery part of our bills have been very, very stable.","In 2016, we think we're going to bring it to the next level. We're focused on the customer touch points. We have successfully implemented a new outage management system throughout the three states so that, if you will, our order entry system is consistent for all 3.5 million of our customers. And with this technology, which has great connectivity between our customers and our electrical components, we're going to be able to take it to the next level with a communication strategy that will let the customers know exactly what's going on at all times with their system and their connections. We're also going to be rolling out a new bill, new website, again, important interactions with the customer that we think are the key to our success long-term.","For the region, as you know, it's an exciting time in New England. We are in a very unique phase. I think just last week, Gordon van Wheelie, who runs ISO New England, made a great presentation to the business community, and its focus was the needs going forward. And critical, first thing that he addressed is the gas infrastructure needs, showed the difference between our pricing and New York and other regions in the winter timeframes when our gas infrastructure experiences constraints, and whether gas prices are high or gas prices are low, the differential is very significant.","He also talked about the transmission system and the impacts that are going to be felt as we as a region meet our carbon reduction goals and move almost 35% or more than 35% of our fossil generation over the renewable generation. And so, exciting time and we're right in the middle of that and we'll talk more about that.","And for investors, of course, you know that we work for you. The foundation for TSR, which we measure very carefully, is growing earnings per share and growing dividends. And that's what we'll talk to you about our ability to continue that as we go forward. And as we do that, we think we will provide attractive returns while maintaining the highest credit rating in the industry.","If you flip to page four, my favorite slide in the deck, we continue to outperform our peers in the market over the long-term. Last year was kind of a flat year. We do believe we did better than the industry. And as you can see by the bottom chart, as long as we keep our dividends growing, and this week, we raised our dividend 6.6% or $0.11, and despite that, we still, as you know, have a very modest payout ratio. I won't dwell on those numbers, although I do like to.","The last slide I just would mention before I turn it over to Lee is page five. And we're really quite proud of this. We've grown into a role as a regional leader. I referenced the recent ISO New England presentation that Gordon made and their view on the regional challenges. But what has been very interesting, and Lee is in the center of all this, is that as the largest player in New England, we seem to be the one that everybody comes to when they think they can help our customers in the region achieve our energy goals.","And so, we're working with several partners to help create the solutions that will bring us to the modern era, whether that's the pipeline constraints that I mentioned. Again, we think we have the best project and the best partner in the form of Spectra Energy that allows us to use existing facilities that pass by every one of our most efficient new gas-fired units in New England. And with our plan, we'll keep those units in the competitive queue each and every day of the winter.","On the renewable energy side, we think we have \u2013 and there we'll probably talk a little bit more about the three-state RFP, but as we look at that, we think we have really the only dispatchable project that can flow a substantial amount, no pun intended, of carbon-free energy into the region at the peak times that will, again, affect the pricing in the queue. Whether it's the oil heat dependency that, in particular in Connecticut, is a key program in the Connecticut energy policy, we found this year that despite the fact that the gap between oil and gas shrunk considerably that people still want to convert. And we were able to convert about 11,000 customers last year. And I think we already converted 1,000 in January. So, the mild weather, while we don't like it from a sales perspective, allows us to continue and get a lot of work done.","And, of course, the forefront of everything in New England in terms of solving our energy problems and backing out carbon is energy efficiency. It's the cheapest way to achieve our objective. We have award-winning EE programs. As this slide says, we spent $0.5 billion a year, but last year we actually exceeded our goals. Spent less, exceeded our megawatt hour goals and had our incentives. We exceeded our plan by about $5 million on the incentive side. So, we're very proud of that.","The bottom line is we want our customers to see us as the solution to their energy concerns. And that's why it's an exciting place to be, New England, and for us to be in the center of all this.","And with that, I know you would like to hear more about the projects. Every time I'm in front of a group, they want to ask about Northern Pass or Access Northeast, and even my board is always interested in what's going on with the projects.","So with that, I'll hand it over to Lee to give you more flavor on progress report on where we are with some of these stuff.","Leon J. Olivier - EVP-Enterprise Energy Strategy and Business Development","Okay. Thank you, Tom. I'll provide you with brief update on our major investment initiatives and then turn the call over to Jim.","Let's start with Northern Pass and slide seven. In December, the Hampshire Site Evaluation Committee, or SEC, determined that our Northern Pass application is complete and commenced the formal review process. As part of that process, the SEC held five public information sessions on the project in January and will hold another round of public hearings later this quarter. Simultaneously, we continue to respond to questions about the project from the multiple state agencies that are participating in the review.","As you can see from slide eight, we're expecting the Hampshire SEC to vote on the Northern Pass, consistent with its current schedule, which concludes on December 19. In parallel, the U.S. Department of Energy will host a series of four public hearings on its draft Environmental Impact Statement or EIS on Northern Pass the week of March 7. Two of them will be held jointly with the New Hampshire Site Evaluation Committee.","Written comments on the draft EIS are due to the DOE by April 4. We expect the DOE to finalize the EIS in the second half of this year and anticipate a Presidential Permit issue soon after than the Hampshire SEC process has concluded. That time table has not changed and we ensure that all relevant conditions of the SEC decision will be reflected in the Presidential Permit as well.","We continue to feel very good about the review process on Northern Pass. We're receiving strong support for the project both inside and outside of New Hampshire. At the first public information session last month in Franklin, New Hampshire, where the DC to AC converter station will be located, we received significant support from local leaders, the business community and labor representatives. In Massachusetts, Governor Baker said in his State of the State speech last month that increasing access to affordable hydroelectric power was the top priority of his administration.","As Jim will discuss in his remarks, our new capital expenditure forecast reflects revised $1.6 billion of cost of the project we announced in October and also allows the vast majority of the construction to take place in 2017 and 2018. As you probably know, Northern Pass is one of two projects connected to Eversource that were bid into the joint state RFP.","As shown on slide nine, the other project is the Clean Energy Connect. This project involves construction of the new 600 megawatt, 25 mile transmission line between a transmission substation we own in Hinsdale, Massachusetts and a transmission substation in Easton, New York State. This project will utilize a back-to-back HVDC converters to ensure deliverability into New England.","We are developing it with Brookfield, and Iberdrola, and EDP Renewables. These partners already have a presence in New York. They've not been specific about the cost, but our share, which is entirely a transmission investment, will be more than $400 million.","If approved as part of the RFP, we expect this project to be built in the 2018 through 2020 timeframe, and for our investment to earn returns consistent with FERC-regulated transmission investments. Each of the three states involved in the Clean Energy RFP; Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island will go through a process to select the winning bids and submit them to regulators for approval. The RFP schedule is on slide 10.","As you can see, we expect contracts with the successful bidders to be executed by the end of the third quarter and for the contracts to be approved by the end of this year. We believe that the two projects we are jointly proposing represent the region's best options for low-cost, firm, reliable and non-carbon emitting resources.","Regarding Northern Pass, our bids into the RFP does not change in any respect the significant benefits this project will provide to the host state of New Hampshire. Our Forward New Hampshire plan remains in place. We anticipate $80 million per year in energy savings to New Hampshire, additional savings specific to New Hampshire as a result of a power purchase agreement with HQ, a commitment to hire New Hampshire workers first, a $200 million fund to support economic development and community initiatives, as well as other benefits.","I'll now turn to slide 11 and the Access Northeast project we plan to build with our partners, Spectra Energy and National Grid. To remind you, Access Northeast is a $3 billion project to upgrade the existing Algonquin pipeline and add 6.8 billion cubic feet of LNG storage in Acushnet, Massachusetts to bring firm gas supplies to power generators in New England. Our share of the Access Northeast project is 40% or $1.2 billion.","FERC has accepted the pre-filing we made last year and we're continuing to submit information on the project to FERC as part of that process. In January, FERC staff completed 13 open houses on the project in the region. We plan to make our formal application filing late this year to meet our initial in-service date of 2018. The project is designed to add 900 million cubic feet per day of natural gas supplies to serve the region's power generators during cold winter periods. That will allow up to 5,000 additional megawatts of the region's most efficient and low-cost units to remain online when winter temperatures drop, saving New England customers approximately $1.5 billion to $2 billion in a typical winter, and approximately $3 billion in an extreme winter such as 2013, 2014.","The Access Northeast builds off the existing Algonquin footprint, which already touches 60% of the power generation in New England, a percentage that will grow as new proposed plans are built. The project allows direct last mile deliveries to the power plants to ensure greater reliability and cost benefits. The business models that the electric utility signed pipeline capacity contracts for up to 20 years with Access Northeast and then retain an independent capacity manager to market that capacity to generators.","Without Access Northeast, those generators are frequently unable to run their units during cold weather when the region's existing pipeline capacity is used primarily to heat homes and businesses. The large amount of new pipeline capacity is set aside to meet the needs of natural gas generators, we can depend less on more costly and higher-emitting coal and oil plants that typically run when the region's natural gas supplies run shot.","We have made significant progress in the past three months. The status of securing approval of contracts with the wind and electric distribution companies is on slide 12. Following an RFP this past fall that attracted a number of bids, NSTAR Electric and Western Mass Electric filed with the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities in December seeking approval of contracts for pipeline and storage capacity with Access Northeast. The two utilities asked for a decision by October 1 of this year.","The National Grid's two Massachusetts electric distribution companies, Massachusetts Electric and Nantucket Electric, made a similar filing with the DPU on January 15. Once approved by the Department of Public Utilities, these contracts will account for nearly 45% of the Access Northeast targeted capacity.","In Connecticut, the natural gas capacity RFP will be run the State Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, or DEEP. We expect this process to be complete later this year.","In New Hampshire, the Public Utilities Commission issued an order on January 19 in which they accepted a staff report that concluded that the PUC had sufficient authority to approve electric distribution contracts for natural gas supplies if those contracts are shown to be in the customers' interest.","If the PUC Commission has agreed with the staff that they have sufficient authority to approve such agreements, they would then determine whether the specific contracts submitted were in the customers' best interest.","In Maine, where regulators have been engaged on the natural gas contracting issue for some time, bidders were given an opportunity to refresh their proposals in December. State regulators are scheduled to reach a decision on recommended solutions by mid-year.","In Rhode Island, National Grid issued an RFP in November. At the same time, the Massachusetts electric distribution companies issued their RFP. We expect National Grid to make a decision and file in the coming months with Rhode Island.","In the Vermont, the state has expressed support for additional natural gas infrastructure, but its level of participation has yet to be determined. We expect that the state processes will be concluded this fall so that we can file our formal application with FERC before the end of 2016. We continue to believe that Access Northeast offers an excellent near-term and long-term answer to the region's intensifying winter energy supply challenges.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim.","James J. Judge - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Lee, and I'd also like to thank you all for joining us this morning. Turning to slide 14, I'll start by covering our financial and operating results for the fourth quarter and the year, our 2016 outlook and long-term EPS growth expectations through 2019, current regulatory developments in the absence of rate case activity for the next 12 to 18 months, and I'll conclude with a brief overview of how we've delivered on the commitments that we made to investors in recent years.","Let's start with the fourth quarter. As you can see from slide 15, earnings, excluding integration costs, were $0.60 per share in the fourth quarter 2015 compared with earnings of $0.72 per share in the fourth quarter of last year. The $0.60 per share is consistent with the guidance that we gave on the third quarter earnings call and consistent with the updated Street estimates that have been published this year.","Electric distribution and generation earnings declined by $0.07 per share to $0.28 per share in the fourth quarter 2015. Higher retail electric revenue, mostly due to the December 2014 Connecticut Light & Power distribution rate decision, added about $0.05 per share to earnings, but that impact was offset by higher property taxes and depreciation expense due to higher plant balances and higher amortization expense due to the amortization of CL&P's deferred storm balance.","Earnings for NSTAR Electric and Public Service in New Hampshire, which do not have revenue decoupling, were lower due to milder weather. Earnings in this segment were also lower due to a higher effective tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared with the same period last year. On the consolidated basis, our effective tax rate was approximately 39.4% in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared with 35.4% in the fourth quarter a year ago. The higher rate lowered consolidated earnings in the quarter by about $0.04 per share.","As expected, transmission earnings were down $0.03 per share in the fourth quarter of 2015 due to the absence of the fourth quarter 2014 reversal of a reserve related to FERC's review of the New England transmission ROEs. The historically mild temperatures this past December were the primary reason for a $13.2 million or $0.04 per share decline in our natural gas segment earnings. Lower natural gas revenues alone cost us $0.03 per share, despite having 2% more heating customers in the fourth quarter of 2015.","Average temperatures in Boston and Hartford were 10 to 12 degrees warmer than average in December. As a result, our firm natural gas sales were down 16% in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared with a fairly mild fourth quarter of 2014. Parent and other improved by $0.02 per share compared with the fourth quarter of 2014.","I'll now turn to full year results. Excluding integration charges, we earned $2.81 per share this year compared with $2.65 in 2014. 2015 results were consistent with our guidance of $2.80 to $2.85 per share and also consistent with recently updated Street estimates.","As you can see in the news release, the most significant driver of earnings growth in 2015 was higher electric revenue, which added $0.39 per share to our results compared with last year. The primary driver was approximately $150 million distribution rate increase for Connecticut Light & Power. We also benefited from a 0.3% increase in retail electric sales. Those higher revenues were offset in part by higher property taxes, depreciation and the CL&P storm amortization expense in 2015.","Higher electric transmission earnings also contributed to improved year end results. Our transmission segment earned $0.96 per share in 2015 compared with $0.93 in 2014, benefiting in part from a higher level of investment in the business.","As a result of our robust capital program, our transmission rate base was approximately $5.2 billion at the end of 2015 compared with $4.9 billion at the end of 2014. Those benefits were partially offset by FERC's decision last year to lower the base transmission ROE in New England to 10.57% from the previous 11.14% and to cap our ROEs on any reliability project, regardless of previously approved incentives at 11.74%.","As we've said in the past, those changes have reduced our effective transmission ROE, including incentives, to approximately 11.5%.","Turning to our natural gas distribution business, after a very strong start, our year end 2015 results were almost identical to those that we recorded in 2014. For the year, due to the warm fourth quarter, firm natural gas sales were down 1% after being up 8.4% in the first quarter of 2015. On a weather-normalized basis, sales rose 2.5% for the year. Parent and other results were down $0.01 for the year.","Two other items worth mentioning in 2015 were the benefits of lower O&M and the negative impact of a higher effective tax rate. Lower non-tracked O&M added $0.08 to earnings in 2015. This follows a $0.23 per share benefit in 2014 and a $0.05 per share benefit in 2013. Altogether, we have reduced our O&M by about $250 million since the merger closed in 2012.","Offsetting much of that benefit was a higher effective tax rate in 2015, which lowered earnings by about $0.06 per share as compared with the previous year. So, in spite of the warm fourth quarter, we were still able to grow earnings for the year by $0.16 per share or 6% in 2015.","Turning from the financial slide to operations, as you can see on slide 16, our key reliability statistics have dramatically improved and are record levels, as Tom mentioned. Since 2011, the number of months between interruptions and the speed of restoration when outages do occur have both improved by about 40%. We are well up in the top quartile of our peers, so very proud of this accomplishment.","This closes our 2015 discussion. Let's move on to 2016. On slide 17, you can see we've established an earnings per share range of $2.90 to $3.05 this year. The biggest year-over-year benefit will come from growth of our transmission rate base. The second biggest positive driver will be the natural gas segment. We expect that segment to benefit from a continued increase in natural gas heating customers, various capital initiatives for which we have trackers, and a $15.8 million base rate increase that was effective at NSTAR Gas on January 1 of this year.","Other drivers include lower O&M. In the first quarter of this year, we will migrate our legacy payroll and benefits system to a single IT platform, which we've already done with our accounting and our outage management systems. Consolidating to a single system is expected to significantly improve efficiency and lower cost in the future. Offsetting these benefits are continued increases in depreciation, property taxes and modestly higher interest costs, reflecting continued investment in our distribution systems.","From 2016, let's turn to the longer term in slide 18. We estimate that we can grow earnings per share by 5% to 7% annually over the 2015 to 2019 forecast period. This compares with our previous growth rate of 6% to 8% for the 2014 to 2018 period. Nearly all of that change is attributable to the five-year extension of bonus depreciation for tax purposes recently passed by Congress. We estimate that bonus depreciation alone is lowering our growth rate by approximately 1%.","Components of the 5% to 7% growth are similar to what has driven the 7.2% annual earnings growth since our 2012 merger. We've also noted our key assumptions about major projects, which include the completion of Northern Pass in 2019 and the construction of Access Northeast in 2018 and 2019. Because significant Access Northeast construction is expected to continue beyond our forecast period, we anticipate that it'll contribute to earnings growth in both 2020 and 2021 as well.","Electric transmission capital expenditures and rate base growth are the primary drivers of our attractive earnings growth projection. Turning to slide 19, you can see that capital expenditure projections are up significantly from the forecast we showed you a year ago.","To begin, I should note that our transmission capital expenditures totaled $807 million in 2015. That's about $67 million above our projection at this time last year. We now show nearly $5 billion of electric transmission investment from 2015 through 2019. As we do every year, we have again identified transmission investments that we didn't have in the plan one year ago. We've added about $800 million of new investment, $200 million of that increase involves our previously announced increase in the Northern Pass project. We are projecting transmission capital expenditures of $911 million in 2016, $880 million of which will be spent on reliability related transmission projects at our four regulated electric companies.","Two of the largest initiatives, the Greater Boston and Greater Hartford projects, involve dozens of individual projects and are described more fully in the transmission slides in our Appendix. Those expenditures are helping to drive the significant improvements in reliability and transmission earnings growth in 2016.","You can see that we expect little capital spending on Northern Pass in 2016, but considerable expenditures in 2017 and 2018, consistent with the schedule that Lee gave you earlier. These capital expenditure projections do not reflect our spending on the Clean Energy Connect project Lee discussed earlier, which we expect to contribute to earnings growth from 2018 to 2021. We continue to work on both Clean Energy Connect and other potential projects that we expect to be approved.","As a result, the arrow on the slides shows that we do not expect a significant decline in transmission spending in 2019, but we have not included all of the potential projects that are likely to be built that year. Because we are in a competitive bidding process, we are not providing a total cost of the Clean Energy Connect project or a year-by-year estimate for capital expenditures. We hope to provide that to you should the project be selected.","Let's turn to slide 20. On the left-hand side, this slide shows our capital program, excluding both Access Northeast and Clean Energy Connect. From 2016 through 2019, we expect to invest $9.2 billion in New England's energy infrastructure, including $3.9 billion in transmission that I mentioned earlier.","You can see that electric and natural gas distribution capital totaled about $1.2 billion every year during that period. A slide in the appendix shows that investments in our natural gas delivery system will comprise a rising percentage of that investment.","On the right-hand side, we have estimated the pace of our $1.2 billion projected investment in the Access Northeast project, which costs a total of $3 billion. Our FERC application indicates that elements of Access Northeast will be phased into service between late 2018 and 2021.","On slide 21, we illustrate how the composition of our rate base is expected to change by the end of 2019. About $2.5 billion of the $3.6 billion of rate base growth over the next four years is expected to come from electric transmission. By the end of 2019, we expect that electric transmission will comprise 42% of our total rate base. And if our Access Northeast and Clean Energy Connect investments were included, it puts us at nearly 50% FERC-regulated company by the end of 2019. We believe that this rising percentage of FERC investments will result in an increasing ROE for Eversource Energy as a whole.","Slide 22 shows various initiatives that we expect to continue beyond our current four-year forecast. As I said earlier, we expect significant expenditures on Access Northeast, Clean Energy Connect and other projects we're working on. We also expect continued work on modernizing the electric grid in Massachusetts, assuming our $430 million five-year plan and capital tracker are approved by the state regulators we expect later this year.","A lot of initiatives are primarily tied to growing our natural gas distribution business. Turning to slide 23, you can see that despite declining oil prices, we added 11,415 new natural gas customers in 2015. This is about 7.5% ahead of 2014 and 4% ahead of our target for the year. The slide shows that we expect new heating customer growth to continue to accelerate over our forecast period and eventually reach about 16,000 per year, significantly aided by legislatively-endorsed initiatives in both Connecticut and Massachusetts. In 2016, we're projecting approximately 12,500 new natural gas heating customers, and Tom mentioned that one month into the year we're on plan.","Slide 24 reviews two important regulatory items that are currently pending. Hearings on the divestiture of our New Hampshire generation fleet were completed this week and we expect a decision within the next two months. Last week, a settlement was filed with certain advisory staff at the New Hampshire PUC, who had earlier supported a delay to the sale. They now support near-term divestiture.","Should the New Hampshire PUC authorize the divestiture, we expect the sale process and securitization to be completed later this year and early next year. As a reminder, we expect full recovery of approximately $700 million invested in New Hampshire generation by early 2017.","In December, the FERC Administrative Law Judge handling the second and third New England transmission ROE complaints requested some additional briefing on an aspect of the second complaint. So an initial recommendation by that ALJ was delayed from December 2015 to the end of March 2016. Because of that three month delay by the ALJ, we now expect to receive a decision from FERC on the two complaints in either late 2016 or early 2017.","As you can see on slide 25, we have no general rate cases currently pending for any of our six regulated distribution utilities. And while we do expect rate case activity next year, we expect that any decisions would not impact our financial results until the end of 2017 or early 2018. So we have very good visibility into our distribution company results for the next two years.","Turning to this year's financing calendar, 2016 is likely to be similar to last year. One benefit of bonus depreciation, of course, is that it lowers our cash tax obligation. In 2016, we will receive an estimated $250 million to $300 million in refunds from taxes paid in 2015. Additionally, we expect our cash tax liability for 2016 to be lowered by approximately $300 million as well. In 2017, bonus depreciation is estimated to lower our cash tax obligation by another $300 million.","Slide 26 shows the current distribution of S&P's electric utility credit ratings, with Eversource as the only A-rated parent company as a result of our upgrade last year. We've also noted on the slide several positive outlooks on other subsidiaries at both Fitch and Moody's.","Slide 27 shows the relative price performance of Eversource's shares versus the S&P 500 and the UTY, since our merger was announced more than four years ago. We're very proud of our total shareholder return, as well as our strong credit ratings. We strongly believe that financial strength and attractive shareholder returns can certainly both coexist and do at Eversource.","Slide 28 sums up what we have delivered to customers, policymakers and investors over the past four years. We committed that we'd exceed industry earnings per share and dividend growth rates and we delivered with growth rates that are two times the industry average for three years. We targeted O&M reductions of 3% to 4% and we achieved 5% per year for three years on average. We said we'd maintain the strong financial condition. We've done better than maintain. Three upgrades since the merger announcement has us with the only single A credit in our industry.","We committed to top-tier service and reliability, a 40% improvement in reliability has us now consistently in the top-quartile of our peers. We committed to grow and leverage our transmission and gas business. This morning, we've discussed the great portfolio of projects that will continue that great growth.","And finally, advancing energy policy in the region, our Access Northeast project, Northern Pass and Clean Energy Connect are game changers, cost effectively advancing the region's carbon reduction agenda effectively.","Eversource continues to be a very attractive offering for investors and we're confident it will continue to be in the years ahead.","Now, I'll turn the call back to Jeff.","Jeffrey R. Kotkin - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, Jim. And I'm going to turn the call back to John just to remind you how to enter questions. John?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll now begin the question-and-answer session.","Jeffrey R. Kotkin - Vice President-Investor Relations","All right. Thank you, John. First question this morning is from Greg Gordon from Evercore ISI. Good morning, Greg.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Good morning, guys. So, this whole bonus depreciation thing is a high-class problem, obviously significantly increases the cash flow even though it's a bit dilutive to rate base growth. But I'm just wondering, you said that the vast majority of the reduction in the growth rate is due to bonus and yet you've also significantly increased your capital expenditure budget, so, algebraically, that means that the overall growth rate is more than 1% lower before the offset of the higher capital plan. So, is bonus, in fact, the sole driver of that or are there other factors?","James J. Judge - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No. I would say that bonus is the sole driver of it. The numbers that I mentioned, Greg, $300 million a year, obviously the pancaking impact of that, when you look at 2015, 2016, 2017 and beyond, has a significant impact on our cumulative deferred income taxes, and we're obviously a purely regulated T&D company. So, it does impact our ability to earn. And I've seen a number of estimates out there where companies have \u2013 analysts have estimated that it's about a 1% increase on a company \u2013 decrease on a company like Eversource.","I would tell you this that, as you well know, that we have a long track record, Tom and I, 20 years of delivering on guidance either meeting or exceeding it. And the other thing that I've mention is we tend to provide data to the Street, forecasted data, capital expenditure data, that ties out to the dollar to projects that we have in the queue.","So, we have obviously updated the forecast for the projects that we have and the impact has been of a 5% to 7% growth rate is a better guidance for Wall Street, a more credible guidance than the 6% to 8% that we had previously.","That being said, I'll tell you that a year ago, we didn't provide capital expenditure numbers for Access Northeast and look how long that project \u2013 how far along that project has come. Three months ago at our third quarter call, we didn't provide any guidance. Clean Energy Connect wasn't even mentioned as a project and we now have that before the regulator to be approved.","So, we tend to find projects going forward. We don't put them into our plan until they're real. So, I think we have a very credible 5% to 7%, with some upside going forward.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Yeah. I agree. One last question. Are you electing to take bonus on Northern Pass, or are you going to choose to not take bonus on that particular project?","James J. Judge - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We have customers paying for it and it's largely a FERC type of formula and cost recovery mechanism. So, we would expect the benefits of bonus depreciation to be shared with customers.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay. Thank you, guys. Have a good morning.","Jeffrey R. Kotkin - Vice President-Investor Relations","Yeah. Thanks, Greg. Next question is from Dan Eggers from Credit Suisse. Good morning, Dan.","Daniel L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hey. Good morning, guys. Just following up on Greg's question on the bonus depreciation side. You think about in 2016 and 2017, you'll bring in about $900 million of bonus cash and then you've got the proceeds from the New Hampshire sale or securitization coming in probably early 2017. How are you guys thinking about kind of using that incremental pile of cash relative to old expectations where you didn't need equity without having that cash coming?","James J. Judge - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, we still don't need equity. And that's obviously cash that can be redeployed towards projects. That's capital. That's shareholder capital. And if it turns out that we can't redeploy it towards new projects, we certainly would consider giving it back to shareholders in the form of increased dividends or more effectively through a share buyback, if need be.","Daniel L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","I mean, I guess, how are you accounting for that extra cash in the growth rate? Are you assuming that it kind of accumulates on the balance sheet or is that \u2013 is there some redeployment assumption in the underlying growth rate?","James J. Judge - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","In the underlying growth rate, we actually are very, very cash strong. And so, again, absent another project to invest it in, we assume a share buyback would be the best application of it.","Daniel L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. And I guess, Tom, the merger has been very successful for you, guys. You've executed on what you had laid out when you did the deal, had a very convenient name change along the way. How do you think about M&A at this juncture? And given your success thus far, is this something you could take on the road again?","Thomas J. May - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We have a very strong company. We are also in a very exciting place in New England. You get a sense of what \u2013 you have a sense of what we're telling you and you don't a sense it's on our to-do list, but there is a lot happening in New England and it's pretty exciting. And that's why, as Jim said, we'll have fun with capital allocations. We hope there are more and more projects to deploy our excess capital in, but if not, we're very flexible and we're very shareholder-oriented.","On the M&A side, I'll just say that we've always been big believers that consolidation in our industry makes sense. However, we have also been very selective with respect to what makes sense for our shareholders and for our customers. And we do believe that, and I think we've proved it over the years that you can actually spend less money operating a business and provide world-class service and improve service along the way by using size and scale and technology. But things are pretty overheated right now. We do believe that you go through ebbs and flows. There'll be opportunities. Right now, we're focused on executing the plan we put in front of you.","Daniel L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Got it. Thank you, guys.","Jeffrey R. Kotkin - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Dan. Our next question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from UBS. Good morning, Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning. Can you hear me?","Jeffrey R. Kotkin - Vice President-Investor Relations","Yeah, absolutely.","Thomas J. May - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Excellent. So, I wanted to dig in a little bit more on the Clean Energy Connect. Admittedly, I know it might be challenging. But first, just to get a sense, is this connected to firm renewables back in New York? Just could you talk about the project a little bit just in terms of how we should think about it?","And then on the financials, if you can elaborate, is it accruing AFUDC, whatever construct you've devised with your partners? And then in terms of the return, would it be fair to continue to say, this is a FERC like return on a typical equity ratios we think about, at least preliminarily the $400 million you've contemplated?","Leon J. Olivier - EVP-Enterprise Energy Strategy and Business Development","Yeah, Julien. This is Lee Olivier. Yeah, in regards to the project itself, it really is designed around getting existing run-of-river renewable plans that are in place in New York and building new wind, and as you can see from our partners from Iberdrola, EDP would build new wind.","And getting that combined power, so you can firm up the wind with the hydropower such that when you have a transmission line going into New England, you have 100% deliverability into the region and you have very, very high capacity factors of utilization across that line to the extent of 80% to 90% utilization. It would accrue AFUDC and it would garner FERC-like returns.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. All right. Excellent. And then just turning over to the conversions \u2013 the oil conversion side of the equation, I'd just be curious, you talked about continued strength, particularly on the back of your reasonable winter thus far, moderate, shall we say, but what's the normalized trend of late? I'd be curious, given how low oil prices are of late, is there something to be concerned about as we think about a more normalized weather pattern for the next 2016, 2017 winter that we should be thinking about a slowdown at all?","James J. Judge - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No. I mean, the forecast that we've provided on slide 23, we continue to be comfortable with. If you look at each of the years, 2013, 2014, and 2015, we exceeded the targets that we have provided. And even given the dramatic reduction in oil prices that existed for most of 2015, we have great opportunity, primarily because of a lack of penetration down in Connecticut. It's significantly underpenetrated and we feel pretty good about our target for 2016 and achieving it as well.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","So, perhaps said differently, the penetration level was such that there are still clear economic benefits for customers to continue to switch at the same pace they have, or at least you're confident in the ability to garner the same conversion pace that you have historically?","James J. Judge - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I think the payback for a conversion is more challenging than it was a year or two ago, but we've got some more aggressive marketing and the carbon benefits of gas versus oil are compelling to customers as well. So, I'm not going to suggest that it's not more challenging than it was a year or two ago, but we still feel pretty good about our ability to execute.","Thomas J. May - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","It's interesting. Anything is new construction anywhere on our territory. They want natural gas for heating. It actually adds value to the house. There are studies that shown that the houses are selling for $10,000 or $20,000 more, if instead of having an old oil tank on your property, you have a pipe that without trucks pulling up and down your street.","But we're seeing lots of communities that are actually encouraging us to come in and help them reduce their carbon footprint. We call it the three Ps. They don't require us to make permit fees. They don't require us to have police details, and what's \u2013 on paving. They don't make us pave curb to curb. Typically when you go in and cut a street to put a pipe down in for a neighborhood, they want you to pave curb to curb. They'll say, hey, we'll let you patch that cut and therefore reduce the price to come in and bring this gas to our neighbor. So, interestingly, the demand is still there, but as you say, the payback for a customer is quite different and therefore, you have to find different ways to turn it into a monthly payment rather than a big lump sum.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","And then last, a quick clarification, is the 5% to 7%, the Clean Energy Connect, is it in there and how do you think about it?","James J. Judge - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","It is in there, but again, the CapEx spend there is $18 million to $21 million. So, it doesn't move the dial much one way or another. It's a small piece of the financials out in 2018, 2019.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Fair enough. Thank you.","Jeffrey R. Kotkin - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Julien. Next question is from Travis Miller from Morningstar. Good morning, Travis.","Travis Miller - Morningstar Research","Good morning. Thank you. I was wondering as we talk more about these renewables, they look three to five years out, obviously you have a lot of transmission spend opportunity. So I was wondering if you could elaborate on potential upside for the distribution side of the electric. Distribution side, is there upside in your plan? Is there additional in terms of integrating all of that renewable energy that will come in through the transmission projects?","James J. Judge - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. Travis, this is Jim. We mentioned that we spend about $1.2 billion a year on the distribution system, that's gas and electric, but in particular, we have a slide that references this grid modernization plan. It's $430 million of spending over the next five years. Included in there is advanced sensing technology, a next generation fault circuit indications, and those sorts of things, but a good part of the spend there has to do with making it easier for distributed resources to be tapped into the system and provided for. So, that's a filing that's before the regulator in Massachusetts currently and we expect the plan to be approved later this year.","Travis Miller - Morningstar Research","Okay. That's all I had. Thank you.","Jeffrey R. Kotkin - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Travis. Our next question is from Shar Pourreza from Guggenheim. Good morning, Shar.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Partners","Hey, Jeff. Hey. Good morning, everyone.","Thomas J. May - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Partners","So just real quick question on the growth. So, you kind of had the regulatory mechanisms at the utilities and you sort of assume Northern Pass and Access Northeast are on schedule. So, what's sort of the driver to get you to the top end or exceed your updated growth trajectory, or sort of how should we think about the bottom or top end of that range?","James J. Judge - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, what I would say, Shar, is that, obviously, if all the projects go forward as planned, we would be higher in that 5% to 7% range, but I do think that we have some flexibility in that range, such that if one of the projects didn't go forward, I think we'd still be able to achieve the lower end of that range.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Partners","Okay. Got it. So if your projects are on schedule, you can essentially hit the mid-point of your old range?","James J. Judge - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Or beyond.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Partners","Excellent. Thanks.","Jeffrey R. Kotkin - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Shar. Next question's from Mike Lapides from Goldman. Good morning, Mike.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, guys. Good morning. A couple of housekeeping-related questions. First of all, in 2016 guidance, what are you assuming for O&M cost management on controllable O&M?","James J. Judge - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Michael, this is Jim. We are basically providing estimates of 2% to 3% long-term and there'll be some variability year-to-year. We're not giving a spot-specific number for 2016, but you've seen our performance to-date and you can assume that that 2% to 3%, you can take to the bank.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Well, I mean, actually, you've done a really good job of just completely blowing right past that 2% to 3% a year in the first couple of years post-merger. Just trying to get my arms around what would drive a fundamental slowdown in the O&M cost savings or are you just being a little bit on the conservative side about your ability to manage cost structure post-merger?","James J. Judge - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, we've been giving guidance historically of 3% to 4% and we've exceeded it. So 2% to 3%, I guess, reflects a little bit of a slowdown, but we do see ample opportunity. Eventually, you go from merger synergies, which I think we've largely achieved, into achieving savings just by good cost discipline across the organization. And that's the phase that we're in now.","Tom and I mentioned some of the IT system conversions that are taking place currently that will fuel savings going forward. And our operations area, the standardization that takes place is assured to provide us some additional savings. So we feel good about it, but obviously the 2% to 3% is an indication that it has tempered a little bit from what we've got the first few years.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. And can you frame for us a little bit just the difference in the second and third FERC ROE complaints relative to the one that already lowered your ROE? And if so, what's kind of the \u2013 if complainants get what they ask for or if staff gets what they're kind of nodding towards? What the impact on earnings power and the growth rate would be?","James J. Judge - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, the filings that we've made, the initial briefs that were filed and updated at FERC, the position of the New England transmissions owners is that, if you do the math, similar to what was done by FERC in complaint number one, that the ROE would be 10.24%. And if you did the math the same way for complaint number three, it will be 10.9%. If you average those two, you get to where we at currently, 10.57%. So, we would expect and hope that FERC would realize that there hasn't been a dramatic change in what they approved over a year ago in terms of a base ROE. The same logic applies on the cap as well. The 11.74% sits well within what the math would show from applying the new methodology at FERC to the timeframes that were considered for complaint two or three.","Obviously, there's a series of conflicting testimony, I guess, from the consumer advocates groups and from FERC staff that would have slightly lower numbers, but we feel pretty good about our prospects in terms of the case that were presented.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thanks, guys. Much appreciated and congrats on a good year.","Jeffrey R. Kotkin - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Michael. Next question's from Praful Mehta from Citi. Good morning, Praful.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Good morning. Hi, guys. So, I just had two quick questions. One was on Northern Pass. And just want to understand, if there were delays in the Northern Pass, CapEx plan and implementation, are there other levers to fill the hole in terms of EPS, or is there going to be an impact to EPS, as you see it today?","James J. Judge - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. This is Jim, Praful. As I mentioned, we come up with projects that we don't even have on the drawing board. We're looking at other projects currently. And you're asking me if Northern Pass, the $1.6 billion, was significantly delayed, what would we backfill it with? I would assume that by the time we get out to 2017, 2018 and 2019, there will be new projects, but right now, they have not been defined. I haven't reached the stage where we would include them in our plan.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Fair enough. Got it. And secondly, in terms of capital allocation, you've talked about excess the cash that you have, the bonus depreciation, and one of the options could be share buybacks. From a timing perspective, how do you see that decision playing out? Do you kind of wait and see if you have new projects in 2016, 2017? And if you don't, and if you have excess cash, you do the buyback? I'm just trying to figure out how does that sequence of events go and when does that decision take place to actually do buybacks.","James J. Judge - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. We will look at that on a year-to-year basis. Obviously, we have not announced a share buyback. We don't anticipate one in 2016. We think we have potential application of this excess cash in years beyond that. But if we don't, it's clearly capital that deservedly would go back to shareholders and we consider a share buyback, but it's basically a year-to-year decision.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Got you. Thank you, guys.","Jeffrey R. Kotkin - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you. Our next question's from Steve Fleishman from Wolfe. Good morning, Steve.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi. Good morning. Just briefly in the context of the bonus depreciation and the plan that you're giving us, maybe you could just talk about how the balance sheet or cash flow metrics look under this plan as it is versus maybe you had before to kind of fill in the whole picture.","James J. Judge - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, we certainly think that the cash flow numbers improved, given the bonus depreciation, the lack of tax payments that need to be made. We fully expect to maintain the strong single-A credit that we have achieved to-date. So, I think the credit metrics would reflect that.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Jeffrey R. Kotkin - Vice President-Investor Relations","All right. Thanks, Steve. We don't have any more questions this morning, so we want to thank you very much for joining us. If you have any follow-up questions, please give us a call. Thanks and enjoy the rest of the winter. We'll see you at a couple of the conferences.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

You may begin.","James Judge","Thank you, Paulette. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. I'm Jeff Kotkin, Eversource Energy's VP for Investor Relations. During this call, we'll be referencing slides that we posted last night on our website. And as you can see on Slide 1, some of the statements made during this investor call may be forward-looking as defined within the meaning of the Safe Harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risk and uncertainty, which may cause the actual results to differ materially from forecasts and projections. These factors are set forth in the news release issued yesterday. Additional information about the various factors that may cause actual results to differ can be found in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, and our Form 10-Q for the 3 months ended March 31, 2019. ","Additionally, our explanation of how and why we use certain non-GAAP measures is contained within our news release and the slides that we posted last night and in our most recent 10-K. Speaking today will be Phil Lembo, our Executive Vice President and CFO. Also joining us today are Werner Schweiger, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; John Moreira, our Treasurer and Senior Vice President for Finance and Regulatory; Jay Buth, our VP and Controller; and Mike Ausere, our VP for Business Development. ","Now I will turn to Slide 2 and turnover the call to Phil.","Philip Lembo","Thank you, Jeff, and today I'm going to cover our second quarter 2019 financial results, provide an update on key regulatory dockets, review our financing activity and discuss several developments concerning our region support for offshore wind development. ","So starting with the quarter on Slide 2, you can see that we recorded an after-tax impairment charge of approximately $205 million in the quarter relating to our Northern Pass Transmission Project. It was driven by an adverse ruling we received on the July 19 from the New Hampshire Supreme Court. The court upheld last year's rejection on a permit for Northern Pass that was issued by the New Hampshire Site Evaluation Committee. Although we've received the vast majority of permits we need to build Northern Pass, the New Hampshire Site Evaluation Committee approval was critical to moving the project ahead. While we continue to consider Northern Pass a very beneficial project for both New Hampshire and all of New England, for both an economic as well as an environmental perspective. We see no near-term path for the project's success and have no plans to pursue it further. ","Excluding Northern Pass charge, we are at $0.74 per share for the quarter compared with earnings of $0.76 in the second quarter of 2018. Transmission earnings totaled $0.37 per share in the second quarter of 2019 and excluding the Northern Pass impairment, compared with earnings of $0.35 in the same period of 2018. The improvement was due to the increased level of transmission facilities in our rate base. In the first half of 2019, transmission capital expenditures at our 3 electric utilities totaled $447 million, and we continue to forecast core utility transmission investments of nearly $1 billion for the full year. ","Our electric distribution segment earned $0.33 per share in the second quarter of '19 compared with earnings of $0.32 in the second quarter in '18. Previously approved rate increases at Connecticut Light & Power and NSTAR Electric were mostly offset by higher operations and maintenance and depreciation expense. Also second quarter 2019 results were down by about $0.01 per share due to the divestiture of our New Hampshire generating facilities in 2018. Our natural gas distribution segment had a small loss in the second quarter of '19, compared with earnings of $0.02 in the second quarter of 2018. The decrease was primarily related to the implementation of revenue decoupling in 2019 as well as modestly higher O&M cost.","As I mentioned during our first quarter earnings call, the implementation of decoupling as a result of the Yankee Gas settlement last year boosted Yankee Gas results in the first quarter heating period by about $0.03. But it would be slightly negative to neutral in other quarters compared to 2018, and as we expected, we saw a $0.02 negative impact from the implementation of the new seasonal decoupling mechanism in the second quarter and expect another $0.02 negative impact in the third quarter, but a positive pickup in the fourth quarter. ","In our water distribution segment, earnings were up by about $800,000 in the second quarter of 2019 compared with the same period in 2018, and totaled $0.02 per share. The higher earnings primarily reflected recovery of increased level of investment in the Aquarion system in the outcome of our Massachusetts rate review last year. And a continued focus on realizing operational cost efficiencies throughout the organization. ","Our parent and other segment earned $0.02 per share in the second quarter of '19 compared with earnings of $0.05 per share in the second quarter of '18. The decline was due in part to higher interest expense. We had a comparable results in the second quarter of both 2019 and '18 relating to the marking to market of our investment in certain renewable energy facilities. ","Overall, we earned $1.71 per share in the first half of '19, improving the Northern Pass impairment charge, compared with earnings of $1.61 per share in the first half of 2018. That's a 6.2% increase. Excluding the charge, we remain on target to earn between $3.40 and $3.50 per share for the year, which is consistent with our long-term earnings growth rate of 5% to 7%, which we are also reaffirming today. ","Moving from our earnings discussion to key operating performance results. Our continued intense focus on safety continues to show strong results. Our record is among the best in the industry this year with our safety rate commonly known as days away restricted time at about 0.6 through June. Our electric reliability continues to trend very strong with months between interactions performance at the very highest levels amongst industry peers. Overall, we are very pleased with our operating performance metrics for the year. ","Turning to recent regulatory activity. On June 27, New Hampshire regulators approved a settlement, which had been reached with the Public Utilities Commission staff in the office of consumer advocate to implement a $28.3 billion temporary increase in annualized public service in New Hampshire base distribution rates. The temporary increase will go into rates for customers on August 1 and will remain in effect until permanent rates take effect in the middle of the year, next year. Our application for a permanent rate increase was filed in late May and request a $70 million annualized increase in base rates, which incorporates our temporary rate request. ","Also in New Hampshire, as you can see on Slide 3, it refers to the 1.7-megawatt battery storage project in Westmoreland, New Hampshire, a rural heavily tree group that our radio distribution circuit must follow to serve growth. The $7 million battery project provides a cost-effective alternative to a new distribution line. We've discussed in the past, we've already started with 2 battery storage projects that were approved in Massachusetts, the Outer Cape and Martha's Marcus Vineyard projects represent $55 million of investment, 30 megawatts of capacity and 58-megawatt hours of supply. Local stakeholders have been very supportive of the projects, and we expect to receive all necessary land use permits by the end of the year. These projects will increase reliability and in the case of the Vineyard, significantly reduce dependence on high cost and high emissions diesel generation. We expect to have both projects in operation before the end of next year. ","In Connecticut, we continue to wait peers' decision on this great modernization docket. In addition to Advanced Metering Infrastructure or AMI, we expect that decision to provide us with guidance from peer on the types of investments to be pursued as well as the regulatory construct for renewing such investments. We already have been evaluating a number of potential CL&P battery storage projects for consideration pending peers' decision on the grid mod docket. In the recently completed session of the Connecticut legislature, lawmakers clarified existing statutes to explicitly allow regulated utilities to participate in the ownership and construction of energy storage facilities that can be shown to benefit customers. ","With respect to our Massachusetts Electric Vehicle Charging Station program, we are on pace to complete our $45 million capital program that supports above 3,500 charging ports by the end of next year. We currently have more than 1,000 charging points on the contract and are on track to have secured commitments by the -- by year-end for nearly another 1,000 charging ports. A few weeks ago, we announced that some of the charging ports would be located at 7 Mass Audubon Wildlife Sanctuaries in the state. We are poised to propose a similar Electric Vehicle Charging program in Connecticut pending guidance from regulators on a broader review of grid mod. ","In New Hampshire, we are working with state agencies and the state other utilities to develop a public private partnership that would leverage publicly available funds with utility infrastructure investment to set up a fast charging carter in the state. ","Turning to financing on Slide 4. We had a very significant level of financing activity in the second quarter. On June 4, we closed on the sale of approximately $1.3 billion of new common equity, the price per share was $72.50. The sale included a forward-sale arrangement that delays issuance of about 12 million of those nearly 18 million shares. The forward sale will settle on or before May 29 of 2020. We're thrilled with the investors response to the offerings, more than 60 institutional investors participated and demand for the shares was about 3.5x the supply. We're also pleased with -- the price performance since then has performed very well immediately and for the longer term asset we offer. We expect the sales to be the only block issuance for Eversource shares during our 5-year forecast period. We expect to issue another $700 million of shares through an at-the-market program later in the forecast period as our funding needs develop. This would complete the $2 billion of new equity through 2023 that we first discussed during our February earnings call. ","As we discussed earlier, we also expect to utilize approximately $100 million of treasury shares each year through 2023 to meet our dividend reinvestment and employee retirement plan requirements. Through July, we distributed about 750,000 treasury shares this year to meet those planned requirements. I will cover our recent offshore wind RfP award in New York later, but I believe it's important to state here that we do not expect to issue additional blocks of equity like we did back in May even after considering the 880-megawatt award in New York. Should there be any future equity need beyond the current forecast period, we expect it to be minor given the significant cash flows that we expect from the South Fork and Revolution Wind projects as they enter service beginning in 2022. And it would most likely be satisfied through a small at-the-market issuance program if needed. ","On the long-term debt side, NSTAR Electric issued its first green bond in May, starting at $400 million of senior unsecured notes with a coupon of 3.25%. It was the tightest spread ever on an unsecured green bond in our industry and attracted some new investors to Eversource and a strong very sustainable investment profile. We had about 90 investors on the informal call interested just shortly before the issuance. While we are very pleased with the investor interest in our recent equity and debt issuances, we're also very disappointed with S&P's rating action last week concerning the Eversource system. We believe the combination of our robust financial profile; industry-leading cost management; strong operating history; our positive regulatory environment, which includes multiple multiyear settlements; and diverse regulatory jurisdiction exposure should have allowed us to preserve our previous ratings or at least limited any downgrades. Nonetheless, there are no electric utility holding company peers with higher ratings than Eversource at S&P, and we expect to continue to be able to finance at very favorable levels that will continue to benefit our customers. ","From financing, I'll turn it to offshore wind and on Slide 5. On July 18, New York governed Andrew Cuomo announced nearly 1,700 megawatts of offshore wind awards including 880 megawatts to Sunrise Wind, a partnership between Eversource and Orsted. 1,700 megawatts represented the largest offshore wind award to date in the United States and major first step in reaching New York's target of 9,000 megawatts by 2035. We are targeting an in-service date for our facilities of 2024, and we signed a memorandum of understanding with Con Ed and the New York Power Authority to work together on certain transmission facilities relating to our winning bid. We expect to complete negotiations with the state on a contract for the project within a few months, and as you can see from the slide, this is our second successful bid that we've made in New York with South Fork being the first and most advanced. ","This slide provides you with a summary of where we won contracts to date, where we are in the several siting process and when do we expect the facilities to enter service. In Rhode Island, the PUC issued its written decision in June approving 400-megawatt contract that's part of our Revolution Wind project. A contract for a separate 200 megawatts of offshore wind from Revolution was previously approved by Connecticut regulators and a contract for another 104 megawatts is now before PURA. ","In terms of future RFPs, I'll turn it to Slide 6. In Connecticut, Governor Lamont signed a bill on June 7 that authorized the state to procure another 2,000 megawatts of offshore wind by 2030, with an RFP for 400 megawatts starting within 2 weeks of the governor's signature. Preparation for the RFP is now underway and bids expected to be due in late September and awards in November. ","In Massachusetts, the state issued the Commonwealth second offshore wind RFP in May, requesting bids for at least 400 megawatts of offshore wind. But as they did in the first RFP, they said bidders can also offer up to 800 megawatts as little as 200 megawatts of offshore wind. We are currently evaluating the investment profile and time line for both the Connecticut and Massachusetts RFPs in order to develop and refine appropriate bid strategies. We continue to view our partnership with your Orsted, it's a terrific combination of 2 highly performing organizations that view risks, financial return thresholds and operating excellence similarly. Orsted is the largest and most successful developer of offshore wind in the world, renewing the largest utility with strong stakeholder relationships and the deepest knowledge of the region's bulk power delivery system and one of the industry's strongest financial profiles. This combination of attributes continues to make us very competitive in the region, offshore winds, solicitations. We continue to expect our offshore wind partnership will provide a significant source of earnings and cash flow growth as the offshore wind turbines enter service beginning in late 2022. We expect that the awards we have won will continue to enhance our current 5-year earnings growth profile as we move into 2024 and beyond. ","As we've noted previously, there likely will be increases in competition for future offshore wind solicitations in New England and New York. We do not expect to win all of the state solicitations that are ahead, but when we do need to win we are confident that it will be with a disciplined bid that will allow us to achieve returns that are well above those in our regulated business and commensurate with the profile of offshore wind business model. That concludes my comments, and now I'll turn the call back to Jeff.","Jeffrey Kotkin","And I'm going to turn the call over to Paulette just to remind you how to ask questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. I'll now turn the call back to Jeffrey Kotkin.","Jeffrey Kotkin","Thank you, Paulette. Our first question this morning is from Mike Weinstein from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Michael Weinstein","How much of the offshore wind -- I guess, at this point, is everything that has been announced already in the -- expected to be in that guidance range you've already put out there? Or is any of this now above where your guidance is?","Philip Lembo","Mike, this is Phil. Our current guidance of 5% to 7% range goes through to 2023, so as I've said before, when you get to 2023 we'll really only be South Fork, which will be fully in-service for year and then Revolution Wind will be coming in during the year. So those projects are baked into the guidance that we have. The Sunrise Wind will come in beyond what our current guidance period is, and we will pick that up when we update our guidance on our year-end earnings call.","Michael Weinstein ","And what kind of returns are you expecting in these investments at this point?","Philip Lembo","What we stated is that on a unlevered basis, Orsted has publicly stated that they target and we would support sort of an unlevered return of about 8% that translates into a midteens ROE if you are in the Eversource world.","Michael Weinstein ","Got you. And also has -- the rating agency action on the downgrade, does that have any material effect on your earnings guidance going forward?","Philip Lembo","No, it doesn't, Mike.","Jeffrey Kotkin","Thanks, Mike. Next question is from Sophie Karp from KeyBanc.","Sophie Karp","Just wanted to ask you philosophically, what is your appetite for a project similar to NTP and maybe scale and complexity outside of the offshore wind where obviously, you're participating. So how do you think about that going forward?","Philip Lembo","Well, Sophie, welcome to the Eversource call. Good to hear your voice. So our region has aggressive targets for carbon reduction and a strong appetite for Clean Energy Solutions. So there is nothing on the drawing board that we see right now other than the offshore wind opportunities that we're involved with, but I'm certain that in the future as the regions need change and as more Clean Energy requirements come into play that other projects could develop, but right now, there is nothing in our plan and nothing in the drawing board for the region that's not already been announced out there.","Sophie Karp","Got it. And then on the offshore wind, obviously, there has been headlines about the issues that [indiscernible] having with that permitting from the federal level. What are your thoughts on that? And obviously, you've given yourself way more time to deal with that as far as the time line goes, but generally if you could just give us some color or thoughts on how you expect the permitting process to shape up?","Philip Lembo","Sure, not knowing specifically what their situation is, the details would be in their court, but really from Eversource and Eversource-Orsted side, we recognize how important sighting and permitting is for the success of this project, and we are focused in our sighting efforts to filing complete sighting and permitting applications, really based on thorough offshore site investigations, we've done a lot. A lot of upfront work, our approach is to complete an extensive amount of survey work to this -- the fullest extent possible prior to submitting applications. We think that's the best way to make it through the permitting process. On our projects, we've had a fleet of survey vessels. We've spent millions of dollars to assess the characteristics around these areas. That's -- those are critical to the filing of a complete application. ","We were the first in the U.S. to develop and deploy these measurement BOVIS that are in our lease area to study wind speed and wave height. So we put a lot of effort into thoroughly investigating the sites before moving forward. We also understand that there is constituencies out there that you have to address, the fisheries industry. We have full-time liaisons. We've modified our wind farm layouts to avoid impacts in our designs. We were the first developer to announce changes in proposed turbine layouts based upon input from local fishermen. So that plus the fact that we were the first developer to partner with a group called Responsible Offshore Development Alliance and really it provides a unique partnership for how fishermen can provide direct input to us. So really that combined with the combined strength, I'd say, of the Eversource and Orsted teams in this area, I think, really is a differentiator.","Jeffrey Kotkin","Next question is from Steve Fleishman from Wolfe.","Steven Fleishman","So just a couple of things, first, Phil, could you just clarify the -- I think in the past the Revolution Wind even though it starts in 2023, it was not really going to benefit till after the forecast period, is that still the case?","Philip Lembo","That's correct, Steve.","Steven Fleishman","Okay. And then is there any information you can give on pricing for Sunrise Wind and -- or any idea when that will be made public?","Philip Lembo","As I've mentioned in my comments, we are probably a few months away from finalizing a contract with [indiscernible] and the expectation really is within 30 or 60 days after that. So after that period at some point there is an expected disclosure of pricing.","Steven Fleishman","Okay. And then just -- it sounds like maybe you could give a little more color on the comments on financing future growth in the offshore wind. So it sounds like -- a high level thought process is that as the first projects come on they generate cash flow that helps to basically fund the new growth and that's kind of high level how you are thinking about this?","Philip Lembo","In the early years of those, there's a significant amount of cash flow that's generated from projects once they go into service and that will be used to fund and finance some of the construction costs as we go forward and really -- so I think that helps us and that really gets to the conclusion that other than doing some minor at-the-market issuances we have no future needs for a block equity.","Steven Fleishman","Okay. So for example, that might be as you're going to book, you're going to get the ITC from those projects. And then you can kind of reinvest those into the growth projects.","Philip Lembo","Right, there's cash generated from the... Correct, correct. But really, that should -- as I've said, that, that should really -- if you take that and the success that we've had on the future project, that really should allow us to -- and we expect that our growth will accelerate beyond the midpoint of our 5% to 7% as we move forward here.","Steven Fleishman","Right. Okay, and then just one other question on the offshore wind. So just in terms of the actual booking of the accounting for the tax credit, how are you planning a rough sense of how you're planning to book the accounting of the ITCs?","Philip Lembo","Yes, the booking of it would be over the life of the asset or the life of the contract. So over a time period so -- or you could look at, so that's one option. The other is to do it over a 10-year period. So we're sort of looking at both of those at this stage.","Steven Fleishman","Okay, but it's going to be -- you're not going to -- you're definitely going to spread it out?","Philip Lembo","Yes, correct.","Jeffrey Kotkin","Our next question is from Praful Mehta from Citi.","Praful Mehta","So maybe just picking up on the tax side, just to clarify on the ITC, is the assumption that the sharing of the ITC and the depreciation, will that be based on the ownership percentage? Or is there a disproportional sharing or a tax equity component related to any of the tax credits?","Philip Lembo","So when you look at -- the partnership is a 50-50, and I guess, the best way to look at it is, you could -- there's many ins and outs and gives and takes, but the economic value is shared 50-50 between the 2 partners.","Praful Mehta","Right. So the economic value in total, so the combination, I'm assuming of cash flows and tax credits but you could split the tax credits different from the 50-50, is that a fair way to understand that?","Philip Lembo","Any category could be -- within the categories split differently than 50-50, but the -- if one category is 40% then another category has to be 60% to offset. So overall, all the categories that relate to the economic value are shared 50-50, but if not each one of them has to be 50-50.","Praful Mehta","Got you. And just remind us, your tax profile post the 2022 time frame, you are a full tax -- cash taxpayer at that time?","Philip Lembo","That's correct.","Praful Mehta","Got you. Understood. That's helpful. And then in terms of the equity offering, you've talked about 12 million shares being done over some time period. Is there any color you can provide on how to think about matching of the timing of the forward with when you would want to do it depending on when the CapEx kind of hits, just to understand that timing?","Philip Lembo","Sure. The forward was put out for a year, so the expectation is that by the end of May of next year that those 12 million shares would be issued.","Praful Mehta","I got you. So you delay that as much as you can effectively is the good way to think about that?","Philip Lembo","Yes, I think the best way to think about it is, we would assess what our needs are and what the opportunities are, and we, again, be opportunistic about when we do it. But we're not going to issue before we need it, that's correct.","Praful Mehta","Understood. And then finally just on the growth profile that you talked about, the 5% to 7%, there clearly wasn't any Northern Pass in your forecast through 2023, is that right from a growth perspective?","Philip Lembo","Right, the capital investment was removed from our plan, that is correct.","Praful Mehta","Right, but was there any underlying base earnings or any AFUDC or anything else in related Northern Pass that was in the plan?","Philip Lembo","Yes, there was. And I think we've talked about that, that there -- in addition to earning the return on the investment under the transmission service arrangement that we have that there was kind of $0.03 to $0.04 of AFUDC annually in that in our forecast. So we know that, that will not occur, but we are very comfortable and reaffirming back our 5% to 7% target, and I will say that for the remainder of this year because of the impairment that they'll probably be about $0.02 of AFUDC that have been booked, had the project been active that will -- we will not be reflecting, but that we will, as we always do, look for ways and I'm confident, that we'll find opportunities to offset that for the rest of this year and going forward.","Praful Mehta","Got you. Super helpful. And just to confirm, the 5% to 7%, so you're still comfortable within the midpoint of that range even throughout through 2023?","Philip Lembo","Yes, that is correct.","Jeffrey Kotkin","Next question is from Paul Patterson from Glenrock.","Paul Patterson","I wanted to touch base with you on offshore wind and this declining price cap legislation, I guess, sort of the amendments are sort of eliminated and just sort of how you view that in the context of offshore wind economics, I mean, kind of a dramatic move, I guess, on the part of the state legislature and the governor. How should we think about that in the context of, I guess, what Massachusetts is experiencing?","Philip Lembo","Thanks for the question, Paul. So late last night, I think, you're probably referring to or maybe you haven't caught up with yet that the cap in Massachusetts, there was legislation that I'm not sure the governor actually signed it earlier this morning or will be signing it, but effectively that does lift the cap for one year. So for the next -- for this upcoming solicitation, the cap in Massachusetts is removed and I think that's just recognition that there's many things that they hadn't thought of at the time when the cap was instituted, but they still are focused on cost going forward. So the legislation was passed by both the Senate and the House that removes the cap for this current solicitation. So there is no cap over the current solicitation.","Paul Patterson","And is that because, I guess, they feel that the economics are such that we might see higher prices in this upcoming solicitation as opposed to what was achieved previously? Is that safe to say?","Philip Lembo","Yes, I think there is recognition if you've kind of followed the different proposals that were out there, Paul. Folks really honed in on this, the tax credits changing, when they passed the legislation they were at 24% or 30%, and they've been reducing each year. So I think that there is a recognition that all of the things being equal if you lose or have lower tax credits that, that's going to impact the pricing. So rather than sort of engineering every particular aspect of the bid, they just decided it's easiest just remove the cap and -- for a year and then go forward.","Paul Patterson","Okay. And then on the Connecticut grid mod. I'm sorry, if I missed this. What's the timing that you're expecting on that?","Philip Lembo","Well, the -- I'll just give a little bit of history there that this was a docket that has been completed and all the testimony has been done, but in the interim, there's been some -- there was changes, Katie Dykes, who was the chair of the PURA has moved -- sort of been moved into a higher position and a new chair at Connecticut PURA then there was legislation in Connecticut to increase the size of PURA by adding 2 more commissioners. So there's been a little bit of evolution in the Connecticut PURA. So right now, we believe that is certainly one of the issues that is on the front burner of the agenda at the PURA, but it's hard to say precisely when we expect it, I mean, we do expect it to come out this year. And we have been working on proposals that we would bake in response to it, so that we are ready to go when something does come up. But just to refresh your memory, this is not a prescriptive per se order that we're looking -- that's coming out, the expectation, it will be more directional and then ask each company to submit specific proposals to address it. So in the anticipation of that we are working currently on our specific proposals, again, so that we are ready when the order comes out.","Paul Patterson","It's been kind of dormant there, I mean, for -- I guess, since January or something, it seems to me, and I'm just wondering, you expect an order though just to of show up or is there any other process that will happen between -- or will there be something else that's going to be -- in other words, should we just -- are we just waiting for an order now? Is that pretty much where we're at?","Philip Lembo","There is no indication that there is any other process that would be done, so at this stage, we are just awaiting an order.","Paul Patterson","Okay. And then just finally on the battery stuff, how do you see the economics of your battery investments vis-\u00e0-vis peakers. I mean we're hearing different things from different players in the sector around the country, cheaper than a peaker, that kind of thing, when it's combined with renewables what happens? I'm just sort of wondering since you've highlighted the deployments that you're making in your service territory. How do you see that -- how do you see the economics of that going forward?","Philip Lembo","Paul, as I described in our applications, there's many different applications for the storage and it's -- some of it is purely based on cost displacement of a peak, our resource some of it has to do with reliability, providing battery storage as our application in province down on the Cape really provides an opportunity to improve reliability there and then we don't have to construct a line through the national seashore or a type of thing. So there's certainly a myriad of benefits, price being one of them, emissions being one of them, reliability being one of them, and I think battery storage, as a package, can address a lot of those things, and then if you can combine it with intermittent resources, it even has a better application. So certainly there's opportunities for the cost to come down. I believe in that area as there's improvements made in storage technology, but I think the early applications are going to kind of proof some of these things out, and we feel very -- have a great opportunity here to really demonstrate the real value that it brings on many fronts.","Jeffrey Kotkin","Next question is from Travis Miller from Morningstar.","Travis Miller","So on the green bonds, I was wondering if you could talk about your decision to go with that type of bond versus the, obviously, traditional type. And then how much capacity you have to continue issuing those types of bonds given the pricing you've got?","Philip Lembo","Thanks for the question, Travis. I'd say that if you look at the bottom line, we believe that we -- our pricing was tighter in the green bond than it would have been in an alternative issuing, a nongreen bond issuance for when we need it. So pricing, there's certainly a lot of interest, our ESG profile really contributes to attracting investors. As you know with the green bonds, there needs to be a green reason to use it and certainly, as we move forward with all of Clean Energy applications, there could be more opportunities to issue green bonds going forward. So the -- I guess, the capacity for them is dependent upon what you're doing that's green, and we do a lot of things that aren't green. So I'd expect that we'd have much more capacity to issue green bonds as we move forward. I can't give you a specific dollar amount or application right now, but the basis for the green bond that we did issue was the $500 million a year that we spend on energy efficiency and some of our other green initiatives. So -- and those become more and more part of our business. There's more and more opportunity to issue those green bonds.","Travis Miller","Okay. And do those have to sit, not the ones you issued, I know, I also have to sit at the parent but is there opportunity or capacity to issue green bonds down at the utilities for some of the stuff, the batteries or anything else that you're doing?","Philip Lembo","I mean, this one was -- in fact, this one was at NSTAR Electric. So it absolutely can go at the utilities.","Travis Miller","Okay, I guess, I'll ask the reverse then, could you do it with the parent some sort of the offshore winds?","Philip Lembo","It's at the end of the parent.","Unidentified Company Representative","So I think almost likely, yes.","Travis Miller","Okay, okay. And then just really quick clarification on the equity. How much would you have needed if you weren't doing the offshore wind? Was there a need there either on the parent refinancing site or down at the utilities?","Philip Lembo","What we said and what we'll continue to say is that we had -- we have a robust $13 billion capital program in that forecast time period. And that combined with the activities we were performing in the wind area really drove the need for the equity issuance. I hesitate to allocate x amount to one category versus the other, but certainly when you look at, we do have robust capital plan that was a big driver of that deal.","Jeffrey Kotkin","Next question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","So just coming back to some of the prior questions on tax credit. I was just curious, do you have any more specificity you can talk to about both the specific ITCs tax year that you're going to try to qualify for the different offshore projects? And also just come back just what is the amortization here? I know this was kind of indirectly asked earlier, but I just want to be very specific about it, and I recognize that you may not have yet made up your mind with respect to these decisions either.","Philip Lembo","Thanks for the questions, Julien. I'd say that the specificity we've given on the tax years or whatever to say that they were appropriate considering the timing of when we bid and what the construction schedule would be. But we have not nor would we plan to identify a specific year, a specific item, that type of thing. But I will say that we've accounted for being conservative, having schedule changes, et cetera, in our tax planning profile. So no more specific than that at this stage. In terms of the number of years, I'd say -- I pointed out there's different ways of showing that. Obviously, you get cash in early and then you could reflect that. So we would do it in the most attractive way, but still evaluating -- we're still evaluating how it best fits into our tax profile going forward. It's hard to say what that looks like right now, but we are going to make the best use of that in the years ahead.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","All right. Let me reframe it this way perhaps, by the time that you're ready to roll forward your outlook to '24, will you be reflecting a decision with respect to tax recognition in that guidance right? I mean, this would seemingly be a pretty material piece of how you establish your future guidance, I would think?","Philip Lembo","Sure. I'd say there'd have to be some baseline assumption that we would make there that would be appropriate to discuss.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Got it. And then just come back to Praful's question earlier about the value share. I had a thought that Orsted had confirmed that they indeed there were going to provide you with their tax credits as a quasi-tax equity counterparty, but can you elaborate, I mean, to the extent possible about how they and you are talking about monetizing the other tax component? And also if possible, how you would think about recognizing that again in your income statement at least to which you are taking on their portion of tax credit.","Philip Lembo","So as I said, there are many categories to divvy up the 50-50 economic value of the partnership and certainly, if every source has more of an ability to utilize more efficiently the tax benefits of the partnership then we'd be foolish not to sort of make that determination. So I'd say at this stage, Julien, the specific, how that's going to work and what the numbers are, are still influx, still something that we look at all the time as part of our partnership, what makes the most sense for the partnership returns going forward, and how we can best utilize the financial profile and the operational knowledge, in fact, of each party to be the most successful financially and operationally here. So I think it's just common sense that if somebody can better do something, let them. Rely on them whether it be constructing something, if there's a better tax appetite, if you can finance cheaper. So all of these different items, we're going to pick the best way to do it and if that means that, that category isn't exactly 50-50, so be it. But the overall division is going to be 50-50. So some of these decisions evolve as you go through time.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Got it. Quick clarification if I can summarize here. How you think about the equity net injection needed for these offshore projects? Again, the thought process being, trying to tie back the balance sheet, the equity you raised here against your outlook over the 5-year period. How should we think about these projects? And I understand that their cash flow profile shifts pretty dramatically depending on the specific year, but upfront, 30% equity? How would you frame it?","Philip Lembo","I'd say the way that you should look at and the way that we've guided is to say, you should assume that it's sort of an Eversource profile cap structure and that would be 64%.","Jeffrey Kotkin","Next question is from Andrew Weisel from Scotia Howard Weil.","Andrew Weisel","I have a question on your appetite for more offshore wind. So you have committed to 50% of over 1,700 megawatts. How big would you be willing to let that business get for you? Is it a question of the earnings mix or the balance sheet or the physical lease capacity space? And what would happen with the partnership with Orsted if you and they wanted to move at different paces?","Philip Lembo","Thanks, Andrew. And I guess this is a question of bigger -- is bigger better, I guess, is the nature of your question. But our lease sites can handle 4,000 megawatts of capacity and that's what we are in partnership with Eversource and Orsted and really I'd say there's not a race to get to the full capacity. There's many thousands on the drawing board of offshore winds RfPs and needs that are expressed in New England and New York. And those come in over many, many, many years and our lease areas, in my view, are the very best. I mean, you look at the proximity of where they are to shore, you look at all the wind speed and other depth characteristics of those sites, and I'd rather have my sites than anything else out there. So there will be plenty of opportunities to grow this as we move forward. But we're going to do it in a way that is disciplined, and we're going to look at each RFP in terms of what the schedule is, what we already have on our plate, what we can do going forward and what the financial profile is of that RFP. So it has to be not necessarily bigger but it has to fit the profile and be a financially additive to what we're doing going forward.","Andrew Weisel","Okay. So notwithstanding cost, certainly, you can't get into the details for bidding reasons, but it sounds like you will be pursuing all of these reasonably aggressively, right?","Philip Lembo","I didn't say that, I said we would look at each one and make determination as to what the schedule that the RFP is looking for, what we already have on our plate, what we think the financial, the bid price would be, what that would mean in terms of returns and then we would make a determination based on that in terms of what our bid strategy would be for each specific RFP.","Andrew Weisel","Okay, got it. And just to confirm, am I right that for all of these offshore wind projects, the interests will be capitalized and therefore, it will impact cash flows during construction but not earnings? Is that the right way to think of it?","Philip Lembo","That is, yes. You are correct.","Andrew Weisel","Okay, great. Then one last one if I may. How do you think about affordability in New England given the higher costs of these projects? I understand that your utilities are in rate freezes, but over the next several years, is affordability a concern especially given the high starting prices for rates in the region?","Philip Lembo","Affordability for our customers is already always a primary concern as well as their reliability and the quality of service that we provide. So certainly, affordability of energy supply costs, affordability of our own distribution rates, affordability is top of the list for customers and top of our list. So we continue to evaluate that and you look at that in relation to what the alternative is, okay? So if you are in a region, as we are in the 3 states that we serve, and in a region that has very aggressive carbon reduction targets, you need to see how is it that you're going to meet those targets and provide the level of capacity and service to customers that they deserve. So what might seem like high cost to some is relative depending on the region you're in and the alternatives that you have, but certainly affordability is important to us.","Jeffrey Kotkin","Next question is from Mike Weinstein at Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Mike?","Michael Weinstein ","One quick follow-up. Just wanted to know if you guys have heard anything from FERC on transmission ROEs and the decision on that upcoming. I'm sorry, if I missed this answer earlier.","Philip Lembo","Mike, you didn't miss any answer on that. The answer is that we have not heard anything from FERC on the status of our 4 open ROE compliance.","Michael Weinstein ","Okay, I was just wondering because they've been issuing a few decisions lately, so I was just wondering if there is any movement.","Philip Lembo","Yes, nothing that we're aware of or that we've seen.","Jeffrey Kotkin","We have nobody else in the queue, so we want to thank all of you for joining us this morning. If you have any follow-ups, feel free to give us a call or send us an e-mail. Thanks a lot and have a good day.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference.

My name is Paulette and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Jeffrey Kotkin. You may begin.","Jeffrey Kotkin","Thank you, Paulette. Good morning and thank you for joining us. I'm Jeff Kotkin, Eversource Energy's Vice President for Investor Relations. During this call, we'll be referencing slides that we posted last night on our website. And as you can see on slide one, some of the statements made during this investor call may be forward-looking, as defined within the meaning of the Safe Harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.","These forward-looking statements are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainty, which may cause the actual results to differ materially from forecasts and projections. These factors are set forth in the news release issued yesterday. Additional information about the various factors that may cause actual results to differ can be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, and our Form 10-Q for the three months ended September 30, 2019.","Additionally, our explanation of how and why we use certain non-GAAP measures and how those measures reconcile to GAAP results is contained within our news release and the slides we posted last night and in our most recent 10-K. Speaking today will be Jim Judge, our Chairman, President and CEO; and Phil Lembo, our Executive Vice President and CFO. Also joining us today are; Werner Schweiger, our EVP and Chief Operating Officer; Joe Nolan, our EVP for Strategy and Customer and Corporate Relations; John Moreira our Treasurer and Senior VP for Finance and Regulatory; Jay Buth, our VP and Controller; and Mike Ausere, our VP for Business Development.","Now, I will turn to slide two and turn over the call to Jim.","Jim Judge","Thank you, Jeff, and good morning. Thank you everyone for joining us today for our review of 2019 results and for our updated long-term outlook. I'll start by thanking our 8,300 Eversource Energy colleagues for just a terrific 2019 and for the very bright future we expect for our company and our customers.","As you can see on slide four, our investors benefited from a very strong total return of 34.4% in 2019. That return was 860 basis points ahead of our peer index and nearly 300 basis points ahead of the S&P 500 total return in 2019. And as you also can see on this slide our three-year, five-year and 10-year performance has consistently beaten our peer index, as well as the broader market. And as the January 2020 performance comparison shows, we're off to another strong start this year. That constancy of shareholder return is directly related to our solid long-term record of operating performance.","On slide five you can see the results of our commitment to continuous improvement in our operating metrics, related to reliability, safety and emergency response. They are in the top-tier of our industry and the top decile of our industry peer group from reliability.","That execution and the drive to provide ever-improving service to our 4 million customers here in New England, form the linchpin of our strategy. By excelling at our basic business, we enjoy strong credibility with our regulators and other state and federal policymakers.","Our leadership position on energy issues also enhanced by our strategy of being a catalyst for clean energy development in New England and for our efforts to strive for best-in-class governance employment policies, safety programs, energy efficiency support and leadership in our communities.","Some of the organizations that have recognized our leadership over the past year are listed on slide six. The credibility generated by our strong operating performance helps us achieve very tangible results, especially in areas such as structuring long-term rate deals in our regulatory jurisdictions or entering new business ventures, such as water and offshore wind.","We have a prominent seat at the table, as our business strategy aligns very well with the energy economic and environmental goals of the region. All New England states are targeting at least an 80% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2050. This is a very ambitious goal, especially given that nearly 50% of those emissions today come from the millions of motor vehicles that cross our thoroughfares daily.","In December, we announced that we will support these efforts by setting a goal of making Eversource carbon neutral by 2030. That's the most ambitious goal of any energy utility in the United States. And as you can see on slide seven we have already reduced our carbon emissions by approximately 70% over the past few years, primarily by divesting our fossil generation in New Hampshire.","From here, our efforts will focus on the combination of improving the efficiency of our electric grid, further accelerating the replacement of older cast iron and unprotected steel natural gas distribution pipes; changing our fleet to include more hybrid and electric vehicles; and increasing the energy efficiency of our buildings.","Setting this aggressive carbon reduction goal makes us more attractive to ESG-focused investors, who now comprise about 10% of the 1,600 domestic and international funds currently invested in Eversource shares.","Our clean energy strategy is further enhanced by our partnership with \u00d8rsted to build at least 4,000 megawatts of offshore wind off the coast of Massachusetts. This build-out is incremental to our goal of making our operations carbon neutral by 2030.","Slide 8 provides a status report on the 1,714 megawatts we have won thus far through successful bids into Rhode Island, Connecticut and New York RFPs. As you can see on this slide, we have secured approvals of the long-term agreements we have under contract. So clearly, the focus ahead is on siting approvals.","This year we expect to file our construction and operations plans for our two large projects with the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management or BOEM. We expect to file Revolution Wind in the first half of 2020 and Sunrise Wind in the second half of the year. Those filings would be consistent with our expectation that Revolution will have its first full year of operation in 2024, and Sunrise will have its first full year of operation in 2025.","We continue to target operation of the first and smallest of these three projects South Fork by the end of 2022. We are currently reviewing that schedule in light of BOEM's recent announcement that it will not complete its cumulative impact study on the six tracks of Massachusetts until mid-June. That study is part of the Vineyard Wind application, but will likely encompass all of the tracks.","The pricing of most of our PPAs is public and noted on this slide. In December, Congress passed and the President signed legislation extending for one year and increasing over 2019 levels both investment tax credits and production tax credits for construction commencing in 2020. We applaud this extension which supports this rapidly growing industry, and we expect to qualify for 18% tax credits on our three projects.","As you know, while we were successful in the New York RFP last year, we were not successful in the Massachusetts RFP or the Connecticut RFP, both of which were awarded in the fall. While the Connecticut pricing is not public, the Massachusetts pricing was made public with the contract filing this month.","Like the first Massachusetts RFP in 2018, the pricing in the most recent RFP would not be sufficient for us to earn our targeted mid-teen returns. So, although disappointed, I was comfortable with our bid not being selected.","As I have said to both the \u00d8rsted Board and the Eversource Board, we control the two best ocean tracks that BOEM has auctioned off in New England. They are the closest to shore, which you can see on slide 9 and should be the most economic to develop and maintain.","Between New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts and Rhode Island there will likely be at least 15,000 megawatts of contracts available to developers over the coming years. The last thing we would want to do is lock ourselves into contracts for 20 to 25 years that would not allow us to earn our targeted returns, because we bid too aggressively.","We consider our sites to be a tremendous competitive advantage, and we'll be disciplined in our bidding. We'll take some additional few years to reach the 4,000 megawatt capacity for our tracks. We are fine with being patient we're preserving our potential returns.","In the meantime, all four developers of the tracks of Massachusetts achieved a significant milestone late last year when we committed to BOEM and the coast guard that we would coordinate our development to provide one nautical mile spacing between offshore wind turbines, both East-West and North-South across all parcels creating a grid-like configuration.","We believe this is a very positive development in addressing the concerns of both the region's fishermen and the coast guard. In late January, the Coast Guard published a notice for public comment indicating that this one nautical mile by one nautical mile configuration will create adequate spacing for search and rescue operations and would maintain safe ship navigation.","Earlier this month, Connecticut Governor, Ned Lamont announced a public-private partnership that will result in up to $157 million being invested in refurbishing the New London State Pier as a staging ground for offshore wind construction.","This innovative partnership into which Eversource and \u00d8rsted together will invest a projected $77.5 million, will allow Connecticut to realize significant economic development benefits from this new clean energy source. So, to conclude my offshore wind comments, I want to emphasize what a great opportunity this development is for our region, for our customers and for our company.","The area off the Massachusetts coast is perhaps the best place for offshore wind in all of North America, because of the year-round wind speeds, the shallow depth of the waters and the proximity to Southern New England road. I believe our two parcels are the best situated of the six parcels that BOEM has auctioned off and our partner \u00d8rsted is the best and most experienced developer of offshore wind in the world.","Perhaps most importantly, offshore wind is in the sweet spot of public policy, providing billions of dollars of economic development benefits to our region and benefiting from widespread support from public policymakers the business community and environmental groups.","As a result I could not be more optimistic about the future of our offshore wind business. As a reminder, our offshore wind opportunity is incremental to the solid growth prospects we foresee for our core business.","As you can see on slide 10, we have grown earnings per share by approximately 6% on average, since the 2012 merger that created Eversource. We expect to continue to grow earnings per share by 5% to 7% solely through the growth of our core regulated utility business. And that 5% to 7% growth excludes earnings from the two large offshore wind projects that we expect will produce significant additional EPS growth in 2024 and 2025.","As shown on slide 11, the key element of our total return profile remains our dividend growth. With our solid earnings growth and conservative payout ratio we consider our dividend to be extremely well supported with a growth trajectory similar to our 5% to 7% EPS growth.","Earlier this month, the Eversource Board of Trustees approved a 6.1% increase in our quarterly common dividend. That increase underscores our confidence in our long-term earnings growth and business strategy.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Phil.","Phil Lembo","Thanks, Jim. And today, I'll cover our results for 2019 discuss the earnings guidance for 2020 and the key drivers that support that. I'll provide an update for you on our five-year CapEx plan in our 5% to 7% EPS growth and review the outstanding regulatory items we have pending. I'll also cover briefly what our financing plans are for the year 2020.","I'll start with slide 13 and our fourth quarter and full year results for 2019. Our GAAP earnings were $2.81 per share in 2019, including a $0.64 Northern Pass charge we recorded in the second quarter. Excluding that charge we earned $3.45 per share in 2019 compared with earnings of $3.25 per share in 2018. The $3.45 was a 6.2% increase and right at the midpoint of the earnings guidance we provided you a year ago. In the fourth quarter of 2019, we earned $0.76 per share compared with earnings of $0.73 in the fourth quarter of 2018.","Now some specifics about the quarter and year. Earnings for our electric distribution segment were $1.59 per share in 2019 compared with $1.44 in 2018. They were $0.28 per share in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared with $0.24 in the fourth quarter of 2018. So both the full year and the fourth quarter results improved primarily as a result of higher distribution revenues. These were partially offset by higher depreciation and operation and maintenance expense.","The transmission segment earned a total of $1.43 per share in 2019, excluding the Northern Pass charge compared with $1.34 in 2018. They were $0.36 per share in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared with $0.31 in the fourth quarter of 2018. The higher full year and fourth quarter earnings, primarily reflects an increased level of investments in our transmission facilities.","Our transmission rate base ended 2019 at an estimated $7.26 billion compared with $6.75 billion at the end of 2018. Transmission capital expenditures totaled slightly more than $1 billion in 2019 or about 3.5% higher than the year previous.","Earnings from our natural gas segment totaled $0.30 per share in 2019 compared with $0.29 in 2018. Fourth quarter earnings were $0.12 per share in 2019 compared with $0.14 in 2018. For the full year, higher revenues were largely offset with higher operations and maintenance costs, depreciation, higher property tax and interest expense. The fourth quarter decline was due to higher O&M and depreciation expense as well as the absence in 2019 of a benefit that we received in 2018 related to our Yankee rate case.","Full year earnings from our water distribution segment totaled $0.11 per share in 2019 compared with $0.10 per share in 2018. Fourth quarter earnings in our water distribution business were $0.02 per share in 2019 that's up $0.01 over 2018. Improved results for the quarter were due in part to higher revenues lower interest and operating expense","At the parent and others we earned $0.02 per share in 2019 compared with earnings of $0.08 per share in 2018. The decline incurred largely in the fourth quarter when the parent lost $0.02 per share compared with earnings of $0.03 per share in 2018. This was due in part to $0.02 per share gain in 2018 relating to the results of a regulatory decision allowing recovery of certain merger-related costs by Yankee Gas. It also resulted from a higher effective tax rate in 2019 than we had in 2018.","Turning to slide 14. Our earnings per share guidance for 2020 is the range of $3.60 to $3.70 per share and this is consistent with our long-term growth rate expectations. The primary drivers of earnings growth are expected to be our continued investment in our transmission system and the positive impacts of our multiyear regulatory plans in place for our electric and natural gas distribution businesses. In the first half of this year, we are implementing an electric distribution base rate adjustments totaling more than $60 million and a natural gas rate adjustment of nearly $16 million.","Additionally, I will discuss shortly, we have rate request pending at one of our electric subsidiaries in one of our natural gas distribution companies. Also contributing to earnings growth would be the impact of infrastructure investment tracking mechanisms in place for our electric and natural gas distribution segments. These involve safety programs in pipe replacements in our gas business. Offsetting these benefits are expected increases in depreciation, interest cost and property tax expense.","Also we'll have higher share count in 2020 as a result of the equity sale last June and closing it out with the full width by the end of May of this year. From 2020, I'll turn to slide 15 and our long-term capital investment forecast. Over the next five years, we are projecting capital investments of $14.2 billion from our core electric natural gas and water business as well as the supporting information technology and facilities investments. These investments are focused on providing reliable service to our 4 million customers across three states.","In our electric transmission segment, we expect to invest approximately $4 billion over the next five years. As a result, by the end of 2023, we expect our regulated transmission rate base to be $9.4 billion. That's approximately $1 billion higher than we had estimated just a year ago. And then we expect the rate base to be at $9.6 billion by the end of the forecast period in 2024.","Turning to slide 16. You can see that in just the years 2020 through 2023, our capital investments are expected to be $1.6 billion higher in those time periods than what we had forecast at this time a year ago. This increase is primarily driven by investments in our electric transmission segment. For the years, 2020 through 2023, capital investments in electric transmission are expected to increase by about $1 billion. We have multiple drivers affecting this increased level of spending and they're all related to providing reliable service in supporting our region's clean energy goals.","For example, we're increasing the use of drones to better inspect our transmission equipment. High-resolution drone photography is allowing us to identify damage of failing equipment much more effectively and efficiently allowing us to accelerate the replacement of at-risk equipment, before it can cause reliability problems for our customers.","In addition to replacing older equipment, we also need to address some notable areas of growth. While overall our electric loads are flat to lower, we are installing additional equipment to address significant customer growth, particularly in pockets of Boston and Cambridge, Southwest, Connecticut and Coastal New Hampshire. We also need to add equipment to better integrate the renewable energy that continues to come online to maintain voltage and reactive capacity. On the electric distribution side, we project investments of approximately $6.1 billion over the next five years.","From 2020 through 2023, we project nearly an additional $400 million investment compared to last year's forecast. Our investments are helping to drive the excellent top-tier reliability performance that Jim identified earlier by improving the resiliency and reliability on our systems addressing continued economic growth and at the same time helping to drive our O&M costs out of the system. Much of the increase in our distribution capital program since last year's forecast is driven by substation investments in the growth regions that I mentioned earlier such as Greater Boston.","We also continue to invest in the DPU-approved grid modernization program in Massachusetts. You may recall that in late 2017 and in the first half of 2018, the DPU approved $233 million of investments, including $55 million for two battery storage projects, $45 million for electric vehicle infrastructure that connects 3,500 charging points and an additional $133 million for technology enhancements on our distribution system.","We had initially expected these investments would be completed over a five-year period but we now expect nearly all the work to be complete in a 3.5 year or less period or by early to mid-2021.","Additionally in 2018, the DPU instructed us to file an additional three-year plan by mid-2020 to cover the years 2021 through 2023. In our capital investment forecast, we have included approximately $290 million for that new three-year plan in Massachusetts.","There are a few changes in the natural gas and water distribution segments where capital investments more closely resembles the plan we showed you a year ago. The increased investment in our natural gas distribution system during the years 2020 to 2023 is primarily at NSTAR Gas where we have a number of additional resiliency projects plus continued execution of our pipe replacement program. And we have similar work underway at Yankee Gas.","At Aquarion on slide 17, we provided you with an updated Aquarion rate base estimate that now reflects the expected sale of certain water facilities around Hingham Massachusetts to the town. We expect the sale to close in the second half of this year and we expect to receive more than $100 million for these facilities, a valuation that was prescribed following a State Court review.","More than 90% of Aquarion Water's rate base is located in Connecticut and much of the capital investment over the coming years will come not only from replacing older less reliable pipes, but also from new projects that bring additional water supplies into Southwest Fairfield County where currently summertime irrigation is precious some of you may know about that. More specifics about that extensive work are shown on the slide in the appendix.","From what is included in our capital forecast, let's turn to slide 18 and discuss some of the items that are not reflected in the forecast. On the electric distribution side the forecast does not include grid modernization investments in Connecticut or New Hampshire. Connecticut regulators have opened a number of dockets related to grid modernization such as storage and electric vehicle charging infrastructure and are pursuing them aggressively with regular public input sessions. But because those dockets are not yet complete, we have not included any such investments in our plan.","Similarly while we have proposed several innovative grid initiatives in New Hampshire, including battery storage project as these initiatives are not yet approved, we have not included any of these investments in our current plans either.","We are not reflecting any investment in advanced meter infrastructure or AMI in any state. In Connecticut, there is an active AMI docket now underway as part of its grid modernization review. Massachusetts regulators have indicated that they will open the review of AMI in other customer facing technologies, although no specific time frame has been established at this time.","We currently estimate the total investment needed to switch over all of our electric and natural gas customers to AMI in the two states, Connecticut and Massachusetts to be approximately $1 billion. But it's unclear at this time of if or when AMI might be authorized by regulators.","We are also evaluating a recent report issued by Dynamic Risk Assessment Systems, the consultants working for Massachusetts DPU to determine if we will need to make any incremental capital expenditures on our Massachusetts gas distribution system. These investments would be needed to meet evolving state safety requirements. No additional investments have been included -- have been identified or included at this time in our forecast.","As you can see on slide 19, the level of investment in our plan will produce a rate base CAGR of 6.9% nearly 7% from year-end 2018 through 2024. This rate base growth underscores our high confidence in the core business producing an EPS CAGR of 5% to 7% and as we've said in the past, we believe we will be somewhere around the middle of that range.","Earnings from our major offshore wind investments will be incremental to the core business 5% to 7% CAGR. In years when we are not adding any offshore wind, we expect to be solidly in the 5% to 7% range.","As Jim said in periods immediately after we bring a large offshore wind project into service, earnings growth is likely to be significantly above the 5% to 7% range. We expect those high-growth periods to be the 12 months after first Revolution Wind and then Sunrise Wind into service.","As you know for competitive reasons and because we're still early in the siting process, we have not discussed our expected total investment in these projects. So I will say that we are expecting to invest $300 million to $400 million in the offshore wind business in the year 2020.","As we've previously said, we expect to capitalize the projects with a 40% to 45% equity and 55% to 60% debt percentage. That's consistent with our current Eversource capitalization. And as we've said, we continue to expect to earn mid-teens returns on the equity in these projects once operational.","As noted on slide 20, core business earnings growth is not just tied to rate base growth in the associated CWIP there are other items. First, some of the regulated segments particularly Massachusetts and New Hampshire distribution earned below their authorized returns in 2018 and we are expecting a significant recovery from these levels going forward.","Second, as our highly regarded energy efficiency programs grow so do potential incentives we see -- we receive for doing an exceptional job. Third, we are conservatively modeling nominal O&M to be relatively flat during the five year forecast period compared with 2019 levels. The bottom-line is we're very comfortable that our regulated segments alone will support the 5% to 7% earnings growth and again somewhere in the middle of that range.","From our growth rate I'll turn to two active rate cases one in New Hampshire, a public service in New Hampshire; and in Massachusetts at NSTAR Gas. Slide 21 shows the status of these rate cases.","On the left-hand side you'll see the PSNH filed a rate case last year seeking a $70 million increase in base distribution rates. Following the settlement with the staff the New Hampshire Public Utility Commission approved a $28 million temporary increase that will remain in effect until the PUC implements a final decision on the permanent rates. We expect that decision in May with an effective date July 1.","The New Hampshire PUC process includes the number of days devoted to settlement discussions and the scheduled targets April 7 for the filing of the settlement if we're able to negotiate one. Regardless hearings will take place in April and historically most New Hampshire rate cases have been settled.","At NSTAR Gas we filed an application in November of last year to raise distribution rates by $38 million effective October 1, 2020. We also requested a performance-based rate mechanism similar to the one approved for NSTAR Electric in its rate case in late 2017. Such a mechanism would tie rate adjustments in the future to inflation measures in years two through five of a five year plan. We expect this rate case to be fully litigated as was the NSTAR Electric case.","Worth noting is that our three largest distribution franchises are currently under multiyear rate plans and we anticipate no new base rate plans for these franchises to be effective before 2022.","Turning from the states to the FERC information on slide 22. There's been significant FERC ROE activity since our November earnings call but none of it directly related to our four pending complaints against the ROEs identified by the New England transmission owners.","In a recent decision that was quite disappointing to us FERC ruled in November of 2019 that it would abandon two of the four methodologies it had earlier suggested it would use in determining just and reasonable ROEs. Instead it said it would focus solely on discounted cash flow and CAPM mechanisms.","Many parties requested reconsideration of that ruling and FERC appears to be considering reviewing its decision in the -- in that MISO case. In the meantime, we continue to book earnings at the same rate at which FERC has ordered us to bill customers. That includes a base ROE of 10.57% with a project cap of 11.74%. We have billed at the same rate since early 2015 and do not expect to change it from FERC rules on the New England case.","Turning to slide 23. I'll review the status of our equity issuance. As you may recall we closed immediately on one-third of nearly 18 million shares that were issued and sold in June of 2019. So the issuance at that time was just under six million shares. The remaining nearly 12 million shares was subject to a forward share purchase arrangement.","On December 30 we closed on an additional six million shares of the forward and we'll close out the remaining approximately six million shares by the end of May of 2020. Also last year, we used about one million treasury shares to fund our dividend reinvestment and certain employee incentive and retirement plan obligations. We had expected to issue about 1.5 million shares last year. But because of our higher share price we've reduced that rate of issuance.","Later in the forecast period, we expect to implement an at-the-market program to address any equity requirements that exist. At this time, we expect to issue approximately $700 million in new equity. This is the same number that we've discussed for over a year now through such mechanism during the forecast period. We'll continue to evaluate our financing needs as we move through the forecast period but we have no additional equity in the forecast.","We're very enthused and confident we'll be able to accomplish this ambitious plan we described you this morning. The plan will allow us to fulfill our work on behalf of our customers, while supporting energy policies of our the states which they've adopted.","Slide 24 illustrates some of our track records and it illustrates the targets we've set for ourselves over the past eight years and how we've been successful in meeting or beating them, delivering significant benefits to our customers and value to our investors.","Thanks again for your time. I'll turn the call back to Jeff.","Jeffrey Kotkin","Thank you, Phil and I'm going to turn the call back to Paulette to remind you how to enter the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","Jeffrey Kotkin","Thank you, Paulette. Our first question this morning is from Mike Weinstein from Credit Suisse. Good morning Mike.","Mike Weinstein","Hi, good morning, guys.","Jeffrey Kotkin","Hi.","Mike Weinstein","Thanks for taking my call. Can you explain how -- why do you think the bids are coming in so low for Massachusetts offshore wind auctions? And what gives you confidence that you can eventually win further auctions going forward if the bids are coming low?","Jim Judge","Sure. This is Jim. Hi Mike. The -- we can't sort of rationalize some of the pricing that other bidders have put in there. Obviously, the returns that they expect are lower. It may be an instance where they're trying to buy market share. But if you -- as we talk here today \u00d8rsted and Eversource that joint venture is the largest developer of offshore wind in North America based upon the 1,714 megawatts that we have contracted.","So, we see the glass as half full rather than half empty. We've won some bids -- we've won bids that are going to be profitable for us. We will continue to be selective in opportunities.","I would say that more so than the other states Massachusetts has clearly been focused on price and price alone whereas other states have looked for other contributions to the state via the economic developments or what have you.","So, Massachusetts has clearly shown themselves to be a state that's focused primarily on price and we'll look for opportunities. It's currently over 25,000 megawatts of offshore wind legislated in the Northeast, 15,000 megawatts alone when you look at New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island. And only about a third of that has been contracted for us. So, we're pretty excited about the opportunity here and the timing will fit with our financial discipline making sure that we win bids that are profitable.","Mike Weinstein","Got you. Thanks. And also do you expect to continue excluding offshore wind earnings from forward earnings growth projections and future updates or do you think you might raise the guidance range at some point maybe next year?","Phil Lembo","Mike this is Phil. Our current plan is to have our core business growth rate and keep it separate at this stage.","Mike Weinstein","Got you. One last question here. Can you explain how offshore wind will fall out for the PTC extension? I think initially that was supposed to apply only to onshore projects, but I understand there are some ways that they can be applied to offshore, but I'm -- maybe you can explain that a little bit?","Jay Buth","Hey Mike, it's Jay Buth. How are you? We -- when we kind of look at this in totality with the portfolio, we do read when we kind of read that language and we talk to some of our advisers we do see an avenue for the PTC extension to be potential for that offshore wind business. We do have some other strategies that we're looking at deploying from a qualification standpoint as well. So, we do feel pretty confident in terms of our qualification realms.","Mike Weinstein","Got you. I'll get back in the queue. Thank you very much.","Jeffrey Kotkin","All right. Thanks Mike. Next question is from Insoo Kim from Goldman. Good morning Insoo.","Insoo Kim","Good morning. Thank you. First regarding financing, how much of the Sunrise Wind construction costs are you assuming would be funded by the initial cash flows from Revolution Wind? And depending on the timing of the permitting and potential delays, at what point would your future equity needs change and the potential magnitude of that?","Phil Lembo","Well, I'd -- that requires some speculation on my part. I'd say that we're confident with the schedule that we have that we're able to finance our construction programs that we have in place for both our core business as well as the wind development with our cash flows from our business. The cash flows are all fungible. We -- there are flows from the core business and there will be cash generated from revenues or tax benefits from the offshore wind that would be used to help finance the whole portfolio of capital that we have.","So as I said, right now looking at the forecast, we have no new equity needs in there rather than to complete what we've already indicated in the past. And we're confident we'll be able to do that.","Insoo Kim","Understood. And maybe a little bit bigger picture Jim. Obviously, Eversource has benefited from its favorable ESG characteristics, including the strategy on offshore wind. When you just look out longer-term, your portfolio mix, could you just update us a little bit on your thoughts on what the optimal mix is? Whether it's on the offshore renewable front or on the water utilities front or anything else that you may be contemplating?","Jim Judge","Well, I think we're pretty pleased with sort of our core business. I think we've perceived as an excellent operator, whether you look at electric, gas or water. I do think in the renewable space, we have taken advantage of opportunities to develop utility-scale solar, where we have that opportunity. And obviously offshore wind is a growing opportunity for us as well.","I wouldn't say that we have a target mix between each sector. The water sector is -- I continue to believe is something that begs for a sort of roll-up. Unfortunately, when you look at how water utilities trade currently at such a high price, it's hard to make the math work and make it accretive, which has always been our threshold for deals. So we'll look for opportunities to grow the business. We'll be selective and disciplined as we have in the past, but we're pleased with each one of the legs of the store.","Insoo Kim","Right. Thank you very much.","Jim Judge","Great.","Jeffrey Kotkin ","Thanks, Insoo. Next question is from Steve Fleishman from Wolfe. Good morning, Steve.","Steve Fleishman","Yeah. Hi. Good morning. Just a couple of questions related to offshore wind. So could you just maybe give some sense on why the timing delays on the broader impact from BOEM?","And also just -- I think there is some opposition to the mile-by-mile configuration. So just could you give a sense on your conviction on getting that approved?","And then finally, just how are you feeling about your cost assumptions that you've put into your projects given just the latest view of cost to build the projects and any impact of delays?","Jim Judge","Okay. Jeff you keep me honest here in terms of the questions. I think the offshore wind one of the things that we're pleased to see was our fit would be a good degree of granularity provided by BOEM with the dates that were provided at the Vineyard Wind proceeding all the way through the record of decision date.","I think people realized that delays at Vineyard Wind may have some impact on other developments. We certainly hope that that's minimal. Obviously, the cumulative impact analysis that's due on June 12 will provide some guidance of schedules going forward.","Eversource and \u00d8rsted we filed a very robust and complete and high-quality corp filings at South Fork. So I expect that that can help expedite our approval once BOEM has completed their cumulative impact analysis.","On the mile-by-mile, while there's still maybe some opposition to that design, there has been sort of a coalition. The coast guard has come out in favor of it. They think that it provides adequate distance for mariners to travel safely and for the fishing community. We think it's -- it basically addresses the primary hesitation or concern that BOEM had when they did stop the Vineyard Wind process.","In terms of cost assumptions, we are continuously looking at project construction not only cost, but schedules and opportunities to improve them. I'm happy that the partner that we have \u00d8rsted their track record and the way that I've seen the class develop tend to include some conservatisms and contingencies that look to be appropriate.","So we're continuously reviewing and testing those cost assumptions. And right now we're very comfortable that what we see is consistent with the returns that we've provided The Street mid-term -- mid-teen returns on equity.","Steve Fleishman","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Jeffrey Kotkin","Thanks Steve. Next question is from Paul Patterson from Glenrock. Good morning, Paul.","Paul Patterson","Hey, good morning guys. How are you doing?","Jim Judge","All right.","Paul Patterson","I wanted to just touch base again on slide 19 and the CWIP number. How do you guys expect that to go? What's your trend expectation with respect to that over this forecast period?","Phil Lembo","In terms of the CWIP number, Paul?","Paul Patterson","Yeah.","Phil Lembo","Yeah, typically that would move up during the forecast period just given our level of construction activities. I don't have a specific rate of increase that, I would give you. But I would say that, we would see that number as increasing during that period.","Paul Patterson","Okay. And then with respect to the -- just one more thing on the offshore wind. There was this independent evaluator report that came out on Friday in which they discussed the potential for the Mayflower project to be rebid and as being a potential opportunity for you guys. I was looking -- I was just wondering if you guys have any thoughts about that potential or...","Jim Judge","Well I can't speculate. I think I did see something that suggested that the winning bid was close to the second bid. And some people are making a case that, that winning bid may be a higher risk and should be reassessed. But I don't have any perspective or insight as to what will be done with that.","Paul Patterson","Okay. And then with respect to transmission there have been several dockets filed at FERC some dealing with ISO New England with respect to competition. There are a number of different cases that are basically kind of the offspring of FERC Order 1000, it seems like in terms of compliance in efforts to -- for cost containment what have you. And I was wondering what your thoughts might be in terms of this apparent effort on the part of FERC to broaden or to reassert this sort of competitive effort with respect to transmission projects?","Jim Judge","Well I think we've seen ISO respond. They issued an RFP in December to address transmission needs to retirements of Mystic 8 and 9. I think it's expected sometime in 2024. And there's a schedule in the process for a competitive bid to be submitted in March. Eversource and National Grid will be obligated to propose backstop solutions against which qualified business developers can bid. So -- and there is competition in New England with sort of the major projects that's on the line.","Paul Patterson","Right. But they're talking about things like they immediately need stuff and supplemental projects. And I'm just wondering I mean should we look towards this Mystic 1 that you just mentioned as perhaps being a data point with which to see how this competition thing works out?","Or I'm just sort of wondering in general, I mean we don't have any we have these so-called things that came out and what have you. Those types of filings and what have you responses to them. So we're sort of early in the process, but I was just wondering I mean -- if you think this could potentially have any impact on your forecast in terms of transmission investment and what have you?","Jim Judge","Well I don't think so. I believe that the -- some of the reliability concerns that Phil mentioned in terms of structure replacements that have been identified and more of them were find -- were found with the use of drones identifying vulnerabilities with the federal government's focus on reliability in the transmission system in particular I think you're going to see the incumbents continue to be the one to address particular near-term fixes that need to be -- or upgrades that need to be required by the system.","Paul Patterson","Okay. And then just back on the grid mod in Connecticut that Phil touched on. I'm sorry if I missed this but what -- when do you think we're going to actually get something out of there? I mean as you mentioned there are several proceedings it's kind of difficult to monitor. When do you think we might actually see some actual sort of concrete proposals or what have you coming out of that?","Phil Lembo","Yes. So Paul you're right. There's almost a dozen. I think there's actually 11 different dockets that are active and the Connecticut process has been inclusive and they've really stuck to schedule. I mean they've been aggressive in terms of going through the particular topics. But I will admit that I don't have a particular target date not -- one has not been published at this time.","But we expect to see something move in the first half of 2020. I don't -- what I've said before I believe to still be true is you're not going to see like one item with all 11 come out. You'll probably see some piecemeal one or two of the 11 move forward in the first half of this year, but I don't have any more specifics on that.","Yes, I think the ones that they seem to be interested in battery storage EVs or certainly programs that we have in place already in Massachusetts. And those are in kind of the top of the list at -- in Connecticut right now.","Paul Patterson","Okay fair enough. Thanks so much.","Phil Lembo","Thank you, Paul\/","Jeffrey Kotkin","Our next question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Hey good morning team congratulations.","A \u2013 Phil Lembo","So perhaps to keep going a little bit in the same direction this fall here. But turning back to slide 18 talking a little bit and trying to quantify if you will some of these upsides. I know you said specifically AMI was $1 billion still that seems unchanged. Can you talk about a: the time line if there are any kind of data points we should be tracking? And then separately for the other two bullets here, I know it's difficult to put your finger on any kind of specific numbers. But as you begin to assess the quantum overall of capital here, how would you frame those other two? I get it's difficult, but at least initially especially on the Massachusetts gas side where I know that there are some data points coming up here.","Phil Lembo","Yes, Julien this is Phil. In terms of one of the -- following on to Paul's comment, one of the 11 items has to do with AMI in Connecticut and there does seem to be some interest there. And one or the other utilities operating in the state has implemented at least a partial AMI solution that's out there. We've said in the electric and gas in Massachusetts and Connecticut that's about $1 billion. And that likely would be spread over a four-year, five-year time period. You're not going to get all of that spending in at once.","So, I'd say that Connecticut is probably ahead of Massachusetts in that regard in terms of at least there's a docket out there and a framework to start looking at. So, that could be something you see in 2020 at least a direction. In terms of Massachusetts, they have indicated and they continue to indicate they want to have more of a generic docket looking at AMI and other customer-facing items, but have not yet set a date for that. I'm not sure if there's one on the drawing board, but I'd say that's probably something that's going to at least kick-off during this year. I don't have any more time line for that. So again, half of our customers are -- it's kind of a 50-50 split between the two. So I mean realistically you'd say half of the $1 billion is in each of the states.","In terms of the gas assessments that's come out and we've been asked and all the companies are preparing information now to be responsive to that assessment. So, I would say we should know within a relatively short period of time if there's any incremental spend out of that. And something to keep in mind that I just wanted to remind folks on, it's sort of in our gas filing in Massachusetts we saw that this was coming right? We didn't know what might come out in terms of the spending level, but we knew that this report was out there. So, in the filing that we already have underway in Massachusetts for the gas case, we already have a carve-out tracker sort of a zero in it right now that we're proposing to say look, we don't know what's going to come out, but likely something will and we will have a place for it. So we won't have to wait five years to go back and get our recovery for it.","So we planned ahead not knowing exactly what the numbers were or what would happen but we at least have the mechanism lined up there. So, again as you suggest, it's a little bit early to speculate there but there could be some hundreds of millions of dollars between all of these that would be incremental.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Got it. And then just going -- sorry let me to nitpick a little bit further on one of your specific angles here, but this notion of fuel security here, I know you guys have kind of talked broadly about Mystic here but more broadly that seems to highlight some of the acute issues potentially here. We saw some FERC actions very recently. Is that another angle that I know we've kind of alluded to here but I'll leave it open-ended in the Boston area and more broadly when you think about winter?","Jim Judge","Yes. I'm not -- it is open-ended. I'm not really sure what you're asking about?","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","So what I was getting after is obviously, if Mystic eight and nine go away and in general you have this open question as to enabling the retirements of these urban large-generation sources. Are there opportunities that open themselves and afford themselves sort of in the here-now to backstop or enable these retirements otherwise?","Jim Judge","I think the -- this is Jim, Julien. The competitive FERC 1,000 solicitation will sort of reveal a number of opportunities that have created to address the challenge of mystic eight and nine going away. So I don't want to speculate on what they might be. We'll see soon enough.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Okay. All right, fair enough. It comes back to that. Understood indeed. Thank you.","Jeffrey Kotkin","Great, thanks so much Julien. Next question is from Travis Miller from Morningstar. Good morning Travis.","Travis Miller","Good morning. Thank you. Just wondering on -- going back to this transmission and that idea of upside on the transmission as we get out to the 2023, 2024. Wondering if you could characterize the gating factors for a lack of better term that might be coming there? Is there a policy change? Is it FERC change? State change? Wondering what might lead to some of those extra growth projects that are not in the forecast right now?","Jim Judge","Well, I'll have Phil add on. But one observation I'd make Travis is that Jeff Kotkin is the best IR guy in our industry and that's not me saying that that's all you folks on the phone saying that because he wins the II award every year. And one of the reasons he does is he provides a lot of regularity on our capital spending plans going forward.","And there's a long history here of providing a CapEx forecast and he provides it based upon projects that are already in the queue that we're aware of that are in our plan. Obviously, we know more about projects that are in our plan for 2020 than we do for 2025 right now.","And so if you look every single year since the merger in 2012, we have updated the CapEx forecast going forward and it has increased and it's \u2013 basically because we're more aware of future needs going forward. So there are projects that are out there that we're not aware of right now that will be in the mix. And that's not just transmission but distribution electric and gas and water business as well. I don't know if you want to add to that Phil?","Phil Lembo","Yes, I'd just add in terms of a couple of categories is I talked about connecting distributed resources to the system. I think we have about 2600 distributed \u2013 megawatts of distributed energy resources in our territory now. So as policies progress and as clean energy connections are required. I think that could be a category that expands in that time period.","So nothing to put in there yet, but that's certainly a driver. And each year we're spending more on cyber and physical security and things like that so that the ramp-up in that particular category seems to get higher and higher each year. So those might be a couple of categories that could move spending up as you move out in the forecast.","Travis Miller","Okay. And then just within that are there any large project opportunities that you see \u2013 as you look out kind of that five-year trends I think on transmission window. Are there any areas where you'd see hey, this could be a possible large project opportunity, let's call it $400 million $500 million type of thing?","Phil Lembo","Yes. Right. Actually just the opposite. I'd say our forecast now includes more smaller projects that more bite-size inside the fence. As I said cyber is certainly an issue. I'd say the largest single project that we have now is our Seacoast Reliability Project that we have as a single project. All the other \u2013 transmission is really groups of smaller activities that we're doing for reliability and to improve the reliability for our customers. So we don't see any big projects out there.","Travis Miller","Okay, great. I appreciate the thoughts.","Jeffrey Kotkin","Thank you, Travis. Next question is from Andy Levi from ExodusPoint. Good morning, Andy.","Andy Levi","Hey, guys. How are you?","Phil Lembo","Good Andy. How are you?","Andy Levi","I am doing well. I agree what you say about Jeff.","Jeffrey Kotkin","Thank you, Andy.","Andy Levi","So just I guess a follow-up from an earlier question. You were \u2013 I know this is something that you had commented on Jimmy. So just on the spacing relative to the offshore wind. When do you guys find out what the final outcome of that spacing is? I guess we're what one mile by one mile now is \u2013 or is that...","Jim Judge","Yes, one mile is \u2013 and fortunately we were the first ones to agree to go to that design a while ago. And so we're probably further along than others in terms of development of COPs that need to be filed with the BOEM. Again it's to accommodate the shipping and coast guard and fishing interests. The \u2013 we do believe the coast guard agrees that it's adequate to address the concerns that they had initially. And we think that will weigh in on BOEM's decision when they evaluate the cumulative impact. All the developers have agreed to the same format that Eversource and \u00d8rsted have committed to earlier. So we'll see how addresses the concerns or questions that BOEM may have and we'll know about that on June 11 or 12.","Andy Levi","Okay. So in mid-June we'll get the idea of what the final spacing is, or will that be in December?","Jim Judge","I think June will give you \u2013 the expectation is that we'll get a draft \u2013 yes from BOEM that will address the cumulative impact of these six leases and provides standards for us to use going forward. That draft EIS ultimately will be finalized by the end of 2020. I think the date that was published through the Vineyard Wind decision was a record of decision December 18, 2020. So June 12 for the draft and December 18 for the final.","Andy Levi","Okay. And then just on the spacing I guess, I'd been \u2013 \u00d8rsted was in New York earlier in the month. So if the spacing right now we're one mile by one mile. But if the spacing got I guess wider, I don't know if that's the right term but if it was 1.25 miles or whatever it is, at what stage does -- not the first two projects but kind of the overall concept of making a large investment as far as for no better way to put it building a factory or building the stuff that you are on land.","At what stage does the spacing become too wide? And makes it kind of not as economic or not economical to kind of put all that capital in, because it would take away from, the longer-term growth abilities, of the overall acreage, that you have?","Jim Judge","Yeah. I think, as I said, the one-by-one should be adequate. One of the mitigating factors, Andy is that, when we began this process. And we talked about 4,000 megawatts we were looking at a technology that was 8-megawatt turbines.","And now we're seeing that \u00d8rsted is actually testing here in Massachusetts, some of the 12-megawatt turbines. So, we were forced to have two holes in the water, if you will.","It may very well be that it doesn't have larger turbines on them, which would obviously, positively, impact the economics. So, right now, we don't anticipate any need beyond the one-by-one.","But we continue to believe that, that will be adequate to provide us the financial results, that we're targeting in.","Andy Levi","But anything over the one by-one, kind of changes everything?","Jim Judge","So, I don't know, what changes everything. But we'd certainly, evaluate it. I haven't heard anybody propose, something beyond the one-by-one, other than the discussions about shipping lanes also being...","Andy Levi","The corridors and things like that?","Jim Judge","Yeah. Yeah.","Andy Levi","Okay. So I guess we still have to monitor it. But it does seem that to be the biggest concern that \u00d8rsted had, in kind of the entire process. But I should have this down at lunch so. Okay, thank you guys. [Indiscernible], so I've got to go.","Jeffrey Kotkin","Okay. That's all right. Thanks, Andy. Next question is from Andrew Weisel from Scotia. Good morning, Andrew.","Andrew Weisel","Hey, Good morning, everyone. A lot of it is already covered of course, but just a quick one on the offshore wind. If we do see some slippage, in the in-service dates related to BOEM or whatever.","Do you have a quick and dirty rule of thumb of what, a 1-year delay, would have on earned returns relative to your expectation of mid-teens, whether that's tax credits or more broadly?","Jim Judge","No. I don't think it sort of reduces our returns. It basically will just delay them. We have factored into our purchase power agreement, flexibility for delays, especially if they're created by regulatory approvals.","So, we don't anticipate, major financial consequences of it, although if further delays occur, the earnings profile would shift out from what we're currently planning for 2020 to 2025.","Andrew Weisel","Got it, okay. And then, just lastly on, O&M. Obviously, you're guiding to flat through the forecast period. Would that be flattish in each year, including 2020, or is there any lumpiness or gradual trajectory?","Jim Judge","It should be consistent throughout the forecast period, Andrew. No particular lumpiness.","Andrew Weisel","Okay. So 2020, should be flat with 2019, then?","Jim Judge","Yeah. Modestly flat, I'd say. In 2019, we had, I think, one of the drivers of O&M being up or really that driver is really kind of a higher level of storms, than we had had the previous year.","So, I know you've heard that from other people. Storms sometimes could create lumpiness. But we're not expecting any other known items to be lumpy, during that time period.","Andrew Weisel","Got it. Thank you very much.","Jim Judge","All right, thanks Andrew.","Jeffrey Kotkin","Next question we have from Mike Weinstein from Credit Suisse.","Mike Weinstein","Hi guys. With all the offshore talk I thought I'd switch over to the other water, for a minute. You've owned Aquarion, now for a few years. Can you describe how operating and planning of water system has been more or less difficult, than the electric and gas systems, that you would have?","I remember at the time you were the first electric utility and really to buy a water company? And there was, questions about whether that would be easier or more difficult.","And then, also now that you have some experience, but you consider looking beyond New England for further water investments, at some point. I know that in the past you haven't but now that you have experience, would you maybe reconsider that?","Jim Judge","Yeah. I would say that, the water business that we've had for a short period of time that we have, has met or exceeded expectations. I mean, we committed that it would be accretive to earnings the first year. It's a very, very small business obviously but it was. They grew their earnings in the second year.","I do -- there is sort of a roll-up strategy within the towns. I think, in the last seven or eight years where we've rolled in 70 or 71 small water entities. But it doesn't move the dial a lot it's relatively small. It's over 50,000 water entities in the state.","So -- I'm sorry the country. And so, it doesn't bank for consolidation. As I mentioned earlier, the pricing is so high, that it's tough to justify paying the premiums that it -- would be required. I think that, we have expanded our footprint.","And I started many years ago in Boston-Edison. And we are -- we shared pretty well. We knew Massachusetts. When we did the deal that created Eversource. We expanded our footprint into Connecticut and New Hampshire, and then, proven that we're able to accelerate really in terms of our operation and financial results, beyond Massachusetts.","Now we're into New York, with offshore wind. And we've had some success there. So, I think, we're less hesitant to move outside of our footprint. And it may very well mean that our water expansion would require us to do that.","Mike Weinstein","Thank you.","Jeffrey Kotkin","All right, thanks, Mike. That was the last question in the queue. So we want to thank you all very much, for your time today. If you've got any follow-up questions, please give us a call.","Operator","Thank you ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. And you may now disconnect."],"8621":["Eversource Energy (NYSE:ES) Q4 2016 Earnings Call February 22, 2017  9:00 AM ET","Executives","Jeffrey R. Kotkin - Eversource Energy","James J.

My name is John, and I'll be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.","And now, I will turn the call over to Jeffrey Kotkin.","Jeffrey R. Kotkin - Eversource Energy","Thank you, John. Good morning and thank you for joining us. I'm Jeff Kotkin, Eversource Energy's Vice President for Investor Relations. We posted a slide deck on our website last night, and we'll be referencing those slides this morning. Now, as you can see on slide one, some of the statements made during this investor call maybe forward-looking as defined within the meaning of the Safe Harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risk and uncertainty, which may cause the actual result to differ materially from forecast and projections. Some of these factors are set forth in the news release issued yesterday.","Additional information about the various factors that may cause actual results to differ can be found in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2016. Additionally, our explanation of how and why we use certain non-GAAP measures is contained within our news release and the slides we posted last night on our website under presentations and webcast, and in our most recent 10-K. Turning to slide two, speaking today will be Jim Judge, our President and CEO; Lee Olivier, our Executive Vice President for Enterprise Energy Strategy and Business Development; and Phil Lembo, our Executive Vice President, CFO and Treasurer. Also, joining us today are Jay Buth, our Vice President and Controller; and John Moreira, our Vice President of Financial Planning and Analysis.","Now, I will turn to slide three and turn over the call to Jim.","James J. Judge - Eversource Energy","Thank you, Jeff, and thank you all for joining us this morning. I want to take a few minutes to provide some high level comments on our 2016 accomplishments and our outlook for 2017 and beyond before turning the call over to Lee and Phil to provide the details. Let me start with slide four by discussing our long-term vision to Eversource Energy. We aspire to be the most successful and respected energy company in the country. I think that involves Eversource becoming the primary catalyst for low-cost clean energy development in New England. We expect to provide our 3.7 million electric and natural gas customers with superior service, which means top tier reliability, prompt and responsive customer service, helpful insights into what drives energy use, and how customers can utilize their energy more efficiently.","We expect to partner in executing the energy strategies of the three states we serve. And finally, we will help strengthen our communities, not just on energy issues but to support civic and charitable needs that are important to the economic vibrancy. For investors, we expect to continue to provide you with the best risk adjusted returns in the industry with very strong earnings and dividend growth, paired with growing cash flows and an attractive balance sheet. As you can see in last night's news release and on slide five, we project annual earnings growth of 5% to 7% through 2020 using the $2.96 per share we earned in 2016 as the base. We're confident that such a growth rate is very well founded and achievable under a wide range of scenarios. Phil will provide you with some of the sensitivities shortly.","As you can see on slide six, we raised the common dividend by 6.6% last year, and earlier this month our board approved an additional 6.7% increase for 2017. These increases are consistent with our goal of raising the dividend at a rate that is consistent with our earnings growth. Our payout ratio of 60% is relatively low for a regulated electric and gas company, and our S&P ratings are the best in the industry, which illustrates the depth of our financial strength. We chalked up a number of accomplishments in 2016 that were consistent with our long-term focus. In terms of operations, you can see on slide seven that we continued to provide top tier service reliability for our customers, and introduced a number of enhancements that will allow us to respond more quickly to routine and emergency requests.","We completed our $2.2 billion capital plan for the year. We managed well within our operating budgets, which largely offset the negative impact of one of the warmest first quarters ever in New England, allowing us to finish 2016 within the earnings guidance that we provided to you a year ago. Since our merger in 2012, we have reduced annual operations and maintenance expense by approximately $250 million, even while measures of service quality have improved and some have improved dramatically. We also made significant progress in 2016 on our strategic initiatives. In December, we announced the formation of Bay State Wind with Danish Oil and Natural Gas, the world's leading developer of offshore wind generation, to develop 300 square miles offshore wind site on a continental shelf south of Cape Cod and the islands. We will bid the project into the initial Massachusetts RFP for offshore wind this summer.","Also in December, we received Massachusetts regulatory approval for the construction of 62 megawatts of additional solar generation. While in New Hampshire, regulators reiterated their support for the sale of 1,200 megawatts of PSNH's mostly fossil generation. Also, in New Hampshire, the Site Evaluation Committee appears to be solidly on a path to issue a decision on Northern Pass within the next seven months. When taken together, you can see how we continue to position Eversource Energy as the leader in supporting our region's rapid development of clean-generating sources. Reducing the region's carbon footprint requires other initiatives as well. First, it requires increased access to natural gas to provide both base load energy and balancing resources that allow for the construction of more wind and more solar sources. It also requires increased pipeline capacity to provide customers with the opportunity to change their primary heating source from oil to natural gas.","As we will discuss, we had some disappointments in 2016 on Access Northeast. But we and our partners Spectra Energy and National Grid, firmly believe the project is critical to enabling the region to meet its energy goals, and to keep energy affordable for our customers in the winter. We all remain committed to its success. As Phil will discuss, achieving our financial, operating and strategic goals requires us to have strong trusting relationships with our policymakers, particularly, our state regulators. Three of the four electric distribution companies will have rate reviews this year. Given the strong record of reliability and customer service we have had over the past several years, and the significant reduction in operating cost that we have realized for customers, we are confident in achieving reasonable outcomes in these proceedings. For us, those outcomes will provide customers with continued improvements in service, as we continue to invest heavily in our distribution systems, while providing reasonable rate levels.","Finally, I want to stress the talent of our 7,800 employees who delivered these excellent results, and I'm so glad as CEO to say they delivered them in a safe manner. 2016 was, in fact, our best year ever for employee safety. We went through a great deal of change in 2016, and we continued to perform extremely well. Last May, Tom May, stepped down from his great run as CEO, and when I became CEO, Phil seamlessly moved into the CFO role. We've been very successful lifting many of our operating metrics to the upper tier of the industry, while lowering our cost through standardization of best practices. Lee and his team continued to advance our new investment opportunities, whether they are Northern Pass, Access Northeast, Bay State Wind, Massachusetts Solar or new opportunities in electric vehicle charging infrastructure and energy storage. This strong performance explains why we're so optimistic about our future.","Now, I'll turn over the call to Lee.","Leon J. Olivier - Eversource Energy","Okay. Thanks, Jim. And before I start, I'll just say for an excuse me for my voice. I've been a little bit of whatever is going around here in February. However, I will provide you with a brief update on our major investment initiatives and then turn the call over to Phil. Let's start with Northern Pass in slide nine, and New Hampshire Site Evaluation Committee or SEC has set evidentiary hearing dates on the project which begin on April 4 and continue through July 21. We consider this schedule supportive of the SEC stated commitment to issue a final written order no later than September 30, 2017. The project also has secured a major legal victory on January 31 when the New Hampshire Supreme Court upheld a lower court decision, which found that the State Department of Transportation has exclusive authority to approve construction of utility facilities along and beneath state highways.","Project opponents have claimed the utilities were also required to obtain permission of adjacent property owners to construct facilities in the public right of way. This was a very important ruling for the project since 60 miles of undergrounding we have proposed is largely under state and local roads. Since our last conference call, interveners have filed their testimony and we've had the opportunity to query their witnesses. Next week, several state agencies including transportation, environmental services, and historic resources are scheduled to file their recommendations on the project to the SEC. Governor Sununu continues to be a strong supporter of Northern Pass, recognizing the billions of dollars of economic benefits it will bring to the State, in addition to the significant reduction in the region's carbon emissions, about 3 million fewer tons of CO2 annually, even mentioned the need for Northern Pass and the lower electric bills the project will bring to make New Hampshire businesses more competitive in his inaugural speech.","As you can see from slide 10, assuming we will receive a favorable decision from the SEC in September, we expect to receive the U.S. Department of Energy approval before the end of this year. With those approvals on hand, we expect to begin the construction early in 2018, and for the project to be completed by the end of 2019. Our new capital forecast shows capital expenditures associated with Northern Pass of about $680 million in 2018 and $800 million in 2019. We will have a better estimate on the final testing plan and in-service date later this year once we have more clarity on the SEC and the DOE approvals, and the equipment manufacturing schedule. We will bid Northern Pass into a clean energy RFP that Massachusetts will be running in the spring.","Turning to slide 11, you can see that the legislation signed last August by Governor Baker authorizes the State's electric distribution companies to purchase 9.5 terawatt hours of clean energy with the full amount contracted no later than 2022. The initial RFP is scheduled to be released by April 1, 2017 or approximately five weeks from now. A draft RFP issued earlier this month calls for bids to be submitted by July 27. We believe Northern Pass is very well-positioned for this RFP, which specifically allows large hydro to be eligible. You will notice on the slide that the same legislation that created the April Clean Energy RFP also requires the state to issue an RFP by the end of June for a minimum of 400 megawatts of offshore wind with a full 1,600 megawatts contracted by 2027.","As you can see on slide 12, and as Jim discussed earlier, we announced in December a partnership with DONG Energy of Denmark, the world's leading developer of offshore wind generation to develop a 300-mile square track, 15 to 25 miles south of Martha's Vineyard. Our Bay State Wind partnership calls for us to share 50-50 in all development costs and associated benefits. Bay State Wind ultimately can own enough wind turbines to generate at least 2,000 megawatts of clean renewable power. This area is attractive because the water depths are relatively shallow about 30 to 65 meters, and the wind speeds are high and reliable, resulting in high capacity factors similar to base load generation. This is particularly valuable in the winter when electricity is more costly in New England due to our natural gas pipeline constraints.","We expect that once a winner or winners are selected, contracts with Massachusetts electric companies will be filed with the DPU in the first half of 2018, with commission with approvals later in the year. We will expect the permitting would take several years with construction not starting until after 2020. As a result, the capital forecast released today does not reflect Bay State Wind construction expenditures in it. While our offshore wind opportunity is a number of years out, we expect it will be very significant as New England States continue to push toward a 75% to 80% reduction in carbon emissions by 2050, offshore wind will become an increasingly attractive option. The experience in Europe showed a 50% reduction in construction cost over the past four years as a supply and network was built up. Turbines became larger and construction techniques improved.","Wind sites off of southeast of Massachusetts are much closer to New England's load centers than onshore wind sites in Northern New England, and involve much less transmission construction and potential for scheduled delays. As a result, we expect offshore wind to be a very competitive renewable source of power in the Northeast. Massachusetts also views offshore wind as a significant economic development opportunity. Bay State Wind and two other firms that have secured offshore wind tracks south of Martha's Vineyard, have identified New Bedford in Southern Massachusetts as one of its potential staging areas for offshore logistics and construction. Other states may also consider energy and economic benefits of this opportunity as well.","From Bay State Wind, I will turn to Access Northeast in slide 13. You may recall that three of the New England States, Connecticut, Rhode Island and Maine passed legislation in recent years, explicitly allowing their respective electric distribution companies to sign long-term contracts for a natural gas pipeline capacity. Each of these states has shown strong support for modernizing the region's natural gas pipeline infrastructure to improve energy reliability, reduce carbon emissions from coal, oil generation and lower price volatility, and total energy cost for customers. In fact, the main PUC last summer voted to move forward with Access Northeast. Unfortunately, there is currently a lack of uniform energy regulatory policy across the New England States.","In Massachusetts, the Supreme Judicial Court ruled in August that the state's electric distribution companies could not sign such contracts. And a couple of months later, the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission said, they could not approve such contracts under current law. As a result, our focus is on developing new path forward that would continue to include participation of all New England States. One option involves pursuing a change in the laws in Massachusetts and New Hampshire so that they align with statutes (17:47) in Connecticut, Rhode Island and Maine. We also appealed the New Hampshire PUC audit of the State Supreme Court, which agreed last week to consider the case. Another avenue is to secure contracts with natural gas distribution companies in Massachusetts and other New England States.","We are not alone and want to develop a path forward. In fact, all New England Governor (18:11) support a reasonable approach. However, we need to resolve the issues in Massachusetts and New Hampshire to move ahead. One fact that hasn't changed is the need for Access Northeast. Once a time prices in New England continued to be a couple of cents a kilowatt hour higher than they are outside the winter season. This fact continues to add about $1 billion a winter to the cost of supply in the region, 6.5 million electric customers with electricity, and requires the continued operation of older, higher emitting generation such as coal and oil plants.","The differential is solely due to winter pipeline constraints which lead to power plant curtailments. The region's supply situation is illustrated on slide 14. We simply don't have enough of natural gas this time of the year to both heat our homes and businesses, and to run the region's power plants. Access Northeast is uniquely positioned to address this problem since it touches 60% of the regions gas-fired power generation. The region's supply situation will worsen in June when the largest coal and oil generator, the more than 1,500 megawatt Brayton Point Power Station retires. Pilgrim nuclear station is slated to retire two years later. And every base load unit that is slated into service over the period of time is fueled by natural gas. New England's natural gas supply situation may also worsen following the retirement of New York's Indian Point nuclear units now expected to retire in 2020 and 2021. It's likely that New York State will replace much of the lost Indian Point generation with power from new combined cycle natural gas units. This would further tighten natural gas supplies as you move east from the Marcellus and into New England.","Well, that underscores the need for all of our major projects. It does not bode well for the long-term cost facing the winning (20:13) customers, and is likely to have severe reliability impacts. In Maine and New Hampshire, the issue of electricity cost continues to be a high profile issue with manufacturers of products (20:26) paper goods to firearms, to chocolates saying they're having difficult time competing with other regions of the country due to our high energy prices, and the volatility of that energy. Some of these customers have recently announced plans to expand or move current operations out of the region.","In his annual State of the Grid report three weeks ago, and in the 2017 Regional Electricity Outlook that was released yesterday, ISO New England President and CEO, Gordon van Welie warned that New England is challenged to meet electricity demands with existing fuel infrastructure, particularly during the winter. He said, market rules would need to change if we cannot invest in new gas infrastructure or allow increased use of dual-fuel capacity, which will further add greater carbon to the region. The clear message is that New England needs access to increased supplies of natural gas in the winter, and needs it soon unless it wants its reliability to be dependent on old units, oil and coal built in the 1950s and 1960s, that are past their efficient lives.","The recently concluded forward capacity auction will likely place more pressure on the region's older oil and coal units. Those units depend heavily on capacity revenues since they have very low energy revenues in today's market, especially during mild winters like we've had in the past two years. As you can see on slide 15, after picking two years ago, capacity payments have declined in each of the past two auctions falling to $5.30 per kilowatt hour a month for the 12 months starting June 1, 2020. We fully expect more of our older fossil generation units to retire in the coming years, only to be replaced by renewables and more natural gas-fired capacity, thereby deepening the region's need for Access Northeast.","Now, I'm going to turn the call over to Phil.","Phil Lembo - Eversource Energy","Thank you, Lee. And today I have a few topics to cover; one would be our fourth quarter and full year financial results. I'll talk about our 2017 and long-term earnings guidance, growth guidance. I'll give you an update on several of our transmission projects, discuss several of the key state and federal regulatory dockets that we have pending, and provide some color on our new capital expenditure and transmission rate base forecast.","So, let me start with the quarter on slide 17. We earned $229.2 million or $0.72 per share in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to earnings of $181.8 million or $0.57 per share in the fourth quarter of 2015. Our transmission segment earned $0.33 per share in the fourth quarter of 2016, that compares to $0.25 per share in the fourth quarter of 2015.","One of the \u2013 two primary drivers for this earnings growth was higher transmission rate base which is due to our continued investment in the reliability of the New England power grid, and I will update you on some key reliability-driven projects in a minute. But the other principal driver was a settlement approved by FERC last month that allows us to recover certain merger-related costs through our transmission rates. The settlement added $0.05 per share in the fourth quarter. FERC had previously allowed recovery of these costs beginning in June, and we had started recording that at that time, but it was subject to a final decision.","On the Electric Distribution and Generation side, we earned $0.26 per share in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared with earnings of $0.28 per share in the fourth quarter of 2015. Fourth quarter results decreased in 2016 primarily due to higher depreciation, property tax, interest and bad debt expense, and partially offset by some higher distribution revenues in the period.","On the Natural Gas Distribution side, we earned $0.08 per share in the fourth quarter of 2016 and that compared to earnings of $0.05 per share in the fourth quarter of last year. Although still somewhat warmer than average, temperatures in the fourth quarter of 2016 were much colder than during the same period of 2015 when we experienced by far the warmest December on record. Cold temperatures in 2016 resulted in 22% increase in the fourth quarter from natural gas sales in 2016 as compared to 2015.","At the Eversource parent and other, we earned $0.05 per share in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to a slight loss in the fourth quarter of 2015. We benefited this year from a lower effective tax rate and the absence of $8 million of integration cost that were recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015.","Turning from the fourth quarter to the full year results, we earned $942.3 million or $2.96 per share in 2016, compared with GAAP earnings of $878.5 million or $2.76 per share in 2015. Those 2015 earnings included $0.05 per share in integration cost.","Transmission earnings totaled $1.16 per share in 2016, compared with earnings of $0.96 per share in 2015. In addition to a higher rate base, 2016 results benefited from the absence of a $0.04 charge that we recorded in 2015 related to a FERC decision, the first return on equity complaint against the New England transmission owners, from the recovery of merger-related cost I mentioned earlier.","On the Electric Distribution and Generation segment, we earned $1.46 per share in 2016, that compares to $1.59 per share in 2015. The decline was primarily due to the absence of $0.12 per share of benefits that we recognized in the first and fourth quarters of 2015 as a result of resolving multiple regulatory proceedings at NSTAR Electric, primarily involving recovery of bad debts and infrastructure investments. Additionally, higher depreciation and property tax expense resulted from our ongoing investment in distribution system reduced full year earnings by $0.07 per share.","On the Natural Gas Distribution segment, we earned $0.24 per share in 2016, compared to earnings of $0.23 in 2015. Rate increase at NSTAR Gas, and continued customer growth was partially offset by much milder first quarter weather in 2016 impacting those results.","At the parent, we earned $0.10 per share in 2016 compared to a loss of $0.02 per share in 2015. Much of that change was related to the absence of approximately $15 million of integration cost in 2015. We also benefited from lower effective tax rate during the year.","O&M continues to be a good story, positive story for us and it was again in 2016 as our employees continued to provide excellent reliability for our customers while also reducing costs. Lower O&M added $0.08 per share to earnings in 2016, really, if you would exclude the benefits we recorded in the first and fourth quarters of 2015 when regulatory orders allowed us to reduce the level of bad debts at NSTAR Electric by more than $35 million on a pre-tax basis. So, positive O&M story again in 2016.","Turning from our financial results to operations. Our transmission investments totaled approximately $900 million in 2016, and that compares to approximately $800 million in 2015 and $700 million in 2014. As you can see on slide 18, we progressed very well on a number of major transmission reliability projects during the year. Through December 31, we invested $134 million in 28 different projects that together comprise the $560 million Greater Boston Reliability Solutions suite. We expect to conclude the final Greater Boston work in 2019.","We've invested $117 million through 2016 in the Greater Hartford projects, which again are a variety of 27 different projects, which together we expect to complete in 2018 at a cost of approximately $350 million. All these projects listed here are progressing very well, according to budget and schedule.","From operations, I'll turn to our regulatory activity and start in Massachusetts in slide 19. On January 17, we filed electric rate reviews with the Massachusetts DPU for NSTAR Electric and Western Mass Electric. While we filed two different sets of rate schedules, we've notified the DPU and FERC that we are seeking to legally merge the two companies in 2018.","From an operations perspective, they currently are operating on a integrated basis and providing excellent service to our 1.4 million electric customers in the Bay State. The rate review costs were an increase, modestly, (30:46) distribution revenues of about $60 million at NSTAR Electric and $36 million at Western Mass Electric.","As part of that, we were also seeking a performance-based, rate-making initiative which incorporates investments of $400 million capital initiatives over the next five years. That includes $120 million in new distribution automation, $100 million in energy storage, $45 million in new electric vehicle infrastructure. Additionally, we're filing for revenue decoupling at NSTAR Electric, and Western Mass Electric has had full revenue decoupling since 2011. In terms of schedule, Intervenor Testimony is due April 21. Here, in the schedule for June with the final decision expected by the end of November of this year.","Our other general distribution rate review this year will be in Connecticut at Connecticut Light and Power which we are required to file this June as a result of our 2012 Connecticut merger settlement agreement. We expect the rate request at CL&P to be quite modest. And really, in each of these rate reviews, in Massachusetts and in Connecticut, we present the compelling story of really dramatically improving reliability while reducing cost for customers.","Moving to slide 20. Here we discuss possible impacts of any changes to the federal tax code. While we expect Congress will start to address tax reform this year, I'm not sure that anybody and we don't know what the timing will be or how will exactly the final tax reform will impact us or our customers. Nonetheless, as a regulated T&D company, the vast majority of all the impacts of tax reform including any cross-border tax, if they were to occur, are likely to be passed through to customers in rates and in revenue requirement changes.","As you can see on this slide, the customers would benefit obviously from lower corporate tax rate, as well as a potential refund of ADIT balances. However, these benefits could be largely offset if there's potential non-deductibility of interest of property tax or state income tax, so much to be determined. But our reference will focus on working with our regulators, legislators and the industry in general to ensure that (33:24) changes benefit our customers in the form of lower rates and protect our shareholder interest.","We expect very modest impact on Eversource's ongoing financial results, lower ADIT balances would likely increase rate base. However, that could be offset if the nearly $60 million of our parent interest is no longer deductible. And we have very little in terms of unused tax credits, so minimal impact on Eversource.","Now, moving into 2017, and the earnings guidance. Our guidance for 2017 is earnings per share in the $3.05 to $3.20 range, and one of the assumption there is we assume the current FERC ROEs remain in place of 10.57% ROE that we currently have in place with a cap of 11.74%.","We continue to have multiple dockets around transmission ROEs pending, at FERC. The status of each complaint is noted on slide 21. As you know, no decision was made on complaints two and three before retirement of Chairman Bay this month. So, maybe a number of months before these complaints are decided.","From transmission, I'll turn to generation, slide 22. On December 29, the Massachusetts DPU approved an application from NSTAR Electric and Western Mass Electric to build a total of 62 megawatts of solar facilities in the Commonwealth. We've commenced with the design and contracting, siting and permitting and approval processes, and expect to invest approximately $200 million in these facilities this year.","In New Hampshire, the PUC has approved the auction process for PSNH's 1,200 megawatt of generation and published a schedule for the auction. We expect the PUC to receive final binding bids in early August and close on the transaction later and prior to the end of 2017.","As you may recall, existing New Hampshire Legislation enables the recovery of all of our plant and investment through the sale \u2013 through securitization if there's any stranded cost that from the net proceeds of the sale.","Now, turn to slide 23, and the capital investment plan that supports our 2017 guidance and really a long-term 5% to 7% growth rate through 2020. You can see that we project capital expenditures of $2.7 billion in 2017 and nearly $10 billion from 2017 through 2020. These figures include $1.5 billion of investment in Northern Pass through 2019. And incremental investments in Access Northeast or Bay State Wind would be an additive to the $10 billion figure.","There are number of changes in this forecast as compared with the one we published a year ago that support our growth rate through 2020. And let me just say upfront, that if you take the time period from our last CapEx forecast which included years 2017 through 2019, and you look at those very same years and this year's forecast, spending is up about $1 billion in that time period.","So, let me get into some of the more details of the plan. First, as I said, there's additional capital spending in our forecast to really strengthen and protect our system. Even though we've moved most of Northern Pass construction from 2017 to 2018 and 2019, we've identified other critical work for this year resulting in a capital budget for 2017 of $2.71 billion, which is consistent and slightly ahead of the $2.66 billion estimate for 2017 that we had forecasted at this time last year.","Transmission investments at our four regulated utilities are expected to total $950 million for this year as compared with $609 million we have projected a year ago. We are forecasting $1.4 billion of transmission capital expenditures in 2018 and $1.2 billion in 2019. Also, we expect to invest $3.9 billion in Electric Transmission over the next four years.","Estimated cost for the major transmission projects are very similar to what we had projected last year, $1.6 billion for Northern Pass, $560 million for the Greater Boston suite of projects, $350 million for the Greater Hartford suite of projects. The increased capital expenditures in 2017 and 2018 are really driven by a few items including spending on critical infrastructure protection projects, storm hardening and various projects related to reliability in terms of line replacement and pole structural changes.","On the Electric Distribution side, we're projecting investments of approximately $1.2 billion this year including our solar investment, which I mentioned, was $200 million. And then, approximately, $900 million per year from 2018 through 2020. Other than the solar investment, our Electric Distribution forecast is similar to what we had showed a year ago.","We've also significantly increased our projected investment in our Natural Gas Distribution business. As you can see on slide 24, in 2016, we invested approximately $270 million in that business segment, and we have raised our capital investment levels in that segment over the next four years to total nearly $1.5 billion including the $364 million in 2017.","There are number of factors really driving the level of spending there compared with past years. And the first is driven by state policymakers who want our oldest \u2013 our older cast iron and unprotected steel pipe removed from our system at a faster pace. We spent about $113 million on pipe replacement in 2016, and we expect to increase that to $118 million in 2017, and that's a level we expect to maintain in the following years.","We're also at the early stages of a $200 million upgrade at our natural gas storage facility in Eastern Massachusetts for which we have a capital expenditure tracker in place. That project should be completed in 2020.","As you can see from this slide, nearly 50% of all the Natural Gas Distribution capital investment in the forecast is tracked to approve regulatory rate mechanism. So, we received immediate recovery for that. This includes the gas system expansion mechanism enabled by the Connecticut legislature several years ago that Yankee Gas continues to use to connect more residential, commercial, industrial and municipal customers to its system. Earlier this month, the Massachusetts DPU approved a much more modest but similar pilot program at NSTAR Gas.","Natural gas remains the fuel of choice for new construction in our service territory. And depending on the type of oil large commercial and industrial customers' use, they can reduce their energy bills by up to \u2013 by nearly 40%, really by converting from oil to natural gas, really even at today's oil prices. Natural gas conversions also support Connecticut's efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80% by 2050.","A few years ago, we have projected that we would be able to double the earnings of our Natural Gas Distribution segment from $60 million in 2013 to more than $120 million in 2023. And we earn nearly $78 million in that segment in 2016 despite a very mild first quarter. So, you can see we're on plan to achieve our forecast.","You can see on slide 25 that over the next four years, we expect Electric Transmission and Natural Gas Distribution to represent a larger share of our rate base. With transmission rising to 42% of our rate base and natural gas to 11%. We project our overall rate base to total $19.2 billion by the end of 2019 and $19.7 billion by the end of 2020. I should note that the 2019 figure is $900 million that was a in our projection a year ago. Most of that increase about (43:08) $650 million is, again, attributable to investment in Electric Transmission. The other growth comes from increased investment in the Natural Gas Distribution pipe replacement in our recently approved Massachusetts solar program.","Investment in our system is expected to be the principal driver of earnings growth over the next four years. But another is the continued cost management of our operating cost. Over the next four years through 2020, we still have significant opportunities to reduce cost, but not at the same scale as the past four years during which, as Jim mentioned, we reduced O&M by about $250 million.","These costs are being driven \u2013 cost reductions are being driven by our continued implementation of standardization and best practices throughout the company and consolidation of several business applications to a more modern technology with greater functionality and flexibility. All of these changes will make us even more efficient and better able to meet our customers' needs while lowering costs.","Lastly, I want to turn to our financing plans. To start, I want to reiterate that we have no plans to issue equity over the next four years to finance our capital expenditures and dividend growth. We expect many of our companies to issue debt during the year. Debt issuances will continue \u2013 debt issuances will result from a combination of capital expenditure programs and debt maturities, and we provided a list of this year's debt maturities in the appendix to the materials.","So, in closing, we're very confident and very proud of our accomplishments over the past five years. And then slide 26 illustrates the progress on multiple fronts. We continue to be a company that delivers on its promises, improving service to our customers, addressing our region's unique energy challenges, and providing new investors with above-average earnings and dividend growth while maintaining high level of financial strength and stability. I look forward and we all look forward to seeing many of you at our investor conferences coming up in Boston and in New York over the next week.","And now, I'll turn the call back to Jeff for any Q&A.","Jeffrey R. Kotkin - Eversource Energy","Thank you, Phil. And I'll turn the call back to John, just to remind you how to enter questions. John?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session.","Jeffrey R. Kotkin - Eversource Energy","Thank you, John. Our first question this morning is from Mike Weinstein from Credit Suisse. Good morning, Mike.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hey. Good morning. Thanks for the very thorough update. First question is on the transmission ROEs. Are you expecting any kind of impact from the loss of a quorum at FERC on the outcome for complaints two and three?","Phil Lembo - Eversource Energy","I'm sorry, Mike. Could you \u2013 I think you broke up there for a minute. Could you repeat that?","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Oh, yeah. Are you expecting any kind of impact from the loss of a quorum at FERC on the outcome for the ROE transmission complaints numbers two and three?","Phil Lembo - Eversource Energy","Okay. That's the part I missed. Just in terms of \u2013 as I said in my remarks, we had expected and we had indicated we may get that decision in 2016. So, without a quorum it's really anybody's guess as to when an order will come out. So, I think impacts would be sort of on a timing basis, but certainly the nature of who fills those seats could be impactful also. So, we'll have to just wait and see, but we're expecting some decision in 2017 on those.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Right. And then, separately, on Access Northeast. I'm sorry, if I missed this. But have you guys discussed like what's the next step there in terms of getting LDCs to contract for it or moving forward?","Leon J. Olivier - Eversource Energy","Mike, this is Lee Olivier. We're having, are having conversations with LDCs. We're have \u2013 moving in both (47:54) two states, Massachusetts and New Hampshire, obviously New Hampshire we have appealed at the lower courts, (48:01) the Supreme Court, it's accepted it. There is movement inside of the New Hampshire legislature for a Bill that would allow the PUC to review proposed contracts in the future. And in Massachusetts, there is a really kind of an outreach campaign with key business leaders and legislators (48:28) to understand the impact that a \u2013 not having additional gas pipeline capacity will have to the region, to reliability, to cost. And as I mentioned, the ISO New England issued its New England electricity outlook yesterday, which paints a very dim picture.","They're also working on an analysis that will be up by mid-year, that will, we believe, specify what will have to take place in New England in order to ensure reliability, which could create significant additional cost for the region as well as creating additional \u2013 significant additional emissions, to the region as well by maintaining older oil and coal-fired power plants and\/or other sources of electricity to ensure reliability. So, we're working on all of those fronts.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. That means (49:28) so, basically, I mean, are kind of waiting for that report to come out mid-year before any (49:34)?","Leon J. Olivier - Eversource Energy","Yeah. I think, the New Hampshire will move along is in a successful way. I think it's really, once that report comes out, it's really going to be \u2013 show the significant impact that New England will face without additional gas pipeline capacity.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Right. And I wonder if you could comment a little bit on the Connecticut Legislation that will allow the contracting of nuclear for clean energy purposes and where do you see that going forward at this point?","James J. Judge - Eversource Energy","Yeah. This is Jim, Mike. We did file a testimony, provided testimony of that proceeding. I think the fundamental question is one of need. I think if Dominion can show sort of a need for some supplemental revenue stream, it makes it more compelling I think for their argument. But there is already an existing process to follow in the region and that is through the ISO New England process. If they are actually planning on retiring the plant, they could file for that with ISO New England. ISO New England could choose to give them a must-win (50:44) contract going forward. Those costs would be spread around all of New England rather than burdening just the rate payers (50:51) in Connecticut.","So, I think, a lot of intervention is occurring in Connecticut in opposition to that, and we'll have to monitor it closely.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","All right, great. Thank you very much.","Jeffrey R. Kotkin - Eversource Energy","All right. Thanks, Mike. Our next question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith. Good morning, Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Hey. Good morning, Jim. So, perhaps just to follow-up a little bit on what Mike was getting at a second ago. Can you elaborate a little bit with regards to Access Northeast? Is it possible to get just gas LDCs to make this project work? Or to what extent ultimately are you dependent upon getting success in Massachusetts one way or another to get this project on (51:29)? And then perhaps a third piece here is, is there a point in time at which you kind of say this is a go-no-go on the project and\/or pursue a new strategy like, say, file at ISO New England with a tariff approach, for instance?","Leon J. Olivier - Eversource Energy","Yeah. Julien, this is Lee. Your first question was, can you make it work with just the LDCs? The answer to that is no. We cannot make it work with just LDC load. There's not enough LDC load to do that. So, that will not work in itself (52:03).","The second one is that we are \u2013 you really do need Massachusetts. Massachusetts makes up about 42% of the load share in the region and you have the other states that clearly \u2013 that you don't want to see Massachusetts create a free-rider situation, so you really have to have Massachusetts play. And it's obviously in their best interest to do that.","And your last question about an option which is talking at (52:33) tariff at ISO New England and having FERC approve that. That is an option that we are also looking at as well. If you recall, the original option that NESCOE came up with several years ago was to use that methodology and then as a result of our consultations with the then FERC Commission and staff basically said it would be cleaner if it was done inside of the state, which we still think that is true. However, that is an option that we are looking at now.","James J. Judge - Eversource Energy","Yeah. Julien, just if I could add in terms of the commitment, this report, I guess, that came out of ISO this week, the ISO CEO says that he is concerned about keeping lights on in the coming winters. So, that creates a great degree of concern here. And at Eversource, we remain committed to the project. Also, if you look at what Spectra is saying in terms of its commitment, I think, their earnings release emphasized the commitments to pursue a viable commercial model here to resolve the issue and the need that exists in New England.","Clearly, this is the last standing project, if you will, and it's the least, I think, onerous in terms of it being a brownfield project. So, we continue to remain optimistic. As Lee indicated, there's actually a couple of potential paths to success here, and we're actively looking at all of them.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. But just to be clear about it, for Massachusetts to be committed to the project vis-\u00e0-vis the rest of the region, that will be more than just an LDC commitment?","James J. Judge - Eversource Energy","Yes. That's correct. And then you, essentially you need EDC load to make this thing work at Massachusetts. We have to be committed to pay its load share percentage of that.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. Excellent. Moving on to Northern Pass quickly, can you describe a little bit the latest on the potential cost dynamic with further undergrounding? As I understand it, I suppose this is still on the table in terms of a conditional approval under the SEC (54:42). Can you describe a little bit, if you move to full undergrounding of all proposed elements, just how much of a swing factor we're talking about in terms of the cost, just to give us some sense of magnitude?","And then to that point, how confident are you in having Hydro-Quebec (54:59) committed to the project to the extent to which that there are indeed (55:03) further required undergrounding as part of any conditional approval from the FOP (55:06)?","James J. Judge - Eversource Energy","Yeah. I would just say, Julien, we're not anticipating any significant increase in undergrounding. Clearly, we believe that if you underground the entire route, the project is not viable when you do that, when you add in the additional cost. So, we're not really pricing that out. I mean that'd be $2 billion plus project. It's not needed.","We think there is growing support in New Hampshire for the project. Certainly, we have a new Governor that has voiced that support. We've been very successful in the challenges that we received against the project and the litigation. So, we're not anticipating significantly more undergrounding on that project.","In terms of the price, the cost of the project, we have still maintained approximately $1.6 million. Anything above and beyond that would be confidentially retained because again we will bid this (56:09) project into the RFP.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. Thank you all, very much.","James J. Judge - Eversource Energy","You're welcome.","Jeffrey R. Kotkin - Eversource Energy","Thanks, Julien. Our next question is from Greg Gordon from Evercore ISI. Good morning, Greg.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Hey. Good morning, guys. Again, I would like to also reiterate the really thorough update, so thank you. Looking at slide 25, it looks like if I just do a simple algebra, the rate base growth forecast, including Northern Pass but excluding any Access Northeast or Bay State Wind capital, it is about a 6% rate base CAGR, which assuming that you can continue to earn consistent returns, and you're not issuing equity, which you said you're not, which you smack in the middle of the guidance range. Is that kind of the message you're trying to deliver over here?","Phil Lembo - Eversource Energy","So, Greg, you were a little faint, but you're basically saying that the rate base CAGR is about 6% per year over the forecast period which supports the growth rate. Is that \u2013 and you're asking is that (57:10)?","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Right. I mean it seems like very straightforward message, right? 6% rate base growth, no equity issuance on consistent returns, that would put you right in the middle of your earnings growth target based on this rate base growth forecast, right?","Phil Lembo - Eversource Energy","Yeah. We're not saying specifically what point would be in the range, Greg. But certainly 5% to 7% we're very comfortable with. The capital plan and what you've picked up in terms of the rate base certainly supports that. I also mentioned that we still have some run room in terms of cost savings, too. So, those would be the two drivers to be in that range.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Fantastic. And then, at this juncture just given the time horizon it would take to get resolution on a theoretical yes decision on Access Northeast, at this point, would the capital spend sort of theoretically not really start to impact your ability to generate earnings until like the back end of this plan or maybe even into the 2020 type, 2021 type timeframe? Or do you actually think that there is a scenario where you could be in a go position to build that pipeline where it would have a tangible earnings impact inside this five year plan?","Phil Lembo - Eversource Energy","Greg, this is Phil. I think in Lee's remarks he talked about not being in the front end of that process but more in the back end in terms of Access Northeast. So, I would say, your first assumption was accurate in terms of that would be sort of at the backend of the forecast that we provided.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Great. Your comments on tax, Phil, makes sense to me, just the federal income tax exposure, but I just want to be clear. They did or did not encompass what might happen if you had increase in bonus depreciation to 100%?","Phil Lembo - Eversource Energy","Yeah. I don't' think I commented on that and they're (59:10) correct.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay, fine.","Phil Lembo - Eversource Energy","But certainly, as you know, there's many options out there and some of these options would affect everybody in the industry. And then, there's some who have more of a T&D profile like us, where there's not much exposure. So, I did not cover that correct.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay. Last question is for Jim. Do you think that Patriots are going to trade Garoppolo, and if they do are they going to let them stay in the AFC East?","Phil Lembo - Eversource Energy","The Jets.","James J. Judge - Eversource Energy","Probably for The Jets, it'd be the worst decision The Jets have made.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","I think there's been a lot of bad decisions. So, that's going to be inevitably tough at the top. But thanks, guys.","Jeffrey R. Kotkin - Eversource Energy","All right. Thanks, Greg. Next question is from Chris Ellinghaus from Williams Capital. Good morning, Chris.","Christopher R. Ellinghaus - The Williams Capital Group LP","Hey. Good morning, guys. How are you?","James J. Judge - Eversource Energy","Hi, Chris.","Leon J. Olivier - Eversource Energy","Good.","Christopher R. Ellinghaus - The Williams Capital Group LP","Phil, can you just describe the weather for the fourth quarter. Was it close enough to normal that you didn't feel a material impact?","Phil Lembo - Eversource Energy","For the quarter?","Christopher R. Ellinghaus - The Williams Capital Group LP","Yeah.","Phil Lembo - Eversource Energy","Well, actually, for the quarter, it was beneficial. It was kind of down from normal slightly. But it was up from the previous year but it was close to normal, but probably even a little bit below when you look at the heating degree days.","Christopher R. Ellinghaus - The Williams Capital Group LP","Yeah. I meant, in terms of normal.","Phil Lembo - Eversource Energy","Yeah. Yeah, so below.","Christopher R. Ellinghaus - The Williams Capital Group LP","Okay. And Lee, with all of the sort of action in New England vis-\u00e0-vis Access Northeast and the gas contracting question. I mean, New Hampshire Legislation, ISO statement, and you were talking about sort of having an outreach with Massachusetts legislators. Does this maybe gives a momentum for Massachusetts to consider some legislation?","Leon J. Olivier - Eversource Energy","I think the more education, that's a result they're on this issue creates an impetus. But clearly, I think the ISO New England action and their analysis that they're working on now will make a significant difference because the outcome of that analysis is going to say that the status quo we believe will say it's not acceptable. And if it's not acceptable, and if you want to ensure reliability, here's what you have to do and it's going to be expensive and it's going to create more emissions.","So, for the folks that don't like gas and they want to see lower emissions, their outcome will create more emissions and that's what this \u2013 we believe this report will say. And if the state and the region wants to meet its goals of this 80% carbon reduction by 2050, you must have natural gas to back up renewable, and to ensure reliability and to ensure that the region stays competitive, and I believe that that report will state that clearly.","Christopher R. Ellinghaus - The Williams Capital Group LP","Okay. And Phil, looking at O&M for the year, even adjusting for some of the unusual one-time 2015 sort of regulatory benefit, it looks like the reduction was a little bit less than sort of your targeted expectations. Can you just talk about what challenges there might have been in 2016, versus your sort of going forward expectations?","Phil Lembo - Eversource Energy","Yeah. I think that, so it's pretty close in that range, Chris. But we had a significant level of storms during the year. So I'd say, when you ask what were some of the O&M challenges for the year, we had probably twice the level of storm activity in the region than we've had in past years, and that put some pressure on our response. People working overtime, having to travel, those type of things. So I'd say, if we had a more normal weather year, you'd see a lot lower O&M, and you'd probably also see some better, higher statistics too, in terms of outages because bad weather, and distressed trees cause limbs to fall and outages to occur. So I'd say that, that would be one of the items.","Christopher R. Ellinghaus - The Williams Capital Group LP","Okay. Great. Thanks for the color, guys.","James J. Judge - Eversource Energy","All right. Thank you.","Jeffrey R. Kotkin - Eversource Energy","Thanks, Chris. Our next question is from Travis Miller from Morningstar. Good morning, Travis.","Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Good morning. Thank you. Just wondering about 2020, the transmission spend, that $283 million, is that more along the lines of a normalized run rate number kind of?","Phil Lembo - Eversource Energy","No. I think that in any of our forecast, the out years gives maybe a little bit less clarity in terms of specific projects, Travis. But as we move through that forecast period, there'll be projects that are identified. I think, you probably know our history that until something is pretty clean line of sight, it won't get into the forecast. That's why we're so confident in it. So it'd say, it's more a case of to be determined some of those projects in that last year.","Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Okay. So like a building blocks, so you started the $283 million, and then add on, say, Bay State and add on (01:04:48)?","Phil Lembo - Eversource Energy","Yeah. I think if I were to reconcile past forecast, that would exactly what would have been the case, correct.","Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Okay. And then what's the status right now in terms of the carbon goals for the region, the RPS in the states, where do you guys stand, on track, ahead, behind, now give me a sense for where you guys have been there.","Leon J. Olivier - Eversource Energy","Each state is a little bit different. Connecticut, really as a result of the kind of the major transmission build out we did there over the last 10 years, and the retirement of a lot of the older oil and coal-fired power plants and the lack of uplift, their carbon has come down fairly dramatically. They're just about on target for their 2027 numbers. Massachusetts has more of a gap particularly as you have the retirements of Pilgrim which is coming up in 2019. So they have a lot more work to do, which is one of the reasons why the governor has sponsored the April RFP for large hydro and renewable, and of course is the June RFP for potentially up to 1,600 megawatts of offshore wind. So he and they understand this, and they're moving along rapidly to try to resolve this. And when you look at the other states, Maine's goal is so low to begin with. It's like about 8% there. They're pretty much there. New Hampshire is very close to theirs in Rhode Island (01:06:36). So Massachusetts will be the outlier for the 2027 (01:06:41). But then all of them would have to make significant cuts to get to the 2050 80% reduction goal.","Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Okay. Great. I appreciate it.","Leon J. Olivier - Eversource Energy","Yeah.","Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Thanks, Travis. I appreciate it. Next question is from Praful Mehta from Citi. Good morning, Praful.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Good morning. Hi, guys. So quick question on the tax reform part, and wanted to understand from an offshore wind perspective, do the economics of offshore wind gets impacted by the tax reform, and how are you looking at other potential non-regulated investments in the renewables side and implications of that with the tax reform?","Phil Lembo - Eversource Energy","No. We don't expect that at this stage, Praful. No impact.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got you. And just so I understand, why is that, because wouldn't that be a part of the economics of how you're looking at the project?","Phil Lembo - Eversource Energy","Well, it depends on what it is that you're \u2013 what comes out of the outcome there.","Leon J. Olivier - Eversource Energy","Yeah. And we have included in our analysis, Praful, no ITC or production tax credits associated with the project. And just based on the high capacity factors, the fairly significant and continuous drop in cost, we think it will be very competitive. And as I said earlier, the beauty of this (01:08:09). You're not going to have to wait eight years and nine years to build a transmission project through three states. And so this has tremendous amount of benefits.","James J. Judge - Eversource Energy","Hey, Praful, whether it's a solo investment that we have underway or the offshore wind investments at Bay State Wind or the Northern Pass line or we've actually announced electric vehicle infrastructure and battery storage pilots here in Massachusetts, I guess all of them would benefit from a lower tax rate, and that the effect of cost-to-capital initiatives (01:08:42) would be lower.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got you. But from a project perspective, the IRRs of \u2013 again, the non-regulated side, IRRs like the offshore wind, you don't expect much impact given you're not really incorporating the tax benefits. Is that a fair way to think of it?","James J. Judge - Eversource Energy","That's right. Yes.","Leon J. Olivier - Eversource Energy","That's right.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","All right. And then, on the Access Northeast, we understood and get all the \u2013 the Q&A has been helpful, but just to understand, if it doesn't go through, and if you do reach the point where from a go\/no-go perspective reach the no-go, what you have in terms of other backup plans, in terms of CapEx spend, or what else do you think would be kind of helping support the growth story if Access Northeast weren't to play out?","James J. Judge - Eversource Energy","We update our forecast every year, and I think it's still indicated between 2017 to 2019, we have increased our CapEx by $1 billion compared to where we were just a year ago. So as we go forward in time, more opportunities will appear for us. We don't anticipate Access Northeast being cancelled, but each year we seem to have more insight into capital needs of the system. And my expectation is that there'll be further projects for us to pursue.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got you. Thank you guys (01:10:02).","James J. Judge - Eversource Energy","All right.","Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Thanks, Praful. Next question is from Paul Patterson from Glenrock. Good morning, Paul.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Good morning. How are you?","James J. Judge - Eversource Energy","All right. How are you?","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","All right. So I apologize if I missed this, but the border adjustment tax, how would that Northern Pass, with a proposal for border adjustment tax if you follow me (01:10:21)?","Phil Lembo - Eversource Energy","Yeah. I think, some of the things that we've seen or I've seen, energy is not \u2013 it could be something, our energy and infrastructure is something that would not be impacted by that. If you're looking at materials and procurement and things like that, most of our \u2013 the highest preponderance, or the majority of the materials that we purchase are domestic materials. So from that standpoint, Paul, not much.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. Just so I (01:10:57) understand, your understanding is that the boarder adjustment tax would not apply to things like electric power or natural gas or something like that. Is my understanding correct?","Phil Lembo - Eversource Energy","Yeah. I think, that is a proposal. That has been discussed as that not being applicable to that, correct.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And then, do we have a firm position from ISO New England whether or not Northern Pass would be (01:11:22-01:11:27)?","Leon J. Olivier - Eversource Energy","That's still in discussion right now. So there is no firm decision, and there won't be one until Hydro-Quebec would basically provide their indication that they will bid into the full (01:11:39) capacity auction. So that's what it takes to trigger that review.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","And so when will we get an idea, when will that be, I guess? When would that ( 01:11:50)?","Leon J. Olivier - Eversource Energy","Well, that would be, obviously for the next function (01:11:51) and there is a letter that you have to trigger, and I can't remember exactly how many months notice you have to give if you're going to participate in that (01:12:02). But it could be triggered at that point in time.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And that will FCA12, we would get an idea. You expect that Hydro-Quebec would want to participate in FCA12 as things stand.","Leon J. Olivier - Eversource Energy","I wouldn't speculate what they would want to do on that. I wouldn't speculate for them.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And then, in New Hampshire, you guys have $128 million (01:12:25) for the gas, among other things as you have. And you're also appealing things to the Supreme Court. What do you think \u2013 I guess \u2013 it wasn't really clear, I guess, in Massachusetts, if you have legislation. If you do have legislation, could you tell me what the number is on that?","Leon J. Olivier - Eversource Energy","No, Massachusetts, Paul, we don't have legislation at this point in time. This is kind of a period of education influencing and anticipating the ISO New England study as well.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And then, just finally, there was an article, a couple of articles in the local press about one out of four, about 25% of Connecticut customers being behind in their bills, electric bills. And I was wondering, is there any weather issue or fuel, or is there something unusual about that? Is that a normal number? And just, in general, how should we think about what the implications of something like that are?","Phil Lembo - Eversource Energy","Yeah. I'm not familiar with the specific article. But we certainly have a lot of focus on our credit strategies we've implemented to the extent allowed under the regulatory mechanisms recovery and reporting mechanisms to collect. So there's nothing kind of unusual in Connecticut. I think, it's a matter of sometimes folks get behind in their bills, whether it be for a number of reasons. But there's nothing in particular that's going on there, Paul.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Thanks, Paul. Next question is from Michael Lapides from Goldman. Good morning, Michael.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good morning, guys. Question, and this one's probably for Lee and apologize for making you use your voice today. [Technical Difficulty] (01:14:29) quickly. The economics of offshore wind, can you give some high-level differences? Like we're pretty familiar in terms of the economic launch or wins, CapEx in the $1,700 to $2,000 a KW range, and transmission line miles, if it's above ground, couple million bucks per mile or so. Can you talk about what the economics similar kind of indicators are for offshore wind? And if the numbers are more expensive, how different of a capacity factor would a typical or generic offshore wind plant likely get?","Leon J. Olivier - Eversource Energy","Yeah. Just to say, I wouldn't speculate at this point on the U.S. numbers because I'm sure you've looked up the European numbers, and they're all in now below $0.10 per kilowatt hour, and that's well known information of the most recent solicitations that have been done in Europe, off of Germany and Netherlands and so forth. And that includes the transmission as well and there's a few out there without transmission (01:15:41). And the real issue is they have a European supply chain that is there between Siemens (01:15:48) and the folks that make the towers and so forth. And the real question is, how much of that are \u2013 it's not a question of how much, but how soon can you get that kind of supply chain over to the U.S.","As I've stated earlier, if you look out where this offshore wind would be interconnected from these leases, the bond leases, once you land it onshore, the transmission grid in those areas has significant excess capacity as a result of retirement of Brayton Point and Pilgrim. So that cost will not have to be added to (01:16:31). So we see this being very competitive. We, our partners, they'll see the costs coming down. Obviously, they have the largest Pilgrim (01:16:43) offshore wind in the world. They have very good positions in the various manufacturing queues (01:16:48). And we think that the interest in offshore wind, it will spread beyond Massachusetts. Already, the Governor of Rhode Island sees it as a big part of their future, energy future. We think that's going to spread throughout New England.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. And when you think about the balance of needing more gas, but having offshore wind that runs heavily in the first and fourth quarter. Then the addition of a significant amount of offshore wind in New England kind of partially or significantly offset the need for incremental natural gas during winter peak.","Leon J. Olivier - Eversource Energy","Yeah. I think from where we are now in terms of the shortfall of gas, and when you factor in another whatever 6,000 or 7,000 megawatts of retirements of the older units, you got to have gas. And if you talk to ISO New England, whether it's good, they always try the same thing. On a winter's day, 04:00 PM, when there's no solar, and on the polar vortex not even be much wind because wind drops significantly in a polar vortex, their job is to keep the lights on, which means you're going to have to have gas in that particular scenario. So I don't think they see any way that you can maintain reliability, take the volatility out of the region without having a gas supply into the region.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thank you, Lee. Much appreciate it.","Jeffrey R. Kotkin - Eversource Energy","All right. Thank you, Michael. I know we've kept you guys for a while today. We really appreciate your time. If you got any follow-up questions, please give us a call. It looks like maybe we've already moved on to the next earnings call. So we will talk to you soon.

My name is John and I'll be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. And now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jeff Kotkin.","Jeffrey Kotkin","Thank you very much, John. Good morning and thank you for joining us. I'm Jeff Kotkin, Eversource Energy\u2019s Vice President for Investor Relations. During this call, we'll be referencing slides that we posted last night on our website. And as you can see on slide 1, some of the statements made during this investor call may be forward-looking as defined within the meaning of the Safe Harbor provisions of the US Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.","These forward-looking statements are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainty which may cause the actual results to differ materially from forecasts and projections. These factors are set forth in the news release issued yesterday. Additional information about the various factors that may cause actual results to differ can be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, and our Form 10-Q for the three months ended June 30, 2019.","Additionally, our explanation of how and why we use certain non-GAAP measures is contained within our news release and the slides we posted last night and in our most recent 10-K.","Speaking today will be Phil Lembo, our Executive Vice President and CFO. Also joining us today are Leon Olivier, our Executive Vice President for Enterprise Energy Strategy and Business Development; John Moreira, our Treasurer and Senior VP for Finance and Regulatory; and Mike Ausere, our VP for Business Development.","Now, I will turn to slide 2 and turn over the call to Phil.","Philip Lembo","Thank you, Jeff. And today I will cover the third quarter 2019 financial results. I\u2019ll provide an update on our key regulatory dockets. Also, discuss our regions offshore wind development efforts and some recent financing activities we\u2019ve had. We\u2019re $0.98 per share in the quarter compared to $0.91 per share in the third quarter of 2018. Electric Distribution earnings totaled $0.61 per share in the third quarter of 2019 compared with earnings of $0.55 per share in 2018. High distribution revenues which resulted mostly from base rate changes implemented earlier in the year as well as lower operations and maintenance expense were partially offset by higher depreciation and interest expense.","Our Electric Transmission segment earned $0.33 per share in the third quarter of 2019 compared with earnings of $0.34 per share in 2018. The decline was primarily due to no longer recognizing AFUDC earnings on the Northern Pass transmission project effective July 1, 2019.","Our Natural Gas Distribution segment loss $0.05 per share in the third quarter of 2019 compared with a loss of $0.04 per share in 2018. The decline was expected and was due to the implementation of gradual revenue decoupling at Yankee Gas late last year. As I've discussed on earlier earnings calls, the decoupling boosted revenues in the first quarter but lowered second and third quarter revenues when customer demand is at its lowest. The impact of revenue decoupling in the fourth quarter will be fairly neutral compared to last year.","Our Water Distribution segment earned $0.06 per share in the third quarter of 2019 the same as last year as higher revenues and lower depreciation expense were offset by the absence of a small gain on a land sale that we recognized during the third quarter of 2018. Our Parent of Other Segment earned $0.03 per share in the third quarter of 2019 compared with nearly flat results last year. The improvement was largely due to the absence in 2019 of last year's write-off of an investment in Access Northeast natural gas transmission project and certain benefits we recorded in the third quarter of 2018 related to tax reform.","Overall, we are in $2.69 per share in the first nine months of the year, excluding Northern Pass charge we discussed last quarter compared with earnings of $2.52 per share in the first nine months of 2018. Excluding the charge, we remain very comfortable with our ability to earn around the midpoint of our $3.40 to $3.50 per share range that we first announced in February.","While we continue to experience much higher than normal storm expense, we thus far have been able to offset that impact elsewhere to remain within our guidance, but it's something we'll need to keep an eye on as we close out the year. The midpoint of that guidance range is consistent with our long-term earnings growth rate of 5% to 7%.","Moving from our earnings discussion to key operating performance results. Our continued intense focus and emphasis on safety continues to produce strong results, our best ever as a company. Our electric reliability continues to trend very strong with months between interruptions at 22.2 months through September this year versus 17.4 months during the same nine-month period last year. Our reliability continues to be at a level that is among the very best in the industry.","Also our ability to respond effectively to weather-related emergency conditions at our systems continues to receive favorable reviews from our customers and policymakers. In late July, we responded to an extensive damage on Cape Cod caused by a rare set of three tornadoes.","About three weeks ago, a nor'easter with winds of up to 90 miles an hour also impacted Cape Cod causing significant damage not only in Southeastern Massachusetts but in Eastern Connecticut and Coastal New Hampshire as well. Our crews organized quickly around last month's storms and with the aid of significant outside resources, we restored power to nearly every one of about 475,000 outages in about two days.","Another storm on Halloween night resulted in significant tree cause outages up and down the East Coast. That storm caused more than 250,000 customer outages with the worst damage in Connecticut and New Hampshire. Thousands of our employees and outside line and tree workers contributed to a very strong restoration effort.","Turning from operations to some regulatory items. Our New Hampshire electric rate review continues through the discovery process with intervenor testimony due next month and a final decision expected in May of next year, 2020. You'll recall that on June 27, regulators approve the settlement we reached with public tilities Commission\u2019s staff and the Office of Consumer Advocate to implement an annualized $28.3 million temporary increase in base rates. The temporary increase was effective July 1 and will remain in effect until permanent rates take effect in the middle of next year.","On the rate reviews, I'll turn to slide 3 in PURA\u2019s recent decision in Connecticut's grid modernization docket. In early October, PURA issued an order in which it divided 11 different topics related to grid modernization in two separate dockets, and then, promptly initiated reviews on six of them. So, those six include items such as advanced metering infrastructure or AMI, electric storage and zero emissions vehicles. There will be a second and third round for this docket, which will cover five other topics ranging from resiliency standards to new rate designs.","The process for reviewing each topic will include public forums, request for different proposals, hearings leading up to a draft and final decision. Although PURA found these topics to be potentially very beneficial to customers, it\u2019s not yet known when they will result in meaningful investments related to these grid technologies. We will update you on the processes in both Connecticut and Massachusetts as we move forward. While we have not yet included any grid modernization expenditures in our capital forecast for the CL&P in Massachusetts, we expect NTAR Electric to complete the $233 million of investments previously approved by the ","Department of Public Utilities by the end of next year.","An updated grid modernization proposal covering the years 2021 through 2023 is due to the Massachusetts regulator by the middle of next year. Many of you have asked us recently when we\u2019ll provide a comprehensive update on our capital investment plans. So, I'll just say as we've done in each of the past six years we'll provide you with the update when we release our year-end results, which we expect to do in the second half of February.","Turning to offshore wind in slide 4. Massachusetts announced the results of its second offshore wind solicitation last week in which Mayflower wind was selected as the winning bidder. Mayflower\u2019s pricing is expected to become public in January when that contract is due to be filed with the state regulators for approval. Based on public statements made to date, we believe that Mayflower bid a price that would not have allowed us to earn the returns that we consider adequate as we did at the same level.","In Connecticut, bids were submitted at the end of September following up on a 2,000 megawatt offshore wind authorization that the legislature approved in June. Three parties submitted bids for these 400 megawatts each. We submitted one bid for 400 megawatts and other bids for other levels of capacity. Later this month, we expect the decision on this RFP in Connecticut.","In New York, we and \u00d8rsted signed a 25-year contract last month with the New York State Energy Research & Development Authority relating to the supply of 880 megawatts of offshore wind into the New York market. The pricing is disclosed and it is $110.37 cents per megawatt hour flat for 25 years.","It was made public when the contract was signed two weeks ago. That pricing and the pricing of the other power purchase agreements we have secured in Connecticut, Rhode Island and Long Islands, each of which is 20 years, will support the mid-teen returns on equity that we expect and that we have been discussing with you on prior earnings call. We expect these returns will significantly exceed those of any of our regulated segments.","Several analysts on this call have asked us over the past week or so whether the mid-teen returns are still applicable given \u00d8rsted\u2019s statement last week that it expects unlevered returns across its global portfolio to be in the 7% to 8% range going forward down 50 basis points from its previous range.","\u00d8rsted also indicated that for (inaudible) project is now anticipating an average capacity factor 48% rather than 48% to 50% due to new understandings of wind dynamics around large offshore wind farms.","Additionally on projects that acquired from deep water, \u00d8rsted indicated that certain transmission cost estimates has increased. As \u00d8rsted\u2019s partner on some of the former deep water projects, we have been jointly developing some of the US cost estimates \u00d8rsted decided. There are several factors that support our continued expectation that we will be able to earn in the mid-teens of these three projects noted on the slide in front of you.","First, the transmission cost estimates that we've been assuming this year in our discussions with investors has not changed. They are consistent with \u00d8rsted\u2019s current expectations but are of more recent vintage and higher than the cost estimates available to \u00d8rsted shortly after we closed this deep water acquisition last fall.","Also, our assumed returns for offshore wind investments are consistent with \u00d8rsted\u2019s current 7% to 8% range.","Just a takeaway here is our guidance remains in place. We expect our offshore wind investments to produce returns on equity in the mid-teens. Our mid-teens ROE expectations are based on our current enterprise-wide capitalization and capacity factors in the 48% to 50% range across our portfolio of wind turbines in the US. We continue to be very encouraged by the bascule knowledge and experience of our partner and by the interactions that we've all had with federal and state regulators.","Turning to financing on slide 5. We essentially ramped up our 2019 financing program in the third quarter with nearly $500 million of long-term debt issuances across Connecticut Light and Power, Yankee Gas and NSTAR Gas. We expect to close on a small debt issuance at Aquarion Connecticut before year-end. But that's the only remaining financing in 2019.","The decline in interest rates this year is certainly resulting in interest savings not only in the long-term debt issuances shown on this slide but also on our commercial paper borrowings where rates are down by more than 50 basis points compared with the end of 2018. Moreover, interest rate benefits our customers and our shareholders.","You recall that we sold 1.3 billion of new common shares in June with about 12 million of the 18 million shares subject to forward sale arrangement that will settle before the end of May 2020. To-date, we have not settled any of the forward sale arrangements.","Additionally, as we've discussed earlier in the year, we also expect to utilize approximately $100 million of treasuries \u2013 $100 million of treasury shares each year through 2023 to meet our dividend, reinvestment, and employee retirement plan requirements. Through October of this year, we have distributed approximately 900,000 treasury shares to meet those planned requirements at a rate of just under 300,000 shares a quarter.","Before I turn the call back over to Jeff, I mean, I just wanted to take a minute, I'm sure you've heard that Lee Olivier recently announced his decision to retire at the end of the year. I want to extend my thanks and appreciation to Lee for a tremendous amount of work he has done for nearly a fifth year utility career to make our company and our industry much better off.","After a highly successful career as a senior nuclear officer, Lee arrived at Northeast Utilities nearly two decades ago and led one of the most successful build-outs of an electric transmission system anywhere in the country.","He later moved on to the position of Chief Operating Officer at NU, and then at the merged Eversource, before beginning what may be his favorite position, which is overseeing our enterprise-wide strategy and business development efforts.","I'm sure, a decade from now, I'm convinced Lee will be known as one of the fathers of a thriving US offshore wind business. Lee and I have worked together for more than 20 years. And so, we\u2019ve the front-end and back-end. He is an outstanding leader and just a wonderful person to work with. All of us wish Lee a wonderful retirement commencing at the end of next month, and I want to thank him for his advice and counsel, and joining us on his last major call. So, thank you, Lee.","Leon Olivier","Well, thank you very much, Phil. I really appreciate it \u2013 appreciate those remarks, and it\u2019s been great to work with you for all of these years.","Philip Lembo","Thanks.","Leon Olivier","You're a great leader and a financial engineer yourself. Thank you.","Philip Lembo","Thanks. Well, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Jeff.","Jeffrey Kotkin","All right. Thank you, Phil, and I'm going to turn the call back to John just to remind you how to enter your question. John?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question this morning is from Mike Weinstein from Credit Suisse.","Jeffrey Kotkin","Good morning, Mike.","Michael Weinstein","Hey. Good morning. I believe this is quite a move. Congratulations and we're all going to miss you I think. It's been a long time ever since the news projects. That's kind of the earliest thing I remember you famous for.","Jeffrey Kotkin","Well, thank you very much.","Michael Weinstein","Well, congratulations again.","Jeffrey Kotkin","You too.","Michael Weinstein","Hey. My question is about the \u2013 I guess the upcoming NSTAR gas filing and what \u2013 maybe you could shed some light on what that's going to entail and also whether you think there's going to be any additional work that might be necessary on the gas utilities as a result of the Merrimack Valley incident from last year?","Philip Lembo","Yes, Mike. This is Phil. We\u2019ll \u2013 we notified the department that we would be in soon for filing and we expect to make that filing shortly here in the next days or weeks. So I say the \u2013 there is \u2013 there are a few nuances to the filing that do address some of the issues that we know of and that could potentially come out of additional work efforts and requirements from the Merrimack Valley incident. So I think you will see, when we do a filing of this in creative ways that we want to address and get ahead on. You know, certainly, you know, cost that would be moving up in terms of safety and engineering, professional engineering requirements that are now in effect that weren't necessarily in effect during our testier period. So, I think you're right that it will be, in some respects, sort of a basic filing, but there will be some creative ways that we can address some of the issues that have come up thus far and provide placeholders for things to come up in the future.","Michael Weinstein","And then maybe just with that same line of thought, maybe you could just give a broad overview of the categories of updates that might be coming in February? You know, not necessarily the numbers so much.","Philip Lembo","Well, in categories, it would be the long-term earnings guidance. And as we've done for many years now, we would adjust that moving forward, you know, add a year onto that. So, less year or add a year so that the long-term earnings guidance will have our guidance for the current year period. We\u2019ll give a capital forecast by category, you know, showing, you know, what capital spending looks like over that five-year period.","We'll provide, as we\u2019ve talked about, a little bit more detail now that the bids will be all-in and developed and pricing known and probably all public by that time. You know, more information sort of on the offshore wind side of things. And then any current regulatory or other matters we see out there.","Philip Lembo","Mike, any other questions?","Michael Weinstein","Yes. Sorry. Just one last question. On the \u00d8rsted, I guess the \u00d8rsted guidance, it sounds like that was \u2013 basically what they've been saying is already baked into your mid-teens assumption that that's why there's no change, right? I just want to just confirm I understood that correctly.","Jeffrey Kotkin","Yes, I think it's important, Mike, to just note that I think \u00d8rsted\u2019s updates were to reconcile back to a Capital Markets Day from about a year ago last November. Our guidance is really based on current information, and all of our disclosed items have already been considered in the guidance and expectations. So we continue to be comfortable and provide forecast in the mid-teens on ROEs. And we continue to look at those costs and schedule estimates as we go forward.","Michael Weinstein","Great. Terrific. Thank you.","Jeffrey Kotkin","All right. Thanks, Mike.","Operator","Our next question is from Shahriar Pourreza from Guggenheim. Good morning, Shahriar.","Shahriar Pourreza","Hey. Good morning, guys. Can you hear me?","Jeffrey Kotkin","Yes.","Philip Lembo","Yes, we can hear you.","Shahriar Pourreza","Okay. Great. Let me just on \u2013 just on the rate cases, could we just get a quick update on New Hampshire's proceedings? Is there \u2013 I guess is there any opportunity to settle after discovery, how we start a discussion that\u2019s going with them?","Jeffrey Kotkin","Yes, Shahriar. This is Phil. There's absolutely an opportunity\u2026","Shahriar Pourreza","Hey, Phil.","Jeffrey Kotkin","To do that, to settle. In fact, on the official schedule, there's time allocated for settlement conference. So that is really the way that things proceed in New Hampshire. So there is an ability to get to that settlement. And then there is a conclusion. I mentioned in May. That\u2019s in the \u2013 on the docket, so I would expect that once we go through all the discovery and all the data (inaudible) that it provides a better basis for having some meaningful settlement discussions.","Shahriar Pourreza","Got it. And, Phil, you mentioned placeholder items and the NSTAR gasoline. Can you just elaborate on what you will do there?","Jeffrey Kotkin","Yes. Sure. And this is true for some of our other filing to another states where we might have an approval for a tracker that is approved and had rate case. But there \u2013 how much is in that category would have to be defined in a future filing. So for example, we have these safety and reliability filings that are approved trackers, how the recovery works, what the procedures will be.","And then periodically, we go in with a plan or this is what the spending will be for the next year or the next few years. We have the same thing like on energy efficiency. We have A, an approved method for collecting it but then we have a plan that goes in each year. So that's what I'm referring to is that our mechanisms would be established and then as resources come up. So you wouldn't have to go back in for a base rate type of filing, you'd have the mechanism there.","Shahriar Pourreza","Got it. Got it. And then just lastly, I know past discussions seemed to point to potentially getting a CapEx update at EEI not necessarily wrong you plan forward and \u2013 but more of a CapEx update around your base business, right. Is that the rationale to not providing update, is it a function because of the New Hampshire case is taking longer than maybe you anticipated, so I'm kind of curious in why not on the base business without having a roll forward, could it seem like maybe past discussions centered on the potential update at EEI?","Jeffrey Kotkin","Sure. I will maybe make a point there, Shahriar. I \u2013 we have never really provided a indication that there would be an update. We've always pointed to the February year-end call as being the time we would do the update. So, what our statements are and what our plans are now are very consistent with what our thinking has been all along but \u2013 that we will plan to and we will do an update in February. So, I\u2019m not, just to be clear, we are not changing anything as a result of any proceeding. It's really that's been our plan all along.","Shahriar Pourreza","Got it. Thanks. And, Lee, congratulations, you're definitely going to be missed.","Leon Olivier","Well, really, thank you. Thank you very much, Shahriar. It's been \u2013 it\u2019s been a lot of fun working with you over the years as well.","Shahriar Pourreza","We\u2019ll stop to take you out for a nice steak dinner, though\u2026","Jeffrey Kotkin","Give it a go.","Shahriar Pourreza","\u2026and Jack.","Jeffrey Kotkin","Give it a go \u2013 and Jerry. Why not? Why not?","Shahriar Pourreza","You got it.","Jeffrey Kotkin","All right. All right. Thanks. Thanks, Shahriar.","Operator","Our next question this morning is from Insoo Kim from Goldman Sachs. Good morning, Insoo.","Insoo Kim","Good morning. I mean, starting with the offshore wind, given your comments on the recent Massachusetts RFP results and the point that maybe the pricing didn\u2019t \u2013 wouldn\u2019t have met your return expectations, are you still of the mindset that the future \u2013 the current and future bids on future offshore wind projects will try to maintain your 7% to 8% unlevered IRRs or mid-teens ROE assumptions?","Jeffrey Kotkin","Yes, we are, and that is, that is our plan.","Insoo Kim","Understood. And appreciating on the Connecticut grid mod side, it\u2019ll pretty probably be a lengthy process of discussing all that various items that you could potentially invest in. And, I think, you've talked in the past about pieces of those and how much that could potentially be, for example, AMI in Connecticut and Massachusetts being a $1 billion opportunity, and as well. But just is there any way to frame what the total opportunity set longer term would be for the Connecticut portion of all these items? I\u2019m assuming And, you know, they won't really be in the base plan when you roll forward the CapEx plan in February.","Jeffrey Kotkin","That's correct, Insoo. Unless it's something that we have a clear line of sight for, it would not be. And just to be clear, it\u2019s not in our plans now. So, we've always talked about in Connecticut as a potential program that would require investments to modernize the grid into various categories.","And in AMI, sort of, we\u2019ve mentioned a number of $1 billion program, and that's really across Massachusetts and Connecticut. So, you know, the number of customers, you know, are fairly consistent across the two states. But you might have different vintages of meters so \u2013 But, you know, it's probably 50\/50 across the states I think is a good determination of that.","But, again, we're \u2013 we don't know, you know, what will come out of the proceeding that are going on. We feel that we have effective programs that can address all of the 11 categories that the Connecticut PURA has established and it's good to see sort of in the first six of them, they\u2019re really, you know \u2013 half of them or more are already programs that we're working on in other states. So, we feel good about our ability to deliver effectively there. But the timing and how much the will be will be determined going forward.","Insoo Kim","Understood. And, Lee, congratulations. I know you and I haven't really interacted much given my (inaudible) you to the coverage, but I wish you all the best.","Leon Olivier","Well, thank you very much. I appreciate it. Good luck to you.","Jeffrey Kotkin","All right.","Leon Olivier","Thanks, Insoo.","Operator","Next question this morning is from Steve Fleishman from Wolfe. Good morning, Steve.","Steve Fleishman","Hey, good morning and congrats, Lee. Wish you the best.","Leon Olivier","Thank you, Steve.","Steve Fleishman","You bet. And so, just maybe a little bit more color on the approvals and just the supplemental study and both timing of that as well as just what are \u2013 what is the focus that you've seen so far of that study and just how do you feel about overall timeline then of your projects?","Leon Olivier","Yes, Steve. This is Lee. I think that the indication that Bowman now given is that they all have a draft of supplemental study in first quarter of next year. And they're looking at the full array of issues as an example. When these leases were let some years ago, they really did not understand the scale or magnitude of the development across all of these areas.","And at that time, I think it was just probably a bit of an oversight didn't really understand what the fisheries \u2013 actually, how they work, how they fish, whether it's straddlers or crustacean fishermen and so forth. And then, there were issues that have arisen around the layouts and how mariners would be able to access to and from ports in the area, and also with the Coast Guard in terms of how they do their search and rescue organizations.","I think all of those are better understood now and those are the kinds of issues that will be factored in into their analysis. I think we \u2013 the joint venture and feel very good about that. We\u2019ve consistently in terms of our layouts and arrays have met with and got feedback from fisheries and mariners in the coast guard. So I think our arrays will be laid out as such there will be minimum issues in the industry, the offshore wind industry in the Northeast where our leases are all collaboratively working together to come up with a sub-common arrays and layouts such it will help facilitate the bulk process once they complete their supplemental EIS. And so we don't think there is any delays right now that we can forecast in any of our projects this time.","Steve Fleishman","Thank you.","Leon Olivier","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","The next question is Praful Mehta from Citi. Good morning, Praful.","Praful Mehta","Hi, guys, and congratulations, Phil.","Leon Olivier","Thanks a million, Praful. Appreciate it.","Praful Mehta","Yes, so I just want to quickly follow up again, unfortunately, offshore wind. Was there a delay right now in the schedule for Revolution Wind? Did that get pushed out a little bit?","Jeffrey Kotkin","No. With this, it's pretty much on track. I think if there was a delay \u2013 because we have not filed \u2013 we have not filed our BOEM permit yet. And we expect to file with them in early 2020, probably end of the first quarter at BOEM at which point in time, we\u2019ll have a clear understanding of where BOEM is going to be with their supplemental EIS. So right now I think would be premature to look at the delay in Revolution Wind. So, we're still looking at a commercial operation for Revolution Wind late in 2023.","Praful Mehta","Got you. And you didn't move out the construction \u2013 the start construction. I know it's got pushed hard but it's the same as you had before?","Jeffrey Kotkin","Yes. It's pretty much the same as we've had before and we won't make any changes. We don't feel there is a need to make any changes until we understand if there is any impact with the supplemental EIS involve.","Praful Mehta","Got you. And then, just secondly in terms of all these projects and in the context of what \u00d8rsted said, is there any incremental revenue that is assumed as a part of these projects to achieve your IRRs? So, for example, capacity revenue or ancillary services, anything incremental that helps kind of achieve or get to your target returns?","Jeffrey Kotkin","Well, in the case of Sunrise Wind, there are pricing at $110.37 as predicated both on the energy, receiving energy revenue and capacity revenue inside of that market. And so we feel good about being able to achieve that.","Leon Olivier","Yes. So, I guess I'd add to that no other really \u2013 in the guidance we\u2019ve given it's all based on the pricing that\u2019s under the contract there.","Jeffrey Kotkin","There is a move afoot here in New England for probably more ancillary kinds of services that was proposing. But that's \u2013 right now, it's all in the concept mode. So, we would have to see what happens there.","Praful Mehta","Got you. And so just to confirm the Sunrise Wind has the capacity revenue component or that's already built into the price that you put here in terms of a final like locked in price?","Leon Olivier","Yes. That\u2019s built into the price like a locked-in price.","Jeffrey Kotkin","Yes. That's built into the price.","Leon Olivier","The fixed price.","Praful Mehta","Okay. Perfect.","Leon Olivier","It\u2019s built into the fixed price.","Praful Mehta","Thanks.","Leon Olivier","Yes.","Praful Mehta","Got you. Thanks so much, guys.","Leon Olivier","Thank you.","Jeffrey Kotkin","Thanks, Praful.","Operator","Our next question is from Paul Patterson from Glenrock. Good morning, Paul.","Jeffrey Kotkin","Good morning.","Paul Patterson","How are you doing?","Jeffrey Kotkin","All right.","Paul Patterson","Congratulations, Lee. And I wanted to follow up on just a few quick things. First of all, the Connecticut grid mod proceeding, it seemed like after quite a bit of a delay and a lot of time, they've now come up with a whole bunch of other proceedings, as you guys mentioned on your \u2013 on the prepared remarks. Any sense as to how long all this might take? And is there any proceeding or any that the new proceedings that maybe are more of a priority or we should focus on more than the others? I mean, it just seems like quite a bit to cover if you thought what I\u2019m saying.","Jeffrey Kotkin","Yes. So, I think, Paul, this is Phil, that you\u2019re right. There's \u2013 there was a lot of time, but recall that the Connecticut PURA, there was a new Chair of the PURA. So, certainly, in that transition, the Chair of any authority wants to, to set a direction and have some influence over the proceedings. So, it probably shouldn't have been unexpected that it would be some modifications or time frame schedule that came out with \u2013 after the new Chair was appointed. But \u2013 so, I think, the way you could look at it is they set up 11 different topics and, if you were me, I\u2019d look at the first six that they\u2019ve done, right?","So, the first \u2013 the first six focus on AMI, storage, electric vehicles, some technologies, if there\u2019s any change needed in interconnections, etcetera. So, the first one is I would think of the most critical and the most priority to the chair. And we have done work in every one of those areas in multiple states so we think we already have good plans and good proposals that we\u2019d be ready to move forward with. So, that\u2019s kicking off right now. In terms of what the exact schedule will be, that is still to be determined. But the first \u2013 what happens next in the first half of 2020 there's another set of three and then there's two more to happen sort of after that.","So, just sort of the staging of the topics I think gives some indication of which ones would be the most important. But how those \u2013 what the time frame would be for a conclusion, I don't expect that we have any meaningful if there were investments to be made I think it\u2019d be beyond 2020. You\u2019d probably at best have the first set completed in 2020 with decisions made and then programs set up for possibly some spending in 2020 and then beyond that. So, I think that's the time frame we're looking at.","Paul Patterson","Okay. And then, there's also been some press coverage of, I guess, some proceeding in Connecticut on affordability and service terminations and what have you. And from what I can see, it seems like this is mostly associated sort of identifying people at risk for first service cutoffs. But is there anything else we should be thinking about with respect to this I mean or is that sort of what the focus is? Is there any other element of that or is there anything you'd like to add about it in terms of how that is unfolding, I guess?","Jeffrey Kotkin","So I think what you're referring to is \u2013 it\u2019s separate from this proceeding for PURA that is going on.","Paul Patterson","Yes, yes. I didn\u2019t mean to suggest this part of the stuff.","Jeffrey Kotkin","Yes. No. I don't know. No. There's no bigger agenda here for affordability. I think just affordability is on everybody's radar screen and we want to make sure that we deliver quality products at a price that is affordable for customers and that's what we do. That's how we design our rate. So there's really no specific agenda for that category yet and that will be decided as we move through.","Paul Patterson","Okay. Awesome. Thanks so much.","Jeffrey Kotkin","Thank you, Paul.","Operator","Our next question is from Julien from Bank of America. Good morning, Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Hey. Good morning, Phil. Thank you. So perhaps when could you file the proposal in Connecticut just to follow up on Paul's question here? Can you \u2013 well are an open ended just with respect again the timeline you guys have articulated here?","Jeffrey Kotkin","Yes. I'd say for the first quarter \u2013 April would be a time frame for the first set of items.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Got it. And then still sort of broadly thinking the same time line to start and spend in kind of a year plus?","Jeffrey Kotkin","Yes. As I said, I would expect that you'd have some decision in 2020 and you could have some spending in later 2020 for any of these programs into 2021 and beyond.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Right. Okay. Excellent. And then perhaps clean up here, apologies if I missed this, but commentary about how you think about expansion on gas and acquisitions on that front or more broadly acquisition strategy. I know that there's been some degree of media attention on this, perhaps it died down, but just want to come back just sort of the core thought process here. Just basically in Mass.","Jeffrey Kotkin","Yes. No. We did not \u2013 we hadn\u2019t mentioned \u2013 we didn\u2019t mention I think so you didn\u2019t miss anything, Julien. And I think that we are focused on our core business and running our core business in an effective way. We've been able to deliver that core business growth and affordability and performance in a way that meets our customers and regulatory requirements. We've been able to do that and deliver in the middle of the 5% to 7% growth rate out of our core business. So, we\u2019re focused on managing those core assets in an effective way and working effectively on our offshore wind business. So, that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on. We certainly have enough on our plate to work on there. So \u2013 and that would be our continued focus going forward.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Got it. Sorry. One more cleanup item if you don\u2019t mind. With respect to earnings recognition of tax credits, obviously, another quarter, getting a little bit closer and hoping getting some clarity here, how do you think about that contributing especially given the very specific time line you articulated already for the in-service of all these different projects how do you think about the cadence of that and how do you think about that contributing to the long-term earnings CAGR or the consistency of long-term earnings sort of ex these credits?","Jeffrey Kotkin","I think our long-term earnings will continue to be primarily driven by our core business and I think you\u2019ll see that our core business really is the driver for the 5% to 7% growth rate. And as we've said that the niche projects come in to service, the offshore wind projects come into service in 2024 in terms of contributing to earnings. And beyond that, our growth rate will improve and increase.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Got it. Okay. Fair enough. I'll leave it there. Thank you, guys.","Jeffrey Kotkin","All right. Thanks, Julien.","Operator","Our next question is from Sophie Karp from KeyBanc. Good morning, Sophie.","Sophie Karp","Good morning, guys. Congrats on the quarter.","Jeffrey Kotkin","Thank you.","Sophie Karp","Got a question I wanted to follow up on Connecticut. It just seems to me, from looking at your slides, that they're kind of doing AMI and all this fun stuff first and then redesign later after all of that. So, is that the accurate read of the sequence of events here? And if so, is there any rate design changes that should be critical for the proposals that they're considering or can your existing rate design accommodate all of it or do you need any changes like what is your wish list there?","Jeffrey Kotkin","No. I think you're reading that correctly, Sophie, that sort of the later topics for some future period of time would include, you know, rate designs, etcetera. So, we don\u2019t feel that there's any specific major, you know, changes in terms of rate design that would, you know, be impacted by any of the other categories that we're working on. There certainly would be no volumes impact, you know, for that. But, you know, I think we were able to \u2013 there may be some minor \u2013 you know, there may have to be a tracker or there may have to be some other category, but, you know, in terms of major rate design, you\u2019re right that anything on that front would be, you know, later topics for discussion.","Sophie Karp","But just to be clear, you wouldn't be deploying any incremental capital until you're clear on their rate design and maybe additional trackers or things like that?","Jeffrey Kotkin","No. No. That\u2019s not clear. We\u2019re able to with our current rates and our current design be able to implement any of the categories that is currently under review. So we do have trackers. We do have sort of placeholders for future grid modernization items just to slide in there. So, no, we would not need to go through a rate design proceeding to be able to implement these items from the first wave.","Sophie Karp","Got it. All right. Thank you. That\u2019s all I had.","Jeffrey Kotkin","All right. Thanks, Sophie.","Operator","Next question is from Travis Miller from Morningstar. Good morning, Travis.","Travis Miller","Good morning. Thank you. I just wonder if you could give a quick update on the water business developments there, what you're looking at over the next kind of 9 to 12 months, and then related to that acquisition rollup, small acquisition opportunities.","Philip Lembo","Hi, Travis. How are you doing? This is Phil. I will start off by saying we're very pleased with the performance of our water business. It\u2019s ahead of where we thought it would be at this time when Aquarion was brought into the Eversource family. We continue to look for opportunities to learn from each other and implement best practice or integration efforts there to improve operations on both sides of the ledger.","We're looking at and continue to look at opportunities to grow that business in a financially disciplined way. And as opportunities present themselves, we will take a look at them. So there\u2019s nothing different to that strategy. We continue to look for opportunities whether it be a opportunity that has more customers of the smaller acquisitions, of roll-ups, we'll continue to evaluate them.","Travis Miller","Okay. Any regulatory \u2013 major regulatory issues or stuff you see going down the line here in the next again kind of 9 to 12 months?","Jeffrey Kotkin","Are you referring to in the water business?","Travis Miller","In the water business. Yes.","Jeffrey Kotkin","No. No. Nothing that we see on the horizon in that time period. That\u2019s correct.","Travis Miller","Okay. And then just real quick, you answered most of my offshore wind questions. But wondering on those contracts either the New York one or the other ones you've had, how much flexibility if any is in that pricing, and are there any clauses in terms of buyouts or adjustments or contract cancellations or anything along those lines of say costs got out of line or there were timing delays stuff like that?","Jeffrey Kotkin","Yes. I think you can assume that this is just standard contract revisions in terms of commitments to pricing and then standard commitments in terms of getting projects and service, but there are certainly opportunities within a reasonable range of these changes in dates and all that. That's all provided for already in the contracts.","Travis Miller","Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you, Travis. Our next question is from Andrew Weisel from Scotia. Good morning, Andrew.","Andrew Weisel","Hey. Good morning, everyone. I am basically all set. Just one follow-up I guess since you have me in here. The comment you made about lower returns and you would have been comfortable with the answer to a prior question for offshore wind that is. How would you think going forward about that trade-offs? If pricing continues to decline perhaps faster than your costs, would you be will \u2013 more willing to sacrifice a little bit of the returns or a little bit of the volume of projects won? How do you think of that tradeoffs?","Jeffrey Kotkin","I think some of the \u2013 some of it is speculation of what might happen in the future. But I would say that our (inaudible) is that we want to maintain our return levels going forward in that business. So we'll look for opportunities to maintain and participate in auctions or RFPs in a way that we can compete effectively and that competition allows us to maintain a mid-teens level of returns for our shareholders.","Travis Miller","Okay. So it would be to be mid-teens, it wouldn't mean \u2013 it has to be more than a certain level above your regulated distribution returns, right?","Jeffrey Kotkin","Yes.","Travis Miller","I could say.","Jeffrey Kotkin","Yes. That is correct.","Travis Miller","Okay. Thank you.","Jeffrey Kotkin","All right. Thank you, Andrew.","Jeffrey Kotkin","That's the end of the queue for today. So we want to thank you all for joining us. We look forward to seeing most of folks on the call at the EEI Conference starting on Sunday. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating and you may now disconnect."],"8622":["Eversource Energy (NYSE:ES) Q1 2017 Earnings Call May  4, 2017  9:00 AM ET","Executives","Jeffrey R.

My name is Vanessa, and I will be the operator for your call today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Mr. Jeffrey Kotkin, Vice President for Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Jeffrey R. Kotkin - Eversource Energy","Thank you, Vanessa. Good morning and thank you for joining us. I'm Jeff Kotkin, Eversource Energy's Vice President for Investor Relations.","As you can see on slide 1, some of the statements made during this investor call maybe forward-looking as defined within the meaning of the Safe Harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risk and uncertainty, which may cause the actual results to differ materially from forecasts and projections. Some of these factors are set forth in the news release issued yesterday. Additional information about the various factors that may cause actual results to differ can be found in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016.","Additionally, our explanation of how and why we use certain non-GAAP measures is contained within our news release and the slides we posted last night on our website under Presentations & Webcasts, and in our most recent 10-K.","Turning to slide 2, speaking today will be Phil Lembo, our Executive Vice President and CFO; and Lee Olivier, our Executive Vice President for Enterprise Energy Strategy and Business Development. Also, joining us today are Werner Schweiger, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; Jay Buth, our Vice President and Controller; and John Moreira, our Vice President of Financial Planning and Analysis.","Now, I will turn to slide 3 and turn over the call to Phil.","Phil Lembo - Eversource Energy","Thank you, Jeff. Today, I'll cover four items: our first quarter financial results, an update on several transmission projects, the status of key regulatory dockets, and the status of our 2017 financing plan. Let's start with the quarter and slide 3. Our earnings were up $0.05 in the quarter. We earned $259.5 million or $0.82 per share in the first quarter of 2017 compared with earnings of $244.2 million or $0.77 per share in the first quarter of 2016.","Our transmission segment earned $0.30 per share in the first quarter of 2017 compared to $0.27 in 2016. The primary driver for this earnings growth was our higher transmission rate base as well as we continue to invest in transmission projects that enhance the reliability of the New England power grid. I'll provide an update on our key transmission projects in a minute.","On the electric distribution and generation side, we earned $0.36 per share in the first quarter of 2017, and that compares with $0.34 per share in the first quarter of 2016. This increase was primarily due to higher distribution revenues. A portion of the increase was the result of the infrastructure investment programs we have in Connecticut and New Hampshire. In addition, as a result of our highly effective, number one in the nation energy efficiency programs, we recorded higher loss (03:42) base revenues in the quarter. These positive impacts were partially offset by higher storm restoration costs and higher depreciation.","On the natural gas distribution side, we earned $0.16 per share in the first quarter of 2017, matching earnings in the first quarter of last year. Temperatures in the first quarter of 2017 were colder than during the same period of 2016, and these colder temperatures in 2017 \u2013 and those were primarily in March \u2013 resulted in a 4.6% increase in firm natural gas sales in the first quarter of 2017 as compared to the previous year. However, the higher sales were offset by higher depreciation and property taxes. So I should also say that the first quarter temperatures in both 2017 and in 2016 were warmer than normal.","At the Eversource parent and other segment, results were relatively flat year-over-year. For the full year, we continue to expect to earn between $3.05 per share and $3.20 per share, and for the long term, we continue to project a 5% to 7% EPS growth.","Turning from our financial results to our operations, our transmission investments totaled approximately $170 million in the first quarter of 2017 compared to approximately $140 million in the first quarter of 2016. We continue to target nearly $1 billion in transmission investments for the year. As you can see on slide 4, we continue to make progress on a number of the major transmission reliability projects.","Through March, we've invested just over $146 million in 28 projects that comprised the Greater Boston Reliability Solution and we expected to complete the Greater Boston work in 2019. We have invested just over $141 million in the Greater Hartford projects which are comprised of 27 smaller projects that we expect to complete next year.","From operations, I'll turn to the regulatory activity, and I'll start in Massachusetts on slide 5. Hearings will begin in June on the electric rate reviews we filed in January with the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities for NSTAR Electric and Western Mass Electric. Across the company, I believe we've done an excellent job in responding to the many data requests that come out during any rate case and in this rate case in particular.","Intervenor testimony was filed last Friday and we expect to get a decision on the case around the end of November with new rates effective in January of 2018. In terms of the intervenor testimony, overall, I'd say there were no surprises from what we've seen in that testimony.","One of the items included in our case is to legally combine NSTAR Electric and Western Mass Electric. FERC approved that combination earlier this year and we hope to receive DPU approval later this year in our rate case. Overall, we're pleased with how the case has progressed thus far.","In Connecticut, on April 18, we joined the Office of Consumer Counsel and the Attorney General in filing a motion to modify the merger agreement that was approved by PURA in 2012. And that agreement required us to file rate reviews for new distribution rates to be effective December 1 of 2014 and December 1 of 2017. So the motion jointly requested that PURA extend the deadline for implementing new rates to July 1, 2018 and PURA approved that motion on April 20.","So as a background, there's really no particular significance. There was none till the December 1, 2017 date in the 2012 merger agreement. At that time, the OCC and the AG wanted to be sure that the savings from the merger that we identified really benefited customers. And in our 2014 case, about $30 million in annual O&M savings were flowed back to CL&P distribution customers at that time. Also, improved reliability at CL&P was a focus in 2012 and it has improved greatly since that time.","Recently, CL&P has been having its best years ever in terms of reliability and is now in the top tier versus its peers. So additionally, the 2014 rate review had a backdrop of CL&P significantly under-earning on its ROE and needing to recover about $300 million of deferred storm costs. So none of these issues are pressing at this time.","So from our rate state reviews, I'll turn now to FERC and the various New England transmission ROE dockets. As you can see on slide 6, on April 14 of this year, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals vacated FERC's 2014 order that lowered the base New England transmission ROE from 11.14% to 10.57%. The 2014 decision also capped the incentives on individual projects at 11.74%, even if higher incentives had been previously approved on those projects.","So the Appeals court agreed with the New England transmission owners that FERC is required to go through two steps in a complaint proceeding. First, FERC needs to demonstrate why the existing ROE is unreasonable. Only then can FERC set a new reasonable ROE. The fact that FERC found that 10.57% to be the new reasonable ROE wasn't enough to prove that our 11.14% was unreasonable. The court added that FERC bears the burden of making an explicit finding that the existing ROE is unlawful before setting a new lawful ROE. The court sent this issue back to FERC for further explanation on why the original ROE at the time of the complaint was not reasonable.","The court also found that FERC did not establish a reason basis for its conclusion that the ROE should be set at the midpoint of the upper half of the zone of reasonableness. The court sent this back to FERC for further justification. The court did not address the issue of incentive caps, because this issue may depend on the outcome of FERC's decision resolving the first two issues that I mentioned.","We continue to review the implementation of this decision with the other New England transmission owners. Also, FERC must still address the ALJ recommendations received in 2016 in the second and third ROE complaints. On the fourth complaint, FERC's chief administrative law judge has scheduled arguments for May 18 on why FERC should not just dismiss the complaints in light of the Circuit Court of Appeals decision. Ultimately, all those complaints may be effective by the recent Circuit Court decision and likely that FERC won't be able to address any of them until after the Commission has a quorum.","The transmission earnings we provided today were based on the Commission's original decision in the first complaint. We'll continue to evaluate whether this is the appropriate assumption as we move through the second quarter. To put it in perspective, our shareholders have invested equity of about $3 billion in our transmission segment, so each 10-basis-point change in the earned ROE moves earnings by about $3 million or about $0.01 per share per year.","Turning to our financing programs, both Eversource parent and CL&P issued $300 million of debt in March. The parent's five-year issue carries a coupon of 2.75% and CL&P's 10-year issue had a coupon of 3.2%. We thank our fixed income investors for supporting our financings. A portion of the CL&P issuance was used to fund a $150 million 5.375% bond maturity. We anticipate additional debt financings later in the year to support our capital program and to refinance a $400 million 5.625% maturity at NSTAR Electric.","Lastly, I just want to note the election yesterday of Christine Vaughan as Treasurer. Christine has been with the company for many years, recently as Vice President of Rates and Regulatory for all three states that we serve and also has been with the company in similar capacity since 2004. She'll continue to oversee the regulatory filings while assuming new treasury responsibilities, working closely with Emily O'Neill and Bob D'Angelo, (13:36) our newly elected Assistant Treasurers. I look forward to introducing Christine to our investors later this year.","And that concludes my comments, and I'll turn it over to Lee.","Leon J. Olivier - Eversource Energy","Okay. Thanks, Phil. I'll provide you with a brief update on our major investment initiatives and then turn the call back to Jeff for Q&A.","So let's start with Northern Pass on slide 7. The New Hampshire Site Evaluation Committee commenced final evidentiary hearings for the project on April 13 after rejecting several motions from the project opponents for a delay. Hearings are now scheduled to run through early August and we have been quite pleased with how they have proceeded thus far. We consider the New Hampshire SEC schedule to be supportive of the Committee's stated objective of issuing a final written order no later than September 30, 2017.","Hearings in April focused on two of the key criteria that must be considered. These criteria include whether Northern Pass and Eversource have the technical, financial and managerial capability to construct, operate and maintain the project and whether approval of the project serves the public interest. These are foundational issues in the SEC review process. Our witnesses were very well-prepared and credible in responding to intervening questions, and those panels were completed on schedule. Earlier this week, hearings continued on the more technical aspects of the project and have continued to proceed quite well.","Prior to the start of the hearings, the two key permitting agencies, the Department of Environmental Services and Transportation recommended approval of the project by the SEC. Both departments approved their respective permits for the project. We received the Department of Environmental Services recommendations and permits in early March and the report from the Department of Transportation in early April. The recommended conditions from these agencies were reasonable and consistent with our design.","In addition, the State Division of Historical Resources, which is not one of the permitting agencies, also continues to review the project and, in its recent status report, concurred that their review of the process is on track. Nothing more is needed from the DHR before the SEC decision is reached. Once the New Hampshire SEC process is complete and assuming the project is approved with reasonable conditions, we expect a U.S. Department of Energy \u2013 a presidential permit to be issued by the end of this year.","Before that point, probably late in the third quarter, we expect the DOE to release its final Environmental Impact Statement on Northern Pass. The preliminary EIS supporting the issuance of the presidential permit was issued nearly two years ago, and the DOE held a number of public meetings on the draft EIS in late 2015 and early 2016. While we have been advancing the project on the U.S. side of the border, Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec has been pursuing siting on the Canadian side. The three-year Canadian process should be completed this summer, so by the end of this year, we expect Northern Pass to be fully permitted in both the United States and Canada. This supports our plan to move into the construction phase in the first quarter of 2018.","In addition to the New Hampshire SEC, the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission has been reviewing several items related to Northern Pass. You may recall that last year, Northern Pass was granted utility status by the PUC conditional upon receiving approval of the project from the SEC. In early April, following a preliminary review, the PUC ruled that it could move ahead with their review of the terms of the NPT proposed lease of Public Service of New Hampshire Transmission rights of way. That decision was also over the objection of project opponents. We expect a PUC decision on the proposed lease terms later this year.","In March, the PUC also ruled on a 100-megawatt power purchase agreement signed last year by PSNH and Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec. The PUC said that under the current state restructuring law, it did not have authority to approve such a PPA with PSNH. Such a contract is not required for siting or to move ahead with the project.","In late March, the New Hampshire Senate overwhelmingly approved and sent to the House of Representatives Senate Bill 128, which would expand the PUC's authority to consider long-term contracts that would lower customer cost and improve grid reliability and fuel diversity. The current legislative session is due to end in late June, so we'll be watching the progress of this bill closely.","We and Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec will bid the Northern Pass project into the Clean Energy RFP that Massachusetts commenced March 31 for up to 9.45 terawatt hours annually for a period of up to 20 years. Bids are due on July 27 and the schedule indicates that the projects will be selected for negotiations by January 25.","Separately, a draft RFP exclusively for offshore wind was filed by Massachusetts utilities with the DPU last week. The schedule calls for the RFP to be final and issued to the market by June 30, 2017. The RFP calls for interested bidders to submit at least one proposal for at least 400 megawatts. The draft also stated that alternative bids for up to 800 megawatts would be considered if bidders can show that a larger project would provide significant net economic benefits to customers.","Bidders can also submit an alternative bid for as little as 200 megawatts. The timeline of the draft RFP calls for the selection of the winning bids by the spring of 2018 and the submission of contracts to the DPU by late 2018. Bay State Wind, a 50\/50 partnership between Eversource and DONG Energy, will bid into the RFP.","Finally, turning to slide 8, (20:13) continue to discuss the gravity of New England's wintertime energy supply situation with policymakers in Massachusetts and New Hampshire, the two states that do not have recent legislation clarifying electric utilities' ability to sign natural gas supply contracts. Brayton Point, the region's largest coal and oil-fired station, was shut down permanently at the end of this month and the Pilgrim nuclear plant will shut down two years later.","ISO New England continues to express deep concerns over the region's ability to meet both gas heating and electrical requirements when temperatures drop. Later this year, ISO is due to issue a report on the challenges New England will face in future winters, if no significant natural gas transmission capacity is built into the region.","So now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Jeff for Q&A.","Jeffrey R. Kotkin - Eversource Energy","Thank you, Lee. And I'm going to turn the call back to Vanessa just to remind you how to enter the Q&A queue.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And thank you.","Jeffrey R. Kotkin - Eversource Energy","Thank you, Vanessa. Our first question this morning is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from UBS. Good morning, Julien.","Jerimiah Booream - UBS Securities LLC","Jerimiah Booream. How are you?","Jeffrey R. Kotkin - Eversource Energy","Hey, Jerimiah.","Jerimiah Booream - UBS Securities LLC","So just a quick question on the new project that was announced by National Grid, the Granite State Power Link. Do you guys view this as a competitor? And to the extent, you can provide any commentary around how that would impact your thought process on moving forward with your own project?","Leon J. Olivier - Eversource Energy","Yes. Jerimiah, this is Lee. No, we don't really look at that as a viable project for the April RFP. Obviously, they would have to go through the entire presidential permitting process. They would have to \u2013 which can take many years, as you know. They would have to go through siting in Vermont and New Hampshire in the \u2013 they don't have a supplier of energy, they don't have an interconnection into Canada, the Canadian process of three years. So when you look at the April RFP and you look at the preference in the Massachusetts RFP for projects that are in service by the end of December of 2020, we do not believe that is a viable alternative, which is not to say...","Jerimiah Booream - UBS Securities LLC","Okay.","Leon J. Olivier - Eversource Energy","...it couldn't be a project for a future RFP.","Jerimiah Booream - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah. Got it. And then, just on Access Northeast, is there any progress on legislation that's been moving forward or any commentary or update there?","Leon J. Olivier - Eversource Energy","Yeah. I just think the general commentary there is we just continue to have those conversations with legislators, we continue to educate them on the alternatives to not building a pipeline from the standpoint of threats to reliability and extreme volatility during the wintertime. And of course, as I mentioned, ISO is working on their no gas pipeline solution, which we believe will cause them to require certain actions to be taken that will not be in the best interests of the region's goals to reduce carbon and it will not be in the best interest of maintaining price stability for our customers.","Jerimiah Booream - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks very much.","Leon J. Olivier - Eversource Energy","Welcome.","Jeffrey R. Kotkin - Eversource Energy","Thanks, Jerimiah. Next question is from Mike Weinstein from Credit Suisse. Good morning, Mike.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi. Good morning. Hey, just a follow-up on Jerimiah's questions a little bit. For the Northern Pass project, could you comment on \u2013 is there any chance at all that the hearings could be pushed beyond September 30? What's your sense that September 30 is a good hard deadline in terms of their commitment to meeting at the Commission?","Leon J. Olivier - Eversource Energy","Yeah. Mike, this is Lee. I would just say that the New Hampshire SEC has been very precise, very comprehensive in how they have run the proceedings to date. They are right on schedule. I think the more testimony that is given and provided by the project, the clearer the project becomes. And we don't see at this point any probability or possibility that this date will be extended. I mean the meetings have been very crisp. The witnesses are very well-prepared and with the ability to answer all of the questions to-date.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","All right. Great. And to what extent is the land-based renewables RFP important for Northern Pass or not important?","Leon J. Olivier - Eversource Energy","Well, clearly, it is important from the standpoint that you have Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec that wants to sell their energy into the New England marketplace. And if there is the ability to participate inside of an RFP and get a long-term contract at a fixed price, that's an advantage to HQ. So, clearly, there's an advantage there, but in any case, the RFP in and of itself does not determine the longevity of the project and the success of the project, because, in fact, there will be many RFPs, there will be many retirements. As we've said before, we see about 10,000 megawatts of retirements in New England, and Northern Pass will be viable in any of those as a source of clean energy for the region.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Right. Great. And just one last one for Phil. Hey, on the \u2013 I'm sorry if I missed this, but can you just remind us what \u2013 as you head into the Massachusetts rate cases for NSTAR and WMECO, what is the earned ROEs at these utilities going into the case? And what are you seeking coming out of it? How important are these rate increases for these utilities?","Phil Lembo - Eversource Energy","Yeah, Mike. So, in the request, we're looking for a 10.5% ROE in the case and the total rate increase is about $60 million at NSTAR Electric and about $36 million at Western Mass Electric. So not \u2013 certainly, they're increases, but not double-digit types of increases. So we're earning close to those numbers. NSTAR Electric at the end of 2016 was probably a little shy of that number of 10.5% when you do all the calculations for Massachusetts, and Western Mass was closer to 9%, so not at the levels that we were looking for in this case.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Thanks a lot, guys.","Jeffrey R. Kotkin - Eversource Energy","All right. Thanks, Mike. Next question is from Praful Mehta from Citi. Good morning, Praful.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Morning, guys. Thanks. So just a quick question on Access Northeast, more around what are the risks to timing and if there are delays, just wanted to understand what is the capital allocation strategy. Is it to wait and hold on to the capital to see when you actually can deploy towards Access Northeast? Or is there any share buyback or anything else on the cards if there are meaningful delays around Access Northeast?","Phil Lembo - Eversource Energy","Yeah. So this is Phil, Praful. What we've said in our long-term forecast of 5% to 7% that Access Northeast is really a small part of the far end of that forecast. So it's not as if there'd be a significant amount of capital that we're expecting in our plan over the next two to three near-term years, so there really wouldn't be a significant amount of capital to think about redeploying.","In terms of share repurchases, we're primarily interested, as we've said, in infrastructure that meet the needs of our customers and the region's energy needs. And really, we're looking for projects that are clean, that improve reliability and that manage to keep customer costs in line. So we don't have a share repurchase program authorized, and our focus would be on the infrastructure development.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got you. Fair enough. And just quickly, any color on FERC ROE given all this uncertainty on where the ROE finally shows up, and as you laid out, the implications for you guys based on the invested capital you have on the transmission side? How do we think about the timing of how this plays out? How are you guys viewing it internally? You said you're going to review whether using your existing rate is the right one going forward in terms of your forecast. So, I guess, if you can just put out at least the boundaries of how we should think about the potential outcomes here.","Phil Lembo - Eversource Energy","Sure. I guess, in the basic part of your \u2013 element of your question really I think gets to the point which is the situation is very fluid. The court decision is still recent, and really, the New England transmission owners, as a group, need to decide what the next steps will be. So that probably is a near-term determination because, in June, the transmission owners need to file a proposed regional network service rate. So it's certainly an active topic for discussion right now with the New England transmission owners.","So one could say that the last approved ROE by FERC is the 11.14%, so that's the last actual number that's out there. So any other number is as good as any other number if it's not 11.14%. So we're on top of this right now, we're working with the other transmission owners, but I think you should see more from all of us in the near-term.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got you. Thank you, guys.","Phil Lembo - Eversource Energy","Okay.","Jeffrey R. Kotkin - Eversource Energy","Thanks, Praful. Next question is from Travis Miller from Morningstar. Good morning, Travis.","Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc.","Good morning. Thank you. I was wondering, real quick, on the gas distribution demand side, you've mentioned the 4.6% increase in the breakout of the numbers. How much of that was core and non-weather-related? And is that tracking along your plan?","Phil Lembo - Eversource Energy","Well, as I said, versus normal, it's below. We've had to \u2013 the comparison of this year to last year was better, because it was a bit colder this year. But as I said, both 2017 and 2016 were quite a bit below normal, in the neighborhood of 6% to 7% heating degree days being below normal there. So we generally plan to normal, so I would expect that number would have been higher had we had hit normal weather.","Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc.","The 4.6% would have been higher?","Phil Lembo - Eversource Energy","Correct. Yeah. It was below normal weather in the first quarter.","Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc.","Okay. Okay. And then, just generally...","Phil Lembo - Eversource Energy","Because I said...","Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc.","What's that?","Phil Lembo - Eversource Energy","Oh. Go ahead. Go ahead.","Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc.","Yeah. Just generally, when you think about all the regulatory stuffs going on, the rate cases at FERC, the transmission projects with gas or electric would you say are the number one or two most important, most critical outcomes or resolutions that you need for the company overall, and particularly shareholders?","Phil Lembo - Eversource Energy","Well, Travis, I think I've always said when you're in a business where 100% of your revenues are determined in a regulatory arena, certainly, positive regulatory outcomes are important across the board. And if there's one company that you can point to as the poster child for getting two positive regulatory outcomes and having constructive relationships, whether they be at the state level or other, it's Eversource. So we feel very good about our abilities there and our ability to work with constructive regulation in the states. So I think they're all important, because we are highly-regulated obviously, but we do an effective job there.","Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thanks so much.","Jeffrey R. Kotkin - Eversource Energy","Thanks, Travis. Next question is from Caroline Bone from Deutsche Bank. Good morning, Caroline.","Caroline V. Bone - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, guys. I just have some follow-up questions on Northern Pass. So last quarter, you guys talked about the need to place an order for certain equipment. I was just wondering if you had any further idea on when that order might be placed?","Leon J. Olivier - Eversource Energy","Yeah, Caroline. This is Lee. The schedule that we have right now with the SEC in New Hampshire is really \u2013 May is really all about a couple of things. It's all about construction and it's all about the environmental impact, and that ends probably in the beginning of June. And then, at that point in time, we'll have a better sense of the construction practices. We'll have a better sense of any other environmental impact that may cause us to change the equipment orders from our current design. So I think we'll be in a better position then to look at making those orders around that period of time.","We continue to have conversations with the vendors, such as ABB, and to understand more about what will be required to do the design and construction or manufacturing, but really, we need to get to the beginning of June to have a better sense of that.","Caroline V. Bone - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","All right. That's very helpful, but I guess one just follow-up to that. Does the Massachusetts Clean Energy RFP have any impact on when that order might be placed? Or is it kind of a separate issue?","Leon J. Olivier - Eversource Energy","I would conclude that that's really a separate issue. It's really all about understanding what the final design is, because we don't want to go forward, order equipment, kick off engineering in and around it, only to find out the design is different and that becomes a re-do and is an expense that we don't want to incur.","Caroline V. Bone - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. And then, just one more minor one. With regards to the final EIS from the DOE, do they want to see the final SEC decision before they put out their final EIS?","Leon J. Olivier - Eversource Energy","No, not necessarily. The presidential permit will come after the SEC decision. So you'll have the final EIS, you'll have the SEC outcome, and then, you get the presidential permit, so no, they don't need to see that.","Caroline V.

The next question is from Paul Zimbardo from Citadel. Good morning, Paul.","Paul Zimbardo - Citadel LLC","Hi. Good morning. I had a quick clarification question. I'm sorry, I was a little confused. On Mike and Caroline's question. I know the slide says first quarter 2018 construction commencing; would you commence construction before that, I think you said January 25, RFP selection date?","Leon J. Olivier - Eversource Energy","I'm sorry. Is the question...?","Jeffrey R. Kotkin - Eversource Energy","He's talking about the Mass RFP identifying winners by January 25, 2018 and would the construction schedule in the first quarter of 2018 depend on what happens on January 25? Is that your question, Paul?","Paul Zimbardo - Citadel LLC","Yes. Like if it's \u2013 if there was any firmer timing in January \u2013 or in first quarter 2018?","Leon J. Olivier - Eversource Energy","No. I think currently, where we are is, assuming we have a successful outcome of the SEC process, we will start construction in the first quarter of 2018.","Paul Zimbardo - Citadel LLC","Okay, great.

Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jeffrey Kotkin. Sir, you may begin.","Jeffrey R. Kotkin - Eversource Energy","Thank you, Hilda. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. I'm Jeff Kotkin, Eversource Energy's Vice President for Investor Relations.","As you can see on slide 1, some of the statements made during this investor call may be forward-looking, as defined within the meaning of the Safe Harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risk and uncertainty, which may cause the actual results to differ materially from forecasts and projections.","Some of these factors are set forth in the news release issued yesterday. Additional information about the various factors that may cause actual results to differ can be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 and our Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2016.","Additionally, our explanation of how and why we use certain non-GAAP measures is contained within our news release and the slides we posted last night on our website under Presentations & Webcasts and in our most recent 10-K.","Turning to slide 2. Speaking today will be Phil Lembo, our Executive Vice President, CFO and Treasurer; and Lee Olivier, our Executive Vice President for Enterprise Energy Strategy & Business Development. Also joining us today are Werner Schweiger, our Executive Vice President and COO; Jay Buth, our Vice President and Controller; and John Moreira, our Vice President of Financial Planning and Analysis.","Now, I will turn to slide 3 and turn over the call to Phil.","Philip J. Lembo - Eversource Energy","Thank you, Jeff, and thank you all for joining us this morning. Today, I'll cover our third quarter and year-to-date financial results, provide an update on certain transmission projects and discuss recent legislative and regulatory developments in the three states.","So let's start with the quarter on slide 4. We earned $265.3 million or $0.83 per share in the third quarter of 2016, compared with earnings of $235.9 million or $0.74 per share in the third quarter of 2015. Our Transmission segment earned $0.28 per share in the third quarter of 2016, compared with $0.24 per share in the third quarter last year.","The primary driver of the earnings growth is a higher transmission rate base, which is due to our continued needed investment in the reliability of the New England power grid. I'll summarize some of our key reliability-driven transmission projects in a minute.","On the Electric Distribution and Generation side, we earned $0.53 per share in the third quarter of 2016, which is the same number as the third quarter of 2015. High distribution revenues were largely offset by higher depreciation, property taxes and interest costs.","On the Natural Gas side, we lost $0.02 per share in the third quarter of 2016, compared to a loss of $0.01 per share in the third quarter of last year. Higher interest and taxes more than offset the benefits of a rate increase at NSTAR Gas and the increased revenues from our natural gas infrastructure tracking mechanisms.","Turning from the third quarter to the year-to-date results, we earned $713.1 million or $2.24 per share in the first nine months of 2016, compared with earnings of $696.7 million or $2.19 per share in the first nine months of 2015. In our earnings press release, we reiterated both our 5% to 7% long-term growth rate and our 2016 earnings projection of $2.90 to $3.05 per share. At this time, we expect to finish 2016 somewhere in the middle of that range.","Transmission earnings totaled $0.84 per share in the first nine months of 2016, compared to earnings of $0.70 per share in the first nine months of last year. In addition to a larger rate base, the 2016 period benefited from the absence of a $0.04 charge we recorded in the first quarter of 2015 to a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission decision on the first complaint against the returns on equity earned by the New England transmission owners.","Our Electric Distribution and Generation segment earned $1.20 per share in the first nine months of 2016, compared with earnings of $1.32 per share for the same period last year. The decline was primarily due to the absence of a $0.09 per share total of benefits we recognized in the first quarter of 2015, as a result of resolving multiple regulatory proceedings involving NSTAR Electric.","Additionally, higher depreciation and property taxes resulting from our ongoing investment in our distribution system reduced year-to-date earnings by $0.05 per share.","Our Natural Gas Distribution segment earned $0.16 per share in the first nine months of 2016, compared with earnings of $0.18 per share for the same period last year. The milder first quarter weather this year with significantly reduced natural gas sales were partially offset by rate increases at NSTAR Gas and continued customer growth.","O&M continues to be a very good story this year, as our employees continue to provide excellent reliability for our customers while also reducing costs. Lower O&M has added $0.07 per share to earnings so far this year, if we exclude the $0.05 on benefits we recorded in the first quarter of 2015 when we successfully resolved the bad debt dispute in Massachusetts.","Turning from our financial results to operations. Our transmission investments totaled approximately $559 million in the first nine months of 2016, and we continue to target transmission capital investments of about $910 million for the full year.","As you can see on slide give, we continue to move ahead on our major transmission reliability projects across the system. We are making solid progress on our two large families of reliability projects, the Greater Boston Reliability Solutions and the Greater Hartford Central Connecticut Solutions.","Last month we announced that we had received approval of the Merrimack Valley Reliability Project, a nearly $125 million transmission project in New Hampshire and Massachusetts, which we and National Grid are building. To date, we've invested $91 million in the approximately $565 million set of Greater Boston Solutions. We expect to conclude the final Greater Boston work in 2019.","As we've done in past years, we expect to provide you with our 2017 earnings guidance and our four-year capital expenditure projections during our year-end earnings call in February.","I'll just cover one area now. During our July earnings call, we discussed the impact of a nine-month extension of the state review of Northern Pass on our 2017 capital budget, and we indicated that other projects were being identified to offset about $600 million reduction in projected Northern Pass CapEx in 2017. In July, we noted an additional $200 million in transmission reliability projects, about $200 million of solar projects in Massachusetts, and $30 million to $50 million of additional investments in our Natural Gas Distribution segment.","Since then, we've identified about $50 million of additional transmission reliability projects above the original $200 million, and as we move through our 2017 budget process, that could go higher. We'll continue to evaluate additional opportunities as we move through the next few months and give a complete update during our year-end earnings call.","I also want to touch on capital expenditures in our Natural Gas Distribution segment. We've invested $180 million in that segment through the first nine months of 2016, up approximately 35% from the same period last year. This increase primarily represents an acceleration of cast iron and bare steel pipe replacement in both Massachusetts and Connecticut, an increased level of work this year in our Hopkinton LNG facility where we are undertaking a $200 million upgrade, and increased expansion activity at Yankee Gas.","Now, I'll turn to slide six and recent developments involving the legislative and regulatory bodies in Massachusetts and New Hampshire. On August 8, Governor Baker signed in Massachusetts, signed An Act to Promote Energy Diversity. The bill requires the state to contract for 1,600 megawatts of offshore wind over the next 11 years in solicitations of at least 400 megawatts a piece. Subsequently, Governor Baker announced that several firms have acquired federal leases to attractive offshore wind sites that are 25 to 50 miles south of Cape Cod, and also agreed to lease a location in New Bedford, Massachusetts for staging their construction activities.","Massachusetts is clearly positioning itself to be a national leader in offshore wind development. We look forward to supporting that effort and believe there will be considerable opportunities for Eversource to build transmission over the coming decade to connect that offshore wind to the electric load.","The Act also calls for Massachusetts electric companies to commence competitive solicitations by April 2017 for nearly 9,500 gigawatt hours of additional clean energy annually. Again, we look forward to working with our policymakers on helping to provide the transmission links that will bring that clean energy to Massachusetts' consumers.","As you are likely aware, the three-state clean energy RFP was conducted this year by Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode Island. That concluded last week with selections focused on small-scale renewables and, as a result, neither Northern Pass nor Clean Energy Connect was selected. The states chose only 460 megawatts of Class I renewables, about two-thirds of that solar and one-third wind. Our two bids included hydroelectric generation that did not strictly meet the Class I criteria in the RFP.","We're focusing our efforts on the next round of contracting that is immediately around the corner. That involves solicitations for the nearly 9,500 gigawatt hours where the Massachusetts legislation explicitly allows large hydroelectric sources to participate. We believe that both Northern Pass and Clean Energy Connect would be excellent candidates for these next solicitations due to their potentially significant impact on lowering carbon emissions.","Northern Pass alone would reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 3.3 million tons a year, the equivalent of taking about 690,000 cars off the road. It may make Massachusetts' roads safer too, I don't know.","Switching from the regulatory slide, in slide 7, hearings begin tomorrow actually on our proposal to build up to 62 megawatts of solar generation in Massachusetts at a cost of about $200 million. Under legislation passed in April of this year, each Massachusetts electric utility is allowed to own and operate up to 35 megawatts of solar.","Western Mass Electric already has 8 megawatts of solar under a prior authorization. So we can add an additional 27 megawatts. NSTAR Electric has none, so we could build 35 megawatts. A DPU decision is due by the end of this year, with construction targeted for completion by the end of next year.","In New Hampshire, the state approved JPMorgan as the auction advisor for the divestiture of our 1200 megawatts of regulated generation. JPMorgan has submitted a proposal for conducting the auction, which the New Hampshire Public Utility Commission is now considering. That proposal calls for active marketing to take place in early 2017. We are targeting the second half of 2017 for completing the divestiture process.","You recall that the New Hampshire legislation enables the recovery of all of our planned investment either through the sale proceeds or through securitization.","Turning to slide 8. You can see the current status of the various return-on-equity complaints before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission related to transmission investment in New England. The latest development involves the fourth complaint on September 20. The FERC accepted the complaint and subsequently assigned a settlement judge to the case. If we do not settle, FERC expects that an order in the complaint would be issued in mid-2018.","We continue to record earnings based on our original October 2014 decision in the first complaint, even though that case remains on appeal before the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, where oral arguments have been scheduled for December 6.","We look forward to seeing many of you who are on this call at the EEI Financial Conference. And now I'll turn it over to Lee.","Leon J. Olivier - Eversource Energy","Okay. Thanks, Phil. I'll provide you with a brief update on our major investment initiatives and then turn the call back to Jeff for Q&As.","Let's start with Northern Pass in slide 10. There's been a number of developments involving Northern Pass since our late July earnings call. On October 14, the New Hampshire Public Utility Commission issued an order authorizing Northern Pass to do business as a New Hampshire utility.","In reaching its decision, the commission approved a settlement agreement between Northern Pass and the PUC staff that determined that Northern Pass had the technical, managerial and financial expertise to operate as a public utility. The PUC further concluded that \"granting Northern Pass authority to commence business as a public utility is for the public good\".","We're pleased to have received this important foundational ruling. In September and October, the New Hampshire Site Evaluation Committee or SEC held more than 20 days of hearings or technical sessions on the project, which featured 10 panels of witnesses on topics that included system stability, reliability, project construction and historical resources.","The sessions allowed interveners to question our witnesses on all aspects of the project based on testimony that was submitted as part of the SEC application last fall. We are very pleased with how well these sessions went overall. They were an excellent opportunity for us to demonstrate the thoughtful planning, design and engineering that we have already devoted to this project, and to underscore the significant economic and environmental benefits Northern Pass will provide to the region.","The next key milestone is the submission of intervener testimony in mid-November. Reports from the state agencies that are reviewing the project are due to the Site Evaluation Committee by March 1, and we anticipate the final committee hearings starting in April of next year.","A final written decision is expected by September 30 of 2017. If the committee issues a written order approving the 192-mile New Hampshire section of Northern Pass in September of 2017, we would expect to receive our U.S. Department of Energy approval by the end of 2017. Based on that schedule, we should be in the position to construct the project during the 2018 and 2019 timeframe, as indicated on slide 11.","From Northern Pass, let's turn to Access Northeast on slide 12. On the state regulatory level, we've had a number of developments over the past few months, as you can see on slide 13. The most important developments occurred in mid-August when Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruled that, under current state law, the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities cannot approve natural gas transmission contracts signed by electric distribution companies.","As a result of that court decision, the Massachusetts electric distribution companies requested that they be allowed to withdraw the contracts between Access Northeast and Eversource's Massachusetts electric utilities and National Grid. That request was accepted by the DPU last month. So there is no contract currently pending before the DPU related to Access Northeast.","In New Hampshire, the PUC ruled on October 6 that under current state law it does not have the authority to approve natural gas capacity contracts for electric distribution companies. The ruling reversed a PUC staff finding issued a year ago and was disappointing to us.","In its order, the commission cited similar reasoning to the Massachusetts court decision and even cited that decision in a footnote. Requesting reconsideration from the commission would be required before an appeal. The New Hampshire Supreme Court could be considered by Eversource New Hampshire.","There have also been developments in other states since our late July earnings call. In Connecticut, the state Department of Energy and Protection, or DEP, last week canceled a natural gas RFP it issued in June, noting developments in other states. It noted that it will continue to monitor the market and activities outside Connecticut and could reinitiate an RFP anytime.","In Maine, a written order was issued last month affirming the PUC's July 19 vote to endorse a contract with Access Northeast, assuming the states of Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island move ahead as well.","In Rhode Island, National Grid filed with state regulators a long-term contract for Access Northeast capacity on June 30. In September, the Rhode Island PUC placed a stay on the docket and requested an update from National Grid in mid-January. We believe that PUC's action was appropriate given the uncertainty in Massachusetts.","Given the current status of the state regulatory proceedings, we're reviewing the changes we may need to make and the project's configuration to serve both EDCs and LDC loads. As a result, we believe the construction is not likely to commence until the spring or summer of 2019, which would represent a 9-month to 12-month change from our previous estimate.","One fact that hasn't changed is the need for Access Northeast. Access Northeast is designed to address a critical problem we have in New England during the winter months; the lack of access to enough natural gas to both heat our homes and businesses and run our power plants. Access Northeast is uniquely positioned to address this problem, since it passes through Connecticut and Eastern Massachusetts, the two most densely populated parts of New England, and touches 60% of the region's gas-fired power generation.","Slide 14 shows you the current natural gas supply situation in New England. Pipelines that reach us from the west, through New York, Pennsylvania, and Ontario, currently can deliver up to 3 billion cubic feet of gas per day on cold winter days. However, the region's LDC loads alone can exceed 4 billion cubic feet per day.","The difference is bridged by vaporizing stored LNG and by plants switching to oil and increasing their carbon output. Exacerbating this issue is the decline of the Eastern Canadian offshore natural gas production, which is likely to continue further diminishing supplies for natural gas to the region.","Slide 15 shows what is happening with our region's generation fleet. New England has more than 15,000 megawatts of generation where natural gas is the primary fuel. Only about a third of that generation is dual-fueled. The other 10,000-plus megawatts only burn natural gas. And you can see virtually none of the generation has firm natural gas supplies.","Our situation will only get worse as Breaking Point, Pilgrim and other non-natural gas units retire over the course of the next two-and-a-half years are replaced by gas burning units. ISO-New England is calling that situation precarious. We believe there are very real concerns around reliability and significant additional sources of natural gas can be brought into New England.","Earlier, Phil discussed the results of three-state clean energy RFP. The projects selected for contract negotiations in the RFP will add some Class 1 renewable resources, but will do very little to address these natural gas capacity issues, which are most acute during the cold winter months.","And reliability is just one issue. You can see the price differential that existed in New England two winters ago on slide 16. Wholesale power prices were about three times higher during the winter than they were during the previous summer, costs that customers ultimately pay.","In a normal year, the price differential is about $1 billion. In a cold winter, it's significantly more. Ultimately, we firmly believe that the region's need for additional pipeline capacity to the west and Access Northeast's unique attributes will result in our project moving forward. We and our partners, Spectra Energy and National Grid, remain committed to the project and the $1 billion a year in benefits it can bring to New England customers.","The two paths in the Massachusetts that we had identified involve contracting with the state's natural gas distribution companies, fall capacity and seeking new enabling legislation. Regarding the legislative option, the Massachusetts legislature will reconvene in early 2017. So, a new statute similar to laws that have been passed in recent years in Connecticut, Rhode Island and Maine could be voted on by mid-2017.","At a recent meeting of the Coalition of Northeastern Governors, Massachusetts' Governor Baker expressed his explicit support for additional natural gas supplies for the state and we believe there is significant support in the state to increase access of additional gas supplies. But we understand that there would be opposition to such legislation from various stakeholder interests, as they were in Connecticut before a similar law was passed there.","In regards to natural gas distribution company option, I would remind you that the Kinder Morgan's Northeast Energy Direct project had signed several gas capacity contracts, primarily with Massachusetts and New Hampshire gas distribution companies, before Kinder canceled the project earlier this year.","We are currently exploring whether Access Northeast can help meet the growing long-term gas needs of these distribution companies. There is no question that both the regions' electric and natural gas consumers need the additional pipeline capacity Access Northeast can provide. And that siting a project on an existing right-of-way and in an existing LNG storage site is by far the most attractive option.","Now, I'm going to turn the call back to Jeff.","Jeffrey R. Kotkin - Eversource Energy","Thank you, Lee. And I'm going to turn the call back to Hilda just to remind you how to enter questions. Hilda?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you.","Jeffrey R. Kotkin - Eversource Energy","All right. Our first question this morning is from Mike Weinstein from Credit Suisse. Good morning, Mike.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks, Lee. Hey. For Access Northeast, would changes to serve LDCs allow the project to proceed without the need for any additional legislation?","Leon J. Olivier - Eversource Energy","Mike, this is Lee. It would really depend on the scope, in other words, the scale of those contracts that could be obtained. You have the Kinder project signed up nearly 500,000 dekatherms, 0.5 Bcf, with contracts that had been approved by their respective regulators in, essentially, Massachusetts and New Hampshire.","So, once you start getting up around 500,000 dekatherms, that makes the project more viable. But we have not made a complete determination on that yet because we still think there is a need for the EDC participation in the other states. So we think there could be a hybrid solution of both LDCs and EDC contracts.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","I guess what I'm thinking is that if it's not reliant on EDC contracts then, if you can get enough LDCs to participate, you wouldn't need any, I guess, special consideration from the Commission where electric customers are supporting the project.","Leon J. Olivier - Eversource Energy","Yeah. That would be true, but it would likely be a smaller project than the 900,000 dekatherms that we originally outlined.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","And on Clean Energy Connect, I think you mentioned that it now supports hydropower as well. I thought that Energy Connect was mostly from supporting wind power in New York State?","Leon J. Olivier - Eversource Energy","Yes. Clean Energy Connect was the combination of existing Brookfield run-of-the-river hydro facilities; in other words, hydro facilities that are old or mostly depreciated and building of new wind by two other entities, which was Iberdrola and EDP. So you would marry up essentially 600 megawatts of wind, 700 megawatts of hydro, you would have ended up with about a 85% capacity factor over the line with having that run-of-the- river hydro balance it.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. I see. And just back on Access Northeast for a second, if the project begins construction 2019, you're looking at getting it online no earlier than spring of 2020 or late 2020?","Leon J. Olivier - Eversource Energy","It'd be late 2020.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Late. Okay.","Leon J. Olivier - Eversource Energy","In the fall, yeah.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thank you.","Jeffrey R. Kotkin - Eversource Energy","All right. Thanks, Mike. Next question this morning is from Travis Miller from Morningstar. Good morning, Travis.","Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Good morning. Thank you. I was wondering, you talked about the winter and the gas demand and stuff. As we go into the season, you talked a lot about the constraints that still are there. What has improved since the last, say, two winters when there were the constraints \u2013 or not so much last winter, but two, three winters ago?","Leon J. Olivier - Eversource Energy","The fundamental improvement for now for this winter would be that the Spectra Energy AIM Project, which delivers about 345,000 dekatherms. The first phase of that came on, on November 1, delivering about 245,000 dekatherms, and then the remainder of that is expected to come on either later this month or in December, which would give you about a total of 345,000 dekatherms. And probably the way to look at that is, if you add AIM in and then you retire Breaking Point, next year they kind of wash each other out.","Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Okay. Okay. Got it. And then, on the offshore wind stuff, what recognition among regulators is there that this would most likely lead to higher customer prices? Is that something that's being discussed and being considered at a high level, or is this just the run to get renewables into the mix?","Leon J. Olivier - Eversource Energy","I would just say on that, following what's taken place in Europe, and I think the U.S. will have a major advantage, because Europe, pretty much where most of this development started, was much higher on the cost curve. And they're coming down on the back side of the cost curve. So you've seen cost as high as $0.24, $0.25 a kilowatt hour.","Our recent tenders done in Europe and Holland for less than $0.10 per kilowatt hour. So we believe with the economy of scale and the development in places such as in Asia or China, which is starting to take place now in Taiwan, we will see a fairly dramatic decrease.","I think the other thing that you have to remember too is that the load centers in New England are on the shoreline. And if you have offshore wind, it's closer to the load. And so therefore, your transmission costs decline significantly. And offshore wind comes on essentially 10 turbines at a time. It doesn't come on like a traditional generator where you spend five years building 1,000 megawatts and one push to the button it all comes on. It's every 8 (31:53) megawatts that comes on. So it rolls in over time. It has a better cost recovery curve as well.","Philip J. Lembo - Eversource Energy","Yeah. I think also, Travis, there's a recognition that there's a mix of solutions that are needed to meet aggressive carbon reduction targets as well. So you've got a mix of needs in terms of bringing more gas. Wind and solar play a part too. So there's many fronts that need additional supply to come into the region.","Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Okay. Great. I really appreciate the thoughts.","Philip J. Lembo - Eversource Energy","All right.","Jeffrey R. Kotkin - Eversource Energy","Thanks, Travis. Next question is from Paul Patterson from Glenrock. Morning, Paul.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Good morning. I wanted to follow-up on Mike Weinstein's question. If I heard the answer, it sounded to me that there would be a smaller project in the absence of the passage of Massachusetts legislation for Access Northeast. Is that correct?","Leon J. Olivier - Eversource Energy","Yeah. Paul, this is Lee. I think it's too early to determine that because we're still in the process of understanding the LDC load. I can tell you there is strong interest from the governors of the two bigger states that we've talked to recently on having an EDC solution as well. And you've got Maine and Rhode Island that are still in the hunt. We recently met with the Connecticut governing agency and their view is that, need some new solutions, but we fully support gas, bring us back some solutions to consider.","So you've got three states that clearly want an EDC solution. And so it's kind of marrying up that with a large enough LDC solution to make for a project that will have a meaningful difference in the region in terms of reliability and price stability and lowering the differential between the region, as an example, MISO and PJM, which is about a 50% differential higher in the winter time. So we're still advocating for a project upscale that can make that difference.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. So, I mean, I guess I misheard the \u2013 I thought it sounded like you might be less than 900 (sic) [900,000] (34:27) dekatherms, if it wasn't for the EDC participation in Massachusetts.","Leon J. Olivier - Eversource Energy","Yeah. Well, the question was that, if it was only LDC, would it be the same size of Access Northeast of 900,000 dekatherms. The answer to that, it was only LDC? No. It would not be.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And that's only LDC in Massachusetts or is that \u2013 I mean, the way it's \u2013 let me ask you the question this way. The feeling I got is that, because of the Massachusetts Supreme Court ruling, the other states seem to have \u2013 at least some of them seem to have some issues about going ahead with something without Massachusetts fully on board. Is that a correct way of summarizing it or do you see it...","Leon J. Olivier - Eversource Energy","I think there needs to be a take of gas and obviously the related revenue requirements with it for Massachusetts. But if you go back and look at the previous contracts that were signed by LDCs in the old Kinder project, majority of those are in Massachusetts. And, of course, gas customers are electric customers as well. So it could be picked up by gas customers. But in essence, the state makes the contribution because gas customers are electric customers.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","I got you. And then Phil made a statement about the renewable RFP where the hydro bids or whatever were not selected, and it sounded like there might have been a technical reason for that. Did I understand that correctly? In other words, it wasn't conforming to \u2013 it was an issue of whether or not the bids you guys had proposed did not conform to some specific technical element of it. Is that the reason why it was rejected? Or was there some other issue?","Philip J. Lembo - Eversource Energy","One aspect, Paul, this is Phil, is sort of subsequent to the RFP going out, Massachusetts passed specific legislation enabling hydro in terms of contracting. So, certainly on the Massachusetts side, the legislation that came in subsequent to the RFP being issued provided us specific authorization. So the timing was, the RFP started, but then the legislation happened. So, now, we have specific legislation, as I indicated, to cover a solicitation for hydro in Massachusetts.","Leon J. Olivier - Eversource Energy","Yeah. And I would add that, if you look at the statutory authority of the three states, they could have bought up to 5 terawatt hours of energy. And they bought 0.9 terawatt hours. So they bought 17% of what they were authorized to buy. The majority of that energy is in solar. And obviously, on a cold winter day at 4 o'clock, you're not going to get that energy and two-thirds of it is really solar. So they bought small facilities. Nothing like...","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Why is that? Why didn't they buy more?","Leon J. Olivier - Eversource Energy","Well, it's just \u2013 you've got three states and they have different needs. As an example, Connecticut, on their carbon goal is doing very good. In other words, they've got a goal by 2020 of 39 million tons a year. They're at 40 million tons now. So they said, hey, look, we'd just rather buy best one in renewables right now.","And as Phil said, Massachusetts in that solicitation didn't really have authorization to buy hydro. But now that they will, in April they'd be able to buy a large tranche of hydro, almost 10 terawatt hours. So it's a little bit of the construct and the timing, but that's kind of how it ended up.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. I appreciate it. Thank you very much.","Leon J. Olivier - Eversource Energy","Yeah.","Jeffrey R. Kotkin - Eversource Energy","Thanks, Paul. Our next question is from Caroline Bone from Deutsche Bank. Good morning, Caroline.","Caroline V. Bone - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, guys. I was just wondering could you just talk about the options you have to offset the impact to earnings from a 9-months to 12-months delay in Access Northeast?","Philip J. Lembo - Eversource Energy","Yeah. I think that \u2013 this is Phil, Caroline. If you look at our growth rate through 2019, there's not a significant amount of Access Northeast in there. So, if you assume that it's still in that time period, you're fairly close just in terms of the spending that, even with the delay, that it would not have a significant impact there.","So we've looked, as we did mention with the NPT, if there's other transmission projects, and as you've seen, we found additional reliability projects. We have additional trans investment in our gas infrastructure, the Massachusetts solar program. So there is a number of initiatives that could fill that. But it's not a significant number.","Caroline V. Bone - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Fair enough. And then with regards to the transmission you guys might get involved with to connect offshore wind in Massachusetts, I know this is kind of far down the road here, but can you discuss how cost recovery would likely work?","Leon J. Olivier - Eversource Energy","How cost recovery would likely work? That whole framework is still being worked out, being discussed and flexed. There's really no specifics. There's couple of notions, one that the state could do kind of a broad RFP for a transmission highway that would interconnect the six parcels of water back into the mainland and folks would bid on that. There could be one or multiple winners on that for design kind of EPC construction.","And the other one is basically that each developer, which is pretty consistent with what takes place currently in Europe, each developer bids their project and they bid whatever, 400 megawatts, 600 megawatts, 800 megawatts, whatever the bid is in terms of megawatts, they build their own offshore substations and they build the cables that run into the mainland and interconnect into the existing transmission system. Which really means all that would be onshore would be a substation and an interconnection to the 345 kV grid.","So it's not really been determined exactly how that will work, but that is a topic of discussion that is taking place inside of the Commonwealth.","Caroline V. Bone - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then, just one final one on a different topic. I know we have kind of the NSTAR Electric rate case finally on the horizon. Can you just remind us how much rate base is currently at NSTAR Electric distribution specifically?","Philip J. Lembo - Eversource Energy","Yeah. Yeah. 2.7, 2.8; in that range.","Caroline V. Bone - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great. That's it. Thanks, guys.","Philip J. Lembo - Eversource Energy","All right.","Leon J. Olivier - Eversource Energy","Thank you.","Jeffrey R. Kotkin - Eversource Energy","Thank you, Caroline. Next question is from Shar Pourreza from Guggenheim. Good morning, Shar.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Sorry, I had to hop in late and I apologize if this was addressed. Lee, let me ask you. So, in Access Northeast, it sounds like a solution could be EDCs for states like Vermont, Rhode Island, Connecticut, and LDC demand in Massachusetts.","Would the Clean Energy \u2013 I'm sorry, the Kinder project that was canceled, the Northeast Direct, it sounds like out of 1 Bcf per day for Access Northeast, you could generally account for Massachusetts just by the customers that were signed up for the Kinder pipe.","Leon J. Olivier - Eversource Energy","Yeah. There is a potential to get very close to that. So Massachusetts created a 42% hole in the project when they couldn't sign contracts. That's about 400,000 dekatherms or so. And there's a fairly large LDC demand in Massachusetts as well. So it could come pretty close to that.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","How is the dialogue going with the offtakers of the canceled pipe?","Leon J. Olivier - Eversource Energy","We have our folks at Spectra that really conduct that dialogue for us because that's kind of what they do around the nation. So I could only characterize it as an ongoing process.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay. Great. And then on New Hampshire, obviously, with the recent ruling, it's 10% of the pipe. Can you theoretically just bypass New Hampshire and socialize the cost through the rest of the New England region, just given the fact that it's such a small piece of that pipe?","Leon J. Olivier - Eversource Energy","Yeah. I mean, I think that when the regional states, all the states in the region and led by the governors quite frankly, put this construct together, it was with the understanding that each state would take its load share of the gas.","So our view on that is we still think there's an opportunity for having New Hampshire take their respective load, which is not big as granted as you said. But we're still committed to work with the other governors and work with the State of New Hampshire to find a pathway through where they pay for their share of the gas.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Right. Right. And then let me just ask you a little bit more sort of just top-level question on the growth. I mean, obviously, investors are going to shift to 2020 and beyond, especially now given the delay of Access Northeast, which hopefully wasn't a surprise to people.","But the question is, knowing how you've been able to backfill your growth, knowing sort of the reliability spending, you've done a pretty good job about negating the delay of Northern Pass, do you sort of envision I mean 5% to 7% potentially being put in jeopardy if Access Northeast is further delayed ? Or do you have enough in that pipeline, no pun intended, but do you have enough in that pipeline in reliability or whatever spend that you have that you don't envision 5% to 7% being impacted?","Philip J. Lembo - Eversource Energy","So I know you said you may have jumped on late. I think, in the actual prepared remarks, I did reiterate our comfort and our guidance of the 5% to 7% earnings growth range. And so we're very comfortable there. Also, as you know, in February, we'll be doing an update of our outlook and adding another year and giving more visibility on the capital and have sort of outlined, as you mentioned, the hole and how to fill that in terms of transmission, gas, the solar project in Massachusetts.","So we feel good about that rate and we'll have more information in terms of adding another year on when we get to the February time period.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Excellent. Thanks, guys.","Leon J. Olivier - Eversource Energy","You're welcome.","Jeffrey R. Kotkin - Eversource Energy","Thanks, Shahriar. Next question is from Mike Gaugler from Janney. Good morning, Mike.","Michael Gaugler - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Hey. Good morning, everyone. Nice quarter.","Leon J. Olivier - Eversource Energy","Thank you.","Michael Gaugler - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Given the delay in Access Northeast and other new capacity pipeline cancelations, just wondering how you're thinking about new reliability projects, as the existing capacity has to be spread more thinly. Or wondering has that optionality essentially been exhausted with the projects that are already announced and underway?","Leon J. Olivier - Eversource Energy","Yeah. Mike, this is Lee. I think the reliability projects that have been built and are under construction and under review are all traced to either situations where there is current overloads or current violations of NERC criteria. And so, therefore, they're being built out to correct that.","Most of the future reliability \u2013 or future transmission rather that will be needed in the region will not be reliability-based. It will be needed to connect renewables from a source, whether that's offshore, in Canada or now the New England such as Maine, to get that renewable energy into the load.","So it's nature. It will be less around what we've done over the last 10 years and more around interconnecting renewables to get it to the load.","Michael Gaugler - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Okay.","Philip J. Lembo - Eversource Energy","And, Michael, this is Phil too. Just in terms of the specific items, I know you're talking about additional or future items, but there are still several ongoing reliability projects that we have that we're having significant spend on through the next several years in terms of Greater Hartford or Greater Boston and projects in New Hampshire, which may need some additional transmission in New Hampshire more than they've had in recent years. So there's good amount in the pipeline. And as Lee said, the nature of some of that going forward could change. But the pipeline is robust at this stage.","Michael Gaugler - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","All right. That's all I had, gentlemen. Thank you.","Jeffrey R. Kotkin - Eversource Energy","All right. Well, thanks, Mike. That's the last question that we have this morning. So thank you very much for joining us today. We look forward to seeing many of you at the EEI Conference next week.

You may begin, sir.","Jeffrey Kotkin","Thank you, Brendon. Good morning and thank you for joining us. I'm Jeff Kotkin, Eversource Energy's Vice President for Investor Relations.","During this call, we'll be referencing slides that we posted last night on our website. And as you can see on slide 1, some of the statements made during this investor call may be forward-looking as defined within the meaning of the Safe Harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.","These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risk and uncertainty, which may cause the actual results to differ materially from forecasts and projections. These factors are set forth in the news release issued yesterday. Additional information about the various factors that may cause actual results to differ can be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, and on Form 10-Q for the three months ended September 30, 2018. Additionally, our explanation of how and why we use certain non-GAAP measures is contained within our news release and the slides we posted last night and in our most recent 10-K.","As you can see on slide 2, speaking today will be Jim Judge, our Chairman, President and CEO; and Phil Lembo, our Executive Vice President and CFO. Also joining us today are Leon Olivier, our Executive Vice President for Enterprise Energy Strategy and Business Development. John Moreira, our Treasurer and Senior VP for Finance and Regulatory; and Jay Buth, our VP and Controller. ","Now I will turn to slide 4 and turn over the call to Jim Judge.","Jim Judge","Thank you, Jeff. And thank you everyone for joining us this morning. I am happy, very pleased to discuss our successful performance in 2018 and the very strong future we see for Eversource. Our 8,000 talented and dedicated employees undertake their work everyday to improve the experiences of our customers, support our approximately 500 communities and execute the forward looking clean energy policies of our state. And doing so, we've created a solid, very long track record of delivering significant value to our shareholders. And doing so in a way that effectively manages the risks of our business.","A regulated business cannot be successful without positive relationships with its regulators. We firmly believe that our success in achieving top tier reliability and safety performance were combined with our success and reducing our O&M cost by more than 20% since 2012, enables us to create constructive regulatory frameworks that are fair to both customers and investors. ","As you can see on slide 4, we settled two major distribution rate cases in Connecticut in 2018. One for our electric business and for our natural gas business. The Connecticut Light and Power settlement was the first electric rate case settlement in Connecticut since 1986 and underscores the level of trust and transparency that we develop with other parties. ","Less than seven months after the three year CL&P settlement went into effect, we implemented a separate three year rate settlement through Yankee Gas. Both CL&P and Yankee Gas settlements provide us with forward looking rate mechanisms that allow us to step up our investments and our infrastructure to better serve our customers without suffering the earnings consequences of rate lag. ","In 2018, we also moved ahead with some of our strategic initiatives to support relentless focus on sustainability and greenhouse gas reduction. In addition to the divesture of our costly units, we successfully completed the build out of 62 megawatt of solar in Massachusetts. The solar investments totaled approximately $170 billion. In addition, we also began implementing separate initiatives in Massachusetts to invest a total of $233 million in battery storage, electric vehicle infrastructure and other grid modernization projects.","They also point Massachusetts state energy policy and by the middle of next year we do compile a new plan for the next three-year cycle beginning with 2021. Our progress in these areas is being recognized. Various ESG rating proves consistently ranked Eversource near the very top of their rating scales, and we now have more than 130 separate socially responsible funds that have invested in our company. We also have achieved strong returns for our shareholders, while managing our risk profile.","Across the board, our credit ratings remain very strong among the highest of the industry. Turning to slide 5, you can see that our total return continues to outperform both the utility index and the broad market from a short term and long term basis. While past performance is certainly no guarantee of future returns, it can be a good indicator. And past performance does validate our contention that a company that excels in its service to customers can also excel in delivering value to shareholders.","Turning to slide 6, you can see that dividend growth remains a central feature of our total return profile. On February 6th, our board of trustees approved a $0.12 annualized increase in our common dividend. The 6% increase is consistent with the midpoint about 5% to 7% long-term growth rate and exceeds the average dividend growth in our industry. And as you can see on slide 7, we continue to forecast growth of 5% to 7% long-term, a continuation of what we have delivered since our merger closed in 2012.","The forecast that Phil will discuss with you shortly extends five years through the 2023. That's a two-year extension to our prior guidance that only went through 2021. As you expect, we continue to plan what even longer term for our growth. As you can see on slide 8, we made the announcement earlier this month that we believe will have a very positive impact on our results well through the next decade. On February 8th, we announced the purchase of a 50% share of similar projects and offshore when energy leases that \u00d8rsted acquired when it bought Peak Water Wind late last year.","Our latest transaction builds upon the partnership we first developed with \u00d8rsted in 2016 when we acquired a 50% interest in Bay State wind. This month's announcement relates to leases for more than 250 square miles of ocean of the Massachusetts coast that are adjacent to the 300 square mile Bay State lease that we jointly owned. These lease areas are among the best sites offshore wind in the entire United States and they're in a prime location to meet the growing appetite offshore wind in New England and New York.","Together the Bay State wind and Deepwater wind sites could host at least 4,000 megawatts, and we share the partnership 50:50 with \u00d8rsted, the world's largest, most successful and most experienced developer of offshore wind. The Deepwater portfolio in which we now have a 50% share includes contracts for about 830 megawatts of offshore wind that will be sold to utilities at Connecticut, Rhode Island and New York. The 830 megawatts represent the largest concentration of offshore wind contracts currently awarded in North America.","These projects still must go through the signing process and will have very limited impact on our earnings growth through 2023. But beginning in 2024, we expect that investment to be a significant source of earnings for Eversource. And those 830 megawatts are likely just the beginning. Last week, we've been into a New York offshore RFP that is expected to be awarded this spring, and later this year we expect to bid into with the second Massachusetts offshore wind RFP where the state seeks another 400 to 800 megawatts of clean generation.","All told, New England and New York have announced targets or adopted legislation that could result in the development of up to 15,000 megawatts of offshore wind by the year 2035. Still we'll have more to say about the expected potential impact of this announcement; however, I want to underscore how pleased we are with this transaction, how pleased we are with our partner \u00d8rsted and the opportunity to bring a significant source, a locally produced clean energy to our region.","A major factor in our decision to expand our relationship with \u00d8rsted is our partners' unequaled global experience, and track record of delivering offshore wind projects on time and on budget. \u00d8rsted has more than a 25% worldwide market share much larger than its nearest competitor. Of the seven projects \u00d8rsted recently completed, six with the limit below the budget that was set when a final investment decision was made. This fact that combined with \u00d8rsted's record of completing projects on schedule has allowed the company to consistently deliver on its return expectations.","\u00d8rsted also shares our philosophy of being a discipline bidder will not sacrifice returns to win business. So while we don't expect to win every offshore wind RFP, we fully expect that our successful bids will achieve a level of profitability commensurate with the project risk. We I believe is largest energy company and the largest developer of energy infrastructure in our region. Collectively, New England has very ambitious greenhouse gas reduction targets seeking to reduce emissions by 80% by the year 2050. New York has established aggressive renewable targets as well.","Offshore wind will be central to meeting this region's carbon reduction and renewable development goals and through this partnership; we're quite pleased to play a leading role in executing the region's energy policies.","We're also pleased with the long term earnings growth opportunities these investments will provide to our shareholders.","Now I'll turn the call over to Phil. ","Phil Lembo","Thank you, Jim. And today my part of the call will cover the 2018 results. An update on our key regulatory dockets. Look at 2019 guidance. Our new five-year financial forecast and a discussion about financing plans during that forecast period.","As Jim said, we had strong 2018 from both an earnings and operational perspective. Beginning with slide 10, we earned $3.25 per share for the full year compared with $3.11 in 2017. A year ago we have projected earnings of between $3.20 per share and $3.30. So we're right in line with that projection. Our electric distribution segments earns a $1.44 per share in 2018 compared with earnings of $1.57 in 2017. The decrease was primarily due to low generation earnings as a result of the divestiture of our New Hampshire generating unit assets.","Also offsetting the higher revenues were increases in depreciation, interest and property tax expenses. Our Electric Transmission segment earned a $1.34 per share in 2018 compared with $1.23 in 2017. Improved results primarily reflect our increased investments in that business. Our Natural Gas Distribution business earned $0.29 per share in 2018 compared with $0.23 in 2017. The increase was primarily due to higher revenues at our Yankee Gas Connecticut property, which would not decoupled until late in the year, as well as the outcome of a Yankee Gas rate review in the increased revenues related to our capital investment tracker mechanisms.","On the Water Distribution segment, we earned $0.10 per share in 2018 and we acquired Aquarion in December so no 2017 results to report there. Eversource parent and other earned $0.08 per share in 2018 including two non recurring items that we discussed in the third quarter. The $0.08 per share write-off of our investment in Access Northeast and a $0.06 gain from various taxes reform items.","I know that a number of analysts may or may not have adjusted their estimates accordingly for these events. Fourth quarter 2018 earnings total $0.73 per share compared with $0.75 in the fourth quarter of 2017. Transmission earnings were down a $0.01 compared with the fourth quarter of 2017 primarily due to a higher effective tax rate in that business in 2018, which costs us about $0.03 per share. Electric Distribution was up by $0.09 per share in the fourth quarter due in part to the absence of the generation earnings due to the divestiture, as well as higher depreciation interest in storm damage restoration costs.","Conversely, our Natural Gas Distribution segment earnings were up by $0.06 per share in the quarter benefiting from capital tracker mechanisms, cool weather and some increased revenues stemming from the Yankee Gas rate decision. We also had a $0.01 per share in the fourth quarter of 2018 from our water business. Slide 11 summarizes the constructive resolution of our three distribution rate reviews in 2018 for Connecticut Light and Power, Yankee Gas and Aquarion in Massachusetts.","We expect far less states rate activity in 2019 though for the first time in nearly a decade we expect to file a general rate review in New Hampshire. Public service in New Hampshire is under earning and it's allowed ROE of 9.67% despite significant cost management success across that business since 2012. In New Hampshire rate reviews take about a year to complete, but utilities have the opportunity to request interim rate increases subject to refund if they expect to under earn, they previously authorized ROEs while the rate review is pending.","As a result, we are planning to file for interim rate relief in New Hampshire in April and full rate review in May of this year. The next area to cover is FERC. This past fall I'm sure you know, FERC issued a proposed new methodology for determining whether it should initiate new proceedings concerning transmission ROEs, and if so, what methodology should be used to decide on them. As you can see on slide 12, there are still four complaints pending against the ROEs earned by the New England electric transmission owners of which we have lagged.","Initial briefs on the FERC methodology were filed in January with reply briefs due in a couple of weeks. We're hopeful that in 2019 this long-running dispute will be resolved by FERC, and that FERC endorses of standards that in the future will make this type of serial complaints, we've had a New England highly unlikely. From 2018 now I'd like to turn to slide 13 and discuss our 2019 guidance. ","We expect to earn between $3.40 and $3.50 per share in 2019. As you can see in the slide, we expect to benefit from our multiyear rate review outcomes in 2018 from our Massachusetts electric jurisdictions. And our Connecticut electric and natural gas utilities. NSTAR Electric implemented roughly $32 million increase in base distribution rates on January 1st of 2019 as part of its five-year performance-based rate plan approved by the Massachusetts DPU in November of 2017.","This increase will help fund reliability enhancement and customer service initiatives. At CL&P based distribution rates rise by an incremental $31.1 million on May 1st of 2019. Here again, this increase provides us timely recovery for our system improvements. Yankee Gas implemented a $1.4 million rate increase on November 15, 2018. The increase was the first of three approved in a multi-year agreement with Connecticut's PURA with the second increase effective beginning in 2020. ","Yankee Gas also receives approval for a tracking mechanism for cast iron and unprotected steel pipe replacements. Finally, Aquarion in Massachusetts implemented a $2 million rate increase just before the end of last year. In the transmission business, we expect to benefit from our continued investment and FERC regulated facilities. We invested just shy of a $1 billion in the transmission facilities at CL&P electric in public service in New Hampshire in the year 2018. And transmission investments in 2019 are expected to be at a similar level at $990 million as we complete some of our major transmission projects in Connecticut, New Hampshire and continue to address our overhead and underground maintenance activities.","In terms of O&M, although overall O&M is expected to increase in 2019 as areas of spending where we have regulatory commitment and recoveries in place. The O&M that affects earnings is expected to decline by about 1% to 2% in 2019. Growth will also be as a result of distribution capital tracking mechanisms in the areas such as replacement of old and cast -iron and unprotected steel pipes in our natural gas business and older water mains at Aquarion.","Somewhat offsetting the additional revenues associated with these investments are higher depreciation, interest expensive and property taxes. So turning from the recent investments to future capital expenditures. I'll move on to slide 14. Overall, we expect to invest nearly $13 billion in our core electric natural gas and water delivery systems from 2019 through 2023. We expect to invest nearly $8 billion over the next three years. So $8 billion out of the $13 billion over the next three years. ","This represents a significant increase from the $6.5 billion forecast we provided to you last year from our core business for the same years. It's key contributor to continuing our outstanding service reliability to our customers into the extension of our 5% to 7% growth rate through 2023. As you can see on slide 15, every segment of the business is forecasting higher expenditures with the electric transmission and distribution business showing the greatest growth.","As shown on slide 16, we expect these increases to move our regulated rate base from $16.6 billion at the end of 2017 to $24.5 billion by the end of 2023 That's a 6.7% compound annual growth rate that is expected to maintain our safe, secure and reliable delivery systems and drive our 5% to 7% EPS growth over that period. This is the basis of why we believe we can grow earnings around the midpoint of our range on average over the next five years. Confident in that ability. On the transmission side, the increased investment aligns with our asset management oversight process and anticipates completion of our larger projects in Greater Boston, our New Hampshire seacoast and our Greater Hartford suites of projects.","It also includes significant regional projects such as substation investments in Greenwich, Connecticut and in Cambridge Massachusetts, as well as a number of smaller projects to improve the resilience and security of the transmission system. These include replacing overhead structures and upgrading some of our underground infrastructure due to age and asset condition.","Turning to slide 17, you see that many of the larger projects we have spoken about to you over recent years are moving ahead to its final completions. The Greater Hartford Central Connecticut reliability family projects should be complete by the end of this year. We received a written order on January 31st of this year from the New Hampshire's site evaluation committee approving the Seacoast reliability project. And that is expected to be complete by the end of this year.","The Greater Boston reliability project continues to progress. This is a joint solution with National Grid. We are also --we are responsible for 28 of these projects of which 25 should be complete by the end of this year. In the Electric Distribution segment, we forecast capital expenditures of nearly $3.5 billion from 2019 through 2021 compared with last February's forecast of $2.9 billion for the same year. We also expect to invest another $2.25 billion over the course of the years 2022 and 2023 in electric distribution. There are a number of factors driving the increase as we discussed previously, we've identified many additional automation and storm hardening opportunities following the rash of Nor'easters and tornadoes that struck our overhead electric system last March and May.","We also are seen faster customer growth in certain areas of Greater Boston including the Seaport area and cities of Somerville and Cambridge will be making incremental substation investments. These investments are being made to meet the growing demand of customers in these areas.","In the Natural Gas business, we now forecast $2.33 billion of capital expenditures over the next five years with about $1.4 billion occurring in the next three. These expenditures include an acceleration of pipe replacement in both Connecticut and Massachusetts. In the recent Yankee Gas rate case of the Connecticut PURA shorten the period for replacing the older cast iron and unprotected natural gas distribution pipes from 13 years to 11 years. Our new forecast also reflects a more rapid replacement of cast iron unprotected steel pipe in our larger Massachusetts system.","We're also making additional plant and system investments in our Huntington LNG facility that we're doing in parallel with our current liquefier and major systems upgrade. On slide 18, you can see our forecasted pipe replacement capital budget for the next five years. You may recall that as a result of the Yankee Gas rate settlement, we now have fully reconciling pipe replacement and tracking mechanisms in place in both states.","In addition to pipe replacement, we continue to see some growth from new construction, new customers, additional fuel cell application and the installation of new combined heat and power systems and customer facilities fuelled by natural gas. This growth requires additional investments in our natural gas infrastructure which drives the distribution rate base growth by an average at annual average of more than 12% through 2023, far faster than any of our other regulated segments.","Rate base is expected to exceed $3.5 billion here by the end of 2023. Turning to slide 19, in our Water Segment, we invested about $102 million in Aquarium systems in 2018 about 50% more than Aquarion's prior owners were investing each year. We expect to invest nearly $625 million in Aquarium systems over the next five years or about $125 million per year. As you can see on the slide, we're projecting rate base reaching approximately $1.2 billion by the end of 2023. ","Turning to slide 20, you can see about a third of that investment is designed to improve Aquarium's ability to meet the water supply needs of southwestern Fairfield County in Connecticut. We now have reconciling mechanisms to recover pipe replacement investment in each state Aquarion serves. In addition to growing Aquarion through investments in our existing service territory, we continue to seek out opportunities to require small existing systems particularly in Connecticut.","About three weeks ago state regulators approved Aquarion's purchase of assets of two smaller water companies in South East Connecticut. Four of the small acquisitions are now before regulators for approval. I mentioned the number of items that are included in our five-year nearly $13 billion capital forecast. On slide 21, we list some potentially significant items that are not in our core business CapEx forecast. And may come to fruition during the forecast period.","In the CapEx forecast, we've been conservative I'd say in terms of what may come out of the grid modernization dockets in the state's we serve. In Connecticut, we await the release of a Connecticut PURA report on a year-long review of distribution companies long-range planning, which there was considerable discussion about Advanced Metering Infrastructure or AMI, also discussion of energy storage increased real-time monitoring of lines and substation conditions and other topics. Because the review has extended longer than we had anticipated, we opted not to include any AMI of basic incremental grid modernization spending at CL&P in this forecast.","We also did not include any basic grid mod in New Hampshire in this forecast, but expect to make some proposals in New Hampshire's upcoming general rate review or in a separate filing following the New Hampshire PUC issuance of a final decision in their ongoing grid modernization proceedings. In Massachusetts, you can see on slide 22, we are currently implementing $233 million of the approved investments in core grid modernization storage and electric vehicle infrastructure.","Beyond these programs, the DPU has asked the utility, the state electric utilities to propose next year a new three-year grid modernization program for the period of 2021 through 2023. Our forecast includes spending on incremental core grid mod programs through 2023. Like Connecticut, we expect Massachusetts to also consider the rollout of advanced metering infrastructure or AMI. But we're not reflected any rollout of AMI in this forecast.","Separately, we've not included any investments in Northern Pass in this forecast. In terms of O&M, we expect O&M to remain relatively flat during years two through five of our five-year forecast after the decline of 1% to 2% for 2019 that I mentioned earlier. Turning to our financing plan. As illustrated at the end of the appendix, we have modest level of maturities that will need to be refinanced this year and next year. However, we do have a significant core business capital program that I described earlier.","In addition, we have approximately $100 million of excess deferred income taxes that will be refunded to customers over the next few decades. And the cash flow benefits of bonus depreciation as everybody knows has ended. These factors are positive for customers deposited for long term growth. Over the past four years, we've invested nearly $10 billion in our infrastructure to maintain great performance for our customers. Annual capital expenditures grew from about $1.9 billion in to 2015 to more than $2.8 billion in 2018, which contributed to our top quartile reliability and service response for customers.","We also entered the water business by acquiring New England's largest investor owned water company back in December of 2017. We continue to evolve our business to meet the growing needs of our customers, as well as the clean energy mandates of our region. In order to finance this growth, this five-year forecast period does include issuance of both new debts in equity to finance investments in a balanced way as you can see on slide 23.","We expect to issue approximately 2 billion of new equity over the next five years. This equity will help fund the nearly $13 billion of core business and capital investments we expect to make through 2023 and also our 50% of the capital requirements associated with the construction of the offshore wind facilities for which we and \u00d8rsted have secured PPAs that Jim talked about earlier. We'll also use treasury shares to satisfy our dividend reinvestment program needs.","Our expectation to grow earnings per share around the midpoint of the 5% to 7% range through 2023 anticipates the issuance of this equity over the five years. I'll repeat that. We expected revenue earnings per share around the middle of our 5% to 7% growth rate through 2023 even while issuing approximately $2 billion of equity through new common share issuance and with the Eversource share s coming out of Treasury for our dividend reinvestment program. We will be opportunistic about the equity issuance and will time them accordingly over the next several years. The PPAs we have for offshore wind did not produce revenues or earnings until the turbine begin producing energy.","Construction cost including interest on debt will be capitalized into the class of the projects, but there will be no earnings on the equity investment until the turbines are operating. By 2024, we expect all 830 megawatts of offshore winds to be fully operational being additive to our earnings growth trajectory in a meaningful way going forward. Cash flows also expected to rise significantly once the offshore wind turbines are fully operational.","On the fixed income side, we continue to carry very strong credit ratings for all agencies. We've always maintained a balanced approach here, achieving above-average strong earnings and dividend growth and also strong credit ratings. We prided ourselves on delivering strong financial performance and strong financial condition. This plan accomplishes both in a balanced way delivering a 5% to 7% EPS growth and maintaining the strong financial condition and metrics that we currently have.","To summarize on slide 24 as Jim said earlier, 2018 was a very strong year for us. Our reliability and safety metrics remained in the upper tier of the industry. Our customer service metrics continue to improve and we are introducing innovative technology to improve the customer experience in many ways including more mobile access. We continue to play a vital role in implementing our state's clean energy initiatives. We continue to provide our investors with strong earnings and dividend growth and have to provide an attractive future growth opportunity.","Going forward, our core business continues to be the engine for our 5% to 7% EPS growth outlook for 2023. Our underlying rate based growth is 6.7%. And we continue with our strong focus on our O&M part. And we see offshore wind is being added to our earnings growth in a meaningful way beyond 2023. Look forward to seeing many of you at the Equity and Fixed Income Conference is coming up in Boston in New York over the next week.","And I'll turn the call back to Jeff for Q&A. ","Jeffrey Kotkin","Thank you, Phil. And I'm going to return the call to Brendon to remind you how to enter your question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","Jeffrey Kotkin","First question this morning is from Mike Weinstein from Credit Suisse. Good morning. Mike.","Mike Weinstein","Good morning, guys. Thanks for the big update. A question on the equity coming out. Can you give us I mean I know that you said it's going to be opportunistic, but can you give us a sense of whether some of it is back end loaded for the wind project? I think you said that you wouldn't be investing in the wind projects until they come online, right. So that'd be pretty far out. And I mean that was I think the \u00d8rsted is only $225 million so that wouldn't be that much of the $2 billion equity to account for that. Maybe you can give us a sense of what that equity is for like why do you need equity now.","I mean I understand that with bonus depreciation rolling our tax cash taxpayer at some point in this plan. So that would be a contributor. Can you just tell us like what's driving the $2 billion of equity and when you'll need most of it is? Is it backend loaded or front unloaded?","Phil Lembo","Sure. So, Mike, let me let me just add to something that you mentioned or clarify a few things. The capital program of $13 billion and the construction of 830 megawatts is included over the next five years not just that initial payment that you referenced to the partnership in \u00d8rsted. So it's the construction of the 830 megawatts where the turbines and our CapEx program. So as I said, we will be opportunistic and assess what our needs are over that time period. No rush to need to do anything, but we'll take our time to look at what our construction program looks like over that time period and make some determination over the course of that period.","So I wouldn't say that any of it is front end or backend loaded. I just say we'd be opportunistic of how we're going to approach it going forward.","Mike Weinstein","Is -- how much of it is driven by the fact that you are becoming a cash taxpayer again and because I mean just a few years ago we were talking about the possibility of stock buybacks right. So this is the flip of that. I'm just wondering what's the driver of the $2 billion.","Phil Lembo","Yes. Mike, we better tax cash payer actually, we are tax and cash payer this year and we expect to be a tax cash payer next year. We had about $160 million of cash taxes in 2018 and will probably be in the 130 to 150 range in 2019 in terms of cash payment. And just to clarify in terms of, we had not really discussed share buyback I know but we got the question a lot, but I've always and we've always said that our focus is on investing in the infrastructure of business. ","And we didn't see that we would be in that mode of buying shares back that we would be continuing to invest in the business. And as I said, we've had a significant capital program over many years and have the next five years as even larger as I described going forward. ","Jim Judge","Mike, this is Jim. Just to add to a point that Phil made earlier in his comments. I think it's important to recognize that we're guiding towards 6% the midpoint of the range through 2023 and in the process we're not only funding the core business CapEx, but we're funding the build-out of the offshore wind as well, with virtually no earnings contribution from that business until 2024 when revolution wind comes online. So we're basically guiding to 6% even with the drag associated with the offshore wind investment.","Mike Weinstein","Got you, and that offshore wind investment is just -- just the \u00d8rsted for now just a 50% investment for now, right?","Jim Judge","That is our partnership with \u00d8rsted 50% on day one.","Operator","Jeffrey Kotkin","Next question is from Insoo Kim from Goldman Sachs. Good morning, Insoo.","Insoo Kim","Good morning. Maybe to ask the timing of the equity in a different way. So I think you have mentioned in the past that you wanted to keep the current Moody's credit rating intact. Do you have any sense of does that imply target FFO debt of, let's say 14% to 15%? And, if so, what time period do you look to I guess achieve or at least maintain that level?","Phil Lembo","Well, certainly we like where our Moody's credit rating is as you're right that we were target to maintain that credit rating. And you are also right that would indicate FFO to debt at those levels which --so that would imply we would be targeting that to maintain those rating. So there's really no change there, and I think that as we get into our kind of our spring forecast period with the rating agencies will, we obviously have discussed any press release that comes out and will provide an updated forecast as we go forward.","Insoo Kim","Understood and then regarding the 5% to 7 % EPS CAGR through this time period. Do you expect it to be a little bit lumpy given a lot of the regulated, the bulk of the increase of the regulate investments are in the next three years and then you have a lot of the wind construction financing without the earnings benefit coming in the latter half of that period. I just --I'm just trying to gauge whether they're --it's more of stable or whether we could expect some lumpiness?","Phil Lembo","I say it's more stable. Yes, I mean certainly any particular quarter could have particular things in it, but I'd say you should expect us to be in a stable growth environment.","Insoo Kim","Understood and just one more if I could What's the total potential opportunity set for AMI at least over this five-year period that could add to the rate base growth?","Phil Lembo","Well, in our --when you look at it, I'll say for us nothing has been approved, right. So if you did a full rollout in Connecticut and Massachusetts you might be at a $1 billion or for full rollout everywhere for AMI it should proceed what the program like that it would be over multiple years to get that installed. So that's the sizing that you should be thinking about there.","Operator","Jeffrey Kotkin","Great, thanks Insoo. Next question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America. Good morning, Julien.","Julien Dumoulin Smith","Hey, good morning, team. Thank you. Perhaps just to kick off on the offshore side if I can you. Elaborate a little bit on how you think about the size of the equity check now? I mean I know you've put down something of a down payment here with 225. I know that you are targeting regulated like returns on this investment, but what is the equity check that you're going to need just the kind of backdoor if you will into the 2024-ish earnings profile that we're talking about here?","Jim Judge","Yes. Julien, this is Jim. I don't know you mentioned regulated returns, \u00d8rsted is identified high single digit IRS as an appropriate return target, and importantly is the limit on that so that translates more to mid-teens ROE for us. We would expect offshore wind to be our highest earning business segment. ","Julien Dumoulin Smith","I'm sorry, okay, to run and reconcile with that mid-teens on what kind of equity check? And should we include the 225 that you've paid as part of that equity as part of the denominator in that ROE?","Phil Lembo","Yes. I mean certainly the 225 is part of the total cost of the project. There will be construction costs that go in there but you can imagine that given the competitive nature of this business that discussing specific construction costs or other assumptions would be sort of I think letting a little bit too much out of the bag in terms of competitors. So I say we'll try to be transparent. I think you probably have an assessment of your own as to what a megawatt cost to build or something like that, but the 225 is part I'm just getting started and there'll be construction cost that get added to that as we go forward.","Julien Dumoulin Smith","Sorry maybe this might be a little more power way to ask it. What about like equity contribution is like a percentage of the capitalization. I know you have ITC's and the capitalization but it's we taking 50:50, 30:70, kind of high conceptually?","Jim Judge","Yes, Julien, I'll try it another way that we're not going to sort of disclose the financing construct of our bids, but we are saying that the dramatic increase in our core business CapEx, coupled with the cost estimates that we have to build out the offshore win suggest that we want to do about a $2 billion equity issue through this five year window to continue to maintain the track record that we have, and that track record is one that's worth noting in terms of credibility and consistency.","I mean if you look at the slide 5, we have had a remarkable run whether you look at one, three, five, 10 year performance of outperforming the index and outperforming the S&P 500. And I go back, if you looked at twenty years I was CFO of NSTAR 20 years ago. I think the results; the performance results are even more dramatic. So this consistency and a believe credibility given the track record. And while the financial performance has been top tier here, for the majority of that window of time we're also in top tier in terms of financial conditions.","So we've put together a financing plan here that is going to allow us to again be a top tier finishing performer at the same time of having the top tier credit rating. So the finance --the financing are fungible right in terms of we have cash needs whether it's core business or whether it's offshore wind. And what size here I think is one that's going to allow us to continue a wonderful track record that we've had. And we've got commitment and conviction to deliver on that 5% to 7% of earnings growth and dividend growth that we've had going for so many years. ","Julien Dumoulin Smith","If I can just jump in real quickly on the 5% to 7%, obviously, there's --you are rebasing after 325. How are you thinking about the sort of the shape of that to get to the midpoint? I mean you just raise CapEx, the same time raising equity, seems like it's about a nickel decline versus the prior baseline for 2021 but I'm sort of curious as you see this out play out through 2023. Are you still saying it is midpoint of that 5% to 7% versus the prior baseline?","Jim Judge","Yes. We are. Absolutely and again just in terms of the rebase lining comment. I mean traditionally our track record has been set each year we would move into the new year and then add another year and this year we're adding two more years into that. So it's very traditional as to how we've addressed giving you the long-term guidance but certainly conviction in a stable way with being in the middle of that range is clearly what we're confident and delivering.","Jeffrey Kotkin","Thank you, Julien. Next question is from Stephen Byrd from Morgan Stanley. Good morning, Stephen. ","Stephen Byrd ","Good morning. I wanted to talk about offshore wind as well and just conceptually with your partnership with the \u00d8rsted, obviously, \u00d8rsted is a very accomplished offshore wind developer. At a high level how have you all determine the allocation of risk? Is it sort of essentially a true partnership where all risks are shared equally between the partners or there --is there a bit of a different delineation in terms of responsibility and risk between the two partners?","Jim Judge","It's a shared risk 50:50. We collaborate on various benches into the RFP. The basis for the returns that we expect promote bids. So it's a true 50:50 partnership from a risk perspective.","Stephen Byrd ","Understood. And then when I think about the permitting process. I'm just not familiar with everything that would be involved or sort of other approval elements, and just thinking through permitting risk and other risks here. At a high level again, don't need to go through every permit, but how do you think about execution risk for these projects. You obviously have PPAs in place which is a huge element here, but how do we think about the potential risks of execution here?","Jim Judge","That's about 24 -months permitting and citing calendar and site assessment work that has to go on. And then the US O&M is a key agency and then you get state and local permitting as well. Construction then is another 24 months, so right now where we are in the cycle is we expect South Fork site to be finished by the end of 2022 on that calendar. And the Revolution wind which is the larger one, 700 megawatts of PPAs to be done by the end of 2023.","Stephen Byrd ","Okay, understood and then just one last question just on Northern Pass. You highlighted on a slide which is really helpful all the permits and I guess the two next steps that I'm thinking about are the New Hampshire Supreme Court review and the Army Corps of Engineers process. Would you mind just talking a little bit further about next steps there and sort of how we think about those two pending processes?","Phil Lembo","Sure. So the process has kicked off at the New Hampshire Supreme Court. They agreed to hear our case, received briefs on the case. So we expect that oral arguments would soon be determined in New Hampshire probably in the May timeframe and then there really is no precise deadline or timeframe that's required for the court to decide, but we would expect some decision to be in by the end of the year type of thing. So the Army Corps permit is really --there's been a preliminary assessment of that and really at this stage once all of the other approvals are made, we don't see any issue in moving through that Army Corps permitting process.","Jeffrey Kotkin","Thanks Stephen. Next question is from Praful Mehta of Citi. Good morning, Praful. ","Praful Mehta","Good morning, guys. How are you doing? Great, so sorry but I'm going to dig into a little bit of the offshore wind again. And I think the question from my side is more conceptual as in you really on this call gone headlong into offshore wind, right. Did the focus on offshore wind is increase significantly, obviously, the partnership with \u00d8rsted and I think the skeptics still there are plenty of skeptics on offshore wind more around the concerns on execution risk.","Clearly, it's been done in Europe but the risks around large projects execution approvals still seems to be pretty high among investors in the US. How would you -- how did you get comfortable with that risk? And do you believe that there would be --that this would be executed on time on budget? Or do you see any big risk that allowed that you worry about?","Jim Judge","Yes. I think it's a good question. I do think it's important to note that, well; there was a lot of discussion of the offshore wind. What's particularly notable is that the dramatic increase in our core business CapEx for the three years in particular is about 25% increase for the next three years. And that's driving a lot of our growth prospects along with the rate platforms that we have in place. \u00d8rsted has a long track record in many countries of going through the sighting process of delivering on projects and actually coming in under budget and on schedule.","I understand that it's a new process here in the US. The sense that we get is that policymakers in particularly in the states in New England. I have a very strong appetite for more offshore wind. We've been through some of the site assessment plan already in 2017 has been actually completed already. So we're basically right where we thought would be from a sighting and permitting perspective. And I think there's a lot of excitement around the demand and the interest in offshore wind. We're making commitments in the various states in terms of economic development et cetera.","So I have reason to believe that the spending that we have in the plan of 2022 and 2023 is likely to take place as we go through the permitting process and begin construction. ","Phil Lembo","I just add a couple things to that another as more information that you have and the more certainty you have going into the process certainly reduces the risk exposure. And we've been at this for multiple years, three years basically to do site analysis to start the ball rolling in terms of permitting. So the lack of surprises there to somebody who maybe and it has just been a winner of a lease who has been in but really hasn't been able to do multiple years of wind and sea bed assessments and those types of things. ","So another comfort factor I'd add would be the amount of preliminary engineering and preliminary work that I has identified and move forward on a number of these items.","Praful Mehta","Got you, that's super helpful color. And just in terms of returns, clearly the return sounds pretty good based on the current views of the --and the forecast. Is there in your assessment, given you've done so much analysis on it, where are the big levers that could drive returns downwards or upwards? Is it just construction or the other factors that we should be thinking about as well?","Phil Lembo","Well, certainly construction is a big element in terms of --and as Jim mentioned, our track record and for our projects being completed on time and on schedule. And four sets track record for completing projects on time and on schedule are pretty high up on the list. So construction cost could be one of them. ","Jim Judge","It could, but we have a fair degree of conflict, did a lot of due diligence with our board in terms of entering into this deepwater transaction. And I think what's important to recognize is that now with \u00d8rsted, we have the one and two closest leases to the mainland that means that the construction costs, the water depth are appealing in terms of a build out. We were worth --it's worth noting that the \u00d8rsted lease that we entered into in 2016 cost was $600,000 and again it's -- at least it's very close to shore. Leases that are owned another 20 or 25 miles in deeper water move up transmission costs just sold a couple of weeks ago for one $135 million a piece.","So I think that's a pretty good indication that there's a lot of value here. That this robust interest in offshore wind build-out and we have some significant advantages in cost and construction because of the locations of our two appealing leases.","Jeffrey Kotkin","Thank you, Praful. Next question is from Antoine Armand from Bank of America. Good morning. Antoine.","Unidentified Analyst ","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to get a quick sense of new debt financing needs this year beyond the maturities. ","Phil Lembo","Typically, we don't give a precise schedule of our debt financing needs throughout the course of the year or the exact timing of it. But I do expect that for the maturities that we have we have $800 million of maturities that we would be financing, refinancing those and depending on levels of short-term debt, we could be doing issuances that are incrementally higher than that. So most of those would be at the various operating entities who have needs because they have their own construction programs and they finance their construction with internal funds plus debt financing.","So $800 million is what the maturities are, and I would expect we will probably do something above that to keep our short-term debt levels down.","Unidentified Analyst ","Got it and then over the five-year period. So you have of [1275] of CapEx. You have this $2 billion of equity $500 million combined of treasury shares. And then I mean cash from ops so you probably doing at least $2 billion a year. So if you have added these all up you have very limited incremental debt issuance over the period. Is that a right way to think about this?","Phil Lembo","Yes and then we have as we've mentioned a few times that we are additive to that $13 billion capital plan is the build-out of the offshore wind that I didn't here in that list of items. ","Operator","Jeffrey Kotkin","Thank you, Antoine. Next a question is from Angie Storozynski from Macquarie. Good morning, Angie.","Angie Storozynski","Good morning. No questions about offshore winds for change, but a different angle. So would you be interested in an expanding your T&D businesses in New England? If there were to be a federal asset sales in New England?","Jim Judge","Hi, Angie. This is Jim. We would be obviously interested at the right price in terms of expanding our T&D's core business. We have the long, long track record of being a disciplined bidder when you look at the transactions that we've done 20 years ago company that form NSTAR was done and it's seen as hugely positive from a shareholder perspective over that 20-year period. Seven years ago now we did the deal that merged NU and NSTAR into what's now Eversource. Again, a deal that was widely recognized as being a big win for investors as well as customers.","And then we did water acquisition deal that we did last year which true to form was delivered on, it was accretive to earnings in the first year as we have indicated in the --they actually our earnings performance outperformed our budget or our expectations for that business. So whether it's T&D or the water business, we think our core platform is a successful one and we would be interested in extending, but there have been a dozens and dozens of transactions in this region that have taken place that we didn't win because again we were disciplined bitter.","So it'll all come down to the value that we can bring to the transaction. And what the asking price would be for the acquisition.","Angie Storozynski","But none of this is envisioned in or embedded in that $2 billion of equity issuances, right. This is just to finance your current CapEx plans and then you're not trying to shore up your balance sheets for a potential M&A deal?","Phil Lembo","No. It's strictly for as I mentioned its capital --the capital plans we have and the investment activities that are in the five-year horizon. ","Jeffrey Kotkin","Thanks, Angie. Next question is from Andrew Weisel from Scotia Howard Weil. Good morning, Andrew.","Andrew Weisel","Hey, good morning, everyone. That was a long time to not talk about offshore wind, kidding of course, but just one or two going back to that topic. Strategically, \u00d8rsted obviously now on to Block Island and is interested in developing offshore in the mid-Atlantic. Would you consider expanding beyond New England and New York or you're going to stick to your former corporate name of Northeast utilities?","Jim Judge","So, we will. Northeast utilities is an old name but certainly the assets that we acquired in the transaction with \u00d8rsted were the deepwater North East assets. There were other assets that were not part of the transaction. So we see our competency in this particular region as opposed to across the US. Proximity was a fact there are other leases that the \u00d8rsted bought in the process that were further down the east coast from the mid-Atlantic area.","And we didn't buy into those properties. So we at this stage, we feel that the proximity is important. These two leases are right off the coast of Massachusetts and Rhode Island coastal core operations. So that was a factor in the decision at this point.","Andrew Weisel","Okay. Then I know that you guys are very confident the construction will be on time and on schedule. My question is mechanically or procedurally what happens if you're not able to deliver on the obligations under the various PPAs? In other words how does the each state treat that potential scenario where the --did the turbines aren't spinning on time?","Leon Olivier","I think, yes, this is Lee, Andrew. The issue the PPAs has certain provisions and adapted essentially required you to post more credit letter, letter of credit but the penalties are relatively speaking to the investment are minimal if you don't meet the in-service dates.","Andrew Weisel","Okay, very good. Then just a quick one on the equity. If I heard correctly, Phil, I think you said that drip needs would come from the Treasury stock for the bulk of the $2 billion number. Should we expect block issuances as needed or it would be more like an equity forward deal?","Phil Lembo","There are many different ways of doing that whether they be block trade or roadshows or forward or so in terms of an ATM kind of program. So not really prescribing specifically the intent, but certainly all of those would be or the method, all of those methods would be evaluated and we would move forward again opportunistically and in a manner that we felt was appropriate for the time.","Andrew Weisel","Got it. And in the past few years one of the drip obligations been?","Phil Lembo","It's $90 million to $100 million, anyone.","Jeffrey Kotkin","Thank you, Andrew. Next question is from Paul Patterson from Glenrock. Good morning, Paul.","Paul Patterson","Good morning. How you doing? Just a few quick ones the ROE in New Hampshire, you guys said that you're under earning your lot. I just wondering could you tell us what it was for 2018?","Phil Lembo","We've just filed our final numbers are in the process of doing it. I say it's just shy of an 8%, it's below 8%.","Paul Patterson","Okay and then with respect to -- know that a grid mod is not in the Connecticut or New Hampshire in your forecast, but I also knows that the grid mod docket has sort of been in held in abeyance for some, I'm not clear why. Could you sort of elaborate a little bit more what might be going on there?","Jim Judge","Yes. I just commented with the new governor coming in there have been some changes. The former share of PURA has now taken a more significant job as the Commissioner of Deep. So I think it's got to do with the changes organizationally that happened with --when the new administration comes in, yes. ","Phil Lembo","And in New Hampshire it's-- they typically have a smaller staff than any of the other states. And in fact just recently they started to move forward in a more active way in terms of draft mechanism, or draft position papers that will require more, some more studies. So it's moving along and if there's no particular reason other than staffing at this stage.","Paul Patterson","And then I think after this year, you're expecting O&M to be flat. Is that tied in any way to the CapEx that you guys have been investing or just is that just the savings that you guys are doing from just what you guys have often been doing? There's a cost containing.","Phil Lembo","Well, certainly I did highlight on the call that certainly there the CapEx investment has driven improvements and high levels of reliability and safety and performance for our customers, but it also helps in terms of taking other costs out of the business. If you repair something that you don't have to go visit two or three times to repair, if you replace it you'd have some O&M savings. So certainly the O&M gets reduced as a result of it. So being flat is really a challenge because you've got inflation. You've got negotiated wage increases. So really you're taking kind of 2% to 3% of cost out of the business just to stay flat.","Paul Patterson","Okay and then just on the offshore wind. Are you guys thinking of doing perm EPCs or anything like that with respect to the execution of the actual build out or how do you guys look at that? I know you mentioned that this \u00d8rsted and what-have-you is it's got a good track record but other than that I'm just wondering anything any idea of up for EPCs or how should we think of that?","Leon Olivier","Yes, Paul, this is Lee. I think the way to think that is that \u00d8rsted brings all of the resident competencies that they need, that they just coming off building or in the process and building over 2,200 megawatts for the UK alone. And again as Jim said, all on schedule below budget and so they're very good shape for them. It's a core expertise that's what they do. So really wouldn't make any sense to bring it EPC. There are other developers that clearly will have to bring in an EPC because they just don't have that core competency.","Paul Patterson","Okay and then the capacity factor, just could you remind me what it is that you guys are expecting for wind? Offshore wind.","Leon Olivier","Capacity factors, they're on the range of 45% to 50% capacity factors on the wind, and it's higher in the winter when prices are the highest in the region including New York and so there's a great benefit in that winter period for reliability and price suppression as well.","Paul Patterson","Okay and then just finally weather adjusted sales growth for 2018, could you tell us what that was?","Phil Lembo","I didn't tell you what it was but for electric, Paul, it was and again I preface my answer by saying as a result of our great plans that we have in place 90% of our revenues all of Massachusetts, all of Connecticut are decoupled. So weather has no impact only New Hampshire is the only jurisdiction that is still, it's not decoupled but weather adjusted normalized for the year was down slightly like 0.2%.","Jeffrey Kotkin","Thank you, Paul. Next question is from Travis Miller for Morningstar. Good morning, Travis.","Travis Miller","Good morning, thank you. I'll return to the offshore wind if you don't mind. The agreement with \u00d8rsted outside of the projects in the works right now. When we are thinking about that CapEx beyond and thinking out to the big potential what type of obligation as part of that deal with \u00d8rsted and partnership with \u00d8rsted. You have an obligation there to invest if say \u00d8rsted were to make a decision to go forward?","Jim Judge","No. With any opportunity we have the right to participate or not. There's no commitment or obligation to fully build out the 4,000 megawatt. We have an option to proceed or not.","Travis Miller","Okay, on your own, based on your own economics and decision, okay. And then in terms of policy to again apart from the PPA is in place, are there any policies that need to go into effect in any of those northeastern states to promote offshore winds such that you could make it easier to go forward or are you going to be competing with other renewable sources on some of those non-identified projects?","Jim Judge","Yes. Well, there's been a mixture. This clearly been actual offshore wind specific RFPs, the state of Massachusetts was the first to legislate it 1,600 megawatts need to be bid and it's specific to offshore wind. If it completed 800 of that with the first solicitation, we expect the next one to occur the first half of 2019 here. Additional legit legislation in Massachusetts has asked the Department of Energy resources to take a look at doubling that number to go to 3,200 megawatts.","The state of New York has legislated 2,400 megawatts that they're going to do through multiple solicitations. Connecticut and Rhode Island have been active as well. In New York, the governor has actually suggested that he thinks that they should go to 9,000 megawatts although only 2,400 has been legislated to date. So the policy is in the form of offshore wind solicitations. One of the Connecticut solicitations that took place last year had offshore wind among other clean energy resources.","And in that instance revolution wind project won an additional 100 megawatts, but there were also solar and nuclear commitments in that process as well. So the majority are offshore wind specific but there was some clean energy RFPs that would invite all fuel sources. ","A- Lee","Now we just mentioned Jim that in Connecticut the governor has filed a bill yesterday a Senate bill that would add additional 1,000 megawatts offshore wind. So that's firming up as well.","Travis Miller","Okay, great, now is1, 000 megawatts up a pure offshore wind.","A- Lee","Yes, Pure offshore wind.","Operator","Thanks Travis. Next question is from Andy levy from Exodus Point. Good morning, Andy.","Andy levy","Hey, guys. Can you hear me? Okay and I apologize if this was answered or that has been popping around so just get back on the equity. How much of the $2 billion is allocated for the offshore wind? The spread out.","Phil Lembo","Yes. There's no specific allocation, Andy, is the direct answer. We would look at our total portfolio of construction and investment needs which we said is $13 billion over the next five years for our CapEx. And then add on to that the build out our share of the cost of the 830 megawatts of build out of the offshore wind. So looking at the total pot is where we would focus not specifically find it in that area.","Andy levy","No. No. I understand that but if you didn't have the offshore wind how much equity would you be issuing?","Phil Lembo","Well you're asking it the same way only differently.","Andy levy","Yes, you could, Phil.","Phil Lembo","As I said, the $2 billion of equity supports kind of our total CapEx and offshore wind for the next -- ","Andy levy","Okay. So let me ask you different then. What's the proper capital structure for an offshore wind project?","Phil Lembo","So that when you -- you did miss it, Andy, because we talked about cost. ","Andy levy","Okay. What's the bottom line of that?","Jim Judge","That's a competitive process, obviously, we are not going to disclose the cap structure or the capital cost.","Andy levy","But I guess your return on investment however you measure it must be based on kind of how you finance it right?","Phil Lembo","Correct.","Andy levy","Okay, that's not -- that something at some point will you share that with us?","Jim Judge","Yes. We've been saying based upon actually \u00d8rsted has disclosed an 8% unlevered IRR which is going to give us a return that we think would be a transmission like or better when you look at so the returns on equity that we would expect there.","Andy levy","Okay and that's assuming that everything goes as planned or do you have a contingency built in into that?","Jim Judge","We work with \u00d8rsted building appropriate contingency is not only in terms of spending, but in terms of schedule.","Jeffrey Kotkin","Thanks Andy. Next question is from Mike Weinstein from Credit Suisse. Good morning, Mike.","Mike Weinstein","Hey, guys. And just one quick follow-up. I just wanted to explicit --have you explicitly say that just confirm that you basically have offshore wind, additional offshore wind in the equity number, but it's not in the CapEx plan correct?","Phil Lembo","That is correct. It's not --it's not CapEx, it's equity investment.","Mike Weinstein","Right. So there's a certain amount that's -- that's why the equity might look high to some people because it's not in as part of that $12 billion to $13 billion CapEx plan?","Phil Lembo","That's exactly correct, Mike.","Mike Weinstein","Okay. But you're not saying how much?","Phil Lembo","That's correct also, yes.","Mike Weinstein","Okay. Just wanted to get that out there. Thank you.","End of Q&A","Jeffrey Kotkin","All right. Well, thank you very much for joining us today. If you have any follow-up questions, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to seeing you at the conferences in early March. Take care. ","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note this conference is being recorded.","And at this time, I will turn it over Jeff Kotkin. You may begin, sir.","Jeffrey R. Kotkin - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, Brandon. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. I'm Jeff Kotkin, Eversource Energy's Vice President for Investor Relations.","As you can see on slide one, if you've gone into our slides, which are on our website, some of the statements made during this investor call may be forward-looking as defined within the meaning of the Safe Harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risk and uncertainty, which may cause the actual results to differ materially from forecasts and projections. Some of these factors are set forth in the news release issued yesterday.","Additional information about the various factors that may cause actual results to differ can be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. Additionally, our explanation of how and why we use certain non-GAAP measures is contained within our news release and the slides we posted last night on the website under Presentations & Webcasts and in our most recent 10-K.","Turning to slide two, speaking today will be Jim Judge, who yesterday became Eversource Energy's President and CEO; and Lee Olivier, our Executive Vice President for Enterprise Energy Strategy and Business Development. Also joining us today are Werner Schweiger, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; Phil Lembo, our new Senior Vice President and CFO; Jay Buth, our Vice President and Controller; and John Moreira, our Vice President of Financial Planning and Analysis.","Now, I will turn to slide three and turn over the call to Jim.","James J. Judge - President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Jeff, and thank you all for joining us this morning. I also wanted to thank many of you on our call today for the notes you've sent me since our announcement last month of Tom's retirement. Tom's record of providing value and service to customers and investors as CEO first of Boston Edison, then NSTAR, Northeast Utilities and Eversource Energy, was unsurpassed in our industry. I was both honored and tremendously excited by being our Board's choice to succeed him.","This company has a tremendous future ahead. We continue to identify investment opportunities to enable our region to successfully implement the state and federal energy policies that continue to shape our region. We also have what I consider to be the best group of 8,000 employees in the industry and a very talented and very experienced management team. I look forward to continuing to work closely with our investors as our company continues to deliver to you attractive returns by providing the highest level of service to customers.","As Jeff mentioned, pleased to share with you that yesterday the Eversource Board of Trustees elected Phil Lembo as the company's Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. Most of you know Phil well. He's been a key contributor for us for years. So congratulations, Phil, and I'd like you to say a few words.","Philip J. Lembo - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer","Yeah. Thank you, Jim. I would echo Jim, thank you for those notes and congratulations and calls I received. So thank you very much. I know I've known a lot of you for many years going back to the investor relations days several years ago. But I'm looking forward to meeting those of you who I haven't had a chance to meet yet and working with you closely over the weeks and months ahead. I know I have some big shoes to fill and I'm excited about the opportunity. Just also want to close it and say I'll be part of the Eversource team that's at the AGA Conference down in Naples and I hope that I'll get to meet you in person at that event.","So thank you, Jim, and I'll turn it back to you.","James J. Judge - President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Phil. Today, I will cover our first quarter financial results, strong operating performance results for the quarter, an update on certain transmission projects and regulatory dockets. Starting with our financial result in slide four, we earned $244 million or $0.77 per share in the first quarter of 2016, compared with earnings of $253 million or $0.80 per share in the first quarter of 2015. Both of those are GAAP numbers since we are no longer separating our merger integration costs in reporting our results. These results represent a solid start to 2016 despite the very mild weather in the first quarter. These results also support our full year EPS estimate of $2.90 to $3.05 per share as well as our long-term earnings growth rate of 5% to 7%.","Our transmission segment earned $0.27 per share in the first quarter of 2016 compared with $0.21 per share in the first quarter last year. The first of two principle drivers of that increase was the absence of a $0.04 charge we recorded in the first quarter of 2015 after FERC issued its final decision in the first New England Transmission ROE complaint. The second factor was the earnings growth we are experiencing as a result of our continued investment in the reliability of the New England power grid. That rate case growth added $0.02 per share in the first quarter of 2016.","On the electric distribution side, we earned $0.34 per share in the first quarter this year compared with earnings of $0.41 per share in the first quarter of 2015. Three principle factors contributed to this $0.07 per share reduction in earnings. The primary driver was the absence in 2016 of about $0.09 of benefits we realized in the first quarter last year from settling several longstanding dockets at NSTAR Electric.","Milder weather in the first quarter of 2016 reduced earnings at NSTAR Electric and PSNH where distribution revenues are not fully decoupled, and that cost us about $0.02 per share. Partially offsetting those impacts were lower O&M and other items, including our second quarter 2015 accumulated deferred income tax settlement at Connecticut Light and Power. Altogether, those factors added about $0.04 per share in the first quarter.","On the natural gas distribution side, we earned $0.16 per share in the first quarter this year compared with earnings of $0.18 per share in the first quarter of 2015. Warmer weather was a principle factor with lower gas revenues costing us $0.05 per share despite a nearly $16 million annualized rate increase at NSTAR Gas. We had a very cold first quarter in 2015 and a very mild first quarter in 2016. Heating degree days in the Boston area were 21% above normal in the first quarter of 2015 when NSTAR Gas did not yet have decoupling.","In Connecticut, where Yankee Gas is not yet decoupled, heating degree days were about 10% below normal in the first quarter this year compared with 18% above normal in the first quarter of 2015. The weather impact was partially offset by lower O&M, a rate increase at NSTAR Gas and other factors that together added $0.03 per share to earnings.","Turning from our financial results to operations, our transmission investments totaled $140 million in the first quarter of 2016, and we continue to target transmission capital investments of $911 million for the full year. As you can see on slide five, we continue to move ahead on our major reliability transmission projects across the system. We are making solid progress on our two large families of reliability projects, the Greater Boston Reliability Solutions and the Greater Hartford\/Central Connecticut Solutions.","We have now invested more than $130 million in those projects with many elements now completed, under construction, or before regulators for approval. By 2019, we expect to invest $900 million in these comprehensive solutions to our region's energy \u2013 long-term reliability challenges.","The New Hampshire Site Evaluation Committee has a number of projects before it, including Northern Pass. Last month, we filed our application with the Site Evaluation Committee to build the $77 million Seacoast Reliability Project in Southeastern New Hampshire. We expect a decision on our application by mid-2017, and to complete the Seacoast project by the end of 2018.","We also continue to expand our natural gas delivery system in the first quarter. We've added about 2,500 natural gas heating customers in the first quarter, up about 20% from the 2,050 we added in the first quarter of 2015, and very consistent with our full year 2016 goal of 12,500 new heating customers.","We added a 72nd town to the Yankee Gas service territory, the town of Bozrah in Eastern Connecticut. And despite the mild winter, we did have one frigid weekend around President's Day, when both Yankee Gas and NSTAR Gas set all-time records for the amount of natural gas delivered in a single day. On February 14, NSTAR Gas delivered over 8.5% more natural gas to our customers than the previous record set back in January, 2014.","Now, I will turn to our regulatory calendar in slide six. We are awaiting a decision from the New Hampshire PUC on our comprehensive settlement with numerous state officials and other parties to divest PSNH's generating assets. To remind you, PSNH generating rate base, including under-appreciated plants, fuel and inventory, totals approximately $700 million. Any investment we have in our generation business that is not recovered through the plant sale process will be recovered through securitization. We continue to expect the entire sale and securitization process to be completed by this time next year.","Moving from New Hampshire to Washington, on March 22, the administrative law judge at FERC handling complaints number two and complaint number three involving the ROEs earned by all New England transmission owners issued his initial recommendation. For the 15-month refund period ended in March 2014, the 400-page recommendation called for a base ROE of 9.59% and a cap of 10.42%. For the 15-month period ending October 2015, the decision called for a base ROE of 10.9% and a cap of 12.19%.","Our currently allowed ROE is 10.57% and our current cap is 11.74%. So if the FERC were to adopt the ALJ recommendation, we would find ourselves under-reserved for the earlier refund period by $34 million after tax and over reserved for the later refund period by $8 million after tax. Because we cannot be certain how FERC commissioners will ultimately decide the case, we didn't book any charges this quarter due to the ALJ recommendation. We will reexamine the issue as this process moves forward. If FERC were to adopt the ALJ recommendation, we would have a one-time net charge of approximately $0.08 per share.","Going forward, however, we would earn a higher ROE of 10.9% compared with the current base of 10.57%. Parties to the case filed comments on the ALJ recommendation on April 21. We continue to expect the final FERC decision around the end of this year or early 2017. I should note that after six months of no additional complaints, a fourth complaint was filed this past Friday by Eastern Massachusetts Municipal Electric Companies. We await FERC action on this fourth complaint.","Turning to financing, Eversource parent issued $500 million of senior notes in March, $250 million of five-year notes with a coupon of 2.5%, and $250 million of 10-year notes with a coupon of 3.35%. Proceeds were used to pay down short-term debt. The issuances were several times oversubscribed, and we're very pleased with the rates we received.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Lee.","Leon J. Olivier - EVP-Enterprise Energy Strategy and Business Development","Okay. Thank you, Jim. I'll provide you with a brief update on our major investment initiatives and then turn the call back to Jeff for Q&A. Let's start with Northern Pass on slide eight. The review process for Northern Pass continues to move along according to schedule. March was an important month from the standpoint of receiving public input on our project. A total of seven public meetings were held around this date in the month, three by the New Hampshire Site Evaluation Committee, two by the U.S. Department of Energy, and two jointly between these two primary permitting agencies. The Site Evaluation Committee will hold two additional public meetings on some follow-up items, one later this month and another in June. April 4 was the deadline for the written comments on the draft environmental impact statement, and we expect a final environmental impact statement from the DOE in the fourth quarter of this year.","On the state side, the New Hampshire SEC recently established a near-term schedule through the end of June, providing for commencement of the discovery process in mid-May. The dates are similar to what we had proposed. Under the state statute, we would expect the New Hampshire SEC to hold evidentiary hearings and issue a decision before the end of the year. We are aware that some interveners have requested a more prolonged review period, and we expect a ruling soon on those requests and establishment of a firm schedule.","Assuming the final schedule is consistent with the statutory deadline, as you can see on slide nine, it would support the issuance of a presidential permit from the Department of Energy early next year and the commencement of construction shortly thereafter. We continue to see support for the project building in New Hampshire, and we were gratified by the number of favorable comments in the public meetings, particularly from the labor and business communities of New Hampshire. We believe this is a sign of growing public support for the project and the billions of dollars of benefits it will bring to New Hampshire.","As stated in our February Earnings Call, we bid both Northern Pass and the Clean Energy Connect into the three-state electric RFP. Clean Energy Connect would allow 600 megawatts of carbon-free energy to flow from New York into New England. The review process for our projects and the other approximately 20 that were bid into the process continues, and we expect the states involved in the RFP, Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island, to announce the winning bids this summer.","I will now turn to slide 10 and the Access Northeast project we plan to build with our partners Spectra Energy and National Grid. To remind you, Access Northeast is a $3 billion project to upgrade the existing Algonquin pipeline and add 6.8 billion cubic feet of LNG storage in Acushnet, Massachusetts, to bring firm natural gas supplies to power generators in New England.","Our share of Access Northeast is 40%, or $1.2 billion. The project is designed to provide 900 million cubic feet per day of additional natural gas supplies to serve the region's power generators during cold winter periods. That will allow up to 5,000 additional megawatts of the region's most efficient low-cost units to remain online when winter temperatures drop, saving New England customers approximately $1.5 billion to $2 billion in a typical winter and approximately $3 billion in an extreme winter such as the 2013 and 2014 period.","Access Northeast builds up the existing Algonquin footprint which already touches 60% of the power generation in New England, a percentage that will soon grow as nearly 2,600 megawatts of new proposed plants are built and connected to the project. Access Northeast allows direct last-mile deliveries to the power plants to ensure greater reliability and cost benefits.","Business model is that electric utilities sign long-term contracts with Access Northeast and then retain an independent capacity manager to market that capacity to generators out of market price. Without Access Northeast, those generators are frequently without fuel to run their units during cold winter weather when the region's existing pipeline capacity is used primarily to heat homes and businesses. If a large amount of new pipeline capacity is set aside to meet the fuel supply needs of natural gas generators, we can depend less on more costly and higher emitting coal and oil plants that typically operate when the region's natural gas suppliers are short. We continue to make significant progress on securing and seeking approval of contracts with New England Electric distribution companies. The current status of the state reviews is on slide 11.","You will recall the following in RFP this past fall, NSTAR Electric, Western Mass Electric, and two National Grid electric distribution companies filed with the Massachusetts DPU seeking approval of contracts for pipeline and storage capacity with Access Northeast. Our two utilities asked for a decision by October 1 of this year. The DPU has established a schedule to review that filing that would support a decision in the early fall. Evidentiary hearings on all of the contracts are scheduled for this summer. Once approved by the Department of Public Utilities, these contracts will account for more than 40% of Access Northeast targeted capacity.","In Connecticut, we expect the State Department of Energy and Environment Protection to issue request for proposals for natural gas capacity shortly. We expect this process to be complete with approved contracts late this year or early in 2017.","In New Hampshire, you may recall that the Public Utilities Commission issued an order on January 19 in which they accepted a staff report that concluded that the Public Utility Commission had sufficient authority to approve electric distribution contracts, financial gas supplies if those contracts were shown to be in customers' interests. On February 18, Public Service of New Hampshire filed with state regulators a natural gas contract with Access Northeast that was similar to what the four Massachusetts electric utilities filed in their state.","If the New Hampshire Public Utility Commissioners agree with the staff that they have sufficient authority to approve such agreements, they would then determine whether the specific contracts submitted were in the customer's best interest. A technical session on the docket scheduled was held yesterday. We are optimistic that the commissioners will agree with the staff that they have authority to approve a contract with Public Service of New Hampshire and Access Northeast. The PUC's consideration of whether the contracts provide benefits to customers would follow its legal ruling on the issues.","In Maine, where regulators have been engaged in natural gas contracting issue for some time, state regulators are scheduled to reach a decision on recommended solutions by the early fall. In Rhode Island, National Grid issued in RFPs in the fall with bids received November 13, around the same time as the Massachusetts electric distribution companies had their RFP. We expect the National Grid to make a decision and file with Rhode Island regulators by early this summer.","In Vermont, the state has expressed support for additional natural gas infrastructure, but its level of participation is yet to be determined. We expect that the state processes will be sufficiently advanced by the end of this year so that we can promptly file a formal application with FERC and bring additional natural gas supplies into New England for the winter 2018 to 2019. We continue to believe that Access Northeast offers an excellent near-term and long-term answer to the region's intensifying winter energy challenges.","And now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Jeff for any Q&As.","Jeffrey R. Kotkin - Vice President-Investor Relations","All right. And I'm going to turn it back to Brandon just to remind you how to answer questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir.","Jeffrey R. Kotkin - Vice President-Investor Relations","All right. Thank you. Our first question this morning is from Mike Weinstein from UBS. Good morning, Mike.","Michael Weinstein - UBS Securities LLC","Hey. Good morning. I was just wondering if we could talk about the \u2013 whether the current status of the RFPs and expected approvals for gas contracts support beginning construction in 2017 for getting major sessions with the pipe online for the winter of 2018 and 2019, generally speaking broadly.","Leon J. Olivier - EVP-Enterprise Energy Strategy and Business Development","Yeah, Mike. This is Lee Olivier. The construction period would start for the project in 2018, will start in early 2018, approximately the April-May timeframe and then the first sections would go in on the piping for the winter of 2018. So you're talking about the November timeframe of 2018. I would say right now we're still on schedule. We will be prepared to file the comprehensive filing at FERC in the November-December timeframe. We believe the timing in and around the other states, including Connecticut, even though Connecticut is built inside of their process, they have 90 days to negotiate precedent agreements with the EDCs, we think that could be done in approximately 30 days or 35 days. Their approval process through their regulatory body PURA is a very short term, it's about 60 days. So we think all of these schedules line up right now for conclusion by the end of this year and filing with FERC and start with construction in the spring of 2018 for the first phase of the pipeline.","Michael Weinstein - UBS Securities LLC","Are you seeing more support for the project, just broadly speaking, as a result of the cancellation of Northeast Energy Direct?","Leon J. Olivier - EVP-Enterprise Energy Strategy and Business Development","I would say, although, the two projects were designed somewhat differently, we were designed to supply gas to generators to firm up 5,000 megawatts and they \u2013 ostensibly the (24:55) all around providing LDC power supplies. I think the fact that they're not going to be there obviously puts more pressure on the overall gas supplies of the region. So I believe that there is more support firming up around Access Northeast, both in the business community and with policymakers as well.","Michael Weinstein - UBS Securities LLC","And just one last one. Can you give us an update on Massachusetts legislation and work for renewables in the state, how that might impact things like the Clean Energy Connect project, things like that?","James J. Judge - President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure, Mike. This is Jim. We had solar legislation that was approved in Massachusetts that increases that needling cap and actually extends the opportunity for utilities to consider a utility-owned solar. There is also proposed legislation that the governor is endorsing which recommends hydroelectric commitments as well as offshore wind is being discussed as well. Those are only in draft form of proposed, it's only until the solar legislation is passed today.","Michael Weinstein - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Jeffrey R. Kotkin - Vice President-Investor Relations","All right.","James J. Judge - President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Jeffrey R. Kotkin - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Mike. Our next question this morning is from Travis Miller from Morningstar. Good morning, Travis.","Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Good morning. Thanks. I was wondering just on the demand, so electric demand in particular. How much of that was weather do you estimate? I know it's tough to do.","James J. Judge - President & Chief Executive Officer","Travis, it's a tough question because you have such an extreme change from one year to the next, a very, very cold winter in the first quarter, a very mild winter this quarter resulting in a sales decline in the electric side of 8.5%. I would say that virtually all of that is weather-driven. I think without the \u2013 if we had had normal weather, I think the sales would have been close to flat, is my estimate.","Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Correct. Is that \u2013 remind me what your outlook is for this year in terms of electric sales growth.","James J. Judge - President & Chief Executive Officer","Flat is the estimate that we provided.","Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Okay. And is that \u2013 if we look out, call it five years or something, what kind of trends are you seeing in terms of what would keep electric demand flat or 0.5%, something well below what we've seen historically? Are there particular specific trends and programs perhaps that you would see depressing that type of demand?","James J. Judge - President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. We're estimating the long-term growth rate on the electric side to be flat as well. As you know, we are decoupled in a number of our franchises. And as we have future rate cases, we'll be decoupled everywhere, I expect. But we are forecasting flat on the electric side, but because of the gas conversions going on, we think there'll be 2% to 3% growth in gas sales annually. And really I think the primary driver to that flat growth has got nothing to do with the economy, in particular in the Boston area the economy is moving. There's lots of construction going on. But we as a company spend $500 million a year, $0.5 billion a year on energy efficiency, and I think that has a significant impact \u2013 2% impact on the sales results for the company.","Now, fortunately, the rate-making mechanism for energy efficiency spending makes us whole, either decoupling our loss-based revenues reimburse us. If we actually do a good job on the projects, we're able to earn an incentive. And at the same time, we're recovering our costs as we incur them each year. So the cash flow is positive as well. So, yeah, were it not for energy efficiency, I think we'd be looking at 2% or higher sales volume growth.","Travis Miller - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Okay, great. I appreciate the thoughts. Thanks.","Jeffrey R. Kotkin - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, Travis. Our next question is from Caroline Bone from Deutsche Bank. Good morning, Caroline.","Caroline V. Bone - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, and first of all congratulations, Jim and Phil. That's wonderful news.","James J. Judge - President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you very much.","Philip J. Lembo - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer","Thank you.","Caroline V. Bone - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","You're welcome. So I just have one question. Last call, I believe you guys discussed the possibility of share buybacks. And I was just wondering if you could kind of review with us the circumstances in which we might see such a program?","James J. Judge - President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. We have a lot of positive cash flow items, right? Our fundamental business is strong to begin with. We've got bonus depreciation that's been extended. We have $700 million of cash coming in the door next year from the divestiture and securitization. And what we have said in the past is that to the extent that we can't find additional projects to pursue, to redeploy that cash, ultimately it's shareholders' monies and so obviously we would pay off some debt as well. But we would consider a share buyback if there wasn't a better use of the proceeds. That being said, I wouldn't expect any announcement this year. I mean, we are certainly executing to our plan for 2016. As we reaffirm guidance today, we continue to believe that we're going to be able to achieve those results and those results for 2016 do not assume a buyback is in place.","Caroline V.

My name is Palette, and I will be your operator for today\u2019s call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Jeff Kotkin from Eversource Energy. You may begin.","Jeff Kotkin","Thank you, Palette. Good morning and thank you for joining us. I am Jeff Kotkin, Eversource Energy\u2019s Vice President for Investor Relations. During this call, we will be referencing slides that we, excuse me, posted last night on our website.","And as you can see on slide one, some of the statements made during this investor call may be forward-looking as defined within the meaning of the Safe Harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.","These forward-looking statements are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to risk and uncertainty, which may cause the actual results to differ materially from forecasts and projections. These factors are set forth in the news release issued yesterday. Additional information about the various factors that may cause actual results to differ can be found in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.","Additionally, our explanation of how and why we use certain non-GAAP measures is contained within our news release and the slides we posted last night and in our most recent 10-K.","Speaking today will be Phil Lembo, our Executive Vice President and CFO. Also joining us today are John Moreira, our Treasurer and Senior VP for Finance and Regulatory; and Jay Buth, our VP and Controller.","Now I will turn to slide two and turn over the call to Phil.","Phil Lembo","Thank you, Jeff. Today I will cover our first quarter 2019 financial results, an update on key regulatory dockets and recent developments concerning our offshore wind partnership with Orsted.","Starting with the quarter in slide two, we had a very strong start to the year, earning $0.97 per share, compared with earnings of $0.85 in the first quarter of 2018. Earnings improved in each of our three largest business segments, Electric Transmission, Electric Distribution and Natural Gas Distribution.","Transmission earnings were $0.37 per share in the first quarter of 2019, compared with $0.34 last year. The improvement is due to the increased level of investment in our transmission facilities. In the first quarter of 2019 core utility transmission capital expenditures totaled $199 million and we continue to forecast core utility transmission investments of nearly $1 billion for the full year.","Our Electric Distribution segment earned $0.38 per share in the first quarter of \u201819, compared to $0.33 last year. Most of that increase is attributable to the outcome of the recent Connecticut Light & Power rate case and lower O&M costs at NSTAR Electric.","In addition to the base rate increase, CL&P was allowed to make increased levels of investment to make our system more resilient and to recover related costs through trackers. Those benefits were slightly offset by the absence of $4.3 million at PSNH related to generation earnings in 2019. As you know we divested these units in 2018.","Our Natural Gas segment earned $0.24 per share in the first quarter of \u201819, compared with earnings of $0.18 in the first quarter of 2018. The increase was primarily related to the outcome of the Yankee Gas rate case settlement that we achieved last year and the implementation of revenue decoupling at Yankee Gas.","It\u2019s important to note that under decoupling, we recognized higher revenues during peak usage periods like the first quarter of 2019 and we will have lower monthly revenue targets in the lower use periods like the second and third quarters of the year.","Aside from the implementation of decoupling, our Natural Gas segment benefited from tract investments related to our expanding program to replace cast iron in unprotected steel pipe. We continue to expect those investments to total approximately $160 million across both Massachusetts and Connecticut in 2019, and this is up from $117 million last year.","While segment results were consistent with last year and our expectations for 2019, our Parent and Other segment lost $7 million in the first quarter of \u201819, compared to a loss of only $1.4 million in the first quarter of 2018. This was due primarily to higher interest expense, the results of -- resulting from higher short-term rates and the refinancing of some long-term debt at higher interest rates.","I should add that you may have noticed on our income statement that our effective tax rate for the quarter was 21%, compared to the 23% to 24% rate we had forecast for the year. The difference is related to how we accounted for the returning to customers of excess deferred income tax collections and it\u2019s likely to remain at that level for years, assuming corporate tax rates are unchanged. You should not expect that the lower effective tax rate will have any improvement on our net income.","Moving on to -- from earnings discussion to key operating performance results, our continued intense focus on safety continues to show strong results. Our record is among the best in the industry to-date with our safety rate, commonly known as DART is less than 0.7.","Our Electric reliability continues to trend very strong with months between interruptions at nearly 18 months. We are nearly perfect in our goal of responding to natural gas emergencies within target timeframes. We are also doing better than our own targets in terms of diversity and our internal sustainability targets.","Turning to recent regulatory activity, you would probably recalled that three of our largest distribution jurisdictions have recently implemented multiyear rate plans that provide us with significant visibility for those distribution businesses for many years into the future.","As you can see on slide three, last week we filed a request to implement temporary rate increase at Public Service of New Hampshire. The base electric distribution rates would total $33 million effective July 1st. Later this month we expect to file a request to increase permanent rates on July 1, 2020 by an additional $37 million, above the temporary rates.","Public Service of New Hampshire last sought an increase in base rates approximately a decade ago and since then our operating costs have remained essentially flat over those 10 years, while our reliability has improved about 40% and is now in the upper tier among medium-sized electric utilities in the East.","Improved service has been driven by more than $1 billion of investments over the past decade, while keeping operating and maintenance expense flat since our last distribution adjustment. It\u2019s truly been a great result for New Hampshire customers.","From electricity, I will move to water. On April 22nd, the town of Hingham, Massachusetts voted to purchase the assets of Aquarion Water Company that served the town of Hingham and the neighboring towns of Hull and North Cohasset.","The purchase price is expected to be more than $100 million. The Hingham system represents the largest part of Aquarion Massachusetts assets, but only about 5% of Aquarion\u2019s total plant. About 90% of Aquarion\u2019s operations are in Connecticut.","While we are disappointed with the outcome of the vote, we were aware that this effort by Hingham was underway when we successfully acquired Aquarion. We continue to see additional growth opportunities for the water business in the future.","The town has indicated that it hopes to close the transaction before year end. We will continue to work with the town for an orderly transition. As part of the process, we will determine the final purchase price and the use of proceeds, but we are confident that the sale will not result in any loss for Aquarion.","Turning to financing, CL&P issued $300 million of bonds maturing in 2048, at an all-in rate of 3.85%, proceeds were used in large part to pay off a $250 million, 5.5% coupon maturity in February.","In terms of equity, I noted in our year end call that we expect to issue approximately $100 million of treasury shares annually for the next five years, through our dividend, reinvestment, employee stock purchase and 401k match plans. Through April, we have issued about 575,000 shares through those plans this year, again that\u2019s four months through April.","We also noted that on our call, we plan to issue an additional $2 billion of equity through 2023 to fund our nearly $13 billion core regulated business capital program and our existing offshore wind partnership with Orsted. This new equity is incorporated in our expected 5% to 7% EPS growth rate. As I said in February, we expect to be opportunistic about the equity issuances -- issuance over the forecast period.","Slide four provides you with an update on where we stand with our contracting for offshore wind in New England and New York. As you can see, Massachusetts is required by statute to issue more -- a new RFP for 400 megawatts to 800 megawatts by midyear. The Department of Public Utilities is also evaluating whether to double that initial authorized 1,600 megawatt offshore wind procurement to a total of 3,200 megawatts.","In Connecticut, PURA last year approved a 200-megawatt contract with Revolution Wind and we expect an additional 100-megawatt contract to be filed in the second quarter. Additionally in Connecticut, the legislature is considering proposals to add another 1,000 megawatts to 2,000 megawatts of offshore wind RFPs. The session ends in Connecticut in early June.","In Rhode Island, the PUC approval process is underway for 400-megawatt contract between Revolution Wind and the local Rhode Island distribution company. We expect a decision on the contract in June.","In New York, bids were submitted February 14th into a New York RFP for at least 800 megawatts of offshore wind and we continue to await the results of that.","We continue to be very positive about offshore wind, zero carbon and the economic development benefits that all of these projects will bring to our region. We also expect the projects contracted thus far to provide a very significant source of earnings and cash flow growth, as the offshore wind turbines enter service in late 2022 and 2023. When these units enter service we expect our earnings growth rate of 5% to 7% to move appreciably higher as a result.","Now I will turn the call back to Jeff for Q&A.","Jeff Kotkin","Thank you, Phil. And I am going to turn it back to Palette just to remind you how to enter the queue for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]","Jeff Kotkin","Thank you, Palette. Our first question this morning is from Mike Weinstein from Credit Suisse. Good morning, Mike.","Mike Weinstein","Hey. Good morning. Hey. On the water deals, are there any other municipalities that are in the same boat that are considering a purchase of their systems?","Phil Lembo","No. They are not. In fact the -- there was a special provision in the late 1800s, when Hingham was first sold to the utility at that time. So there are no other similar provisions in other cities.","Mike Weinstein","And I am sorry if I missed it, did you say how much, like, what kind of ballpark proceeds you expect to get and were you intend to use those proceed?","Phil Lembo","Yeah. I did. I did. With the final price tag has to be determined to account for capital additions since certain time periods, but we expect it to be more than $100 million.","Mike Weinstein","Is that something that could potentially reduce equity needs or is that something you already contemplated in your plan?","Phil Lembo","Well, the vote just happened in April. So it\u2019s certainly something that we would factor into our ongoing needs in the future.","Mike Weinstein","Right. So it\u2019s not, I mean, it doesn\u2019t affect the $2.5 billion expectation of equity?","Phil Lembo","It\u2019s a small amount. It\u2019s $100 million. Certainly, it\u2019s a positive benefit to our cash position.","Mike Weinstein","Got you. Okay. Also can you comment at all on, I guess, the -- how offshore wind proposals are coming along, especially in New York at this point, I think, New York is supposed to be announced soon, is that your expectation?","Phil Lembo","Yeah. That is our expectation that -- as we have stated, announcements should be soon, that\u2019s our expectation.","Mike Weinstein","Is it going to be within a couple of weeks, have they indicated at all when they will come up with an announcement?","Phil Lembo","I think they are on a schedule that fits sort of their internal needs and requirements. I do think that the decision will be coming in the near-term, but I don\u2019t have a specific date for you, Mike.","Mike Weinstein","Also as -- my last question is part of the -- what part of the equity plan that you have is specifically for offshore wind. I understand the majority of it is for the core capital plan, but how much of that $2.5 billion of equity is needed for offshore wind specifically?","Phil Lembo","I think as we stated in our previous call when we announced it for the year end call that it really our capital plan the $13 billion investment in the offshore wind is all part of our total investment plan and we have not specifically allocated a certain amount of equity need to each of those specific areas, but it\u2019s really a total need that Eversource has to execute on the plans going forward.","And I will just want to reiterate too that, as I said before, we expect to grow the earnings -- with this additional equity need already included in that, we expect to grow the earnings of the Company long term 5% to 7% and somewhere in the middle of that range. So, but the specific allocation to each bucket we have not determined.","Mike Weinstein","Okay. All right. Thanks a lot.","Phil Lembo","Thanks, Mike.","Jeff Kotkin","Thanks, Mike. Next question is from Insoo Kim of Goldman Sachs. Good morning, Insoo.","Insoo Kim","Good morning. Just one question on the potential regulated investments not in the base plan like the grid mod in Connecticut and potential gas safety spend that may come out in Massachusetts. Any updated thoughts on timing and scale of those?","Phil Lembo","Good morning, Insoo. There really isn\u2019t any definitive update in terms of timing. I will say that one of the areas that we talked about was grid mod spending in Connecticut and just recently a new PURA Chair Marissa Gillett was took her seat as the Chair of that commission. So we would expect sort of the procedure there on grid mod to start moving forward. I don\u2019t have a specific date for it, but that is a new point of information since our last call.","Other than that there really isn\u2019t a specific timeframe. We will file our updated plan for three-year plan in Massachusetts next year and the New Hampshire proceeding is sort of underway, but no specific timeframe there. So other than the new PURA Chair, which should move things along we think in Connecticut, there really is no new dates.","Insoo Kim","Understood. That\u2019s all I had. Thank you.","Phil Lembo","All right.","Jeff Kotkin","Thanks, Insoo. Our next question is from Caroline Bone from Deutsche Bank. Good morning, Caroline.","Caroline Bone","Hey. Good morning, guys. I was just curious and apologies if I missed this, I was just a couple of minutes late dialing in. But could you kind of quantify how much the implementation of decoupling in Connecticut added to the Q1 results. I mean I guess you had $0.05 up from natural gas revenues and I was just curious how much of that was the decoupling implementation?","Phil Lembo","Yeah. So you didn\u2019t miss it. I did indicate that the decoupling mechanism really provides the way it\u2019s implemented sort of a more of an uplift in the periods where there is high usage and high demand. So that would be like the first quarter and lower revenues in the second quarter and third quarter where there are lower usage for gas in a system.","Caroline Bone","Okay.","Phil Lembo","I would estimate that that\u2019s probably $0.03 to $0.04 in the first quarter that\u2026","Caroline Bone","Okay.","Phil Lembo","\u2026 wouldn\u2019t have been -- could have been considered in other quarters before the implementation.","Caroline Bone","Got it. That\u2019s very helpful. All right. And then the other thing I was just kind of noticing that you guys have a lot of short-term debt outstanding or at least you did at the end of Q1. How much of your capacity have you guys used up?","Phil Lembo","We generally try to keep our outstandings about half of what we have capability for. We do have a number of financings planned for the rest of the year. So I would -- there are ebbs and flows Caroline. We don\u2019t -- we try not to be in the market all the time. But build up a certain critical mass and see if there is a maturity that we can then do that along with terming out some short-terms. So I would expect that from time-to-time the levels move up, sometimes it\u2019s less, but usually we are at about 50% of our capacity.","Caroline Bone","Okay. And so you would -- so that might -- that balance might come down a little bit, but you kind of feel comfortable with where it is?","Phil Lembo","Yeah. I would expect it to come down.","Caroline Bone","Okay. All right. That\u2019s it for me. Thank you.","Phil Lembo","Thanks, Caroline.","Jeff Kotkin","Thanks, Caroline. Next question is from Shah Pourreza from Guggenheim. Good morning, Shah.","Shah Pourreza","Hey, guys. Just real quick on Mike\u2019s question on the equity, obviously, you guys are going to be opportunistic. But are you sort of more prone to layer in the equities as the wind spending starts to really ramp up in the 2020, \u201821 timeframe, I mean, obviously the allocation is going to be different and you have your internal plans to finance some of your base business, but just from -- as we are thinking about the ramp up of the wind spending and the allocation of that equity.","Phil Lembo","I think our proposal is consistent with what we talked about last time, which is that we will be opportunistic over the five-year period and things we would look at are what the cash needs are, what the market conditions are, et cetera. So not being specific as to what specific timeframe that will happen over, but those are some of the considerations we would use, the cash needs, the market conditions and that type of things.","Shah Pourreza","Okay. Got it. And then just, Phil, could you just repeat what you alluded or what you kind of highlighted around your growth rate as the wind spending starts to really kick in and they go in service?","Phil Lembo","Yeah. What I said was that once these units, we have units that come on -- come online in 2022 and 2023. And we are very positive about the contribution that can make and when they enter service we expect the earnings growth rate of 5% to 7% and to move up appreciably higher as a result.","Shah Pourreza","Okay. So not within the band but incremental to the 5% to 7%?","Phil Lembo","That\u2019s what I said, yes.","Shah Pourreza","Okay. Great. And then just lastly, maybe just a quick update around Northern Pass, I mean, obviously, you have had some change in leadership, in governors and there was -- has been a big proponent of the projects, so maybe just a quick update on sort of the status there?","Phil Lembo","The status of Northern Pass is it\u2019s in the court now in New Hampshire -- at the New Hampshire Supreme Court. On May the 15th there will be oral arguments in the case. We have already ahead of that obviously parties have filed briefs in the matter. So on May the 15th it will be oral arguments. The court then will take all the information and deliberate on that and hopefully sometime later on this year that decision will come out of the Supreme Court.","Typically when decisions come out of the court related to regulatory matters they are not sort of an up or down decision, they really are more to identify if there are points that were made that should be remanded and reconsidered by the body that originally did that. So if we are successful at the court we would expect that that were to happen, it would go back to Site Evaluation Committee with some things to reconsider in the process.","Shah Pourreza","Okay. Great. That was it. Thanks, guys. Thanks, Phil.","Phil Lembo","All right. Thanks, Shah.","Jeff Kotkin","Thanks, Shah. Next question is from Travis Miller from Morningstar. Good morning, Travis.","Travis Miller","Good morning. Thank you. I wonder when you talk about the higher earnings for the offshore wind in that 2022 and 2023 period. What does the CapEx trajectory look like to get there? Is it something that you would have to start immediately or is it something that phases in? What does it peak and how do you get there on the CapEx side?","Phil Lembo","Just to be clear, in terms of the higher earnings contribution it would be beyond the 2023 time period. We indicated that one of the contracts, the South Fork is comes online. We expect it by the end of 2022 and then the Revolution Wind turbines moving through the year in 2023.","So really the -- in our current 5% to 7% guidance there is a small amount of contribution from wind. And really what I am talking about here is that beyond 2023 is where you would see that more appreciable contributions from the offshore wind.","So having said that, in terms of construction, we really haven\u2019t given specific, we said that the permitting process is probably a few years. The construction process is a few years. So in the early years you are in more of a permitting process and spending is more sort of on those legal and other costs you would expect permitting and then construction sort of ramps up at the back end of the period.","Travis Miller","Okay. And can you start booking earnings before it actually goes in service or does the earnings accounting go with cash flow?","Phil Lembo","No. You cannot. On the offshore wind there is no earnings related to the capital spending. It would be when the revenues come in.","Travis Miller","Okay. Great. That\u2019s all I had. Thank you.","Phil Lembo","Thank you. Travis.","Jeff Kotkin","Thanks, Travis. Next question is from Andrew Weisel from Scotia Howard Weil. Good morning, Andrew.","Andrew Weisel","Good morning, guys. First question is on Massachusetts offshore wind. The law requires that Utah RFP needs to procure prices no higher than those signed in response to past RFPs. And I think most people would agree that their Vineyard offshore project was aggressive on pricing. So my question is -- my questions are, do you expect the proposed legislation to remove that ceiling to move forward and do you as a bidder think that lower costs from like a more mature supply chain would overcome the loss of those tax credits or is higher pricing inevitable?","Phil Lembo","Thank you for that question, Andrew. As you mentioned there is in the Boston Globe and other news sources, there are reports that the legislature is considering, taking another look at that provision and seeing if it, what impact that it has on future bids. Does it inhibit the bidders, is it better for the commonwealth in the long run that there some modification to that provision. So that -- that will be worked out by the legislature coming up. So there are certainly publicly disclosed discussions that type of activity is going on.","I will say that depending on where you are in the bid process and you could be losing a considerable amount of tax benefit, you may have done a bid with 24% investment tax credit in mind and you get out a few years you are maybe down to half of that or it sunsets totally under the current loss.","So I think that that would be a significant impact on a bid price and maybe whether or not that could be overcome by supply chain, I think, you would have to wait and see. But you have -- certainly you would have a known number of a reduction of the tax credit versus an unknown benefit from the supply chain. So I think that the loss in the long run -- the loss of the tax benefit would be significantly to the bidder.","Andrew Weisel","Okay. Thanks. That\u2019s helpful. Sorry, go ahead.","Phil Lembo","No. I was going to say, and certainly, we all have to keep in mind that the tax benefits exist or they get extended or something happens, that in the long run benefits customers because prices can reflect that and should result in lower prices.","Andrew Weisel","Understood. My next question is on rate cases. You talked about the PSNH rate case filing and the multiyear plans. What is your latest thinking on when and where we might see the next filings pop up?","Phil Lembo","Well, I think that possibly the only real franchise that is and under in their agreement right now is at the gas business in Massachusetts. So I would expect that the next one up would be that, since it\u2019s the only one really that doesn\u2019t have a plan.","As you know and somebody mentioned earlier, I think, Mike did earlier in the discussion there is an evaluation going on in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, taking a look at the gas distribution systems across the whole Commonwealth.","So I\u2019d say that, you would want to wait and see what the outcome of that was, maybe there is some additional programs that have to be implemented, and certainly, you would want to know that before you prepare to filing. If you are going to have to implement new procedures, you would want to make sure you had revenue to recover that.","So the next case I would expect to see, because it\u2019s the one that hasn\u2019t been through the process yet is in the gas business in Massachusetts. And then in terms of the timing, I would expect that to be somewhat after we see what comes out of the review that\u2019s being conducted in Massachusetts.","Andrew Weisel","That makes sense. Then, one last one, this is probably a minor point, but the slide on the Greater Boston Reliability Solution, looks like two of the projects have slipped in terms of the approval going from 1Q to 2Q and then at project completion, it seems like a couple more will not be completed by the end of this year. Anything you can comment on what change and how big of an impact that might have?","Phil Lembo","It won\u2019t have any impact in terms of the rate base. The capital investment plan may move for that, but the overall transmission plant and service rate base will not be impacted by those changes. I will say that, like any project that we do these days, getting through some of the citing and permitting. As you know, probably takes a little bit longer than it did five years ago and challenges and whatnot.","So there are a couple of towns that were associated with the Greater Boston project that the permitting process is moving slower than we had hoped for. So we expect to fully get through those processes, but just on a somewhat delayed basis and that will not have an impact on the transmission rate base.","Andrew Weisel","Okay. Thank you very much.","Phil Lembo","You are welcome.","Jeff Kotkin","Thank you, Andrew. Next question is from Andy Levi from ExodusPoint. Good morning, Andy.","Andy Levi","Oh! Hey. I was kidding. How are you guys doing?","Jeff Kotkin","Good. How are you?","Phil Lembo","All right.","Andy Levi","I am doing all right. So a little off the number question, just on the Aquarion, I guess, one of the strategies that you had was to possibly grow that through acquisitions, and obviously, with Connecticut Water still in play, we are not sure what\u2019s going to happen there. But longer term, if there\u2019s not the ability to grow through acquisitions, even if smaller systems, and obviously, you just lost a system now, does it make sense for Aquarion longer term kind of stay within the Eversource family or would it be something that you would positively look at to sell and maybe not have raised as much equity?","Phil Lembo","We feel very confident about our ability to grow the water business, Andy. Not every transaction goes your away. There has been transactions that had happened over time, that we are not involved with other parties are involved with. So you are not going to win every transaction or every RFP or every item that you have out there.","But we feel -- we are committed to the water business for the long term. We want to be a long-term operator of that. We see much strategic sense to that in terms of our vision to be a clean energy leader in the region and so we are in the water business for the long-term and we feel confident that we will be able to grow that business, if not -- as you say, if not with the Connecticut Water transaction that there will be other opportunities in the future.","Andy Levi","Okay. Thank you very much.","Phil Lembo","You are welcome.","Jeff Kotkin","All right. Great. Thank you, Andy. We have no other folks in the queue. So we want to thank you for joining us this morning for the call. If you have any follow-up questions give us a call or we will see you at the five conferences that start next week.","Operator","Thank you.

This morning, I'll summarize our third quarter results and recap some recent state and federal regulatory proceedings.","Overall, we're very pleased with the results for the quarter and for the first nine months of the year. We've been consistent with our expectations and we continue to target full year earnings per share between $3.20 and $3.30 per share, as well as our 5% to 7% long-term earnings per share growth rate. We've also made very good progress on a number of important initiatives and continue to provide top tier reliability and service to our customers.","Starting with slide number 2, we earned $0.91 per share in the third quarter of 2018 compared with earnings of $0.82 per share in the third quarter last year. As noted in the earnings release, the $0.91 includes two non-recurring items. One involve the impairment of our investment in Access Northeast and the other involves some tax benefits. I'll provide more details on these impacts in a minute.","Turning to our core business results, our electric distribution segment earned $0.55 per share in the third quarter of 2018 compared to $0.50 per share in the third quarter of last year. The primary driver behind the improvement was higher distribution margin. This resulted from new rate plans in effect in Connecticut and Massachusetts, and higher sales at Public Service of New Hampshire where we're not yet decoupled.","Additionally, you may recall from our second quarter results that the implementation of decoupling this year for NSTAR Electric in lieu of our former loss-based revenue mechanism resulted in higher year-over-year revenues in peak use quarters, such as the third; and lower revenues in shoulder (00:03:55) quarters, such as the second quarter. Partially offsetting the higher margin was the absence of the New Hampshire generation earnings, and higher depreciation, amortization and property tax expense, mostly at Connecticut Light and Power.","Our electric transmission segment earned $0.34 per share in the third quarter of 2018 compared to $0.31 in the third quarter of 2017. Improved results were due primarily to an increased level of our investment in transmission facilities this year.","Our natural gas distribution segment lost $0.04 per share in the third quarter compared to a loss of $0.02 per share in the third quarter of 2017. The change was primarily due to higher operation and maintenance expense in the gas business.","Our water distribution segment, which is new this year as a result of our of last December's acquisition of Aquarion Water, earned $0.06 per share in the third quarter of this year. More than half of Aquarion's earnings are typically realized in the third quarter when customer usage is at its highest.","Eversource parent and other earned $1 million in the third quarter of 2018 or less than $0.01 a share compared with earnings of $0.03 per share in the third quarter of 2017. Parent and other results reflect two significant non-recurring items. First, the Access Northeast impairment of $26 million after tax or $0.08 per share represents all of our investment in the project. While we've made progress in most New England states in seeking natural gas capacity contracts with electric distribution companies, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruled in the summer of 2016 that the state electric utilities cannot sign such contracts without a change in law","And at this time, despite projected regional energy savings of $1 billion a year, we do not see a clear path to achieving new legislation in Massachusetts, particularly in light of recent unfortunate events outside of Eversource's service territory in the Merrimack Valley region of the state. As a result, we've concluded that our investment in Access Northeast is impaired.","Also in the third quarter of 2018, we filed our final 2017 federal and state corporate income tax returns. There were several discrete items related to legislative tax code changes that reduced our tax obligations. Together, these reductions totaled $18 million or about \u2013 or $0.6 per share. Tax reform had no material impact on our 2017 results and we do not expect additional impacts going forward.","From financial results I'll turn to slide 3 in recent regulatory developments. In September, we joined with the Connecticut Office of Consumer Counsel and the prosecutorial unit of PURA in filing a settlement on our Yankee Gas three-year rate proposal. The settlement is now before regulators for a review and we expect the final decision in the fourth quarter.","The rate plan will be effective on November 15, 2018 and includes three moderate increases in distribution rates over a three-year period through calendar 2021. The authorized ROE will be at 9.3%, a slight increase from existing levels. We will also implement revenue decoupling and a capital tracker that will enable us to accelerate the replacement of older cast iron and unprotected steel pipe. We consider the settlement to be a constructive outcome of the rate review, and marks the second long-term rate settlement we've achieved in Connecticut just this year.","The CL&P review, as you may recall, was settled in January and new rates were effective in May. When you also consider NSTAR Electric's five-year rate plan that was effective in February of this year, we find ourselves in a position of having long-term rate predictability in three of our largest distribution jurisdictions, with both decoupling and capital trackers for certain major investments. It means that for several years we'll be able to focus on just running the business to the best of our customers rather than spending substantial time and resources on rate reviews.","We've also had what I would consider positive news at FERC in mid-October. FERC commissioners voted three to nil to implement a new methodology for reviewing and settling rate electric transmission ROE cases. Rather than solely relying on the commission's discounted cash flow methodology, FERC is now proposing that going forward it would average the DCF, the CAPM, and risk premium, and expected earnings methodologies in determining new authorized ROEs.","FERC's proposed ruling was a result of four serial complaints that were filed between 2011 and 2016 by complainants who asked FERC to lower the ROEs earned by the New England Transmission Owners. You may recall that while all four complaints moved through the hearing process and secured ALJ recommended decision, only the first one was voted on by FERC. That 2014 decision was appealed to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals which vacated the decision and remanded the case back to FERC in April of 2017.","FERC's new methodology addresses the issues raised by the appeals court in the first case, but has not yet produced a new authorized ROE for New England. In its ruling, FERC asked the parties through the ROE complaints to file briefs and their own calculations for a new ROE for the region using the core methodologies for each of the four complaint periods. The briefing process will likely continue through early next year, and it's not clear when FERC will actually decide on each of the four complaints, the oldest, which dates back to October of 2011.","Until we receive final rulings and as instructed by FERC, we'll continue to bill customers based on the commission's 2014 decision on the first complaint, which calls for a base ROE of 10.57% and a cap on what any single project can earn of 11.74%. Now FERC has not ruled on any of the four complaints yet, but in the illustrative calculation that FERC described in its order would result in a modestly lower base ROE of 10.41% and a higher cap of 13.08%.","We are still a ways away from a final decision, but such levels if ultimately approved by FERC would not result in a significant changes to our overall transmission ROEs. While we await FERC's actions settling our actual ROE, we applaud the commission's intention to reduce the volatility of its ROE methodology.","Using a DCF methodology exclusively resulted in wide swings in potential results depending on which companies were at the high-end or the low-end of the peer analysis, and whether the subject company was widely or lightly covered by sell-side analysts. And as you know, there were situations where a change in long-term growth rate estimates for a single company by just one analyst could result in tens of millions of dollars in higher or lower earnings for New England Transmission Owners.","Additionally, it appears that FERC is tightening the threshold to be applied to existing ROEs before it sets an ROE complaint for hearing. We anticipate that changes will provide more stability in transmission returns, thereby encouraging more investment in a critical industry sector.","This order follows the filing of a settlement in August regarding transparency of New England's transmission formula rates. The settlement provides increased transparency, simplicity and the opportunity for various stakeholders to review the annual rates. The settlement is now before the ALJ awaiting certification and after that it will go to the commission for a decision. It followed a lengthy and successful negotiation process between transmission owners and representatives of customers and state regulators, but it does not affect our ROEs.","Finally, I'll turn to our capital program in slide 4. As you probably recall during our August 1 earnings call, we updated our 2019 through 2021 capital program, adding about $600 million of spending in our core business. We continue to refine our estimates for those three years in anticipation of laying out a revised long-term capital investment plan during our February earnings call, and one that will also include estimates for the year 2022.","While we're not yet ready to provide revisions to years 2019, 2020 and 2021, I do expect that the February capital expenditures projection that we incorporate into our 10-K will be higher than the $7.1-billion estimate on this slide. More to come on that early next year as our plans get finalized.","With that, I'll turn the call back over to Jeff for Q&A.","Jeffrey R. Kotkin - Eversource Energy","Thank you, Phil. And I'll turn the call back to Hilda to just to remind you how to enter your questions. Hilda?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Back to you, sir.","Jeffrey R. Kotkin - Eversource Energy","Thank you very much. Our first question this morning is from Greg Gordon from Evercore. Good morning, Greg.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Hey. Good morning, guys. I apologize I dialed in a little bit late because the Vistro call went a little long there. A little bit higher beta than you (00:14:53), so you got to listen to all the Q&A. One, can you just orient us a little bit on you know where the earnings growth targets are now and where your $7.1-billion rate base growth projection you think puts you inside that guidance range?","Philip J. Lembo - Eversource Energy","Yes Craig. Good morning. Thanks for taking this call. I missed this conference call. And as I said before, our earnings growth target is driven by our core business. Our earnings growth is 5% to 7% and we feel comfortable that we'll be in the middle of that range going forward. And really that is driven by the capital program that we have in place at the transmission business, as well as various operating companies. In addition, the strong emphasis that we have and focus on controlling our costs. So really 5% to 7%, in the middle of that is where we've been guiding to.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay. So you're in the \u2013 you feel like you're tracking to the \u2013 all the guidance range today but you just indicated that you're confident that there's additional capital spending that could be added to that plan that would be beneficial to customers. We'll see that in February. Is that going to sort of potentially just extend the growth rate as you move out a year in sort of the \u2013 from 2019 to 2021 to maybe 2022, or could that potentially be additive to earnings potential during the current forecast period?","Philip J. Lembo - Eversource Energy","Well it could be it could be both, Greg. As I said that in February we'll be adding a new year on so certainly we'll have to extend or talk about the extension of that 5% to 7% into that time period. And depending on where we land in terms of the customer program \u2013 the beneficial nature of these capital programs for our customers, depending on what that ultimately ends up being that could move you in the range. So, I do feel good about where we are and where we're headed.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay. One last question then I'll cede to the queue. Customers must be really suffering with high overall energy costs in the region just \u2013 especially during the winter months given the potential for ongoing scarcity events in terms of gas supply. How do you think about managing customer rate impacts? How tight do you expect the winter of 2018, 2019 to be, and how might that impact the reliability and how do you plan for that?","Philip J. Lembo - Eversource Energy","Well, certainly fuel security and pricing especially during the winter are key considerations in New England and discussions have been ongoing for a while there as you pointed out. And we do \u2013 for our customers as you know we're not in the generation business and we buy our customers who remain with us on last resort or basic service.","We go out into the marketplace every six months to secure their energy needs. And we do see that in the winter that that pricing of those contracts does spike, as a result of constraints in the region. So, we're trying to work through FERC, FERC has dockets open on fuel security there at the ISO. New England is evaluating fuel security and certainly it's an issue that we've tried to be in front of in the region.","In terms of reliability, our reliability is really top tier and we continue to focus on that. But certainly if you take units out of the system like Pilgrim is planning to retire in 2019 that just puts more and more pressure on the constraints in the region.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Thank you guys. Take care.","Philip J. Lembo - Eversource Energy","Thanks, Greg.","Jeffrey R. Kotkin - Eversource Energy","Thanks, Greg. Next question is from Mike Weinstein from Credit Suisse. Good morning, Mike.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi. Good morning guys.","Philip J. Lembo - Eversource Energy","Good morning.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hey, I'm wondering if you could maybe bracket or talk a little bit about the annual capital spending that you anticipate from grid monetization in both Connecticut and Massachusetts going forward. I know that this is probably going to be a topic at the EI. But I just wanted to see if maybe you could start talking about it now in terms of how much you anticipate things increasing going forward.","Philip J. Lembo - Eversource Energy","Well, thanks, Mike. I guess it is different by state as you point out you're asking about. In Massachusetts, we really have approval in our current rate plan and additional grid mod provisions for $233 million of spending. And really we're well underway of implementing, the core of that being our energy storage programs. We have two installations for that that are moving along well, as well as initiating our EV infrastructure build in addition to other automation types of projects.","So right now that is the approved level in Massachusetts, $233 million. In the Massachusetts order, they set it up as just like we do more or less for our energy efficiency program where it's going to be an ongoing three-year cycle. So, as we get another year into this program, we'll be filing a plan for the next three-year cycle. So really at this stage the only thing in our plan is what's approved, the $233 million.","In Connecticut, there's a similar \u2013 there's a kind of distribution planning \/grid mod docket that's been ongoing for many months and really they \u2013 it's concluded just recently at the end of October with some hearings. There will be some briefs filed by the end of November, and a decision on that is expected sometime in January of 2019.","And the decision likely will be more what types of things should be put into a filing to go in, it won't be an approval of X amount of dollars for Y number of projects. So, I think we're a little bit away on that in terms of Connecticut and New Hampshire is really in the early stages and has initiated a docket, but there hasn't been any programs approved at this stage.","So, until we get a little bit more clarity, I don't think that by EI we'll have any more clarity than today. So, certainly we think that the programs that we've been implementing in terms of storage and EV infrastructure have a long runway and provide many benefits to customers over many years. So, likely in the future in other grid mod dockets, we'll be filing for programs that address those two issues as well as others. But at this stage, there's no further dollar level associated.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Got you. And on electric transmission given the FERC current \u2013 in the latest order and comment regarding the methodology in New England for determining ROEs, are you \u2013 if higher ROEs were earned on transmission, would that \u2013 are there any specific projects or things that are being held back right now by a lack of a policy or the uncertainty over it that might come out once FERC actually does solidify how it's going to treat those assets?","Philip J. Lembo - Eversource Energy","Well, I think the direction is certainly seems to be converging around sort of the numbers that that we have in place here in Massachusetts now or in New England now and what FERC gave as an illustrative number in that order. So those numbers are good numbers for that business considering the risk profile and how long it takes the site and construct these projects, so certainly \u2013 it's in the appropriate zip code.","So I would say there's nothing really that's being held back or nothing that would be advanced per se given where the plus and minus of where that FERC ROE and the incentives are right now.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Jeffrey R. Kotkin - Eversource Energy","Thanks, Mike. Next question is from the Angie Storozynski from Macquarie. Good morning, Angie.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Good morning. So I have two questions. One if you could provide us with an update on your water growth plans, I'm talking M&A. I mean what's the current status of your bid or interest in that kind Connecticut Water? And separately on offshore wind, so we saw \u00d8rsted's, the acquisition of Deepwater and I'm just wondering if that's in any way reflective of growth prospects for your joint venture with \u00d8rsted or is it completely unrelated. Thank you.","Philip J. Lembo - Eversource Energy","Yeah, sure. Well, thanks for those questions Angie. In terms of the first one, in terms on the water growth, our outlook hasn't changed there from the \u2013 we think that the opportunities in the water business are very synergistic with our business, and we like this. The water growth story there's a lot of infrastructure that needs to be put into the ground. We do think that most of the growth will be through the smaller roll ups of distressed or local water companies in the region. And then we also mentioned that with that there could be some opportunistic larger M&A.","And as you point out, you asked about the Connecticut Water where we're not really involved in that at this stage. We had a bid that was trumped by the other party and we said that we were not going to put in a number that we didn't think created value for our shareholders. So we're not involved in that activity at this stage. And I think they're moving through their shareholder approval process at this stage, and also their regulatory process in both Connecticut and Maine. So, so far we're on the sideline there.","And for offshore wind, we really have a very good relationship with \u00d8rsted, we're fully aligned on Bay State Wind. And we don't see that there's any limit in terms of our opportunities there from what we had expected when we first got involved with the partnership with them.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Just one follow-up, so on Connecticut Water so you are not even participating in the regulatory approval process. I forgot, I thought that you were an intervener or you were planning to be an intervener in that case in Connecticut?","Philip J. Lembo - Eversource Energy","Yes we are an intervener in the regulatory process, that's correct. But in terms of the bidding process for the company, we're not involved. But as an interested party in the area where they operate, we are interveners in the case.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Very good. Thank you.","Jeffrey R. Kotkin - Eversource Energy","Thank you, Angie. Next question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America. Good morning, Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. Good morning team. So just to clarify a little bit on the last question, can you elaborate a little bit more about the opportunities reported from the Deepwater acquisition and how you see it? Just to be clear about this, which project sites are you all thinking about bidding for the upcoming \u2013 or as a JV thinking about bidding for these upcoming auctions?","Does it in any way impede it, or conversely, if the added scale when you think about projects and potentially leveraging some of the infrastructure out of Deepwater vis-\u00e0-vis transmission or otherwise actually improve the JV's advantage for bidding into some of these upcoming RFPs? I just want to be a little clearer about that?","Philip J. Lembo - Eversource Energy","Sure. I think you asked a number of things there. So just to clarify it, \u00d8rsted and Deepwater were the, are the combination there it's not an Eversource activity, it's \u00d8rsted and Deepwater. And as I said, we're fully aligned on the Bay State Wind partnership, our existing agreements with them anticipate this kind of scenario and we feel very good about the going forward opportunities that exist for the Bay State Wind partnership.","We do have more RFPs scheduled in Massachusetts. As you know that some of those contracts in New England are working their way through the contracting phase or in some cases like in Massachusetts in the regulatory approval process, but there's opportunities coming about in New York. There's RFPs being developed for New York and there's an RFP expected in Massachusetts of about 800 megawatts probably in the first quarter of this year. In Connecticut, there's an open zero carbon RFP that exists. So there's many opportunities that exist that the Bay State Wind partnership is actively involved with and we feel good about what our prospects are moving forward.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Excellent. And then just a follow up here, obviously some of your peers in the state have encountered some fairly tragic events. How does that modify if at all any of your gas modernization efforts? I know there's a specific modernization filing in the state as well. I mean, just want to make sure we fully understand the read-throughs from the events with [indiscernible} (00:30:19) to you all and any potential upcoming filings that you might be making on the back as well.","Philip J. Lembo - Eversource Energy","Sure. Well, just last night it was announced that there's going to be an independent evaluation statewide of the gas distribution network and the Public Utilities Commission is overseeing that, that's expected to last 90, 120 days. So there may be some items that come out of that review that impact capital plans, et cetera. We've had at our gas property in Mass and in Connecticut, a fairly active and aggressive program to remove and update our leak-prone infrastructure. And really that program since it has been in effect just a few years, we've doubled the spending on that, where we used to spend in the $30 million and $40 million we're spending $90 million on that to replace leak-prone infrastructure and move it out quicker than it would otherwise be.","So between that and other activities that we've done in terms of combining operations and our focus on quality, our quality assurance and that type of thing and operator qualifications, we've done a lot and planning to do a lot in the space going forward.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. All right. Excellent. Thank you all.","Jeffrey R. Kotkin - Eversource Energy","Thank you, Julien. Our next question is from Michael Lapides from Goldman. Good morning, Michael.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Good morning, guys. Thank you for taking my question. Just curious when you think about the opportunities to manage O&M further and you've done post the combination with Northeast Utilities a sizable job of kind of controlling costs, where do you think the biggest opportunity sets are from here? I mean, it feels and looks like a lot of the low hanging fruit has already been gotten over the last few years, where is the next incremental step change if there's one?","Philip J. Lembo - Eversource Energy","Well, Michael, thank you. We pride ourselves on really being a leader in terms of being able to manage our business in a cost effective manner. So ultimately, as you know, that benefits our customers. And since the merger, we've taken $500 million of cost out of business really, and at the same time improving our reliability and customer service levels to dramatically better than they were pre-merger.","So you can lower cost and improve service at the same time and we continue to look for opportunities to do that, and a lot of that is driven by automation and consistency of operations between properties across states, standardized equipment, et cetera. So it is \u2013 as you point out, the runway gets harder, the low-hanging fruit, as you say, is \u2013 there's less of that around. But that doesn't mean that we're not focused on it. And we're still \u2013 we guided to 1% or so reduction this year, we're on track to do that.","And really, I'd say, the next wave \u2013 when we merge, you can only do so much in the \u2013 at one time in terms of changing out systems and standardizing them. And initially some of the systems are more of what you think of as the corporate systems and now we're moving more into our field operations in terms of automation and providing more tools to better serve customers and lower cost. And those are being rolled out now and next year. So I think those will be the drivers going forward in terms of our ability to keep that process \u2013 that O&M focus going.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. Okay. One other question for you. We've seen in the Northeast many of the other water utilities kind of aggregate or consolidate some of the municipal water and wastewater systems. How are you thinking about that opportunity set? More importantly, how do you quantify like how big of a potential addressable market that really is for you over the coming years, and if it's something that's easy to bolt into Aquarion or not?","Philip J. Lembo - Eversource Energy","Well Aquarion has over many years rolled in municipal systems and I think we could do more there. I think just given its prior ownership model that inhibited that activity to some extent, so it's not going to drive customer growth by 10% but it's a steady 1%, 2% a year that you can add to customers by rolling up some of these systems.","And really you have a good opportunity in the current environment. What \u2013 the current environment is \u2013 budgets are tight and environmental regulations are getting more strict. So you've got municipalities saying gee, do I really want to put more pipe in the ground and invest there, do I want a new school or a fire truck, and just with these environmental regulations do I want to be in this business. So, I think, you've got the opportunity and I think you have the environmental framework that would allow some of these to move forward.","And we have actually a few pending right now at PURA in Connecticut for approval, smaller systems we still see that there's an opportunity to continue that path.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. Thank you, guys. Much appreciated.","Philip J. Lembo - Eversource Energy","Thank you, Michael.","Jeffrey R. Kotkin - Eversource Energy","Thanks, Michael. The next question is from Paul Patterson from Glenrock. Good morning, Paul.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Good morning. How are you doing?","Philip J. Lembo - Eversource Energy","Good, Paul. How are you?","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","All right. So I wanted to just follow up on the transmission ROE FERC thing, and I apologize but could you just \u2013 you did describe that there was some volatility potentially, I think, with respect to how that proposal might work and \u2013 if I heard you correctly. And I was wondering, what were the more recent complaint \u2013 what are your calculations for the more recent complaint periods? What would they be if the proposal were enacted as proposed? Do you follow me?","Philip J. Lembo - Eversource Energy","I do, I do follow you, but I just want to clarify that what I spoke about was volatility, actually that's \u2013 because of the \u2013 introducing an average of multiple methods and by making it a little bit more setting the bar higher in terms of introducing new complaints, that that should mitigate some of the volatility.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. I got you. Okay. I heard you wrong I guess when I was \u2013 okay, that makes sense. Okay. Thanks for the clarification.","Philip J. Lembo - Eversource Energy","Yeah it could have been my Boston accent. I'm not sure, Paul. So on that front I think we're in good shape. And we looked at the case and we're reserving, we have looked at our \u2013 all of the complaints and really the 10.57% and the cap on the incentives is really \u2013 we think kind of handles everything to that level. So if there's a change, we haven't gone through all the details of the calculations because the first calculation then sets the second cancellation, et cetera. But we don't see that there's going to be any big swings.","We've disclosed a 10-basis point, forever we disclosed a 10-basis point change in the ROE could have a $3-million impact. But as I said, the current proposal that's out there, there's briefs that are going to be filed by the parties. All the parties are going to do that in January. Then there's reply briefs, so I think that some of those numbers might continue to evolve but I think we're in a good position right now.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. So just to understand this if \u2013 the way it currently looks to you, you'd kind of be in the same ballpark, this 10.41% base ROE for the subsequent complaint periods roughly speaking, I mean there might be some variation but it's kind of in that neighborhood. Am I understanding it right?","Philip J. Lembo - Eversource Energy","Yeah. I think the way we're looking at it now from our preliminary take and again where we continue to work with all of the transmission owners, because this isn't just an Eversource item, this is a regional item that we see that it's about where it is. Right, you're correct.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And then there was some discussion about incentives when they made this or at least there was some comments, statements. Do you foresee any change in the incentives that FERC has been historically granting in combination with this order or are subsequent to it, or do you have any sense about that at all?","Philip J. Lembo - Eversource Energy","Yeah. I think that they're going to be looking at that. I think that was one of the silent items before, but that is something that I think will be addressed in these briefs and reply briefs that are coming up, but more to come there.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And then I noticed that Northern Pass is still sort of a topic in New Hampshire. I think it was in the gubernatorial debate just recently. And I just was wondering if there's any \u2013 so, I mean I know obviously what happened there, but it's still sort of out there and there has been some issues associated sort of similar to Northern Pass with the (00:40:47) proposal. I'm just wondering if there's sort of any flavor you could give about where Northern Pass or the potential for another Northern Pass kind of thing, or Northern Pass 2.0, whatever you want to call it. How should we think about that going forward?","Philip J. Lembo - Eversource Energy","Well, you may or may not be aware that the New Hampshire Supreme Court has accepted our appeal on the Site Evaluation Committee rulings. So, they did direct the regulators to certify the record and get that back to them next month. So there will be a process where that is evaluated at the New Hampshire Supreme Court in terms of our current Northern Pass proposal. So that still is something that's working its way through in New Hampshire.","It's tough enough for me to forecast the timing of existing projects as opposed to speculating on what might be down the road. But there's certainly aggressive environmental targets that the region has. We've seen an uptick. And even in Massachusetts in the latest session that ended a few months ago, they authorized more offshore wind. And I just think that the tide is going to continue to be looking for projects that deliver clean energy into the region. So what that is right now I can't point to a specific project, but I think if you look \u2013 if you see what's out there in the discussion, it's certainly moving to more of that than less.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","I guess what I'm wondering is, so \u2013 and I apologize for not being more clear. So let's just assume that the Supreme Court that you \u2013 that the siting evaluation committee \u2013 I guess, the next step would be to see what the siting evaluation \u2013 to see how the Supreme Court ruling sort of works its way through that process.","Philip J. Lembo - Eversource Energy","That's correct.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And then after that I guess we just have to see what what's going on with that.","Philip J. Lembo - Eversource Energy","Yes. That's correct.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks so much.","Philip J. Lembo - Eversource Energy","Okay. Thanks, Paul.","Jeffrey R. Kotkin - Eversource Energy","Thank, Paul. Next question is from Praful Mehta from Citi. Good morning, Praful.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Good morning. Hi, guys.","Philip J. Lembo - Eversource Energy","Hi.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","So maybe we touch on offshore wind first, the price of $65, that cleared, and just generally how do you see pricing for offshore wind? There clearly seems to be some disconnect in the market, I wanted to see if you think those prices are too low, or more broadly how do you see the opportunity set for offshore wind relative to the kind of prices that we've been seeing?","Philip J. Lembo - Eversource Energy","Well in terms of the pricing, Praful, we did not win the bid, so the pricing that got accepted was below what we thought was an appropriate bid for the risk profile and the return levels. So, in terms of whether it's appropriate or adequate I think that's best to ask of the winning bidder for that standpoint.","I think that \u2013 we had said that in the \u2013 from my previous comment you can see there's more and more activity going on out there in terms of offshore wind, more development. And I think as you get more in the ground or in the ocean with these projects, that you have a better supply chain. So I think that if you look at any of these kinds of activities, prices seem to move down, technology gets better, et cetera.","So I'm not sure you know that, that's probably not the question you're asking but the specifics of a price or whatever I think is really up to the party that won at that price to really give some information as to why they think that's appropriate because obviously our pricing wasn't at that level.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got you. So I guess another way of saying it is, if prices were to stay at these levels do you expect winning bids in the future or do you \u2013 I guess, is there still a disconnect?","Philip J. Lembo - Eversource Energy","Sure, I mean, when you say in the future as I said costs change. Prices come down, improvements get made in the supply chain, regulatory uncertainty becomes clearer, so a lot of factors that enter into what's in a bid. You have the price of components. So a lot of factors are there, but you have to keep in mind, you also have tax credits that may not exist in the future. So what impact that has on the pricing and determination that people make too. So if you look at the price sort of absent any tax credits maybe that push \u2013 that signals for higher pricing and the tax credits have helped to lower it. So, when you say in the future, it's hard to really determine if \u2013 you have to give me what the tax situation is and some other things that you have to factor into the bid.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Yeah, no, agreed and that's super helpful color. So I appreciate that. And then just on Northern Pass quickly. I know I heard all the comments before, so just wanted to clarify, stepping back does that mean that there is still an opportunity given this legal process? Or is that going on more as a check? I guess just put it in context of like does this still \u2013 do you still see a realistic possibility of Northern Pass coming back?","Philip J. Lembo - Eversource Energy","Yes. In a short answer, yes.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","All right. Okay, perfect. Good to hear. Well, appreciate that. Thank you, guys.","Jeffrey R. Kotkin - Eversource Energy","All right. Thanks, Praful. The next question is from Andrew Weisel from Scotia Howard Weil. Good morning, Andrew.","Andrew Weisel - Scotia Capital (USA), Inc.","Hey good morning everyone. First just a quick one on the Access Northeast impairment, is that an accounting item or are you no longer going to pursue the project or something similar?","Philip J. Lembo - Eversource Energy","Well, it is an accounting item. It's an accounting determination driven by the facts and circumstances and what the accounting guidance is. So, just to elaborate on that though, certainly the legislation in Massachusetts would have to be in place under the current system to enable a contract to be signed. There was no such legislation that came out of the recent legislative session that ended during the third quarter.","And as somebody alluded to early, we did have an unfortunate incident in Massachusetts that I think may provide difficulty in terms of getting legislation in the future. So, looking at all those facts and the impact that might have on future cash flows, that is a determination that we made to \u2013 that the project was impaired.","Andrew Weisel - Scotia Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. Understood. Then, lastly on the balance sheet, I'm not trying to get ahead of the February CapEx update, but how are you thinking about share repurchases? You always thought of that is sort of a backup plan or a support \u2013 a safety net to sort of speak, some of these mega projects you've been pursuing seem unlikely to require capital at least in the near-term. So, how much of a cash stockpile do you want to hold on to?","Philip J. Lembo - Eversource Energy","Well, as we said and I will continue to say our business is developing infrastructure and certainly our capital plan \u2013 we've added to the capital plan, so that shows that we're investing more of our opportunities set into regulated infrastructure projects, and that would be my expectation that our investments will be \u2013 we have a large opportunity set for investments and that's what our focus would be and not really in the share repurchase mode. But we've done share repurchases in the past, people ask about it but it's not really at the top of the list.","Andrew Weisel - Scotia Capital (USA), Inc.","All right. Thank you.","Philip J. Lembo - Eversource Energy","Great.","Jeffrey R. Kotkin - Eversource Energy","Thank you, Andrew. That was the last question that we had in the queue. So I want to thank you for joining us today. If you have follow-ups please give us a call later today. Good luck with the rest of the call. Take care.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference.

I am Jeff Kotkin, Eversource Energy\u2019s Vice President of Investor Relations.","Some of the statements made during this investor call maybe forward-looking as defined within the meaning of the Safe Harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to risk and uncertainty, which may cause the actual results to differ materially from forecasts and projections. Some of these factors are set forth in the news release issued yesterday. Additional information about the various factors that may cause actual results to differ can be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014 and our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2015. Additionally, our explanation of how and why we use certain non-GAAP measures is contained within our news release and the slides we posted last night on our website under Presentations and Webcasts and in our most recent 10-K and 10-Q.","Speaking today will be Jim Judge, our Executive Vice President and CFO and Lee Olivier, our Executive Vice President for Enterprise Energy Strategy & Business Development. Also joining us today are Jim Muntz, President of our Transmission business; Phil Lembo, our Vice President and Treasurer; Jay Buth, our Vice President and Controller; and John Moreira, our Vice President of Financial Planning and Analysis.","Now, I will turn over the call to Jim.","Jim Judge","Thank you, Jeff and thank you all for joining us this morning. Today, I will cover a strong second quarter financial results, which were in line with our guidance range for the full year. Our strong operating performance and update on several legislative and regulatory items and I will close with an update on certain transmission projects.","Let\u2019s start with Slide 4 and our financial results. Excluding merger-related costs, we earned $209.6 million, or $0.66 per share in the second quarter of 2015 compared with earnings of $131.9 million, or $0.42 per share in the second quarter of 2014. Over the first six months of 2015, we earned $466.9 million, or $1.47 per share, excluding those charges compared with earnings of $373.7 million, or $1.18 per share in the first half of 2014. These results strongly support our full year earnings projection of $2.75 to $2.90 per share as well as our targeted long-term annual earnings growth rate of 6% to 8%.","Turning to Slide 5, a significant driver in the second quarter year-over-year earnings growth was the absence of a $0.10 charge we recorded in the second quarter of 2014, resulting from the initial decision from FERC on the allowed transmission ROEs for New England transmission owners. There was no similar charge this quarter plus we continue to realize the benefits of our continued investment in New England transmission reliability enhancements, which added $0.01 to earnings. As a result, our transmission earnings totaled $0.25 per share in the second quarter of 2015 compared with $0.14 per share in the second quarter of 2014. On the electric distribution side, higher retail revenues primarily due to last December\u2019s Connecticut Light & Power distribution rate decision and a follow-on order from earlier this month involving accumulated deferred income taxes added $0.10 per share to earnings. I will discuss the July decision more fully in a moment.","We continue to evidence good cost discipline as we have lower O&M \u2013 lower non-tracked O&M expense this quarter that reflects a decline in labor and labor-related costs and added $0.06 to earnings. I should point out that part of the large O&M decline this quarter, in fact, $22 million of the $56 million you will see in the income statement are costs that we don\u2019t have any more as we sold our electrical contracting company early in the quarter. So, $70 million of annualized O&M will go away. There is really no real earnings per share impact as obviously the revenues will go away as well.","Back to the reconciliation for the quarter. As expected, earnings were negatively affected by $0.06 due to higher property taxes, depreciation and amortization expense associated with storm cost recovery. Other factors impacting the quarter which include improved generation earnings and lower income taxes added another $0.03 per share. In terms of operations, our electric and natural gas delivery systems have performed well over the first half of the year. Our electric restoration metric, which represents the average number of months between interruptions, continues to track favorably as our reliability metrics are now consistently in the top quartile of our industry.","Turning to our state legislatures, we had an active and successful spring. In Connecticut, Governor Malloy signed Public Act 15-107, which among other initiatives will allow electric distribution companies to sign long-term supply contracts with interstate natural gas pipelines. We will discuss the significance of that act shortly.","Turning to Slide 6, in New Hampshire, the Senate and House overwhelmingly endorsed modifications to the state\u2019s securitization statutes which are key to public service of the New Hampshire\u2019s divestiture of its generating assets and recovery of those costs. The divestiture process has now moved to the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission, where we filed a comprehensive restructuring and rate stabilization settlement agreement on June 10. That agreement was signed by a wide range of parties, including the Governor\u2019s Office of Energy and Planning, two key state senators, senior New Hampshire PUC staff, the Office of Consumer Advocate, the IBEW local representing PSNH\u2019s unionized workers and the Conservation Law Foundation among others.","In addition to divestiture of PSNH\u2019s 1,200 megawatts of generation, other terms of the agreement called for PSNH to defer a distribution rate case until at least mid 2017, the continuation of PSNH\u2019s reliability enhancement program and the related cost tracker, foregoing $25 million of deferred equity return on the scrubber, and funding by Eversource shareholders of $5 million of clean energy initiatives. Parties to the settlement agreement have asked the New Hampshire PUC to rule on the agreement by December 31, 2015, which should allow the planned sale process to occur in 2016. As part of the agreement, the Commission\u2019s review of Merrimack Station\u2019s scrubber investment will end. We firmly believe that the agreement we filed will benefit all New Hampshire\u2019s stakeholders over the long-term, which is why it is so widely supported.","Turning from New Hampshire to Connecticut in Slide #7, on July 2, PURA approved a settlement we have reached with the authorities prosecutorial unit concerning the treatment of accumulated deferred income taxes in setting rate base in last December\u2019s general rate case decision. The settlement restored approximately $165 million of distribution rate base and will add about $18 million of distribution revenues annually that\u2019s retroactive to December 1, 2014. We recorded $11 million in the second quarter for the period of December 1, 2014 to June 30, 2015. In Massachusetts, we received two positive orders from state regulators relative to our plans to step up investment in our natural gas delivery system.","The GPU approved a mechanism to recover investments related to the significant upgrade of our 3 billion cubic foot liquefied natural gas storage facility in Hopkinton, Massachusetts over the next several years. We expect to invest up to $200 million in that 40-year full facility, which is critical to helping NSTAR gas meet its winter supply obligations. Additionally, the DPU approved the first step in NSTAR Gas\u2019 accelerated replacement of its cast iron and its untreated steel pipe over the next 20 years or 25 years. Those expenditures which were expected to rise to more than $60 million a year by the end of this decade will also be recovered through a distribution rate tracking mechanism.","Later this year, we also expect to file a natural gas expansion plan to NSTAR Gas to comply with the state legislation that was approved last year. NSTAR Gas is our only distribution company where we have a rate case pending, hearings in that case were a base distribution rate increase request is approximately $23 million. Hearings were held in June and the decision is expected in the fourth quarter. New rates will take effect January 1, 2016.","I would like to touch on energy rates for a moment. On July 1, the default energy rates at all four of our electric distribution companies dropped significantly from as high as $0.15 per kilowatt hour to between $0.0825 and $0.10 a kilowatt hour. This reduction, which is a pass-through for us mostly impacts our residential customers, the vast majority of whom have not moved to a third-party supplier and continue to buy their energy from us. While our customers will benefit from this decline through December, rates are very likely to rise again significantly in January when New England\u2019s acute shortage of natural gas pipeline capacity will again pressure electricity prices. This see-sawing of energy rates is not healthy for our region\u2019s economy and Lee will discuss in a moment the long-term initiatives that we have underway to resolve this dilemma.","In Washington, hearings at FERC concluded this month on the second and third complaints filed regarding the return on equity earned by New England transmission owners. Earlier this year, FERC reaffirmed a base ROE of 10.57%, down from its previously allowed 11.14%. We believe that the 10.57% base is a reasonable level and booked reserves in the second quarter of last year and first quarter of this year, to reflect FERC\u2019s final order. We are due to receive a FERC ALJ initial decision late this year and expect the commission order in the third quarter of 2016.","Turning from regulatory issues to financing, we are pleased with the outcome of our annual rating agency reviews. On our first quarter earnings call I mentioned that the S&P had raised its corporate rating on Eversource and its subsidiaries from A- to A with a stable outlook. S&P also upgraded Eversource\u2019s commercial paper rating to A1. Subsequent to that upgrade, Fitch raised the outlook for CL&P, PSNH and WMECO to positive and Moody\u2019s raised its outlook for PSNH and WMECO to positive. We believe these actions speak loudly about how well we are operating the business and how many important regulatory items have been successfully resolved.","Now turning to Slide 8, I will provide a brief update on some significant transmission projects. Our share of the Interstate Reliability Project which we are building in Northeastern Connecticut has finished major construction and the project was about 97% complete as of June 30. Right of way restoration remains and we expect the entire project in Connecticut, Rhode Island and Massachusetts to be in service later this year. We have now made three filings with the Connecticut Siting Council for projects included in the $350 million Greater Hartford seven [ph] solutions and all have now been improved with one already under construction. We continue to estimate that all Greater Hartford projects will be completed by the end of 2018.","On this slide, we also highlight some additional transmission projects in New Hampshire that have been in our forecast and guidance. On July 21, we and National Grid filed a joint application within New Hampshire Site Evaluation Committee to build the Merrimack Valley Reliability project. Our share of the project would cost approximately $37 million. Separately we are going through the pre-filing process of the Seacoast Reliability Project, which is part of the New Hampshire 10-year reliability initiative we have been discussing with you for a few years. We are reviewing our $70 million cost estimate for the Seacoast project as we incorporate input from the towns that will host the project. These projects underscore the continued economic growth we see in New Hampshire and Eastern Massachusetts. Altogether, our capital expenditures totaled $771 million in the first six months of the year, $324 million of which was spent on our electric transmission system. We continue to project total CapEx of $1.85 billion this year to $740 million of which will be invested in transmission.","That concludes my formal remarks. Now I will turn the call over to Lee.","Lee Olivier","Thanks Jim. I will provide you with a brief update on our major capital initiatives and then turn the call back to Jeff for Q&A. Let\u2019s start with Northern Pass profiled on Slide 10. U.S. Department of Energy released its draft environmental impact statement on July 21. We have begun our review of the document and do not believe it poses any unanticipated challenges to the construction of the project. We were pleased that the draft EIS included that there would be a very low to low visual impact on our Northern sections of our preferred group. As expected, the DOE reviewed a number of alternative routes of the project in addition to our preferred configuration. We will carefully evaluate these alternatives. The considerable breadth of these alternatives should ensure that the project configuration ultimately approved by New Hampshire regulators will have been analyzed by the DOE.","While the draft EIS is now released the DOE has scheduled hearings on the report for early October and asked for written comments by the end of October. Now that the DOE has issued its draft review, we expect to file with New Hampshire Site Evaluation Committee for our state siting approval in the early to mid-fall. The new state process requires a series of public meetings on the project at least 30 days before the application. So you should expect those meetings to be scheduled soon. Once we file our application to site evaluation committee, we will have up to two months to determine that the submittal is complete and then up to 12 months to rule on it. Our state application will incorporate feedback from the DOE\u2019s draft EIS, as well as from the ongoing outreach in New Hampshire to ensure it is viewed favorably by a wide range of stakeholders.","As part of our engagement with New Hampshire stakeholders, we announced on June 16, a new and unique partnership that will create significant opportunities for New Hampshire workers and businesses to participate in our upcoming transmission projects in the state. This would include Northern Pass and about that $800 million we expect to invest in other New Hampshire projects over the next 5 years some of which Jim has referenced earlier.","The Jobs program focuses on three key areas of employment. They include a commitment to hire New Hampshire workers first, their commitment to New Hampshire-based construction related companies, many of them family-run to have an opportunity to bid on our projects a first of a kind training program to allow New Hampshire apprentices to be paid while training for high demand work on electric transmission construction. This effort has been coordinated with IBEW and our major electrical contractors. We look forward to the many of these New Hampshire residents and companies working in Northern Pass. The project continues to offer enormous benefits to the State of New Hampshire and to the region as a whole. We continue to estimate the cost of approximately $1.4 billion for Northern Pass, but that could change depending on the conditions related to the regulatory approvals.","Turning to Slide 11, you can see that we expect to receive both state and federal siting approvals of the project in late 2016, commence construction around the end of 2016 and have the project substantially complete on both sides of the border by the end of 2018, with testing and entering into full commercial operation in the first half 2019. This schedule is similar to what I discussed with you in May.","Turning to Slide 12, New England continues to make progress towards addressing significant energy challenges facing the region. One of these challenges is the need for new clean sources of power especially as we witnessed the ongoing retirement of older coal, oil and nuclear units. Northern Pass will provide some of that clean power, but other additional sources would be needed to meet the renewable energy and carbon reduction mandates New England and other states have enacted into law.","In late February, the state of Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island jointly unveiled a draft solicitation for clean energy sources that will require new electric transmission to be built. The draft RFP asked for proposals for power purchase agreements as well as for the construction and transmission that would tap into clean energy. In late June, the final proposed RFPs were submitted to Massachusetts and Rhode Island through regulators for approvals. Connecticut legislation does not require that step. We expect that regulatory sign-ups on their RFP will occur over the next couple of months and the RFPs will be released to potential bidders shortly thereafter with bids due late this year.","In Massachusetts, Governor Baker filed legislation on July 9 that calls on the state to purchase up to 18.9 million megawatt hours annually of clean hydroelectric power and other renewable energy. That equates to about 2,400 megawatts of capacity. We expect the legislature to take up the Governor\u2019s bill this fall. But earlier this week, Governor Baker\u2019s Energy Secretary, Matthew Beaton, said that the Governor has made the bill one of his priorities since without hydropower, the state will fall short of emissions reductions targeted by the state\u2019s landmark 2008 Global Warming Solutions Act. In addition to taking steps to address its clean energy goals, New England has also made significant progress towards improving the availability of natural gas to fuel power generation during the winter.","As I discussed on our first quarter conference call, New England and federal policymakers are very concerned about the shortage of natural gas capacity into the region during cold weather months, New England is challenged by a lack of gas pipeline capacity into a region, a shortage of natural gas storage and a heavy and growing dependence on natural gas generation. These constraints caused New England to suffer the three highest price months ever in New England for wholesale electricity prices in January and February of 2014 and February of this year. Further, natural gas prices in New England this past winter were almost doubled the national average even though we are located so close to the Marcellus gas fields. Without action the fuel constraints that we are seeing are driving skyrocketing prices will only continue and intensify. ISO New England recently stated that it expects 10% of the region\u2019s generation fleet to retire by 2018 and possibly another 5,000 megawatts by 2020. These units will be oil and coal fire. More natural gas generation will take your place pressuring gas supplies and customer rates even further. The region\u2019s policymakers recognized the severity of this challenge and are taking action.","Turning to Slide 13, let\u2019s start with Connecticut legislation as Jim mentioned earlier, on June 22, Governor Malloy signed Public Act 15-107. This bill provides clear authority for state regulators to allow electric distribution companies to sign long-term supply agreements with interstate natural gas pipelines. We expect the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection to solicit proposals later this year. In Massachusetts, Department of Public Utilities opened the docket in April to examine whether we could \u2013 whether it should consider allowing electric distribution companies to contract for interstate pipeline capacity. We, along with National Grid and the government\u2019s Department of Energy Resources, strongly believe the DPU\u2019s authority to approve such contracts is clear under state law.","Initial comments were filed in June and reply comments in early July. Although the DPU has not set a timeline for the remainder of the investigation, we anticipate the DPU will issue its findings later this summer or early fall. In New Hampshire, the Public Utilities Commission opened its own docket in April to investigate the means by which electric distribution companies could ameliorate adverse wholesale electric market conditions caused by natural gas constraints. Stakeholders filed comments in June. Further, the PUC staff released its preliminary conclusions earlier this month that electric distribution companies have the necessary authority to contract the natural gas capacity. The PUC staff will provide a report to the Commission by September 15 of this year.","In Maine, the Public Utilities Commission conducted an RFP late last year as part of its mandate to bring up to 200 million cubic feet a day of incremental natural gas capacity into the state. Access Northeast bid into that RFP and in May Central Maine Power filed with the Maine PUC recommending that it be allowed to contract with Access Northeast to bring in additional gas capacity. The consultant hired by the PUC analyzed the proposals, issued its report earlier this month including that Maine going it alone would not be justified. We believe this reinforces the need for a multi-state effort. All of these actions point to the increased recognition by policymakers that New England requires additional interstate pipeline capacity to ensure electric grid reliability and stable pricing.","As we have said previously, we believe that the $3 billion Access Northeast project we are developing with Spectra Energy and National Grid is ideally suited to address New England\u2019s natural gas infrastructure challenges since it would include upgrading Spectra\u2019s existing pipelines in New England. Our project is unique, uniquely situated to deliver increased quantities of natural gas to the region\u2019s newest and cleanest generators to inspect those pipelines and our alliance with Iroquois Pipeline connect us to directly to more than 70% of the region\u2019s gas fire units. To remind you, Spectra and Eversource would each own 40% of the project and National Grid would own 20% of the project. The project\u2019s open season ended May 1 and it received a strong response from both electric and natural gas distribution companies.","The Access Northeast has commenced the process of negotiating long-term contracts with those distribution companies. We expect that pipeline customers will file those contracts with state regulators later this year with the goal of securing state regulatory approvals in 2016. With respect to sitting and citing and permitting, we plan to commence our FERC pre-filing later this year. This will facilitate a formal certificate filing at FERC in 2016. We expect to bring the pipeline into service for the winter of 2018\/19 assuming expeditious approvals by federal and state authorities, because of the longer construction timeline for LNG facilities, we anticipate the storage element of the project will commence service after the pipeline.","On July 27, we announced LNG, the LNG element of Access Northeast of public meeting in Acushnet, Massachusetts. That element involves the construction of 6.8 Bcf of LNG storage in Acushnet where Eversource currently operates an LNG facility. This LNG facility has been operated safely and reliably for nearly 45 years. The combination of the enhanced Spectra pipeline system and the additional domestic natural gas will allow us to ensure up to 5,000 megawatts of natural gas generation will remain online even during the coldest winter months.","Now, I would like to turn the call back over to Jeff for Q&A.","Jeff Kotkin","Thank you, Lee. And I will turn the call back to Christina just to remind you how to enter questions. Christina?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call back to Jeff.","Jeff Kotkin","Thanks, Christina. Our first question this morning is from Dan Eggers from Credit Suisse. Good morning, Dan.","Dan Eggers","Hey, good morning. Just on the process right now, I guess for Access Northeast, you guys will pre-file this year. FERC will give you a response what time in 2016 and then when would you expect an official formal approval and then start actually spending money on construction under the timeline you laid out today?","Lee Olivier","In regards to the pre-filing, we will do the pre-filing approximately in the fourth quarter of this year. And then we will do the certificate filing somewhere between the third quarter and fourth quarter of next year. And clearly, at the beginning of this project the capital expenditures, our investments are very low. And what we are doing now was we are putting together the capital flows and cash flows for next year. And we will have a better sense of those later in the year most likely at our conference in the fall in November at EI conference.","Dan Eggers","So, we will look for the capital update, but probably no real dollars going to work until what, \u201817\/18, is that realistic?","Lee Olivier","I think that\u2019s a reasonable conclusion.","Dan Eggers","And from confidence, obviously the open season is showing interest, do you guys need to see more state approvals in some of these process you have pending before everybody is going to be onboard for signing firm agreements at this point?","Lee Olivier","Well, in the case of Connecticut, they don\u2019t need commission approval. What's happening there is the Department of Energy Environmental Protection are putting together a RFP process. They are in the midst of doing that. They will go out with an RFP. Massachusetts, we expect by late this summer, early fall, will have signed off on the RFP and it will be issued then. And essentially, once the RFP is issued, this is on electrics, once the RFP is issued, there is about 75 days that will be required to get your bid in. So we could expect bids in the fall and to choose the winners, of late this year, early next year. And on gas, it really is going to be, it\u2019s a little bit different. The only state that wants to using RFP process is Connecticut. The other states right now have not really made the determination whether they want to follow that or just used the standard kind of LDC process where we will file the EDCs will file the President agreements with the regulatory bodies and that will kick off an approval process that could take anywhere from three months to six months.","Dan Eggers","So we shouldn\u2019t see the bulk of these contracts somewhere around year end I guess then the gas utilities could be a little bit later but within the next six months to nine months we will know how firm and who is presumably going to take the capacity?","Lee Olivier","Yes. I think that\u2019s a good estimate of the time six months to nine months is a good estimate.","Dan Eggers","Okay, very good. Thank you, guys.","Jeff Kotkin","Thanks Dan. Next question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from UBS. Good morning Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Good morning. So the first quick follow-up on the last question there if you can. In regards to the procurement, as you are thinking about what\u2019s contemplated obviously to early days for Connecticut and Massachusetts, will this ultimately be sufficient to get your projects off the ground, what\u2019s the quantity contemplated at least as you are seeing the frameworks proposed between just the two states today to get your project and plus other projects off the ground, what\u2019s the total volume, if you will?","Lee Olivier","Julien, this is Lee. You are referring to the gas side?","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Yes indeed.","Lee Olivier","Yes. In the gas side, we expect to get something very, very close to the 900,000 decatherms per day.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Okay, great. And then second question, somewhat related going towards to the other side of the house on the transmission, as you look at the Massachusetts legislation, how do you think about that tying into the present RFP that you just discussed, would that ultimately be an upsizing or how would that ultimately get feathered together?","Lee Olivier","And this is in regards to the three state electric RFP and Governor Baker\u2019s proposed legislation.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Exactly, how do you see those two working together?","Lee Olivier","Currently, without that legislation the Massachusetts really would be interested in this deliverability commitment model whereby you buy essentially \u2013 you pay for transmission and you get a supplier on the other end that will deliver electricity on an agreed upon, essentially capacity factor or numbers of megawatt hours over the course of the year. So that would be their option there. If the Governor Baker\u2019s legislation passes, then you really have the full range inside of the free state RFP. You would have the deliverability model. You can do transmission with PPAs or they could do PPAs as well. So just in the full range of what the options are in the current RFP.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Great. Thank you.","Jeff Kotkin","Thank you, Julien. Our next question is from Steven Berg from Morgan Stanley. Good morning Steven.","Steven Berg","Good morning. Thanks for your time. I wanted to follow-up on Dan's question just on the approval process and Lee you laid out sort of a 6 month to 9 month timeframe. On the gas side, could you give us some indication in terms of just key regulatory items we should be trying to follow throughout the course of the fall and through the winter time just so that we can better understand sort of the sequence or the key things we should be looking for there?","Lee Olivier","Yes. Clearly, a key thing is the RFP process in Connecticut that will be run by R&D, which we expect to take place this fall. It will be the signing of the precedent agreements by the EDCs and LDCs, because it\u2019s both and the filing of those precedent agreements that will take place essentially late third quarter, early fourth quarter, it will be the approval by the Massachusetts DPU of the RFP process. So, those are the kinds of things that you can expect to see, not the approval of the RFP process, but the approval of the docket that allows the EDCs to purchase gas infrastructure. So, those are some, again I said the pre-filing will be late this year and you will hear \u2013 we will continue to do the further rollout of our Acushnet facility, our LNG facility in Acushnet and you will hear more about that.","Steven Berg","Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. And just shifting gears over to just follow-up on what you have mentioned in Massachusetts with the Governor\u2019s legislation proposal. It\u2019s great that it sounds like it\u2019s a key priority for the Governor. Could you just speak to for the proposal broadly, any your sense for, are there key elements of or sort of features that have drawn our position or is this something that is generally that you think broadly you have supported politically, how do you kind of think about the politics of it?","Lee Olivier","Well, look, Jim you may want to catch up that one a little bit.","Jim Judge","I mean, Steven, this is Jim. I would characterize it as similar to what we saw in Connecticut. Governor Malloy\u2019s Connecticut energy strategy recognized that there are low-cost clean sources available in terms of Canadian Hydro that can help the state achieve its carbon reduction goals. I think the same mentality exists in Massachusetts among the policymakers. So, obviously its draft legislation at this stage would need to be approved on Beacon Hill and then signed by the Governor, but we think there is recognition that clean resources are available and within reach and we need to sort of be on with it in terms of enabling the commitments to be made.","Steven Berg","Great, thank you very much.","Jeff Kotkin","Thanks, Steven. Next question is from Travis Miller from Morningstar. Good morning, Travis.","Travis Miller","Good morning. Thank you. On the O&M cost side, if you take out that business that you guys divested there, how are you thinking in terms of tracking your O&M savings targets for the year, behind ahead, on track, so far this year?","Jim Judge","Yes, the guidance that we gave, Travis, for the year was O&M reductions of 2% to 3%. And when we adjust out the sale of that electric contracting business, I would say we are probably closer to 4% year-to-date. So, we are out little ahead of it. I would caveat that by saying that we do know that there is some timing in those numbers that we have gas and electrical maintenance plans that are lagging behind slightly. So, we will probably catch up on some of that. So, while we are ahead of plan year-to-date, I think the guidance continues to be 2% to 3% for the year that we are comfortable in giving. And that nets out obviously excluded the business that we have sold here in the second quarter.","Travis Miller","Okay. And then what was the full earnings impact, the bottom line impact from that business, if you include that revenue?","Jim Judge","It was relatively small fractions of $0.01. We have $2 million a year that order of magnitude.","Travis Miller","Okay, great. Thanks so much.","Jeff Kotkin","Thanks, Travis. Next question is from Shar Pourreza from Guggenheim. Good morning, Shar.","Shar Pourreza","Good morning. Just one question on Northern Pass, the Jobs program that was announced as well as the property tax payments reductions, can we just get a little bit of a sense on what formed the basis of those terms with this from feedback you received from constituents within the state and sort of \u2013 is this sort of the foundation for settlements?","Lee Olivier","Yes, Shar, this is Lee Olivier. We are not looking at this as a foundation for settlement, because we really believe that the process that\u2019s in place now in New Hampshire is best lift through kind of a litigated process. We think ultimately out the other end it will have more integrity if it\u2019s through the litigated process. Clearly, New Hampshire wants to understand, being the host, they want to understand the values of that line to New Hampshire from the standpoint and what does it do to lower electric cost to the extent that they can have a power purchase agreement, to the extent that it creates jobs both during the construction in permanent jobs, to the extent that there is other financial value to the state. And so this is after a lot of conversations with elected leaders, municipal officials and other key stakeholders in the region, including obviously, labor, the environment. And so what we will have when we announced the project will be a comprehensive value proposition that we will present to New Hampshire that will provide significant benefit in terms of jobs, revenues, tax revenues and other support for the state over a long period of time. So, we believe, coupled with the draft, EIS, coupled with our own outreach around the existing route and changes that we could make reasonably that the combination of all of those will have wide acceptance in the state when we file our application at the SEC in the early fall timeframe.","Shar Pourreza","Okay, got it. So, just one clarification, so the Jobs program and the property tax payments that was from conversations you have had with constituents within New Hampshire?","Lee Olivier","Yes. Well, the property tax payments will just be the standard mill rate on any given area. In other words, how much infrastructure is in a town, what\u2019s the particular towns\u2019 mill rate, what\u2019s that infrastructure worth, what do we have on the books and they will be paid accordingly, very standard is how we do all of our other transmission. And then the other services provide will have been, if you will, discussed with the key stakeholders and we will reach a joint decision on those.","Shar Pourreza","Okay, perfect. And then just on Access Northeast, once you get the firm contracts, sometime I guess next year, is there a point where we can get closer as far as upsizing the pipe through laterals and compressors? And then just lastly on the storage project, is there any kind of a quantification of what that spending outlook could be?","Lee Olivier","On the latter one, the storage, that\u2019s approximately $800 million of investment out of the $3 billion of the project investments, that\u2019s about $800 million. And those are, our first cut up the number is that\u2019s doing some engineering, heavy engineering consulting and understanding where the market is right now will mind for LNG. So, we think right now $800 million is a good number for 6.8 Bcf. And if you look at the project, the LNG would provide about 400,000 decatherms a day. The pipelines would provide around 500,000 decatherms. So, our project right now is approximately 1 Bcf and that\u2019s the project that we will proceed with at this time.","Shar Pourreza","Great, thank you so much.","Lee Olivier","You are welcome.","Jeff Kotkin","Thanks, sir. Next question is from Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs. Good morning, Mike.","Michael Lapides","Good morning, guys. Congrats on a good quarter. Two separate questions. The first one, you have two big projects, I mean, two really big projects, Northern Pass and Access Northeast. There are other market participants who are proposing new transmission down into New England, some of which with more underground routing than overhead. There is also one or two other parties, or consortium trying to get new major pipeline built. Can you talk for each of those two projects, the competitive positioning, the difference between your project recommendations and some of the others that are out there in the market?","Lee Olivier","Yes, sure. Michael, this is Lee. I think looking at Northern Pass, clearly, the entity or utility that has the most hydropower available in North America is Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec. And they are the closest geographically to New England, have tie lines into New England currently. And they are partners and they are only working on one interconnection between Qu\u00e9bec and New England and that\u2019s ours. Okay. So, they are not working on any other interconnection into New England. So, they are our partner here in New England. So where that would lead you is to if you look at other hydro sources, they would be in the [indiscernible] region, those are small in nature. They are under development, could show up in the next 15 years from now, but they don\u2019t provide any meaningful supply into New England during that period of time.","So, from that standpoint, our project, you know what 1,200 megawatts and you look at big part of what\u2019s driving Governor Baker and others, it\u2019s all about carbon reduction. If you want to get a picture, 50%, 80% carbon reduction by 2015, you need a lot of energy that doesn\u2019t produce carbon that runs around the clock. And clearly, that transmission project is the best one to go do that. There will be other projects that will be wind projects. Some of them may have run-of-the-river, firmed up by their wind with run-of-the-river firm and the wind up, but those are smaller projects in nature, the 400 to 500 megawatts. And then you are probably looking at some big wind projects, we will say farther up in places like Maine. You have all the issues of building large transmission infrastructure to correct relatively speaking small amounts of energy. When you look at the wind capacity factor of 35%, the intermittency of that probably doesn\u2019t have the huge carbon impact when you consider what you are paying for. So, that\u2019s kind what the competition looks like there.","On the gas side, it\u2019s real clear. We are building a project that interconnects with 70% of the region\u2019s generators. It is using existing right of ways, existing LNG facilities. It will pick up both EDCs, LDCs. It has future potential expansion capability. The competition is building a pipeline that is designed around serving LDCs and is in an area where it\u2019s very difficult to interact with a whole lot of that 70% of the generation I just talked about. So, we think from that standpoint, we think that project is very well-positioned. And we had a very successfully rollout of our LNG in Acushnet, Massachusetts earlier this week.","Michael Lapides","Got it. One follow-up easier question, when you are thinking about whether there is a new normal for gas utility, demand growth, especially at the residential and small commercial. How do you think about that and how different is that across your systems?","Jim Judge","Well, this is Jim. Long-term gas growth rate that we are assuming in our 5-year plan and the guidance that we have provided is 4%. Now, you may not get those growth numbers in other regions of the country, where gas penetration is more significant. We have a huge opportunity in Connecticut, as well as in Massachusetts in terms of converting customers to gas heat at their homes. In fact, we have got attractive mechanisms in Connecticut in terms of cost recovery for that. So, we are targeting about 11,000 conversions this year. In spite of the decline in oil prices, we are actually ahead of plan. I think we have signed up 4,800 in the first half of the year. So, we have got 2% plus growth just on new customers. And then obviously, the volume is likely to grow as well. So, we feel pretty confident about our 4% growth rate long-term. Again, I don\u2019t know that I would apply that to other utilities or other regions of the country.","Michael Lapides","Got it. Thanks guys. Much appreciate it.","Jeff Kotkin","Thanks, Michael. Our next question is from Andrew Weisel from Macquarie. Good morning Andrew.","Andrew Weisel","Good morning. Two questions on Northern Pass.","Jeff Kotkin","Andrew could you just speak up a little bit?","Andrew Weisel","Sure. Sorry, two questions on Northern Pass, first with the RFPs that you described, given that this is an economic base project, do those really matter if the project succeeds in bidding those RFPs and if so would that affect your economics, Hydro- Qu\u00e9bec\u2019s or the rate payers?","Lee Olivier","I think \u2013 this is Lee, Andrew. I think the way we would answer that is there is this existing RFP process that\u2019s been made available to all entrants. So obviously, we in HQ would enter this project into \u2013 to that process because to go forward independent of that would provide the others that would bid in and we are chosen to have the competitive advantage over Northern Pass. So I think it\u2019s appropriate that this project, takes part in that RFP process. So and in that case as you know, in the three states there would be some load share spreading of that cost over those three states. And each state obviously will be different based upon the specific part of there \u2013 either RPS portfolio and our carbon reduction mandates that they have. So that would have to be determined by the three states as part of the RFP process.","Andrew Weisel","Okay. Thank you. The next question from me DOE\u2019s draft EIS, the cost estimates of undergrounding look quite a bit lower than what you guys have talked about. The most expensive option they have is 4B at $2.1 billion to underground it, is there some disagreement in how they make that estimate, do you still think that it would be prohibitively expensive to underground it or in light of the DOE\u2019s estimate, is that something that you might consider?","Jim Judge","The numbers that DOE used in their estimates was a direct cost. They didn\u2019t use the fully loaded cost with AFUDC and financing. So they just used the direct cost that\u2019s why their costs were different than our costs.","Andrew Weisel","So do you still consider \u2013 I am sorry continue.","Jim Judge","The cost that we use are costs that are current industry market costs either for underground that we do or have done and\/or updates from our contractors. So we think our costs are pretty accurate. And I think the main difference with the DOE is they just used direct cost.","Andrew Weisel","Do you still see fully undergrounding as prohibitively expensive?","Jim Judge","Yes. We see underground \u2013 full undergrounding is a necessary, prohibitively expensive and a project \u2013 some project modifications could be done with some additional undergrounding that rates, essentially the issue raised inside of the DOE EIS. If you look at the DOE EIS and analyzes essentially three areas; the Northern area, the central area and the Southern are like the White Mountains National Forest. And all of the areas, if you look of the scenic impacts are all rated on the scale from zero to five. They are already either very low or low in terms of the scenic impact. Nevertheless, as a result of that outreach we have done, there is some additional undergrounding that can be done, that will make those numbers even lower without having to underground the entire project.","Andrew Weisel","Thank you very much.","Jeff Kotkin","Thank you, Andrew. Our next question is from Caroline Bone from Deutsche Bank. Good morning Caroline.","Caroline Bone","Good morning, just a minor question really because most of my questions have been asked, but is there anything that could cause you to book a reserve related to the pending second and third ROE complaints, would the ALJ decision be potential catalyst?","Lee Olivier","There is a potential that the ALJ decision comes on by year end, I think they are targeting in fact at the late December number. And obviously we will assess the merits of that recommendation, whether or not it warrants a reserve or not. So the timing is such that we do expect that ALJ decision at the end of this year. However, the final FERC ruling on it would be the third quarter of 2016. So we will have to look at the facts and circumstances of that order before we could tell you whether it is going to be reserved or not.","Caroline Bone","Alright. Thanks guys.","Jeff Kotkin","Alright. Thank you, Caroline. We have no more questions in the queue. So we just want to thank everybody for joining us. We know you have additional calls later this morning but if you have follow-up questions, please give us a call. Thank you very much.","Jim Judge","Thank you."]}}
