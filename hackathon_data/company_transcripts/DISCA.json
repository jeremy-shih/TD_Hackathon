At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today Andrew Slabin, Executive Vice President, Global Investor Strategy. Please go ahead sir.","Andrew Slabin","Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us for Discovery's third quarter 2019 earnings call. Joining me today are David Zaslav, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Gunnar Wiedenfels, our Chief Financial Officer; JB Perrette, President and CEO, Discovery Networks International; and Peter Faricy CEO, Global Direct-to-Consumer.","You should have received our earnings release, but if not, feel free to access it on our website at www.corporate.discovery.com. On today's call we will begin with some opening comments from David and Gunnar, and then we will open the call for David, Gunnar, JB and Peter to take your questions.","Before we start, I would like to remind you that comments today regarding the company's future business plans, prospects of financial performance are forward-looking statements that we make pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are made based on management's current knowledge and assumptions about future events, and may involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations.","In providing projections and other forward-looking statements, the company disclaims any intent or obligation to update them. For additional information on important factors that could affect these expectations, please see our Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2018 and our subsequent filings made with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.","And with that, let's turn the call over to David.","David Zaslav","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss our Q3 results and outlook. Discovery reported an impressive quarter of operating and financial results, with performance at the top end of our competitive set. Across all businesses and regions, we met or exceeded our guidance, with a notable acceleration in our international segment high single-digit growth. Overall, a very strong set of numbers by any measure.","I believe we have the best operating team in media today. I am proud of what we have accomplished both in the quarter and since our acquisition of Scripps early last year. It is a story of promises made and promises delivered and in most cases overdelivered.","To that point, well before we closed on Scripps, we talked about our goal of being able to generate $3 billion of free cash flow. Before the acquisition, we were generating about $1.4 billion and Scripps was generating about $700 million. Today, we are at $2.9 billion for the trailing 12-month period. And having generated nearly $900 million in free cash flow this quarter, we feel good about that goal.","On net leverage, we had been relentlessly focused on reducing our financial leverage from the post-merger peak of nearly 4.8 times net debt to AOIBDA. And at the end of Q3, our net leverage of 3.1 times is close to the low end of our target range.","We've begun to return capital to our shareholders having repurchased $300 million of our equity or nearly 12 million shares in Q3, with additional purchases in Q4, while at the same time reinvesting in our future growth strategy.","From the beginning, we viewed Scripps as much more than a portfolio of cable channels, but rather a trove of global IP, with among the strongest lifestyle brands, programming and personalities in the world. We envisioned a major opportunity to not only enhance their position globally, but also to carve out a differentiated direct-to-consumer strategy.","A few weeks ago, we launched another key component of that strategy with Food Network Kitchen, a world-class customer experience in the kitchen with live and on-demand cooking classes with the most celebrated chefs from around the globe.","We work closely on all elements of the product with our partner Amazon over the last year to get it off the ground. We are very pleased with the product and very excited about the opportunity of value creation it presents.","And to support our broad strategic initiatives, we've taken a major step forward in the seamless rollout of our singularly owned and operated tech stack, on to which all of our direct-to-consumer platforms will sit from Dplay across Europe and Motor Trend OnDemand to the Eurosport Player, our Global Cycling Network, GOLFTV, Magnolia and our factual content service.","Everything we said we were going to do, we've done. And looking forward, we are equally focused on delivering against an aggressive set of objectives within an industry undergoing real disruption. Yet Discovery has always punched above its weight, by being nimble opportunistic and flexible in leveraging every opportunity to put our content and beloved brands everywhere consumers are across an unrivaled global footprint.","It is core to how we operate. It's our North Star and the engine behind what drives our broader strategy and investments in our future. Today there are more ways than ever to get content to consumers. And we are as well positioned as anyone to leverage every path and platform to monetize our content investment, across both linear and direct-to-consumer.","It starts with strategic decisions we made many years ago to control our destiny and build long-term value, by owning and controlling our IP globally, content and brands that people love, which was further strengthened by the Scripps portfolio.","We generate roughly 8,000 hours of original content annually, alongside a library of titles in every language that aggregates several hundred thousand. It's a huge competitive advantage, especially as we watch our industry peers on the premium scripted side pay whatever it takes to amass enough content for a slice of the fragmenting entertainment space within the direct-to-consumer market. We are not in that series scripted and movie side of the entertainment business. It's crowded. It's aggressive. It's expensive and it's risky.","As women over the past year around America have put their TV sets on, they can choose to watch movies, scripted series. They could watch anything they want. But more have chosen to watch our programming than any other media company, which makes us the number one media company for women in the United States.","In addition, our strategy of pivoting into sports has made us the largest producer of live sports outside the U.S., another aggregation of IP that we think is high on the value chain. Our investment in world-class IP defines our beloved brands in areas people love and drives powerful engagement across our portfolio.","Our international footprint across 200-plus markets is unrivaled, with an average of 10 to 12 free-to-air or cable channels in every key television market. Owning great content that people love, strong brands and operating at scale is important, but no longer enough. We are also focused on building industry-leading capabilities and proprietary tech IP so we can create truly compelling customer experiences and ecosystems.","As I noted we launched Food Network Kitchen two weeks ago, a first of its kind experience offering the most complete food and cooking digital ecosystem, with content and interactive features, as well as the largest roster of iconic cooking talent.","We are the peloton of food but we are priced for the masses. We'd like to be in everybody's kitchen. It is powered by a unique partnership with Amazon, as well as the biggest promotional push ever across our network portfolio, with food and cooking being big funnels to drive and create value.","Food Network Kitchen is also the first new product to launch on our owned and operated tech stack. And it is becoming increasingly apparent that owning and operating our own tech architecture is a distinct competitive advantage and one that should allow us to further scale opportunities across multiple verticals, meaningfully driving global functionality, efficiencies and speed to market. Peter Faricy who oversaw a marketplace for Amazon has been a big help to us and he's here with us today and will be able to answer some questions during Q&A.","Switching gears to our core traditional business. Our performance has been solid. Though domestic ratings are a work in progress across certain properties networks like TLC have been nothing short of a phenomenon in our industry. The team at TLC has done an extraordinary job turning around and building that network. Just two years ago it was the ninth or 10th network in America for women. Today it continues to be the number one ad-supported cable network in prime time for women 25 to 54 and women 18 to 49.","Together with TLC and our other networks it allows us to reach almost 35% of women on Sunday nights in America. It's a great, great story. It's what we do. And we're attacking every one of our channels for growth. And at HGTV, A Very Brady Renovation delivered its biggest hit of all time, a prime example of us leaning into our scale with an ambitious creative swing supported across our broad network portfolio. ","We recently announced that the Brady Bunch gang will return for a holiday special. ","Our portfolio performance helped us secure our position as the number 1 TV destination for women 25 to 54, once again during the quarter. And in fact for the better part of the year and our best-in-class GO apps along with products like Discovery Premiere and Engage form the backbone of a uniquely secular growth narrative within an industry that has been largely static.","And as such, we are definitively taking share. On the international front our business continues to show signs of steady growth in part driven by continued programming and audience strength, traction of our direct-to-consumer products, as well as further integration of the Scripps content and brands around the world.","Once again our share of market and delivery across our top 10 markets was up with growth of 3% and 2% respectively building upon last quarter's very strong increases. Our international growth was driven by the highest Q3 ever for EMEA, led by strength in the U.K. and Italy both of which delivered record audiences in July and August, up 12% and 9% respectively.","This also has helped to insulate us from ongoing macro weakness in these key markets, especially in the U.K. where our commercial share of market has increased to roughly 8%. JB Perette is here with us and can discuss in more detail the strides we are making not just in Europe, but all around the globe.","With exciting locally differentiated streaming products gaining traction and expanding, we aim to become the Hulu equivalent in select TV markets in Europe. Our strategy in certain cases has been to partner with key local players that broaden the content offering and share of market.","In Germany our JV with ProSieben Joyn which combines 55 channels into one app has become a leading streaming platform since launching in June with more than four million monthly average users.","And we announced a few weeks back that in our largest European market, Poland we will launch a single streaming destination to access a powerhouse of Polish content in partnership with leading media and distribution company Polsat. We are very excited about this opportunity and our team is looking at other large market opportunities.","I would also add that getting deals like this done is not easy. We lean on our local teams and the credibility and relationships they have built over the years. There's a lot to appreciate in getting these structured deals, content, technology and partnership in the aggregate off the ground.","There are a number of markets where we aggregate all of our content and go-to-market alone. And the brand we use is Dplay. And Dplay has now expanded to 10 countries internationally including; Japan, the Nordics, Italy, Spain and most recently in the U.K. and Ireland.","Dplay has some great momentum particularly after having been repositioned onto our own tech platform and it's given us a lot of learning about how to position a large aggregated content service.","People are consuming more content in the aggregate than ever before, but every programmer is battling for people's free time and attention. And we are driving deeper connections with our fans in a far more cost-effective manner than many others. Behind our brands and personalities big personalities, which have delighted audiences for in some cases decades, we are taking that engagement and those personalities and putting it on steroids, whether it is unique view-and-do experiences like Food Network Kitchen, aggregated AVOD and SVOD platforms in Europe and even looking at lifting large collections of our channels and taking them on to OTT and pushing them into distribution around the globe.","We have great assets, resources, IP and an adept management team with local knowledge and infrastructure that are well equipped to succeed across the ecosystem. We are super excited about the direction and opportunities ahead. Our operating performance is strong and stable. And while the industry is undergoing secular challenges, we are facing disruption head on with a very confident operating posture and strategic position.","Our focused financial investments in our world-class IP and relentless pursuit of new revenue opportunities makes us a stronger company than we were a year ago and one that is on a path to continued sustainable success.","Many thanks and I will turn the call over now to Gunnar.","Gunnar Wiedenfels","Thank you David and thank you everyone for joining us today. I am very pleased with our third quarter operational and financial performance. We continue to build momentum as we deliver on our strategic objectives to transform and pivot Discovery.","I'd like to share some financial highlights from our third quarter. My comments will be in constant currency terms for our international business as well as for total company unless otherwise stated. And please refer to our earnings release published earlier this morning for a more comprehensive view of all the drivers of our third quarter financial results.","In the third quarter, Discovery again achieved healthy operating performance delivering 3% U.S. advertising growth, 6% U.S. affiliate growth 10% international advertising growth which included a full quarter of impact from the consolidation of the three networks acquired from UKTV which added about 300 basis points of growth and 8% international affiliate growth.","We grew total company adjusted OIBDA 9% driven by revenue growth and 7% decline in U.S. expenses which helped us to maintain an almost flat expense base. As we've previously flagged, we've anticipated that expenses in our international business will ramp up as we invest for future growth.","Turning to one of my priority topics, we reported $884 million of free cash flow in the third quarter keeping our trailing 12 months free cash flow at $2.9 billion which is inclusive of about $200 million of cash restructuring costs, as well as the funding for our growth investments. At quarter end our net leverage was 3.1 times.","Now let me share some forward-looking commentary starting with the four key revenue drivers for the fourth quarter 2019. First, for U.S. advertising growth is expected to be again in the low single-digit range driven by the typical dynamics in pricing, digital monetization, the health of the market and of course the impact from ratings which remains the greatest variable impacting U.S. ad revenue growth.","While ratings of some key networks have been challenged in the third quarter, we have doubled the amount of premiere content on the Food Network for the holiday season and we are excited about our programming slate for the remainder of the year such that our Q4 estimate of low single-digit growth could turn out to be conservative. ","In addition, we expect to continue to benefit from increased viewership on our GO platform further growth from our data-driven Engage product as well as upward CPM pressure from innovations such as Discovery Premiere all of which are contributing to our top-of-peer performance and revenue growth, despite the noted ratings headwinds. ","Second, U.S. affiliate is projected to increase in the 3% to 5% range for the fourth quarter and we reaffirm our full year guidance for U.S. affiliate revenue growth in the mid-single-digit range. As you know in the fourth quarter we will let our initial inclusion in certain virtual MVPDs such as Hulu and Sling TV. Accordingly, implicit in this projection is a sequential decline in our core subscriber growth.","Third, we expect international advertising growth in the mid-single-digit range, driven by share growth in our top markets and contributions from our digital investments. Contribution from the consolidated UKTV Lifestyle Business is projected to again add 2 to 3 percentage points of growth. While the balance of our international advertising business remains healthy there are some increasingly more challenging markets such as Mexico and Argentina, creating an overall more volatile picture and one that we will keep a close eye on during the remainder of the quarter.","And finally, international affiliate growth is expected to be again in the high single-digit range supported by favorable terms in certain new affiliate deals, new channel launches and traction from our suite of D2C products.","Turning to total company guidance. We continue to expect solid free cash flow growth for the remainder of the year even as we continue to invest in the build-out of our expanded digital ecosystem and our previously noted step-up in CapEx from such items as global real estate consolidation and transformation projects related to technology infrastructure and software development.","Turning now to our direct-to-consumer investments. We now expect the impact from direct-to-consumer investments on full year 2019 adjusted OIBDA to be at the lower end of the $300 million to $400 million range we have previously discussed. And though, we again enjoyed another quarter of total company margin improvement, which was 100 basis points higher this quarter, the expected ramp in our digital investment spending will flow through more meaningfully in Q4 as we have previously detailed with you.","Turning now to our capital allocation strategy, our priorities remain consistent. We continue to expect to: Number one optimize leverage. While we are nicely within our three to 3.5 times net leverage range, we expect to continue to delever further towards the very low end of this range.","Number two, concurrently we will continue to evaluate value-enhancing investments along with strategic M&A. And number three, finally, we will opportunistically return excess capital to shareholders. As noted in the third quarter, we repurchased nearly 12 million Class C common shares for a total consideration of $300 million at an average price of $25.93 per share with additional purchases thus far into Q4.","Before I close, let me quantify the expected impact that foreign exchange will have on our 2019 financial results. Given the movement of the dollar at current spot rates, FX is now expected to negatively impact revenues by roughly $245 million to $255 million and AOIBDA by $90 million to $100 million versus our 2018 reported results.","In closing, our results today highlight the consistency of our company's overall performance, particularly at a time of great change within our industry. And I couldn't be more pleased with our strategic and financial position.","Looking ahead, we remain confident in our ability to generate healthy free cash flow and execute on our long-term growth initiatives. Thank you for your time this morning. And now David, JB, Peter and I will be happy to answer any questions that you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jessica Ehrlich with Bank of America. You may proceed with your question.","Jessica Ehrlich","Thank you so much. Can you give us some color on what's going on with Food Network Kitchen. I know it's only two weeks but how many I guess users do you have so far? Can you give us some color on ancillary revenue? The shopping app look is amazing. And then on just D2C kind of what your view is? Where will discovery be over the next five years? What are the services can you launch? You have so many brands. What do you think that this will look like to you? Thank you.","David Zaslav","Thanks, Jessica. I'm going to hand it over to Peter for the food stuff, but let me address the broader issue. We have -- as you know, we've really shied away from these seven or eight players that are [indiscernible] fighting it out in this entertainment area.","It's getting more and more expensive and we believe that three or four are going to make it. And it's going to be a lot of carnage and very, very difficult great companies and good luck to them. But when we look at the overall space, we really have two strategies.","One is the people will have three of those or maybe four of those but then they still love golf. They still love natural history and science. We together with everything we got from the BBC, now have a definitive collection of content with Planet Earth, Blue Planet, space, ocean, science that if you think about when we were younger a family would buy World Book or Encyclopedia Britannica because every family and every child should see it.","We have a collection of natural history and science content not just in scale in having the majority of it that exists in every language but a collection of content that every family and every child should watch, which is very differentiated from watching scripted and series movies.","We have Chip and Joanna Gaines and we'll be launching in 2020 with them direct-to-consumer. And we have cycling and cars. And so we're going in these niches. We're doing a very good job and Peter will speak to it. We are developing a uniform platform so it's very easy for us to just jump on. That platform has interactivity. It has the ability to do -- have commercial to buy things, to buy cycling equipment, to buy golf equipment. And so we think that that's a terrific strategy and it's starting to bear real fruit for us.","In addition, we're doing very well with our GO, our direct-to-consumer product, which is growing massively. And it gave us real confidence that people that are not subscribing to cable love our content together with Dplay, which is scaling around the world.","And so outside the U.S., you see that our strategy is becoming clearer. We've gotten together with ProSieben in Germany and we announced that we had 4 million subscribers as of last quarter. ProSieben announced this morning that there's now 5 million subscribers that are using Joyn on a regular basis.","And when you think of Germany you got Sky Deutschland that's been in business there for 10 years. They don't have 4 million subscribers. Now they have paying subscribers. But in four months or five months we have five million users that are spending significant amount of time with us with Joyn. And the reason is we've aggregated 55 channels and a massive amount of great local content.","So Netflix is doing all their thing. Disney will do their thing. But we have local, local, local. Same thing is true in Poland. We announced the deal with Polsat, which is -- we're the largest player in Poland with TVN, the second largest player is Polsat, the third largest player is the government.","Polsat and we are coming together to create our own local Netflix product. It worked. It's working very well in Germany. It's working well in Northern Europe with Dplay for us. And we think by aggregating with others we could really be differentiated with local. So that's our European strategy and it's rolling out. It's ahead of plan. We're learning a ton and our platform is working.","In the U.S., I'll just say that, we're now starting to examine a new opportunity. I mentioned it in my comments that people could watch anything but they're spending -- we're looking at the viewing patterns of our content our -- the aggregate of all of our channels makes us not just number one for women. But if you think about the basic cable ecosystem, people could watch anything they want but more of them are choosing to watch us.","And you have some of these platforms launching with eight Series 10 series or a bunch of movies and series to come. We have hundreds of thousands of hours that people grew up on. And when you aggregate all of our product in the U.S. we're looking now at whether we should just aggregate and you have eight people that are doing entertainment and scripted and we're examining the opportunity of -- in addition to what we're doing here of aggregating all of our content in the U.S. and having something that looks very different is very deep, has great personalities, great brands secured right a through.","And so more to come on that in the next several months. But it feels very good right now to us in terms of our niche strategy with passion and depth view and do our strategy in Europe of aligning with the other big players and accelerating into that with Dplay and Joyn and with Polsat. And finally, with all the success we're having here in the U.S. we're saying hey, maybe why not? It looks like we have the most win, we may have the most compelling content and the deepest library of anyone. So with that let me pass off to Peter on Food Network Kitchen which is off to a great, great start and we're super proud of it.","Peter Faricy","Good morning, Jessica. Yes, we're super pleased with the results so far. One of the biggest lessons of my time at Amazon is, if you really want to drive the outputs and the outputs here are things like subscribers and revenue, at the very beginning of launching a new product, you really have to focus on the inputs. So we're obsessed right now with focusing on the inputs.","And the inputs that I'll give you some feedback on are about customer ratings, the customer experience, how engaged are they and what do the early customers think of the product. So far we're very pleased. So on the -- one of the biggest benefits of having our own technology that David talked about earlier is the fact that we can build a product that we know consumers will love. And the feedback so far has been terrific. So we have a 4.1 rating across Amazon devices, 4.5 on Android and 4.8 on iOS. So, coming out of the gate, we're very pleased with that feedback.","And one of the things that we're seeing from consumers is that many of them were already interacting with us before on Food Network. But in particular, we're looking harder at the feedback from brand-new customers. So these are people -- this is the first time they have an experience with Food Network. Their ratings are even higher than those ratings I just gave you. So that's a good leading indicator that we're headed in the right direction.","Number two, as expected the star of the show, if you will, is really our live and on-demand cooking classes. We're really pleased with the engagement so far. Some of the most popular classes -- it won't surprise you. It's Bobby Flay cooking pork chops.","One of my favorites was Molly Yeh doing fried cheese pickles. But -- it's a fun product. People are engaged. They're asking questions to the chefs. It's kind of a unique product and a unique experience, and we're beginning to see some pick up across social media of how much people love it.","For those of you who have the app, which I hope has everybody on this call, we have Alex Guarnaschelli, Marc Murphy, Rachael Ray, Geoffrey Zakarian and Bobby Flay over the next five days. Bobby Flay, I think is doing three classes on Sunday. So, we have this thing loaded with the best chefs in the world.","The consumer demand on the classes has been so high so far that we're actually going to make two changes. We're going to expand the number of live classes from 25 per week to 40. We're also happy to announce the opening of a brand-new Food Network Kitchen studio in Los Angeles. So we're going to double. We have this Food Network Kitchen here in New York.","We're going to double our capacity by opening up a studio in Los Angeles. That will allow us to serve customers all across the U.S. well, but also allow us frankly to add more and more classes over time. So, the live and on-demand classes, we're very pleased with so far.","And then finally, as you probably know, I think we've talked about this before. November, December and January are the Super Bowl of the cooking and food season. And we are very excited about the marketing plans we have.","You will not be able to watch any one of our networks across the Discovery portfolio and not see a reference back to Food Network Kitchen. If you happen to be watching Food Network of the cooking channel, you'll see a lot of very direct references to you can go make this right now on Food Network Kitchen. So we're very excited about that.","Number two David mentioned the partnership with Amazon has just been terrific. Most consumers in the U.S. will be on Amazon between now and the end of the year as we have this big holiday shopping season, and I'm happy to say Food Network Kitchen will be featured prominently across the site.","And that includes all the Alexa devices and it also includes the very popular Fire TV. So Fire TV has millions of customers right now. And if you tune into Fire TV, front and center is Food Network Kitchen being featured. So we feel like we're on the right track at this point. And net-net we're very pleased with the first couple of weeks of results.","The only thing I'd add to David's comments about the bigger portfolio for direct-to-consumer is we publicly announced the couple of things for next year. David mentioned Magnolia. We've also talked about our factual product with the BBC. We also plan to rollout something with cycling and global cycling network.","And then I would just add to David's comments and say stay tuned, because we have a bunch of good ideas and we're going to be pretty aggressive I think coming out of the gate.","I'll just close with -- a lot of people wonder what was it about this opportunity that drove me from Amazon to come to Discovery. And I think it's really -- we have the most powerful brands in the world. We have these very dedicated loyal consumer bases. And now we're building products that they love. And I think that gives us a chance to really, really innovate and change this industry. So I couldn't be more excited to be here and looking forward to sharing more results as we go forward.","Jessica Ehrlich","Peter, can you just elaborate a little bit on the ancillary revenue opportunity, the shopping and selling other products, whether it's kitchenware or other things?","Peter Faricy","Yeah. I think that's something I'd love to talk about more over time. I think we continue to see people using that feature, but I'd love to give you more feedback on that. And also, we've talked about we want to launch in 2020 the ability for people to be able to buy kitchen utensils and kitchen equipment as well. So, I'd love to talk about -- more about that in a future call.","But right now, I think one of the biggest signals we're excited about is it's very hard to have live classes all over the nation every single day. The technology has worked outstandingly well. And that's one of the reasons that I think we really feel like we can scale up the number of classes.","We even did a series of classes last weekend with Molly Yeh in North Dakota, live from her actual kitchen which was just wonderful to watch. The customer feedback was incredible. So, we're excited. This has a lot of potential avenues for growth. And right now, we're all in on all those avenues.","Jessica Ehrlich","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Vijay Jayant with Evercore ISI. You may proceed with your question.","Vijay Jayant","Great. Thanks. Since we have Peter on the phone, I just wanted to get any sense of sort of the size of your digital opportunity today. I mean you keep talking about all these ions on the file that are sort of growing. But if you had to sort of size Joyn, Dplay, PGA, Eurosport and the like, excluding your virtual MVPD how big is that? How is that sort of offsetting some of the linear pressures that we have in the business? And obviously you have a lot of growth coming. So any help on that would be really, really helpful.","And then probably for Gunnar, your margins keep going up. Obviously, we stopped talking about synergies, the $600 million number. It's probably hard to even quantify that now. But how much more room is there on just the Scripps-related synergies going forward? Thanks so much.","Gunnar Wiedenfels","Okay. Vijay let me comment on those. So I'll start with your margin point. I mean, as you know we had already guided for no margin increase for the third quarter and came in a little better. But I continue to say do not expect further margin increase. We are operating at industry-leading margins. And that being said we will absolutely continue to be laser-focused on the efficiency of this company. We have a lot more initiatives in store. We're continuing to improve our cash conversion, et cetera. But as you know, we're also looking at a number of initiatives on the digital side that Peter just referred to that, we will be funding as we look forward. So, no more margin expansion to be expected, even though we continue to be super focused.","Vijay Jayant","Before you get to the next point, in this area of digital JV, you were the driving force on the Joyn deal on this aggregation strategy in Europe with Polsat and us and going across Europe and leading out with Dplay. Could you just talk a little bit about those, because those are -- it really is a differentiator?","Peter Faricy","When we see, David and myself, Bruce Campbell runs our corporate development were all at NBC back in the days when 10-plus years ago when we created Hulu here in the U.S. and we've seen what that has done over the last 10 years. And so, we not only are believers in the aggregation strategy and the power of local in that context for the U.S. market, but we know that that can work and it can scale meaningfully.","And so in a world where a lot of English language international players are, as David said, spending a lot of money on English language scripted content. At the end of the day, for the last three decades as a company, we've learned that as you go out internationally local is incredibly important. And while some of those companies may eventually get to that and certainly are investing in certain areas, it's hard. It takes time. And we already have in many of these markets, very strong positions with the leading local players.","And so, we believe that the local strategy is critically important, can be very viable and can be a leading video aggregation streaming service, just like it's proven out here in the U.S. with Hulu. And so whether it's Joyn, whether it's our Dplay apps, we have now -- and you look across certainly the European footprint, we have the leading position in Europe of being able to connect the dots over time on a -- the leading local streaming services in each of the big markets across Europe.","And it's working. It's scaling in the markets we have it. And we think that these things are hard. They're not easy to do, but we have real track record. We have experience doing them. We have people who know how to execute these deals. And then we know how to build the right teams and hire the right people to get these up and running. And so, we think that's a very differentiated approach for us that is unique to our strategy across Europe.","Gunnar Wiedenfels","And maybe to the question of the size of the opportunity again, as we've said many times, for us it's too early to be talking about a framework of P&L metrics for you guys at this point. But let me just say, we were convinced that it can be material. We've got super passionate audiences in all of those verticals.","And as a matter of fact, if you look at our numbers that we're reporting this quarter, last quarter and what we're seeing for next quarter, we're starting to see some material contributions come through on the top-line. And I only see that expanding as we move forward.","And the other thing to keep in mind is from a P&L perspective, all of these verticals that we're talking about have the great advantage again that we're not in the business of $5 million per hour production. But we have the benefit of true utility content at very low costs. So I'm excited about the opportunity not only from a revenue growth, but also from the bottom-line perspective. Again, with that being said, obviously, we want to make the right investments. We're not netting for margins in the short-term, but we'll manage for a sustainable long-term setup of this company.","Peter Faricy","Thank you, Bob. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan. You may proceed with your question.","Alexia Quadrani","Hi. Thank you. As we look into 2020, any sense how much the Summer Olympics might contribute in, sort of, revenues and costs next year? And is that -- would that be a great vehicle maybe Olympics in general to promote your DTC services?","Gunnar Wiedenfels","Alexia, 100%. It's a great year. It's an exciting event that's coming up. And certainly with the transition that JB and Peter have managed for the Eurosport Player it's now on our own tech stack, et cetera. So we're in attack mode for the player for sure. So it's an important event.","Financially as we have discussed previously, remember we're going to see about 30% of the total rights costs for the Olympics come through next year. So that is a significant chunk of events that is going to hit the third quarter. And if you keep in mind the monetization, we're exploiting these rights across all levers sublicensing advertising affiliate deals and then our own direct-to-consumer deal. So those revenue streams are all contributing to the monetization, but obviously over a longer term while the expenses are going to hit in the third quarter.","And it's also fair to say that given this is later in the year, we'll have less time in the year 2020 to recoup some of those investments because especially if you look at player revenues from additional subscribers affiliate renewals et cetera, those are longer-term impacts on the top line. I hope that's helpful.","David Zaslav","Having said that, it is a great magnet for massive audiences and attention to the quality of what we're able to do. We're the only company that can have the Olympics in 25 languages with local hosts. It's one of the reasons that the PGA TOUR came to us. It's the reason why Thomas Bach came to us to innovate. It was in terms of innovation. Last time we were on every platform and we reached more people under 25 than ever before. And we were just getting started. JB talk a little bit about how we can use the Olympics not just for sustainable growth which you've done but also to promote a lot of these other products golf cycling the Eurosport Player.","JB Perrette","Yes. But, I think, if we look at the Olympics as having several different value streams aside from the direct ones that Gunnar pointed out. And so two or three that are additional to that. Number one, obviously, with the world turning for that 17-day period to the games right in advance of also the fall season launches in a lot of our bigger entertainment and free-to-air markets in Europe we use the games massively as a promotional vehicle to drive all fall seasons and our new lineups across the network.","So as a marketing push it will be hugely helpful. It was incredibly successful for us in PyeongChang. Realizing that PyeongChang obviously in the Winter Olympics were only popular in a fraction of the European continent where winter sports are more popular. This obviously being the summer is a totally Pan European and every market is interested in this. So we'll use it from a marketing vehicle for our content mainly.","The second piece is I think you've heard David previously, say in PyeongChang even though it was off-cycle in terms of games that probably had a little less visibility because it's winter a little less visibility because it was PyeongChang and not Tokyo which is getting a lot more buzz and a lot more awareness to it than 2018 did. We drove 0.5 million new subscribers to the player in that period during the winter. For now for the summer where the games are popular across the entire continent, where we have the only place you'll be able to get all the games will be on the player. We think we can use that to drive greater -- a much greater penetration for our Eurosport Player product.","And then the third is as we look at the broader line of the direct-to-consumer products that Peter and the team are building whether that be Dplay, obviously, Eurosport Player and potentially some of the other products that we are rolling out whether it be Motor Trend et cetera using the Olympics also to drive awareness to the rest of the direct-to-consumer portfolio and try and drive subs in a broader range of our portfolio. Those are really three major priorities for us as we look at leveraging this huge event and the biggest global event in the world to drive value for us across our portfolio.","Alexia Quadrani","Thank you. And again just, sort of, staying on international for a quick follow-up. Just given the initial success of the launch of your Network Kitchen and your expansion plans already in the U.S., I guess, how should we think about the time line for the rollout in other international markets?","Peter Faricy","Yes. We -- our current thinking is regrouping at the very beginning of 2020 and choosing with Amazon our partners in this a few more countries to launch across the world. And I think JB and I are very excited about the opportunity. I think, JB mentioned on the previous call we actually have some food assets outside the U.S. that are quite popular. That extends all the way through Asia as well and the Middle East. And so we're going to kind of take a look at where we think we have the best localized content to leverage already because we like to own our own P and have a head start and -- where we can get the biggest benefit from having Amazon and where we think we can serve consumers best, but we absolutely plan to roll this product out beyond the U.S. in 2020.","Alexia Quadrani","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Drew Borst with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed with your question.","Drew Borst","Thank you for taking my questions. You guys outlined a lot of your DTC efforts that you already have in the marketplace. There's obviously a bunch on the come for next year. I was hoping that you -- just taking a step back, I want to understand the base of revenue that you guys have now like say this year? Because I feel like there's a lot of services. They're in a lot of different segments across a lot of different revenue lines. But I don't know if you'd be willing to share just sort of what is kind of the revenue of this broader DTC business globally say, for this year.","Gunnar Wiedenfels","Drew so, we don't break that out specifically because as you say it's several contributions in multiple lines of business in the two segments. But as I said before, it's starting to meaningfully contribute to revenue growth and it has been for a couple of quarters. And I expect more of that next year. And just to give you an order of magnitude it's several hundred million dollars of total direct-to-consumer revenues that we already have to-date.","Drew Borst","Okay. Thank you. And then you mentioned that -- the OIBDA impact of these investments you expect to be at a low end of the original $300 million to $400 million range. I was wondering if you might be willing to share what you're thinking for next year in terms of kind of an OIBDA impact?","Gunnar Wiedenfels","Yes. So let me take a step back here. When we defined that original $300 million to $400 million envelope keep in mind a lot of these individual products were business plans at that point. So there's a certain amount of uncertainty and we have been prioritizing products against each other. That's why we've come in at the lower end of that spend envelope around $300 million rather than towards the top end of the $400 million.","As I said earlier you should expect that in Q4 as we fully get behind Food Network Kitchen from a marketing perspective as well and all the other products we've got internationally that you'll see some more investments come through. And it's too early to talk about specific numbers for next year. I mean, we're still in the process of budgeting. But you shouldn't be surprised to see increased investments.","Keep in mind Food Network Kitchen is going to be a full year plus some global markets. We've got a handful of new markets coming online for golf. Eurosport Player is going to be the priority with the Olympics. Dplay has seen a tremendous run extremely successful in terms of the subscriber uptake. So we really want to get behind that as well. And then we've got new products coming to the market with Magnolia in -- around the summer with our factual products that's in the making. So with all that you should assume a little bit of an increase in investments. Again, too early to talk about specific numbers.","And then as we've said earlier as well I want to have the full flexibility to be able to get behind products that work because with all of these products it's the drumbeat that Peter laid out initially focused on the input factors make sure that we have the right product, make sure we're seeing the engagement of first adopters. And then once we're convinced that we're onto something, we really want to be able to get behind performance, marketing, and really spending up to lifetime value to scale those products quickly. So there's very likely again going to be a bit of a range as we talk about.","David Zaslav","A good way to think about it is, we're doing a terrific job, great leadership team driving down on the existing ecosystem, everywhere in the world. We're on the leading end of performance in terms of our ability to -- we're growing ratings outside the U.S., our ability to commercially monetize that, our relationships with distributors, the ability to launch new channels everywhere in the world where no one else can. So the existing ecosystem we're very effective and we're driving hard.","But what you're seeing now is we're mounting a massive attack with all this IP as our artillery on everybody else, because everyone should have our content. So whether it's Food Network Kitchen, whether it's Golf, whether it's the Eurosport Player, whether it's Motor Trend, Magnolia those are siloed passion driven attacks. And Dplay across Europe is picking up. Everybody that doesn't subscribe to cable and those who do subscribe to cable with SVOD and AVOD products and that's what we're looking at in the U.S. is stepping up a full-on attack, mount and attack with our differentiated content against -- to serve --super serve and serve viewers and people that own phones and people that just love the characters and content that we have and delight in the fact that we're differentiated.","Everybody knows who we are. We don't promote ourselves because we have a show. We don't have to tell everybody come watch a show. They want to come hang out with the characters we have and the brands that we have. And so we're starting -- we're looking at things very differently because the passion for us as a group of IP seems to be very, very sustainable and strong.","Drew Borst","Yeah. And I assume David, what you're talking about seems to be like taking your channels and offering a suite of direct-to-consumer suite. And I just want to confirm, I assume you wouldn't say this, but there's no contractual restrictions with your current MVPD partners in terms of content or anything that would restrict your decision making or your ability to do something like that just to confirm?","David Zaslav","We have an ability to do whatever we want, but we're probably the most -- we've been the most friendly company in terms of the existing ecosystem. And we're looking to continue. We're talking to existing distributors. We're in the marketplace. We started by talking to customers about their confusion, about all these offers of what scripted series should I watch now? I got 20 of them in the hopper. And we're finding some great information about what we have and how valuable it is. And we're now trying to evaluate the best way -- we want to preserve the existing ecosystem. And we think that we have an ability to also attack everyone that doesn't subscribe to cable and have them have an opportunity to watch the great content they grew up watching.","Drew Borst","Great. Thank you. Appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next call -- question comes from Steve Cahall with Wells Fargo. You may proceed with your question.","Steve Cahall","Thanks. And I joined a little late, so apologies if I missed this. You've got now all these digital initiatives and they're sitting nicely under Peter. I was wondering if you think there's a point in the future, since it's such a broad portfolio that you might be able to give us some sort of goalposts or like a revenue range of what you think these can do on a run rate basis?","And then on the buyback side, I was just wondering how we should think about it? Do you think about this is now a structural thing where you can generate a few billion dollars a year in free cash flow. So there's always going to be a couple of billion dollars a year that you can use to buy back stock now that you're at this level of debt? Or is it more opportunistic than that? And just last one related to free cash flow. Next year, are the Olympics a drag on free cash flow? Or are they just a drag on EBITDA when they hit in the summer? Thank you.","Gunnar Wiedenfels","All right. So let me start with the digital initiatives and the goalpost. I understand the desire to get as much of a modeling framework as possible. As I have said many times before, we want to maintain the flexibility right now to try things and to fail if we have to fail or to get behind stuff that's working. And as Peter said, we're really focused on input metrics rather than trying to chase metrics further down the funnel, be it subscriber numbers or let alone revenue and profit numbers. So that's why it is very early.","The other thing is -- one thing to keep in mind -- again this business drives our two reporting segments, the U.S. Nets the D&I segment. So there's always that element that these businesses are all embedded in our regional structure.","Now that being said, I do think -- and again it's a little early for that but I would expect that as we go through next year with more product launches and more let's say track record on existing products that we will increasingly start giving more disclosure here. But again I don't think it would be helpful right now to get too granular. And it wouldn't be responsible either because again it's very early days.","Number two on the buybacks, look I mean we've been saying the same thing for the longest time now and our priorities haven't changed. We are now at 3.1 times. Very soon we'll be at the lower end of our target range. And again I do continue to want to take advantage of our balance sheet here. And we're funding all the investments as you could see in our numbers here.","We will continue to look for M&A opportunities. But you all know that that's easier said than done. We would do another Scripps acquisition any day, but they're not that available. And to be honest with you, if I look at the buybacks that we executed last quarter, those are going to be great investments. And honestly investing in our own stock sets a very, very high bar for every M&A activity. So this idea of investing in ourselves be it through buybacks or be it through funding organic investments on the D2C side is going to be a priority.","Steve Cahall","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Mitchelson with Credit Suisse. You may proceed with your question.","Doug Mitchelson","Thanks so much. A couple of questions. David, I mean you're mentioning what sounds like a pretty remarkable strategic shift with your direct-to-consumer strategy in the U.S. So I was hoping for some more clarity. Are you talking about taking your library of content and going direct-to-consumer? Are you talking about actually taking your current content on the live networks plus the library going direct-to-consumer? Are you talking about doing this in combination with other content companies or leveraging other platforms like Peacock? Or is this something that you would do yourself?","David Zaslav","Look what we're doing is we're looking at the strength of our IP in the U.S. in the aggregate. And we're looking at -- and talking to consumers, how much they love it. We see through our GO platform, how young the people that are using it and how much time they're spending with it. And we're now looking at what -- how do we take that content. We're already doing it independently.","Is there an opportunity for us to take that content on a broader basis to reach -- to mount and attack on those that are not existing cable subscribers. That's the full ecosystem. That's what everyone is looking to do and needs to do, which is take the great IP and reach everyone. We want everyone to watch our content.","And we have to do it the way we did it in Germany. But candidly, we haven't wanted a partner in the U.S. because all those entertainment platforms don't have enough. They've spoken to us. And we look at what they have is differentiated. They're part of an overall entertainment pie. And they each have a piece; none of them have it all. We have almost all of each of our platforms. And when we put it together we have something that's compelling. And so we'll be looking at that over the next few months.","Doug Mitchelson","Very interesting. And Gunnar, you were threatening to continue to delever but there's only 10 basis points left to go. And you just talked about capital deployment a little bit. If you're doing close to $3 billion of free cash flow next year and you're basically at 3.0 times as you end this year, it sounds like either that's going to M&A or capital returns. The only other thing that would be an input in the model is if you were investing so much in digital initiatives like the one David is talking about that EBITDA would be pressured. And that some of that cash flow would have to go to pay down debt. Am I, sort of, thinking about all that right? And is that last scenario in play?","Gunnar Wiedenfels","Well, I think you're thinking about it right, but let me make one thing very clear. I don't see any scenario where we'd be spending that much in Peter's investments here that there will be a really material impact on our free cash flow. We will prioritize those investments but this is not\u2026","David Zaslav","And one of the reasons is that, if you think, the jewel for HBO's Game of Thrones, our jewel on Food Network Kitchen, might be Martha Stewart cooking for Thanksgiving or just cooking -- doing a live cooking class every day.","If we find that they really love Martha or they really love Bobby then we can -- we don't have to wait 1.5 years. It doesn't cost us $8 million an episode. The next week we sit down -- everyone working with us is having a great time.","And even with our existing content, our average cost of content is -- has stayed relatively flat. In some cases, we've been able to maybe do a little bit better. But -- and our average cost of content is $0.5 million an episode.","On Sunday night, we're generating a 35 on -- with 90 Day Fianc\u00e9 on TLC. And the cost of that content is -- it's the number one show on television on Sunday night. And the cost of that content is actually less than that.","JB Perrette","I think, the other thing -- Doug, its JB, I think Dplay and the traction we've had internationally has also opened our eyes a little bit, to the fact that we all focus -- and particularly obviously for the U.S. focus on what's happening to the pay-TV bundle and subscriber loss.","I think that's the defensive way of looking at it. The offensive way to look at it which is what we've seen internationally is, there's also enormous -- and in some markets obviously like the U.S. growing percentage of base that has never or doesn't have access to our content or is choosing not to have access. And yet would love it.","And so when we look at a market like Italy, which essentially has more than 70% of the population is not signing up for pay-TV. As we've launched Dplay in that market we've realized, now rather than just holding on to the 30% penetration of pay-TV, we got to get much more offensive about going after the 70% that never has had it.","And that's a whole new target base that -- as we're seeing early numbers is looking at our content and saying, we'd love to have this. And so that's an exciting way of looking at it. And I think, part of what David is referring to in terms of us looking at the U.S. market and having sort of that same question.","David Zaslav","The one point on the current ecosystem, Charlie announced this morning, that he added 150,000 subscribers, with 214,000 Sling subscribers, which is a skinny bundle. And we are -- on every skinny bundle, we happen to have very good carriage on both of the Sling platforms which I don't know that anybody else does.","So we'll be the beneficiary of that. But it's a directional point. 214,000 subscribers and they don't carry any regional sports. Charlie is not putting regional sports on Sling. You talk about this overstuffed bundle, retrans, sports networks regional sports networks. It's all weighing down this industry.","And here's Charlie. He just takes the regional sports code off. And he picks up 214,000 subscribers. And if you take one of our distributors out, that has been working on getting rid of non-performing subscribers. And you see we're slightly down. We may be flat. So I don't know, if this is going to be a pivot.","But if there's a skinny bundle that can get some acceleration and we are seeing a rotation into some of these, what I would call, MVPDs, we have very good carriage on all of them, better positioned than anybody.","And maybe this is a moment where the U.S. can -- if the existing distributors can get some courage, I think they can start to benefit the consumers which is, \"Hey I don't want to pay $100 and get all these regional sports networks. I don't want to pay for all the sports. I just want some great content. That's what I spend time watching.","So I think Sling is very encouraging. And it's a good mark for the industry. Stop stuffing the damn bundle, serve the consumer.","Doug Mitchelson","All right, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question comes from Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson. You may proceed with your question.","Michael Nathanson","Thanks. I have just a couple for JB. I just wanted to learn more about, how you think about what markets do you partner with a local broadcaster or you go it alone. And in those markets what have you learned? Or how necessary is maybe the local content versus just taking your discovery products into a Dplay mode?","JB Perrette","Yeah. So, I think our view is generally. And as sort of David referred to in the Poland example, we think the faster and the more local aggregation can come together the better. And so in that market where essentially between us and Polsat we have about 70% of the audience share in the market.","I think that sort of answers the question of we view that -- even though, we have -- we are the largest broadcaster in Poland as an example. And we do go it alone. And we're seeing traction and growth on our own.","We think that making it easier back to what David just said about, lead with the consumer, that the simpler we can make it, in aggregating content, in a good experience, for the consumer wins. And at the end of the day, even with a 30% share of audience plus in a market, if we can partner with another big -- one or two big players that have meaningful share and make it even easier with more great content will locally differentiate it.","So that is always going to be the better approach. Whether we can get that done in every market, look, obviously is something that's a work in process. But I think, as broadcasters around the world are realizing that the model has to change.","And that their future is going to be entirely based on how quickly and how well they can pivot to the streaming world. The good news is, Discovery with our track record of putting these partnerships together, developing these products, scaling these products. We're a unique partner and the most credible partner and in a lot of these markets to pull it together.","Michael Nathanson","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you.

Since our last call, we have made some key strategic investments. We have seen expected but still difficult third quarter advertising results, in part due to the Olympics. We have completed a major US distribution deal, and we have watched a continuation of strong trends in distribution revenue, which are 50% of our US and 50% of our international businesses. That long cycle, domestic and international revenue mix makes Discovery unlike any other US-based multi-channel network company.","Today, I want to talk about five major developments since our last earnings call. Our new CFO, two strategic investments, the financial foundation provided by our large distribution deals, and gains in our digital rollout that bring increased focus on our digital monetization. First, as you know, Gunnar Wiedenfels will join us early next year as CFO. Andy Warren has graciously agreed to extend his contract term to ensure a smooth transition of CFO responsibilities and a big thank you for that, Andy, and for all of your service, great service over the past five years.","Gunnar's experience as CFO of publicly traded Procebin is perfectly aligned with Discovery's future and growth portfolio. Procebin, one of Europe's major media companies, operates multiple broadcast and cable networks and is also Germany's leading online video marketer. We are excited to bring Gunnar onto the team as Discovery continues our rapid growth and diversification in new content and digital platforms around the world.","Second is a key strategic partnership for Europe. Today, I'm extremely pleased to announce that Discovery and MLB Advanced Media have created a joint venture to form BAMTech Europe. This platform partnership leverages Eurosport, the dominant player in sports rights across Europe with unparalleled reach and BAMTech's world class digital technology service.","Discovery will remain 100% owner of Eurosport and all of its IP, as well as its digital platforms. This partnership will greatly accelerate Eurosport's access to over 700 million people in Europe. Gaining just 1% of the European population to subscribe to the Eurosport Player would equal 7 million subscribers. BAMTech's state-of-the-art back-end video platform and service will be implemented in 2017 across all of Eurosport digital products, which today include Eurosport.com, the continent's number one sports news web site with 60 million users a month, and the Eurosport Player, what we call our Sports Netflix, the leading subscription based OTT sports platform across Europe, giving fans an all-access pass any time and on any device in 52 countries.","In addition, we will have access to select MLBAM content in Europe for direct-to-consumer contribution. BAMTech Europe also will work with a broad set of sports and entertainment content owners, broadcasters, and OTT platforms to enhance their digital capabilities, reach and performance across the continent.","Third is an investment to change our content and IP mix, and help Discovery grow into a leader in short form and mobile content for the next decade. Last month, we announced that we will be investing $100 million, and entering into a strategic partnership to create a new media holding company called Group 9 Media. We will contribute two of our digital assets, Seeker & SourceFed Studios, Digital Networks, and we will combine them with independent Digital Networks' Thrillest, NowThis, which is the number one video news publisher on Facebook, The Dodo, as well as two Snapchat channels that belong to the NowThis portfolio.","With 3.5 billion monthly video views across all of these millennial-focused brands, Group 9, will be a top five digital first content and social video company on day one. With a best in class leadership team, tremendous brands, reach and scale. We will own 39% of Group 9 and importantly, we have the option to acquire full ownership in the future.","Fourth is another big distribution agreement. We completed a successful renegotiation with AT&T DirecTV. So we will continue to reach their 25 million subscribers in the US at very favorable rates. The DirecTV agreement is in line with our other recent deals. This long-term contract not only helps secure our linear distribution growth, but it also means Discovery's content will be available across all DirecTV platforms on a favorable basis, including the soon to be launched OTT DirecTV Now streaming product.","The importance of long-term international and domestic distribution deals, like our recent deals with DirecTV, Liberty Global, and Telenor cannot be overstated. In the US, with the successful completion of our DirecTV deal, we won't have another major renewal until the end of next year.","Internationally, while there were some one-time items last year that impacted third quarter growth, we expect double digit underlying organic growth for the next few years. As our stronger premium content portfolio, that now includes leadership in sports in Europe, is translating into much stronger price increases as deals are renewed. There's no question that the addition of sports and the upcoming Olympics to our nonfiction portfolio in Europe, is bolstering our profile with distributors and reinforcing the must-have nature of our suite of brands. Half of our total company revenues come from these agreements, and our built-in price escalators provide a solid, stable foundation of growth, even as advertising fluctuates. This stability is what gives us the optionality to monetize our content on existing and emerging platforms and is further evidence of the strength of our brands and our content.","Two recent examples of our brands resonating with audiences are OWN and ID. With new hits like Queen Sugar and Greenleaf, a strong Saturday night and Tyler Perry programming continued to deliver audiences. OWN is the number one network for African-American women in America, and prime delivery is up 12% year-to-date. And for a few weeks this quarter, OWN was a top 10 network in America for women.","ID continued to score big in the third quarter, ranking as the number one network for women in August, September, and October. Number one: JonBen\u00e9t, an American Mystery Story is this year's best new nonfiction cable series and ID's best ever across demos. And this series also drew record audiences in the UK and ID's international viewership growth was up double-digits yet again.","The fifth topic I want to discuss is our digital strategy. Our global digital strategy is pretty simple, get our own content to as many people as possible across all screens and platforms and fill in with digital-only content as needed. A key tenet of our digital strategy and driving incremental revenue growth is TV Everywhere. In Latin America, our kid's digital product continues to gain traction with Discovery Kids Play now in front of over 40 million households.","In the US, Paul Guyardo and team have done a great job with the recent launch of our authenticated network apps and websites, which now give cable and satellite customers the ability to watch our long-form content anytime, anywhere, and on practically any device. We've made real significant progress with our authenticated offering in this past year.","A year ago, our TV Everywhere footprint was in just over 20% of the US. Today, our footprint covers over 70% of the country. The national launch of our TV Everywhere apps that we call GO occurred on August 9. It's early days, but we have already learned a lot and initial results are quite promising.","First, 50% of the streams are coming from 18-year-olds to 34-year-olds. This gives us confidence that our content is relevant to a younger audience. We just had to put it on a different platform for them to consume it. Second, we are seeing strong pricing. As CPMs for GO are at a big premium versus our linear nets, largely because the length of view is almost an hour and the millennial delivery is so strong. Third, consumption patterns appear to be 60% recent episodes and 40% older titles, which is a strong testament to our deep, rich library and the fact that consumers are seeking out our programming, even over a week after it's aired.","Finally, our only real material challenge is our authentication rate, which is a common challenge for all programmers and distributors. But we're working with our distribution partners to address it. For example, we have just launched home-based authentication with Comcast, which removes a huge barrier by eliminating the password requirement on sign-in, and roadmaps to do the same with other MVPDs are in the works.","We also continue to make strides in Europe. In some markets of Europe, the pay television penetration is lower than in mature markets and that provides new digital opportunities to leverage the investments we have been making in sports rights beyond our linear business. Of the 320 million homes in Europe, 160 million homes currently have Eurosport, but 160 million homes currently do not have access to Eurosport on TV, primarily because they are non-Pay-TV households. That 160 million is more than all the households in the US. For future digital delivery, there are nearly 200 million wired broadband subscriptions and nearly 600 million mobile data subscriptions across Europe, more than all the fixed and wireless data subs in the US, together making Europe the most important continent for sports growth and opportunity over the top. So there are clearly two routes for sports expansion in Europe, linear and digital, and we are attacking both.","To help drive our Eurosport digital effort, I've asked Paul Guyardo to now oversee Eurosport's digital businesses. Paul worked with Barry Diller for many years at HSN and worked at DirecTV, where Paul and his subscriber acquisition team built DirecTV from 15 million subs to over 20 million subs. Following the successful launch of our GO apps in the US, Paul will take his skills to Eurosport's digital operations.","And we're building a world-class team with new expertise to manage our direct-to-consumer business out of London. We recently hired Ralph Rivera to be the managing director of Eurosport digital, and he will take over the day-to-day operations. Ralph joins us from the BBC, where he was responsible for all of the BBC's digital media services, leading the implementation and operation of BBC iPlayer as it grew by over 300%. And not coincidentally, he delivered BBC's first truly digital Olympic Games for London in 2012, providing solid in-house expertise as we get access to the Olympic rings on January 1 of next year.","Today we own the content for our linear businesses and we have the right to use that content to build our global digital businesses. As I have told many of you, because we own the sports content for both linear and digital, I've begun to think of this as an opportunity to build a Netflix for sports in Europe. We are also exploring creating services for science, in the auto space, and for other niche genres in the US and around the world, additional direct-to-consumer opportunities, so our super fans can access our content where they want, on whatever device, whenever they want.","So in closing, we continue to secure important long-term distribution deals and invest and add key personnel to support global growth across all platforms to assure that Discovery Communications continues to evolve globally and digitally way beyond the way the traditional U.S.-based multi-channel network company can evolve.","And now I will turn the call over to Andy.","Andrew C. Warren - Discovery Communications, Inc.","Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. As expected, and previously communicated, our third quarter was challenging, but our financial and operating trends in the fourth quarter are much better and our robust full-year outlook is still very much intact. Importantly, as David mentioned, while the media landscape is rapidly changing, Discovery's global content portfolio of well-loved and increasingly diversified brands makes us uniquely well positioned for long-term growth.","Half of our revenue base is derived from affiliate, which is well positioned for strong and sustained growth, given the multi-year nature of our contracts with built-in price escalators. We also remain highly focused on controlling our non-content operating cost growth while thoughtfully investing in content and OTT platforms. As we have consistently highlighted, two of our most critical competitive advantages are our flexible cost structures and the fact that we own or control the vast majority of our content across all global platforms. These advantages give us tremendous operational flexibility and optionality and allow us to fully maximize our long-term profit growth.","Now, let's dive into our third quarter results. Excluding currency, total company revenues were up 3% and adjusted OIBDA grew 1%. Net income available to Discovery Communications of $219 million decreased versus the third quarter a year ago, primarily due to a $50 million or $0.08 per share non-cash after tax write-down of our Lionsgate equity position.","Earnings per diluted share for the third quarter were $0.36, and adjusted earnings per diluted share was $0.40, down 15% versus last year's third quarter. Excluding the $0.08 impact from this one-time Lionsgate write-down, third quarter adjusted EPS would have been $0.48 up slightly year-over-year. Excluding both, negative currency impacts, as well as the Lionsgate write-down, adjusted EPS was up 5% for the third quarter, and up fully 18% for the year-to-date.","Third quarter free cash flow increased 75% to $410 million, primarily due to lower cash taxes and improved working capital turns. Impressively, constant currency free cash flow increased 112% for the quarter, and increased 72% for the first nine months of the year. Our total company free cash flow growth has clearly accelerated.","Turning now to the operating units, our U.S. network revenues were up 2%, as our 7% affiliate growth was offset by a 3% decline in advertising growth, which was fully expected due to the Olympics, as well as the timing of Shark Week this year. Excluding the Olympic impact, US advertising would have been up low single digits. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect fourth quarter advertising to be flat after taking into account the small approximately 50 basis point impact from the deconsolidation of our Discovery Digital Networks relating to our recently announced Group 9 deal.","Our domestic distribution revenues were up 7%, while total portfolio subs again declined almost 2% versus the third quarter of last year. We continue to benefit from the significantly higher locked in rate increases we have solidified in all of our recent affiliate deals, including our new deal with DirecTV. We are extremely pleased with the outcome of this latest renewal which was completed at very favorable rates and in line with our other strong US affiliate deals.","The DirecTV renewal was truly a win\/win as our content will be available across all DirecTV platforms, including their soon to be launched OTT DirecTV Now streaming product.","Domestic operating expenses in the quarter were actually down 1% as we remain laser focused on controlling our non-content cost growth, resulting in 3% adjusted OIBDA growth and 100 basis points of year-over-year margin expansion to 58%. Total domestic operating expenses are expected to be flat to down again in the fourth quarter.","Turning now to our international operations, the 3Q comps to last year are simpler, as there are no major acquisitions or divestitures to normalize. So my following comments will refer to our organic results, which need to only exclude currency impacts. International organic revenues increased 2%, with distribution revenues up 8%, and advertising revenues down 2%. Our 8% affiliate revenue growth was primarily due to higher affiliate rates in Latin America, CEEMEA, and in Northern Europe where we have been successful in leveraging our expanded content portfolio that now includes sports to drive higher contracting pricing step ups, but was partially offset by a couple of one-time items in Europe and Asia in the third quarter of last year. We still expect constant currency distribution growth over the next several years to be up at least low double digits as we continue to benefit from our stronger, more diversified portfolio of networks and higher contracted price escalators.","Turning to our third quarter national advertising, overall results were meaningfully impacted by the Olympics and while we benefited from higher volumes in southern Europe, and higher pricing and volumes in CEEMEA, growth in these markets was more than offset by declines in Northern Europe, our largest advertising region. Northern Europe was clearly heavily impacted by Brexit and other macro-related weaknesses, as well as softer ratings at our female skewing networks. Trends, however, are improving in the fourth quarter, with all regions seeing improved results. Therefore, we expect fourth quarter year-over-year advertising growth to improve by several hundred basis points versus this third quarter's growth rate.","International operating expenses grew 6% in the third quarter, primarily due to higher sports content, and production costs. But total international cost growth will slow in the fourth quarter.","Now, taking a look at share repurchases. In the third quarter, we repurchased a total of $374 million worth of shares and we have repurchased $1.5 billion of stock over the last four quarters, as we committed to on last year's third quarter call. We now have spent a total of $7.8 billion buying back shares since we began our buyback program at the end of 2010. On a stock split adjusted basis, we have now reduced our gross outstanding share count by 34% and by 30% net of employee equity awards.","We are still very comfortable with our current gross leverage ratio of 3.3 times, given both our high degree of confidence and our free cash flow growth forecast as well as our robust 16% and growing free cash flow-to-debt yield. We have significant flexibility around our deployment of capital and are extremely committed to remaining investment grade rated company. Very importantly, we are well within the financial ratios prescribed by all three rating agencies to maintain our current investment grade debt rating.","As we look ahead to the fourth quarter, we will continue our share repurchases, for our available capital for buybacks will be impacted by the $100 million investment in Group 9, but 4Q share repurchases will not be impacted by the BAMTech Europe deal due to its immaterial investment size.","Now, let's review our forward looking guidance. For full year 2016 we still expect constant currency free cash flow to grow in the high teen range and constant currency adjusted EPS, excluding the Lionsgate write-down, to grow at least 20%. We are also reiterating our 2015 to 2018 three-year guidance of constant currency adjusted EPS and free cash flow growth CAGRs both growing at least low teens or better.","I also want to update the expected year-over-year foreign exchange impact on our full year operating results. Thanks to our effective hedging strategy, the expected year-over-year FX impact on our financials has not changed since our last call, despite some of our major currencies, especially the pound recently weakening. Assuming current spot rates stay constant for the rest of the year, FX is still expected to reduce our constant currency revenues by $150 million to $160 million, and our constant currency adjusted OIBDA by $80 million to $90 million. In addition, we still expect a positive FX impact to adjusted EPS of $0.02 to $0.06 due to the net effect of this year's adjusted OIBDA impact and the year-over-year change in the below the line FX impact.","In closing, as I near the end of my tenure at Discovery, I'm extremely optimistic about Discovery's current global content portfolio, our optionality, given our ownership of content and flexible cost structures, and our overall financial and operating momentum.","Now, Dave and I will be happy to answer any questions you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Alexia Quadrani of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Thank you. If you could comment \u2013 two questions. Well one question is a quick follow-up. First on, Netflix spoke about a movement to sort of non-scripted programming and I want to know if you saw that as an incremental competitor to your domestic business here, or not necessarily because your brand is such a driver of viewership. And then just a follow-up, if you can give us a little color on your DTV Now comments. Will all your networks be distributed on the product? And any sense on what tier they might be on?","David M. Zaslav - Discovery Communications, Inc.","Okay, sure. Look, I think Netflix is a terrific company and they've had a lot of success in putting together quality content as well as acquiring content from existing players. And they've been in nonfiction and they are continuing to do some nonfiction. I think directionally, it's \u2013 they've moved to be more like an HBO and so I think in terms of where Netflix sits with us, we see them more as a premium service. Both Showtime and HBO also are doing some nonfiction and documentaries. And so we don't really see them as a competitor with our brands. Our focus really has been to get, to tighten up our brands to focus more on nourishing our core audiences so that we have super fans and we can be reaching them and build a steadier and longer viewership on each of our brands around the world. And, we have seen that with Discovery outside the US, which is continuing to grow globally, ID, which is breaking out, has grown over 10% this year domestically, and more than that outside the US, as well as Oprah and Science and Animal Planet.","And, so we are really focused on curating through brands and we are finding that our pipeline is strong, particularly because of our leadership with Discovery as the number one channel for men in the U.S. and almost every market around the world. We are a first place that producers are coming to. Also, because of the amount of volume, as well as for each of our other channels, on crime, we are number one because we buy the most, in the African-American space now with Oprah, Oprah has become the number one place. I think focusing on our brands and nourishing our audience is really the key for us for growth and I think Netflix is doing quite well and it just reiterates the fact that nonfiction is strong.","On DirecTV Now, we were able to work out a deal that I think works really well for DirecTV and for us. The idea with Now is that they're going to have an opportunity to reach out to subscribers that maybe they couldn't otherwise get and for us, we think a lot of that, at least hearing from DirecTV, is going to be a younger demo or cord-nevers, at least in the initial tranche. But for us, we are well covered. A number of our services are going to be carried and at least 85% of the economics we will be reaping from each subscriber. And, we expect that to the extent that it rolls out and it's meaningful, that we will find what we have found on smaller bundles around the world, that our viewership becomes stronger. So we have been able to secure a strong position which I think works well for us and works well for DirecTV because they have very high quality services to offer on DirecTV Now.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you. David, as you move towards direct to consumer, particularly internationally, can you talk about what you think the organization needs to do, operationally? You mentioned some senior hires, your partnership with BAMTech, but in terms of hiring, I don't know if you think you need to get bigger in customer service or in billing software, I'm trying to get a sense for what Paul's job is here in terms of transforming the company to a more direct relationship with the consumer since your digital strategy is all screens, all places. I'm just wondering what the building blocks are that you are putting in place to make that all happen.","David M. Zaslav - Discovery Communications, Inc.","Sure. I'd say it's really four pieces. BAMTech and getting into business with Bob Bowman is a big piece of that, from a middleware perspective, as well as access to some additional IP through them. But joint venturing with BAMTech and sharing and investing in a tech platform that we build out throughout Europe gives us a best of class platform that can hold all the streams and provide a very positive consumer interface, which we think is an improvement over what we have today.","In addition, we have Ralph Rivera who ran the iPlayer, and that's sort of the \u2013 how do we aggregate all the content and how do we offer it? Right now, we are offering it as a broad offering. Ralph is looking at subdividing that to specialty groups. We now have all the majors in tennis. We have all the cycling. We have all the winter sports that we start to break that out into seasons passes and we have started to experiment with that and Ralph will create the content working with Paul.","But Paul's job at DirecTV was subscriber acquisition and marketing job. And, that's what he did for Barry at HSN, and that's what he did at DirecTV. He had a team of over 300 people that drove DirecTV from 15 million subscribers to 20 million, and he had dashboards that related to customer service, reducing churn, subscriber acquisition, how do you \u2013 where do you go? What are the affinity groups that you go to and how do you attack those groups, at what pricing.","And so, we have started to hire a significant number of people. We made the decision to put them in London because we view this group as a disruptor group. So rather than have our existing team that's doing a world-class job of building Eurosport, and acquiring that IP, so we have our three Eurosport channels across all of Europe and we have Eurosport.com that Peter Hutton and his team is running and that is profitable and we have been able to get great IP.","Now we have our BAMTech middleware together with their IP and their know-how, we put on top of that one of the best guys in the industry, with huge experience in offering content directly to consumers, and then Paul on top of all of it, responsible to drive it. And, look, there is no \u2013 when you think about Europe with over 700 million people, and only 50% pay penetration, there's huge opportunity here, we think, to go over the top. There's the 50% that aren't getting any of the Eurosport content at all, and then even when we are showing the Eurosport content on our channels, we have so much IP that there's a huge amount that's not being seen.","And so that will be an attack. Our sports Netflix in Europe is something that we are taking seriously, and we see it as a disruptor and we think it could be a huge value creator. But, we think it's just the beginning. Because, when we look at all of our IP now, we've spent the last four years building our content, owning it on all platforms and whether it's science, whether it's auto, whether it's African-American, we think that there's an opportunity with all that content paid for, to go direct to consumer, either for a fee or for free and build additional economics and additional bites at the apple.","Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Janedis with Jefferies. Your line is now open.","John Janedis - Jefferies LLC","Thank you. David, over the years, you have talked a lot about programming and the importance of being on brand and I think for the most part, either on Discovery and TLC, but ratings have been a little bit soft the last couple of quarters. So, when you look at improving ratings, is the solution more original hours, is it marketing, is it better measurement? I'm just trying to get a better handle on your line of sight for the turn. Thanks.","David M. Zaslav - Discovery Communications, Inc.","Thanks so much, John. First, I'd say that we really view Discovery globally. So this year globally, Discovery is up in a meaningful way. In the US, we are down a little bit. We are still the number one network for men in the US. We still beat ESPN six months of the last 12 months, but we have a group that we are talking to everyday that feels like Discovery is really on brand. We could put more content on there just to get ratings or we could put content on there that would be very US-centric, but we really look at Discovery as a global platform and measure it in terms of how we are gaining share around the world.","Rich Ross had a huge success with his miniseries Harley and the Davidsons and we took that around the world and we are finding some meaningful success with that. Gold Rush is back and doing quite well. Alaska: The Last Frontier is back. So we have a lot of content coming in the fourth quarter, I think you'll see some meaningful improvement. But most importantly, the channel is on brand. We have done well with our scripted series and we have some real documentaries that are meaningful that have been on the air, that are reminding people of what Discovery is when it's at its best. So we feel good about Discovery.","TLC has been a challenge. But I think we are making the turn. We now have a Sunday night that's really strong with 90 Day Fianc\u00e9, where we are number one or two for women on Sunday night again. The overall trend in the last few weeks has been better. But we've worked really hard over the last 18 months on our development and on figuring out how \u2013 what is TLC when it's at its best and how has it changed over the last couple of years. Where did we lose some acceleration? And Nancy Daniels and her team together with the global TLC team, has been digging in and we think we have some good content coming up in the fourth quarter and first quarter, so we think that we can help turn that around.","And each of these channels are at times a bit of a challenge. Oprah was a challenge for us, the OWN network, and now it's a top 10 or top 12 network in America and it's number one for African-Americans. For a period of time, ID a year and a half ago, was stalled and Henry and his team got really focused on, what is ID, how do we nourish that audience? And now it's back on track and growing in a meaningful way and it's number one for women. And so, I think our creative teams are strong. We're not going to have all 14 of our channels growing all at the same time, but as we look at our overall share globally, whether it's in the women's category or the men's, over the last year, we continue to grow.","John Janedis - Jefferies LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Richard Greenfield with BTIG. Your line is now open.","David M. Zaslav - Discovery Communications, Inc.","Where is Rich? The second time this has happened to Rich.","Jackie Burka - Discovery Communications, Inc.","Next question please","Rich Greenfield - BTIG LLC","Hello, can you hear me?","David M. Zaslav - Discovery Communications, Inc.","All right. We got you.","Rich Greenfield - BTIG LLC","Oh, sorry. So, Bob Iger recently said that great content may no longer be enough, that you need direct access to the consumer. You're clearly trying to build a bridge in Europe through the Eurosport Direct product, but wondering how do you think about the US if Iger is right? And then just two, AT&T DirecTV is now the largest MVPD, presumably has the best rates for content, including yours, I would presume. To the extent that DirecTV now takes share from other MVPDs across the country, is that a headwind potentially for you and others in the industry in 2017 on the affiliate side?","David M. Zaslav - Discovery Communications, Inc.","Well, I'm not going to get into the rates on any specific deal, but I'll say that, look, we had a very good equitable argument when we went into our renewals a few years ago. When we did the deals eight years ago, seven years ago, five years ago, we were getting about 5% or 6% share, and we were getting 4% or 5% of the money. Our share went up to 12% or 13%. We launched ID, it became number one for women. We launched OWN and it was successful. Discovery came back to being number one. And we invested a lot more in content. So when we went out to the, all the distributors, we were able to get a significant step up and double-digit increases. And now we're done with all of our deals and that's true across the board. We were also able to secure good protection for our channels against tiering and real protection that we were going to get carried in a meaningful way in any offering. It helps us that our top five channels or six channels represent about 85% or 87% of the money.","You know, exactly what happens with DirecTV now and where that growth comes from, we don't see that as being an issue. We see it as being an opportunity. There's a lot of people that probably weren't able to afford the traditional DirecTV product that may buy that $35 product. And if they do, we're going to have a lot of channels on there. Each of those channels are very strong brands. And we've seen in markets like Brazil and Mexico and in many of the markets in Europe where we only have half of our channels carried, if we can preserve most of the economics, the viewership on those channels grow and the strength of the brands grow. And so we're rooting for DirecTV with NOW. We also think that creates a nice marketplace driver. So if the other distributors in the market decide to do something like that, the biggest impediment right now is the price of cable in the US. It's something that we don't see in most markets around the world, and it's mostly driven by high sports fees.","And so the biggest issue that we have in Northern Europe, Rich, is it's one of the few markets where cable TV is $100. And the result of cable being $100 is that there have been a lot of people that have gone to other services or disconnected. And that's not true across almost all of Europe or Latin America. And here in the US, one of the things that has stopped the growth of cable is pricing in all that sports. So the idea that somebody can do a $35 offering, and we can get most of our economics and more share, that's a positive.","The second thing is we've already gone directly to consumers with Discovery Go, which is going very well so far. And as I said, 50% of the people that are spending time with Discovery Go are under 34 and about 40% are under 25. And they are watching an hour and they're watching all the commercials. And so we've already said next year we expect at least 1% of additional growth in ad sales because of Discovery Go. And we think it could be north of that. We have a Dplay product in Europe where we're also going direct to consumer, so we're learning a lot about all that, and I think you will see all the work that we did where we said, let's not fight for ratings, let's fight for super fans and strength of brand, that we'll be able to take that brand to people around the world. And I've said it before, but when you take like a science product, what would a science app that's $1.99 or $2.99 when we already have it in 55 languages look like if we could take it around the world and make it available to the over 1.0 billion subscribers that currently get our content?","And so, we think with our content paid for, direct-to-consumer is an opportunity, but I would say that we really view the existing ecosystem as quite solid. So I think owning great content that has super fans and being able to take that to consumers is a real opportunity for additional meaningful growth. And in the case of sports, it could be a huge driver for us. But the existing ecosystem around the world remains strong and I think it's more of a, what's going to be in four years, five years and six years in terms of getting directly to consumer or seven years, than in the next few where things seem really pretty stable around the world when you look at subscribers","Rich Greenfield - BTIG LLC","Thanks so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Vasily Karasyov with CLSA. Your line is now open.","Vasily Karasyov - CLSA Americas LLC","Thank you very much. I would like to ask a couple of questions on the international networks. First of all, I think the release calls out Northern Europe weakness but then says that there was volume growth in Southern Europe. Given that the Olympics are a global event, can you explain that divergence, please? And then, do you mind giving us an idea of what Eurosport and ex-Eurosport what the margins are doing there? Because I'm sure the trends there are divergent in terms of operating expenses growth and advertising and (46:27) revenue growth so that we understand the drivers a little better? Thank you.","Andrew C. Warren - Discovery Communications, Inc.","Sure, it's Andy, Vasily. Yeah, so the answer to the question around volume growth in Southern Europe and really it also applies to Latin America and Eastern Europe. It's what we call the power ratio. And we've talked before about the share of economics following the share of viewership, and if you look at those two regions, Latin America, Southern Europe and Eastern Europe, you are still seeing strong double-digit growth there because we just have so much catch up to do relative to the economics following viewership and share. So you'll continue to see us talk about, while Olympics certainly was some headwind in those markets, no question that this \u2013 the overall trend of our performance from a macro perspective and from an economics perspective continues to be a great tailwind for us.","With regard to Eurosport, look, we don't anymore split out Eurosport, but not only because it's so integrated now with the rest of the business. We go to the affiliate marketplace as one company. A lot of the ad sales now, while we are seeing tremendous outgrowth on Eurosport, given its new platform, we don't think of it as being a standalone entity anymore from a reporting perspective. While margins are a little less, still positive, a little less, given the dynamics of sports rights relative to some of the third quarter ad sales challenges that we talked about, no question the trend there is still positive. We are still seeing a growth in the top line for Eurosport related product and we are still seeing, over the long term, profit growth and margin growth for that asset.","David M. Zaslav - Discovery Communications, Inc.","We are seeing a bit of a tale of two cities. If you look at Northern Europe, as I talked about earlier, they have this \u2013 they are uniquely seeing putt levels decline over the last two years, and we are all feeling that. A piece of it is ratings, which we think we can correct, but a piece of it is that there's a \u2013 there's something meaningful that has happened there over the last two years that has not had any kind of systemic impact in Europe or Latin America, we're gestationally in different positions. So when you look to Northern \u2013 when you look to Northern Europe, if you exclude that and you exclude the UK, where Brexit has presented real challenges in terms of the advertising market, we are seeing in Latin America and throughout Europe high single, mostly double-digit growth still. So we are seeing low double across Europe and Latin America, and then we've got a Brexit challenge and we have a putt level challenge in Northern Europe, Norway, Denmark, Sweden where we're fighting that fight. We think we can improve it a little bit, but we can't say right now whether the viewership levels on television are going to continue to decline or ameliorate. Right now it looks like it's a slow, steady decline up there, more so than we're seeing across most of Europe, which is contrary to what we're seeing in Latin America where there's still meaningful growth. And Eastern Europe, we are seeing meaningful growth in viewership as well as subscribers.","Vasily Karasyov - CLSA Americas LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of the Anthony DiClemente with Nomura. Your line is now open.","Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. I guess no one has asked about the domestic advertising outlook yet, so we need to do that. You had said, Andy, that third quarter would have been low single digits if you exclude the Olympics. So fourth quarter outlook being flat, is it deceleration? So, can you please just talk about the drivers there? I would have thought you'd had the benefit of the new CPM pricing from the up front. And then just sort of bigger picture on domestic advertising, what are you seeing in the marketplace? Is there a budget shift to the Facebooks, the Googles, and the Snapchats going on out there?","And then another one for, a separate one for David, also a question about getting your content closer to the consumer. But more about marketing. So you talked about Discovery Go. You've reached critical mass with that. You've talked about Deep Play, the Eurosport Player, does it make sense to start marking these digital products like Discovery Go more aggressively? And just, at a higher level, how do you think about the returns of marketing these digital products to consumers? Does it make sense at all to do it directly, or strategically, would you rather wholesale your digital content to third parties like DirecTV Now, who in turn do the heavy lifting on investing and marketing? Thanks.","Andrew C. Warren - Discovery Communications, Inc.","It's Andy, Anthony. So look, on the fourth quarter ad dollars, I'll look at it this way, there's going to be some pluses and some minuses. The pluses are A, clearly still a strong market. We're still seeing double digit scatter over up front, we're still seeing high single scatter over scatter and so the market continues to be our friend and there's good volume and there's good pricing there. So clearly, there's some positive there. We are also still seeing some positives from some pricing on Discovery (51:50) Go, and we've talked about the audience profile there skewing so much younger and more female. So those are clearly still positive trends that exist in the fourth quarter.","I think on the negative side, one is the deconsolidation of our digi-nets, due to the deal that we announced where we are combining our assets to get a much bigger viewership share, and, look, the other is the universe declines and some pretty conservative view on our ratings. Clearly, there's some upside potential there.","We're seeing some traction. We talked about ID, we've talked about Velocity. But, we've taken a pretty conservative view on ratings and the universe. So, I think we have a real chance to over deliver on that expectation, but we are trying to set expectations right as we think about the next kind of two months.","Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","What's your assumption on the universe? Is it more than 2% or is it 2% on your portfolio sub expectation?","Andrew C. Warren - Discovery Communications, Inc.","Yeah, it's the same level, Anthony. We've kind of been at the slightly below 2% to 2%. We are not seeing any acceleration there. So we're still thinking about a 2% decline in the fourth quarter.","Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Okay, thanks.","David M. Zaslav - Discovery Communications, Inc.","And on taking our content direct to consumer, we're now in 70% of the country with DGo and we have a strong relationship with a lot of the distributors that are helping us to promote it. So we feel like that's on a good track. We are really working on driving the authentication. When it comes to our sports product, we are putting in place a team that will work on marketing. The best case is, one of the things that you saw with AT&T is it's something that I have been talking about for a year and half that we have been seeing. It used to be the triple play, but more and more in Europe now, you are seeing the quadruple play. You are seeing wireless, broadband multi-channel to the home. There's still some fixed phone, but it's much less relevant as we all know.","And so with that type, there comes a commoditization and we saw it across Europe, as BT tried to de-commoditization their platform by owning special IP, you see it with Deutsch Telecom, you see it with Vodafone, you see it with Telenor, you see it in Latin America. So, for a long time I have been saying, that that pipe is getting commoditized. And when you are holding on to that pipe, if there's one or two guys next door that are offering the same thing, it becomes a real challenge and it's almost a race to the bottom. And so we have seen that around the world. And the reach, when that happens is IP de-commoditize the platform.","And so, some of the deals that we've been able to do, whether it's with Canal+, whether it's discussions with the mobile guys, which is something we're having now much more aggressively, where everyone is looking for IP to attach to their pipe, to de-commoditize it. And so, I think that the positive side of AT&T, is it's an affirmation that owning great IP is important. Of course it raises some significant issues for content owners in terms of how they are going to be carried on their platform. But the point is that the right deals for us, in Europe or Latin America, could be quite advantageous to driving this product. There's no reason why this product shouldn't be driven by the mobile players across Europe. And so, if you buy a particular wireless product, you can get the Eurosport Player. If you sign up for a particular distributor, you can get the Eurosport Player. They can bill for it.","So if we expect that over the next period of time, that there will be some bundling of our product, just like Netflix is now getting bundled with Liberty Global, or bundled with other distributors, that it's a way of making and offering. The difference is, that in some of the markets in Europe, it could be exclusive. So we could be marketing ourselves direct to the consumer. We have Eurosport, so people are watching the sports that they love. We could be telling them the next match is on the Eurosport Player, so sign up. So we could be our own direct promotion through unsold inventory, which makes us unique and different from Netflix. But also, we have our direct reach. And, we have 10 channels to 12 channels in each market, where we are reaching specific demos. But then there's also, we think, the opportunity over time, over the near term, over the next year or two, once we have this best of class player working with Bowman and BAMTech and we have the product that we think works, because we have the IP that we think works, that we start to have distributors become sub-distributors for us, which we think also will reduce churn in a meaningful way, because we will be packaged along with other billing by distributors.","So this idea of the quadruple play and this fight to de-commoditize the pipe, I think, for people that own IP, and could offer it across all the different platforms, is going to be a real meaningful opportunity for growth.","Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Thanks, David.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Todd Juenger with Sanford Bernstein. Your line is now open.","Todd Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Oh, hi, thanks. Given the hour, I will just keep it to one question here. David, you mentioned before the 14 network brands in the states, something like 85% of economics in the top six. So my question is, how do you think about those other eight networks from both a strategic and financial perspective, and their role in your portfolio? Do you still subscribe to a philosophy of basically trying to invest and grow those and find the next sort of ID, or maybe is the world changing about how you think of those, the role of those networks going forward both in their distribution and their investment and the overhead that's required to maintain them and all that stuff? Just your thoughts there would be really helpful, thanks.","David M. Zaslav - Discovery Communications, Inc.","Thanks, Todd. We have been focused on trying to \u2013 I think more than anybody else, we have been growing brands domestically around the world, and as you have seen our company evolve over the last ten years that I have been here, we have taken a meaningful amount of investment in content and new brands. So we have gone from investing $500 million in content to over $2 billion. And, as opposed to just growing and defending Discovery and TLC and Animal Planet, there's a number of channels that are having a real impact in the U.S. and around the world that didn't exist; whether it's ID, Velocity, which we call DMax or Turbo around the world, Oprah, which didn't exist a few years ago. And so, if you look at our channels, the top six represent 85% or 87% of the ratings, and 85% or 87% of the economics.","That is where our primary focus is, but we have some other niche channels that we are playing around with and they have also been a farm team for us. Some of the content that starts on those channels ends up going to our bigger networks and it's a little bit of a secret sauce for us. Survivor Man and How It's Made started on Science and they became strong performers on Discovery and we are still finding that around the world.","But directionally, even though we have between 10 channels and 12 channels, in most markets, we have 8 channels that represent 85% or 90% of our economics or 85% or 90% of our share. And so, that's where we are focusing and as we look at a world that is going to be changing over the next couple of years, we have been spending most of our time making sure those channels are stronger, those brands are stronger, and the people that are watching those networks feel more connected and affiliated with them.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jessica Reif Cohen with Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Jessica Jean Reif Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. I've got two questions. David, you mentioned on your Eurosport, becoming like a Netflix for sports, you mentioned other categories that you were interested in, like science and auto, is that all under Eurosports or is it a European service you are thinking of, or something more global? And the second question is on the creation of Group 9, can you talk about some of the metrics that you are looking at and, you know, when and how will you buy the balance of the 61%?","David M. Zaslav - Discovery Communications, Inc.","Okay. Let's start with Group 9. We were doing, with Seeker & SourceFed, about half a billion streams, and we found that those streams actually had very good CPMs, but we needed a sales team, which we had, that was selling those 500 million streams. When we went to talk to advertisers, they liked the demo that we had, but we were like the \u2013 we were number 20 in line. So putting this together with Thrillist, The Dodo and NowThis, we get a number of things.","One is we get 3.5 billion to 4 billion streams a month, which gives us \u2013 makes us the number three player, four player or five player in the space. So already advertisers are calling us saying, we like the demo that you have, we like the scale that you have, how can we do more business with you? That's number one. Two is, there's an ad sales team that's working for Ben Layer, a very strong CEO that's running the whole business, and we'll be able to take advantage of having one big sales team sell the 3.5 billion to 4 billion streams, which is a real advantage. The third is, they have a fantastic data analytics business, which is \u2013 we were faced with the question of do we build a very big sales team? Do we build a big data analytics structure? And how do we scale up our half a billion? And so we view this as a three part. We got the 3.5 billion to 4 billion, so we got scale. We have a great sales team as we picked the best and the brightest of all of these companies and Ben pulls it together, and the third is we got a great data analytics structure. I mean, that data analytics structure built NowThis in the last year and a half to be the number one provider of news on Facebook. And they also with have two Snapchat channels.","So, for us we've got scale, we have data analytics, we have an ad sales team that we can rely on. We're more in the front of the line. And we were out in San Francisco last week, we were with the Facebook guys and they're transitioning their platforms to video and we're in the top two or three providers of video to Facebook. And we got to work on how do we monetize that content, and that's why we were out there talking to them. In our one minute and one and a half minute videos are generating so much energy for Facebook, how do we get more value out of that? It's not in our plan right now but it's going to happen, but if it does happen, which I think eventually hopefully it will, the value of a business like this could be huge.","And finally, we pick up a stronger relationship with Snapchat, where we pick up two channels. And so I think for us, we now own 39% of it, we've got a great leadership team running it, we'll see over the next few years how it develops and it gives us great optionality and it gives us a great support system.","Finally, Eurosport and the whole partnership with BAM, that relates to sports. And we're going to be going at that very hard. And, remember, the reason why we think it's so compelling is that Netflix spends over $6 billion to $7 billion a year on content. We're going to be offering our sports content across Europe and our cost of content is zero because we're already making \u2013 our margins are already in the teens for Eurosport. And so this could be a very profitable business for us. It's not that different from the cable players that were able to build a business model on the coaxial cable and multichannel to the home and then being able to take a second bite at the apple and offer broadband without a lot of cost. And so we have to prove it out, but we think we have something quite strong.","When it comes to science our auto, that's something we can offer globally and we can offer it direct to consumer, we can offer it through distributors because we already are the \u2013 we have a huge amount of that content in language, and we're just playing there with the best way to offer it. And we're having a lot of discussions with consumers about what they like, what they like about our content and how to package it.","Jessica Jean Reif Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","And that concludes today's question-and-answer session.

Joining me today are David Zaslav, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Andy Warren, our Chief Financial Officer. You should have received our earnings release, but if not, feel free to access it on our website at www.discoverycommunications.com.","On today's call, we will begin with some opening comments from David and Andy. After which, we will open the call up for your questions. [Operator Instructions]","Before we start, I would like to remind you that comments today regarding the company's future business plans, prospects and financial performance are forward-looking statements that we make pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are made based on management's current knowledge and assumptions about future events, and may involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations.

Zaslav","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Last year, Discovery's investment in content, brands and new international platforms generated more impressions and scale than ever before. Better than double-digit growth in international audiences, expansion of our global flagships into new markets and establishing the leading sports provider in Europe is creating strong operating leverage across the company and long-term value for advertisers, audiences, distributors and shareholders.","2015 marks Discovery's 30th anniversary. And we built our portfolio and brands through a consistent strategy, a strategy of investing in our channels and programming to take market share in the U.S. and market share around the world; investing in local teams, infrastructure and boots on the ground to drive our global business; and owning our rights and IP across platforms and regions to strengthen our network portfolio and provide the foundation for our direct-to-consumer offerings.","The core of our strategy is to continue investing in content, which feeds in average of 10 channels in more than 220 countries; and to grow our market share in markets around the world. This investment has paid off and our share of prime time viewers, 25 to 54 in the U.S., has risen from 7% in 2008 to 12% today.","Our international viewership continues to set records, gain share and grow dollars in key markets around the world. We ended 2014 with nearly 3 billion cumulative global subscribers, up from 2.5 billion at the end of 2013. And we grew our average international audience by 13%.","More people are spending more time with our content than ever before. Consumers all over the world are consuming more video and more programming than ever. Because we own the vast majority of our worldwide content and IP, we can take advantage of new ways to distribute and monetize our program. New distributor entrants, over-the-top platforms and SVOD expand our optionality and our chance to bring in more dollars and reach more people.","Last quarter, we reached our first-ever long-form distribution agreement with Hulu in the U.S., providing another strong brand and linear TV friendly environment for our content. And in terms of new marketplace entrants, we closed a favorable deal for all of our U.S. channels with Sony for its new cloud-based service, PlayStation Vue.","Discovery has a direct-to-consumer business that is profitable and growing, something very few media companies can say. And our opportunities within this landscape are growing rapid rapidly. A look at our recent progress in Europe gives us good reason to be optimistic about our near- and long-term growth in this area.","In Europe, we've gained subscriptions, valuable insights and a new marketing and sales platform with our own direct-to-consumer products. One is Dplay in the Nordics and the other is the Eurosport Player, which we distribute across the continent. Those services have almost 0.25 million subscribers, bringing in an average of $8 per month in U.S. Our European OTT offerings is giving us a growing revenue stream, a growing direct-to-consumer offering and valuable learnings that we can apply in the U.S. and other markets.","And we're just getting started. For 2015, our goals are to launch a new integrated platform to scale the back end for both services; deploy Dplay to additional markets across Europe and acquire specialty rights at a low cost to strengthen Eurosport's Player and have its growth accelerate; and take all of our learnings and expertise to support the strategy we will be taking to distribution partners and consumers in the U.S., Latin America and around the world. You will hear much more about our products in this area in the months to come.","Further demonstrating the value we continue to earn from our distributors, we completed strong renewals with all of our U.S. distribution partners for deals expiring at the end of 2014, including Suddenlink, Cablevision, NTTC and our latest distribution agreement, a strong renewal with Mediacom that we are announcing today.","In addition to favorable economic terms, each agreement offers subscribers authenticated access to Discovery content inside and outside the home, a good start to building a robust U.S. TV Everywhere offering in earnest and another element of our strategy of capturing a growing share of the streaming audience. These renewals are critical components in growing our U.S. affiliate revenue line, driving our over-the-top offerings, like TV Everywhere, and it demonstrates that the marketplace continues to place a high value on quality content and brands.","Comcast announced last year that our deal with them is up at the end of June. As we all know, Comcast is the largest cable company, a key platform for any independent programmer, of which Discovery is the largest. With our deal coming up, we are hopeful that Comcast will negotiate in good faith, like all of our other distributors have over the last several years.","We continue driving hard on development and a new pipeline of content across our networks here in the U.S. Discovery Channel was the top 4 cable channel for men last year and had 5 of the top 10 cable shows for men, led by Gold Rush at #1; Deadliest Catch at #3; and Fast N' Loud at #4. So far this year, Discovery has vaulted to the #1 nonsports cable network for men 25 to 54, a very strong position in the marketplace. And while Discovery Channel has some nice momentum, we believe its best days are ahead.","In January, Rich Ross officially started, a terrific creative leader, who in less than 2 short months, has reinvigorated our flagship channel. Rich secured the key strong leaders at Discovery and in addition, has hired seasoned executives onto his leadership team, including John Hoffman, a 17-year HBO veteran, to lead our big tent-pole specials and event programming; and John Goldwyn, a long-time producer, who has developed many feature films and most recently, Dexter, to oversee Discovery Channels' scripted and miniseries strategy.","Rich and his team are planning on being very aggressive in developing both of these categories, such as Racing with Extinction (sic) [Racing Extinction], which debuted at Sundance and will be a global television event this fall, as only Discovery can do with reach into over 500 million homes around the world.","Following ratings softness last year, Animal Planet continues to build ratings momentum on the strength of series such as Treehouse Masters, Pit Bulls & Parolees and, of course, Puppy Bowl, which was once again the #1 cable telecast on Super Bowl Sunday, drawing nearly 11 million total viewers, nearly 3 million streams and reaching more than 17 million fans on social media.","TLC also experienced some softness last year, largely driven by the cancellation of Here Comes Honey Boo Boo. We're moving forward by adding compelling new series like 90 Day Fiance, TLC's highest-rated freshman series of the year; and My Big Fat Fabulous Life, which has been renewed for another season and performed extremely well, joining our established series like 19 Kids and Counting, which helped made TLC the #1 cable network for women on Tuesday nights. And last night, was another big Tuesday for us.","Our other U.S. brands continued to post impressive gains. ID was again #1 in length of tune in all of TV, meaning ID viewers spent almost twice as much time watching ID on average than other cable networks. The network had its highest year ever for prime and total day and was the #5 cable network for women 25 to 54 for all of 2014. The channel continues to defy gravity with passionate superfans.","And Velocity continues to attract new audiences and posted impressive double-digit ratings gains in prime and total day for the year. Velocity also added 5 million U.S. subscribers in the past year and now reaches 61 million homes.","We are focused on optimizing the programming and performance of the U.S., leveraging this content across our global footprint and unlocking the value of Discovery's distribution advantage around the world. Demonstrating our ability to light up our strong brands on a global basis, we launched our new brand, Discovery Life, in the U.S. and Poland on the same day in January.","While we are not satisfied with our U.S. ratings performance in 2014, and with the softer U.S. ad sales in the second half of the year, it is important to note that we program for a global audience. River Monsters, Fast N' Loud, Dual Survival, Naked and Afraid, Gold Rush, MythBusters, Say Yes to the Dress, all reached more than 200 million global viewers each year. Developing such globally appealing shows drives our ability to gain share and reach new audiences around the world.","While our ratings were down for the year in the United States, we set a new international record with the highest average audience in our history, up more than double digit in market share. With new leadership at our flagship Discovery and momentum out of the gate in 2015, I am confident we have some real creative wind in our backs and a growing and dynamic development pipeline.","The strengthening U.S. dollar had a big impact on our financial results last year across our entire global footprint, however, we are focused on the operating leverage we are creating. And concerns about currency headwinds aside, our international business remains the key differentiator among our U.S. peers and an engine that continues to have strong organic growth.","During 2014, we hit 2 major inflection points. More than 50% of Discovery's revenue comes from outside the U.S., so we generated more than $1 billion in international OIBDA. Discovery's strong organic growth around the world is being driven by our distribution advantage, strong global brands, local managers and staff and smart, strategic acquisitions, led by our new Eurosport brands across Europe and Asia.","TLC launched in Germany last year and has grown audience across the Central and Eastern European region by 36%. We also supersized TLC in Australia, with an improved channel position and tripled our female viewers.","ID and Turbo are our hottest new global brands, set to fuel the next generation of worldwide growth. Now reaching over 100 million global homes and since its launch in Denmark in November, ID has had fantastic success and already ranks as the #4 of our 9 pay-TV channels in Denmark, regularly generating between a 2% and 4% share despite not yet being fully distributed.","Velocity's international brand, which we call Turbo, is also taking off, particularly in Latin America. We've invested in Turbo and doubled the channel subscribers across the region to over 20 million homes. In fact, Turbo has greater distribution in Brazil after 1 year than many other major brands have after 20 years in the market. We're on track to reach more than 125 million homes for Turbo by the end of 2015.","Latin America continued to lead our organic growth with prime time ratings up 14% year-over-year and our flagship channels, Discovery Channel, Discovery Kids and Discovery Home & Health, ranked as top 10 channels across the region in the key market. Discovery Kids just earned its sixth straight year as the #1 pay-TV channel in all of Brazil.","Brazil is also a great example of the power of our global content engine. Dual Survivor Brazil, a U.S. format with a locally produced version, delivered the highest-rating ever for Discovery Channel in the country. This is our fastest-growing market in Latin America. Ad sales rose more than 40% year-over-year and pay-TV penetration rates are still just 30%. So we're excited about our continued strong position in this important market.","In Europe, it has been nearly 9 months since we took majority control of Eurosport, and I am more excited than ever about this acquisition and the opportunities that lie ahead. Discovery is now the largest sports player in Eastern and Western Europe by number of subscribers and feeds. Our integration efforts have been focused on going to market as one team, bringing greater scale and depth to distribution and ad sales, bolstering our strategic investments in sports rights to enhance Eurosport's offering and strengthening the bundle of our combined portfolio of leading global brands.","We're strengthening Eurosport's pan-regional strategy of being the home of sports that are popular across Europe, such as tennis, cycling, winter sports, with all rights and additional exclusivity. We reach 130 million homes across Eastern and Western Europe.","From May to year-end, we signed 24 incremental deals, including Spanish cycling, alpine sports across Europe, FIFA Women's World Cup Soccer, handball and hockey in the Nordics, and we continue to bolster our tennis and soccer rights. But we're doing it in an efficient and effective and cost-effective way. In addition, we're strengthening Eurosport's local relevancy by acquiring must-have rights to both marquee sports and local sports incredibly important to European fans, while maximizing the distribution of our portfolio of channels.","In addition to the content and sports rights, we have leveraged our local infrastructure and expertise to merge our distribution teams and have already completed 30 combined distribution deals. And our ad sales teams have sold our joint offering at many upfronts across Europe, highlighting the power of our combined brands and content offering, more than 10 channels in every market, which reaches all the key advertiser demos.","To bolster our strategic leadership and capability in sports, we've hired sports industry veteran, Peter Hutton, as CEO of Eurosport. Peter will use his more than 30 years in the business to lead our negotiations of key sports rights, launching new local feeds into larger advertising markets and to grow the Eurosport Player, which we're very excited about because it's our first real success in direct-to-consumer across Eastern and Western Europe.","And finally, in Asia, India's portfolio of our established global brands achieved best-ever audience levels for prime time and all day, with now 8 networks in 5 languages, reaching 260 million cumulative subscribers. And we're looking closely at what else we can do in India to capitalize on our local team, infrastructure and strong brand position.","With organic growth opportunities across our global platform and more ways to display and sell our content than ever before, we remain confident that Discovery is well positioned to continue taking market share, deliver long-term growth and increase shareholder value in the years ahead.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Andy for details on our financial results.","Andrew C. Warren","Thanks, David. And thank you, everyone, for joining us today. As David highlighted, despite industry challenges in the domestic ad market and increasing foreign currency headwinds, our expansive network portfolio drove audience and market share gains around the globe.","On a reported basis, total company revenue for the year increased 13% and adjusted OIBDA increased 4%. As expected, given that over half of our revenues are now outside the U.S., the strengthening dollar was a major headwind in 2014 as changes in currency rates had an approximately $100 million negative revenue impact and $70 million negative adjusted OIBDA impact versus 2013, and reduced our full year reported revenue growth by 2% and our adjusted OIBDA growth by 3%. It's important to note that the additional negative FX impact since our November 4 earnings call, we would have been within our then guided full year OIBDA range.","Total company organic revenues, which excludes the impact of foreign currency, SVOD licensing revenues, newly acquired businesses and the consolidation of the Discovery Family, grew 7% and adjusted OIBDA grew 6% for the year as we further demonstrated our ability to deliver consistent financial results, even as we continued to invest in building our networks and operations worldwide. Total company margins on an organic basis were 42%, in line with 2013.","Full year net income available to Discovery Communications grew 6% to $1.1 billion in 2014, primarily due to improved operating performance as well as a $105 million decline in mark-to-market equity-based compensation, a $56 million decline on losses from hedging derivatives and a $49 million decline in tax expense, partially offset by a $74 million increase from restructuring costs associated with Discovery Family and Eurosport and $62 million less in gains related to Discovery Japan and Eurosport transactions.","Our full year book tax rate came down 300 basis points to 35% as we remain laser-focused on lowering both our effective and cash tax rates by fully utilizing the increasingly international mix of our business. We remain confident on our ability to bring our global effective tax rate to 30% or less for fiscal 2017, which will drive net income growth, as well as accelerate our free cash flow growth. Earnings per diluted share were $1.66 as adjusted earnings per diluted share, a much more relevant metric from a comparability perspective as it excludes the impact from noncash amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, was $1.84, a 13% improvement year-over-year.","For the full year, free cash flow increased 2% to $1.2 billion, driven by solid operating performance, partially offset by higher content investments and cash tax payments. Content spend for the full year, excluding newly acquired businesses, increased mid-single digits, and as David discussed, this increased programming spend is delivering global audience market share growth and higher advertising revenue. Free cash flow per share, a critical metric for us and the metric that most influences our strategic and planning execution, was up even more as our share count continued to decline due to our buying back over $1.4 billion worth of our shares over the course of 2014.","Focusing now on the fourth quarter, results only. Foreign exchange had a 5% negative impact on revenue growth and a 6% negative impact on adjusted OIBDA growth. Excluding FX, licensing revenues, Eurosport and Discovery Family, organic revenues were up 4% and organic adjusted OIBDA declined by 2%.","Net income available to Discovery Communications decreased to $250 million in the fourth quarter, primarily due to the before-mentioned restructuring charges and lower equity earnings this quarter, as positive earnings from OWN and other nonconsolidated investments were more than offset by losses from our 50% stake in All3Media.","All3Media had positive nonconsolidated adjusted OIBDA in the fourth quarter. But amortization and acquisition-related intangible assets and mark-to-market losses on both foreign currency and debt-related interest derivatives led to a net equity earnings loss as hedge accounting was not applied. Going forward, we expect All3Media's adjusted OIBDA profits to continue. However, mark-to-market adjustments on derivatives used to hedge foreign currency and interest rate risks are included in their earnings and may cause their net results to fluctuate.","Fourth quarter earnings per diluted share was $0.38 and adjusted EPS was $0.43 compared to $0.46 a year ago. Free cash flow increased an impressive 23% in the fourth quarter to $390 million, as improved operating performance and lower tax payments were partially offset by higher content spend.","Moving now to the individual operating units. U.S. Networks fourth quarter revenue grew 1% on a reported basis but declined 1%, excluding the consolidation of Discovery Family in the quarter and licensing revenues in the fourth quarter of 2013. Reported advertising revenues decreased 3% in the quarter due to lower delivery and demand. Delivery did improve slightly from Q3 but was still down mid-single digits versus the fourth quarter of 2013.","Looking ahead to 2015, we expect U.S. ad sales to improve from the fourth quarter results, driven by scatter pricing holding up nicely versus the upfront and modest volume growth. Our current assumption is that the overall advertising market will be relatively tepid this year, similar to 4Q '14. But our ultimate full year ad sales outcome will depend upon a variety of factors, with the most important being our network delivery performance.","Distribution revenues, excluding the impact from Discovery Family and licensing agreements, were up 6%, consistent with this year's previously reported quarterly growth rates.","Looking ahead to the first quarter 2015, until there's a new Comcast carriage deal, we expect our organic distribution growth rate to continue to accelerate as we benefit from the higher rates we garnered from our new deals with NTTC, Cablevision, Sony and others at the end of 2014, as well as from our now recognizing revenues from our new Hulu deal. Note that unlike our SVOD deals in prior years, we expect the revenue recognition from Hulu to be relatively smooth over the life of the contract.","For the full year, our domestic advertising revenues were up 2% as higher ad pricing and volume more than offset lower delivery. And our distribution revenues were up 6%, excluding the impact of licensing agreements and Discovery Family consolidation.","Turning to the cost side of our U.S. Networks. Fourth quarter organic domestic operating expenses were up 6% as cost of revenues were up 15%, primarily due to the Wallenda event; while SG&A was down 8%, driven by aggressive base cost productivity and lower marketing costs. For the full year, domestic adjusted OIBDA was down 2% on a reported basis but increased 2%, excluding the impact of Discovery Family and licensing agreements.","Turning to the International segment. Our International Networks delivered another quarter of strong results, capping off another exceptional year. Our reported Q4 international revenues were up 17% and adjusted OIBDA was up 11%, while reported full year revenues were up 28% and adjusted OIBDA was up 18%. Foreign exchange reduced fourth quarter international revenue and adjusted OIBDA growth rates by 10% and 13%, respectively, and full year revenue and adjusted OIBDA growth rates were reduced by 4% and 8%, respectively. Reported results also include the results of Eurosport for May 2014 and of SBS from April 2013.","For comparability purposes, the international commentary that follows will refer to our organic results only. They exclude Eurosport's results for all periods and excludes SBS's first quarter 2014 results. They also exclude the impact of foreign exchange.","Fourth quarter international revenues were up 8%, led by 10% advertising growth and 8% distribution growth. Advertising, again, grew double digits in the fourth quarter, led by Western Europe, primarily from the continued success of our free-to-air initiatives, and to a lesser extent, the Latin America from higher volumes, especially in Brazil. Affiliate revenues had another robust quarter of 8% growth, driven primarily by subscriber growth and higher pricing, especially in Latin America. For the full year, organic advertising revenues were up 14%, and organic distribution revenues were up 9%, both very impressive growth rates that reflect the vitality of our international business.","Looking ahead to 2015, we expect organic international advertising to grow consistent with the double-digit increases we delivered in the fourth quarter 2014, even including the ad sales ban in Russia. While organic and affiliate revenues should grow high single digits despite the overall slowing growth of the international pay-TV market and a negative impact from renegotiating several affiliate deals in Russia as a result of the heavy devaluation of the ruble and the collapse of their economy.","Turning to the cost side. Organic operating costs internationally were up 4% in the fourth quarter, primarily driven by higher content amortization, partially offset by a decline in SG&A. Our focus and ability to grow revenues faster than costs led to international organic adjusted OIBDA growing 15% and organic margin expanding 300 basis points in the quarter to 41%. For the full year, international organic adjusted OIBDA was up 16%, and organic margins were up fully 200 basis points to 40%.","Focusing now on Education and studios businesses. We reorganized all of our existing and newly acquired global studio production assets into a stand-alone operating division and reclassified these results out of our U.S. and International Networks segments and combined them with the Education segment. This redefined and growing segment posted a 14% increase in revenues for the year, mostly driven by the acquisitions of Raw on the studio side and Espresso in the Education side, as well as strong acceptance of our recently launched Education digital textbooks. Adjusted OIBDA was down year-over-year.","Going forward in 2015, there will, again, be minimal profits with this division as we continue to invest in growing both our Education Techbook business and our studio IP and owned content.","Now moving to our go-forward capital allocation policies and commitments. It is very important to remind investors that our first priority remains investing in our core business to drive sustained, long-term organic growth. Our second priority is investing in strategic, bolt-on acquisition, such as Eurosport, to strengthen our global platforms. And our third priority remains returning capital to shareholders through execution of a share repurchase program.","In 2014, we repurchased over $1.4 billion worth of over shares. We have now spent over $5.7 billion buying back shares since we began our buyback program at the end of 2010. And we have reduced our outstanding share count by 27% as we find the return on repurchasing our own shares very attractive.","As we articulate our 2015 capital allocation expectations, we remain highly committed to our BBB rating, especially given current global economic uncertainties. Therefore, we currently expect to have approximately $1.5 billion of our available capital for full year 2015 to fund both share repurchases, as well as to fund any additional strategic M&A investments, including the potential TF1 put for the remaining 49% stake in Eurosport.","As you may recall, TF1 is a put right for their 49% stake from this July through September as well as for the same period in 2016. Separately, our calculated free cash flow per share IRR remains very compelling. So we expect to continue to allocate a sustained and growing amount of our capital to share repurchases in future years.","Now let's focus on our 2015 guidance. We expect foreign currency headwinds to persist this year and are, therefore, changing the way we issue guidance to exclude the impact of currency movements in order to provide investors a clearer view of our local currency-based business.","Given this, we expect that full year 2015 revenues will grow in the high single- to low double-digit range, adjusted OIBDA will grow in the low to mid-single-digit range and adjusted EPS will grow in the high single- to low double-digit range, driven by the solid operating performance and a lower tax rate, partially offset by approximately $25 million of higher interest expense. It is important to highlight and appreciate that the difficult geopolitical situation in Russia is adversely impacting this revenue guidance range by approximately $50 million, driven by the cable ad sales ban as well a necessity to renegotiate several pre-existing affiliate contracts in the region.","Revenue growth in 2015 will outpace adjusted OIBDA growth, mostly due to increased content spend at Eurosport. After 9 months of controlling the asset, we have now determined that we must bolster our investments in sports rights in the near term in order to fully maximize the growth potential of the asset in the medium and long term. While we will be very diligent and selective about which sports rights we pursue to drive long-term, cost-effective, market-influencing growth, we do intend to make 2015 a year of real investment in the business, with full year Eurosport margins down from high teens in 2014 to high single digits in 2015.","As David highlighted, we see very compelling potential for Eurosport, even more upside than we thought when we brought the asset in the business 2 years ago and fully expect these increased sports rights investments to pay off, both at Eurosport as well as across our entire international portfolio.","Let me to further clarify the foreign exchange impact on our 2015 results. At current spot rates, FX is reducing our constant currency guided revenue by $350 million or roughly 6% and adjusted OIBDA by $150 million, also roughly 6% versus our 2014 reported results.","Looking at our International Networks mix of currency exposures. The revenue mix in 2015 is expected to be around 30% euro, 30% Nordic, 20% U.S. dollar, 10% British pound and 5% Brazilian real. Our International Networks adjusted OIBDA currency mix is forecasted to be about 25% euro, 25% Nordic, 15% real, 5% Russian ruble, 5% U.S. dollar and still slightly short the British pound as our international headquarters are in London.","Lastly, we anticipate reported free cash flow growth of low single digits in 2015, with growth and cash flow from operating businesses partially offset by higher cash taxes due to prior year timing benefits related to Section 181. We do expect cash taxes in 2016 to decline significantly as the cash tax deferral effect of 181 subsides.","Thanks again for your time this morning. Now David and I will be happy to answer any questions you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] First question comes from that line of Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","David, could you talk a little bit more -- I know you said there's going to be more information over the next couple of months. But there was some really interesting comments about direct-to-consumer in your opening remarks. What are you learning so far in Europe about the appetite for consumers to buy your content directly? And it sounds like you think that's the way the world's headed in the U.S., which, at least to me, seems like a shift to maybe your thinking. Can you talk about how that thinking has evolved? And then I just have a quick follow-up for Andy on some of the guidance points.","David M. Zaslav","Sure, Ben. Look, I think that the existing marketplace in the U.S. is going to stay as is. I don't think it's going to grow the ecosystem in terms of the basic cable bundle, but it seems to be quite stable. What we are learning outside the U.S. is that if we have superfan content, our Eurosport app, that's $8 a month, we're getting big spikes before the Australian Open with people signing up, where they can get 8 courts. It's not affecting our viewership on Eurosport at all. We got a big spike right before the Tour de France. So that owning sports rights, particularly for affinity groups, we don't need to own the big soccer. And so we've been out acquiring a lot of specialty rights that we think can really bolster that business.","And with 250,000 people and growing, we're talking to them, we're seeing what they like and so I think if anything, we've learned that the superfan group is really valuable, that people still love to watch TV traditionally. But when they're going out of their home and their's something that they really love, and sports is probably the easiest one -- the other area that we think we have a real chance to monetize is down in Latin America, where we have Kids, which is another. Sports and kids being probably the 2 areas that most lend themselves to a superfan and the direct-to-consumer. But we're also offering an over-the-top service in Northern Europe, in Norway, Denmark, Sweden and Finland with Dplay, and we're finding some success with that.","Here in the U.S., we're hoping that TV Everywhere continues to grow. We were very effective in getting our deals done at the end of the year, with big step-ups and double-digit increases. You see that -- you see our increased distribution fees coming through. It was 6 last year. We expect that they will grow outside of Comcast, high single and drive to double digit. So we're getting real value for our content. TV Everywhere will help that. It will be additive. We did Hulu. We did Sony.","The good news for us is we own all of our content. There's great superfans for Oprah. We have superfans for Science. Discovery is the #1 network for men again. And so we believe our content has a lot of value. We just have to figure out how to do it. The best way would be a broad deployment of TV Everywhere in the U.S. and maybe taking some of our superfan affinity groups and going after them, the way Oprah is now with offering courses for $60 or $70 to go -- to do deep dives.","But I think that the ecosystem here in the U.S. is going to stay basically as is for the next 3 years. And the question is, 4 or 5 or 6 years from now, will there be peel off of this direct-to-consumer business? I think mostly in the U.S., if TV Everywhere doesn't develop the way that it should, which would a positive for all of us. And if it doesn't, it would be -- it will require all of us to go directly to consumer because the cable guys aren't getting it done.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","That makes sense. And then just Andy, you gave us a lot to chew on there right at the end on guidance. On your domestic advertising comments, can you just give us a little bit more color on what you're expecting for Q1? I couldn't tell if you were saying you think that the business will grow or just improve.","And then, your comments for the year about the market being tepid. It sounds like you're assuming a pretty flattish year for ad growth in '15. But I just wondered if you could add any comments there.","Andrew C. Warren","Yes, sure, Ben. So look, for the first quarter, what we said was we expect U.S. ad sales to accelerate from the down 3% we experienced in the fourth quarter. So we do see pricing that's solid relative to the upfront. We're seeing cancellations and options that are kind at or better-than-normal levels. Look, the biggest determiner for us will continue to be the variability of our delivery. So we definitely see still a relatively tepid environment, is kind of word we used and carefully chose that word. But we do think we'll have a slightly better performance in the first quarter, and that kind of continued slightly better performance than the fourth quarter throughout 2015.","David M. Zaslav","The area that we're seeing improvement is in volume. For our guidance, we've assumed that it will remain tepid for the year. So far, 5, 6 weeks in, it's better than what we've projected. But we really don't have a lot of visibility to how it's going to be for the next 3 quarters. And so we've assumed that it's going to be tepid.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Anthony DiClemente from Nomura.","Anthony J. DiClemente - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","I just had one for David and one for Andy. David, just on the Discovery Channel and the evolution of leadership at the network. Now that Rich Ross has started, I'm wondering if you think there's going to be a shift in the programming strategy there maybe to broaden the appeal of Discovery. You mentioned you guys are global and the global appeal of your program strategically. But I'm also thinking in terms of broadening perhaps the target demographics for Discovery here in the U.S.","And then for Andy, I just had a quick one, which was you guys in the quarter reclassified some of your OIBDA. OIBDA losses, I guess, from your U.S. and International segments into Education. And just to kind of help us get the model right for 2015, I was wondering if you could quantify the impact of that. What's implied in your guidance just in terms of the different breakout of OIBDA in those 3 segments?","David M. Zaslav","Thanks, Anthony. Look, I think that when we look at Discovery Channel in general, we feel great about it. First, it's terrific to have a strong creative leader with Rich there, and he's brought on a few good people in areas where we thought that we could build on. And he -- we also have a great team at Discovery. But when you look at Discovery last year, it was flat. Outside the U.S., we were up double digit. So we're up in 229 countries, double-digit, and in the U.S., we're flat.","One thing to remember is we program our channels, Discovery, Animal Planet, Science, TLC, ID, we program these globally, Velocity. It gives us tremendous leverage. So the fact that in 229 countries, we were up double digit, and in the U.S., we were flat, that actually was a successful year for us. We're not satisfied because the U.S. is a big market and we want to drive it. The good news is that Discovery has shown a tremendous amount of strength coming into this first -- into the first 6 weeks of the year. We're up more than 20% from where you were in the third and fourth quarter. Discovery is now the #1 non-sports network in America, every week of the last 6 weeks. On Friday nights, Discovery is the #1 network in America, including the broadcasters for men.","And to your point, one of Rich's key initiatives is to bring more women back. If you look at Discovery outside the U.S., we have much more co-viewing in terms of a younger demographic, and we have much more women watching. And we've taken a big step on Friday nights, where we have Gold Rush and Alaska Bush. Not only are we the #1 network, beating the broadcasters, but Alaskan Bush is the #1 network -- we're the #1 network for women on Friday night from 10 to 11. And so this drive of bringing back women and bringing back a younger generation to co-view, which is something we saw here in the U.S., we got away from a little bit in the last 2 or 3 years. Rich is target focused on that, but Discovery is very strong. It's strong here in the U.S. It's strong around the world, and I think Rich is going to take it to the next level.","The -- on the issue of pushing our programming a little bit? We -- right now, we have -- we're going to get back to some of our traditional programming, a little bit more of our natural history, science and space. That stuff is working much better outside the U.S. and we want the blue chip stuff, so we'll drive that. And we'll also push on some -- in scripted, but it's going to be -- it won't be a lot. It'll be just some because we think it all needs to be part of the overall recipe. And when we do it, we'll be doing it with content that works around the world.","And we do make choices. If we wanted Discovery to be up 5% or 6% last year, we could've done it. We opted not to do certain programming that we thought would do well in the U.S. but wouldn't play well outside the U.S. And so our sharing ratio is up to 85, which makes us more efficient and the scripted programming that we'll do -- and Rich has one scripted series that we think is going to be very strong around the world.","Andrew C. Warren","Then your question, Anthony, about the segment reporting, a couple of comments. We wanted for investors to clarify and simplify kind of how we look at the business. Obviously, the studio business is very different from the networks business. So as we've invested in IP, as we've grown our presence in the studio business, we wanted to separate that and have it clarified so that the U.S. Networks, International Networks were truly stand-alone.","So within this new segment called Education and studios, we do expect for 2015 Education to have a slightly lower OIBDA than it had in 2014, as we invest in a longer-cycle Techbook. And also, we expect Studios to have a continued loss profile as again, we build that asset and own more and more global IP.","So think in terms of that segment -- well, understand the OIBDA was meaningfully down in the fourth quarter, driven by, again, investment in assets, particularly long-cycle Techbook as well as studio IP. And we expect in '15 again, that to be roughly breakeven OIBDA for that segment.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Kannan Venkateshwar from Barclays.","Kannan Venkateshwar - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just a couple of questions. The first is on the operating leverage and the international business. Looks like the content investment there, especially in sports, will keep going up. But on the other hand, is there any offset in terms of maybe integrating the sales forces or cost items that we can expect, now that we've been a few months into the Eurosport?","And the second question is on the FX side. Could you break out for us what the cash impact of FX is? Is it largely a translation impact that we're looking at right now?","David M. Zaslav","Thanks, Kannan. Look, on the international rights that we're acquiring, one of the advantages that I think we have with Eurosport, we reach 130 million homes with our Eurosport Pan-European feed. And then we have another 2 to 3 channels in 55 countries across Eastern and Western Europe.","Unlike the U.S., where it's football, baseball and basketball, which are very popular and if you're in sports, you have to have those 3. The equivalent of that would be soccer. But aside from soccer, there are affinity sports that are very popular in some regions and not so popular in others. So we've been able to pick up sports rights, I think, for very good -- very, very good values.","Now we're investing because we think having those rights will build our over-the-top service, where we make almost $100 a subscriber. We also see that we don't -- when we look at Eurosport, we look at it as, how does it build our whole package? So we might have 3 sport channels, but then we have another 10 channels. And we have integrated on distribution and on the ad sales side with very little incremental costs, because we already have local teams in place. And we're finding that the ability to go to the distributor with all of it will get us more value. And so you might see Eurosport's margins dropping as it's broken out individually, but the overall package of international will be rising and we think will accelerate. Because having these must-have rights together with our 10 channels -- where in almost every market, Discovery's the #1 channel for men, we have women's channels, will give us more strength.","In addition, we are going to be careful. We looked at Formula 1 and we liked the idea of Formula 1 because it's popular in 220 of our 230 countries. But the valuation was just way too high. So we walked away.","Andy?","Andrew C. Warren","Yes, Kannan, to add to that, we have said that a strategic and financial imperative for us is to grow our margin for our international business. And you could see that we did that by 200 basis points in the -- in 2014. So to your point, we're definitely seeing and driving that leverage. So as we think about 2015, while investing in sports and that will create a lot of long-term leverage and value, will depress margins, outside Eurosport and outside foreign exchange, we still see margin accretion for international business even despite what I mentioned was the $50 million bad guy associated with the collapse of the Russian currency and the economy.","So we still see that operating leverage. We're having a lot of success on cost productivity. We've done a really good job on driving cost synergies at both SBS and Eurosport. So we're going to invest in content that drives value, and we're going to continue to look at cost productivity to ensure base organic margins are up year-over-year over year.","Kannan Venkateshwar - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And could you help with the FX question, which is, is it largely translation and there's no real cash impact?","Andrew C. Warren","No, there's definitely a cash impact as well. I mean, while it is translation, there's -- when the day is done, this is both a transactional and translation risk. So our all-in reported free cash flow expectation of up low single digits certainly includes the fact that FX is depressing our currency impact of cash flows as well.","David M. Zaslav","And when we look at our international business, we have full conviction. And we have full conviction because these things are cyclical. We're looking at growing our international business double digit. We're looking at drive -- we have our local teams in place. Our market share grew over 13% last year. We think we can do that again this year. A lot of others are not investing internationally. Our model of global brands and global content gives us tremendous efficiency, and we love our international business.","I think over time, things can flip the other way, where it's working for us. But we're continuing to drive our market share, and we're being helped by the fact that others are walking away.","We also have conviction in Russia. We have a big business there. We have great brands and there is some challenges in terms of the politics. But having said that, by the end of the year, we need to restructure where we own only 20% of the entity. But there's been a lot of interest in our brands and our content and getting us value for that. And there's also been some green shoots around Putin looking again at pay-TV. So for us, we think Russia is a long-term growth market. There's certainly a lot of turbulence there, but our cost of content is very low. We have a huge amount of content in Russian language that's already and relationships. So while others are saying, \"Let's invest less internationally and let's walk away from Russia,\" we're staying in Russia. And we're continuing to push very hard on international, where we see not only great growth, but a lot of what we've talked about in terms of what's facing the U.S. market, the slowing behavioral changes in the way content is consumed. The Latin America is 4, 5 or 6 years behind. There are markets in Eastern Europe that may be more than that, so we see it as a big hedge and a big opportunity to take advantage of what we've built over the last 7 or 8 years.","Andrew C. Warren","And just to add one other point. Because we had the most profitable international business, obviously the strengthening dollar impacts us significantly. But it's important to realize that a lot of the things that we've done with regard to, like, issuing euro debt 1 year ago, the TF1 put that's opened, all of those actually are helping us the other way. In dollar terms, that euro debt is now less expensive. The put in dollar terms is now less expensive. And so a lot of those activities actually helped offset the dollar translation of our very profitable business.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Doug Mitchelson from UBS.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","David, you talked a lot about programming strategies on the call. Nancy Dubuc, CEO of A+E, recently lamented the lack of creativity and risk taking. She's been seen in the nonfiction genre the last couple of years, and so a pretty sort of core genre for you. I'm curious, David, would you agree with that characterization? And whether you agree or disagree, can you walk us through how the market for nonfiction has been changing over time in your view?","And Andy, I'm not very good at math, so I just wanted to make I'm doing the guidance correctly. Is the $1.82 to $1.91 sort of basically the EPS after FX impact range? You're giving us FX impact about $0.16. Am I doing that math right?","David M. Zaslav","Thanks, Doug. Nancy is a good friend. I've spent many years on the board of A+E. I think in history, she's doing a very nice job for them and she's a great programmer.","I would say that I somewhat disagree. I think the risk taking has been too much. We're actually going in the other direction.","If you look at what's happened to nonfiction, you see the aggressiveness of picking really kind of wacky characters of -- it's almost become scripted in the way that it's presented. And I think the audience here in America gets it. They get that this isn't really nonfiction. That some of these fights aren't real. That some of these characters aren't real.","And so what's really been working for us is, forget about what everyone else is doing, which is looking for more extreme characters, more extreme contention, to get back to basics. And we've actually made a strategic decision to do that and it's working for us. If you look at Treehouse Masters, no one's throwing mud at each other in Treehouse Masters.","This past Tuesday night, we did 19 and Counting. We're the #1 network in America for women, and we have got a 2 6 in the demo. And what is it about? It's about a family that homeschools their kids. And we followed it with another very wholesome family that's struggling with the issues that everyone in America's struggling with.","And so for us, whether it's Alaskan Bush, Gold Rush, Last Frontier, 19 Kids and Counting, Treehouse Masters, we think that a lot of the nonfiction challenge has been going into this extreme area. We're getting back to great characters, heroic characters that are doing jobs, that are facing challenges, that all of us, as we sit on the couch, look at and admire. That's what -- that's why people love Gold Rush. That's why they still, after 11 seasons, love Deadliest Catch. Last Frontier and Bush are about families living off the grid. And so I think that nonfiction is working very well for us, and we have to remember what we do best, which is great authentic characters that are fighting the fight to live, to make the best of their lives. And when we do that, we do very well.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Andy?","Andrew C. Warren","Yes, Doug, to answer your question, your math is very much in line with kind of our thinking. Our pre-FX adjusted EPS, up high single to low double translate to the kind of math and process you just laid out.","Operator","The next question comes from that line of Jessica Reif Cohen from the Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jessica Reif Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I have a couple. First on advertising, I heard what you said about the near term. But the -- your change in the upfronts, does that signal any change in longer-term advertising outlook or your strategy in selling in the U.S.?","David M. Zaslav","Okay, I take -- look, I think -- we came well off of a slowdown in the second half of last year, where the volume just stopped. Volume is better now but we're just not prepared to give guidance to say that volume is going to continue at this level and accelerate. So I think your guess is as good as ours.","On the upfront, that was really a decision that was driven by Joe Abruzzese and the team. We looked at who's been coming to the upfront over the last couple of years, and then we looked who comes to the -- a number of the dinners that we do around that time. And we find that the more senior players are coming to the dinners and that we weren't getting the real -- the buyers that are making a difference in the upfront. So we're going to have a lot of the same material. We're going to have the same sell, but we're going to do it in small teams going directly to the buyers and the agencies. And we think this -- that, that could be more effective. We'll assess how it goes. It was really Joe feeling that going to the offices of the actual buyers will be stronger, getting directly to the buyers themselves.","Jessica Reif Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Right. And then given the currency headwind, I mean, looking at it another way given the dollar is so strong, don't you think it's a great time to go shopping? I mean, given your comments on the international markets, is this the time to be a little more active?","David M. Zaslav","Well, look, the fact -- obviously, it plays both ways. So to the extent there are assets outside the U.S., they're more than 15% cheaper than they were a few months ago because of the currency.","Having said that, we have a -- we now have more than 10 channels in 220 countries and we have a business that we think we can grow significantly over the next several years. So we don't want to buy anything that's going to -- that would slow us down. And so we have the advantage of having probably more synergy than anyone else. We have boots on the ground to make the assessment. But I -- we are going to be disciplined because I think we have a very good hand. We're way out front internationally. We're growing and most of our competitors are not investing and walking away. So we're getting a lot of growth just by doing what we're doing.","So I think that, that's what you'll see. If we can get good synergy and we can buy and grow faster, we'll do it. Otherwise, there's no reason to stretch.","Andrew C. Warren","And just to elaborate on that from a purely financial perspective. We still very much hold the -- any deal criteria has to have a low-teen unleveraged IRR. And when we compare any allocation of capital to M&A, we compare it to the IRR we get on repurchasing our shares, which has an extremely high IRR, not only given where our stocks hits today but also sort of given our free cash flow per share growth profile. So while you're right, the assets are cheaper in dollar terms, there still is very much that hurdle around IRRs in comparison to share repurchases.","Jessica Reif Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great. And one last one. On Eurosport, what was the stand-alone growth in 2014? And how volatile will it be in 2015 and beyond, given all your comments about investing and driving growth through sports rights?","Andrew C. Warren","Yes, in 2014, the business performed very well. It was kind at or better than our deal expectations for the full year, which we only consolidated 7 months. But for the full year, revenues were up nicely and profits were up nicely as well. Part of the commentary around '15 is, while we're going to be consolidating the full year, we do expect the margins on Eurosport stand-alone to go from high teen to high single digits.","But one thing David talked about was, it's less relevant, I think, today more than ever to look at Eurosport by itself because of the overall leverage we're getting across the whole international portfolio. So I think as we talk about Eurosport, it's got to be on the holistic view versus just Eurosport itself, because so much of the benefits we're deriving are outside the 4 walls of just Eurosport performance.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Todd Juenger from Sanford Bernstein.","Todd Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","First, on international advertising. Listen, I hearing all the good news about the share you're gaining with audiences, new networks, new distribution, still posting double-digit ad revenue growth globally x currency. I guess my question is for the year, I think it was a 14% number. For the quarter, it was a 10% number. So my question is, sort of what's the difference? What changed? How much of that is -- is it Russia? Is it just overall demand sluggishness? Does that tie to macro? Or is does it tie to something about the maturation of pay-TV? Then I do have a follow-up, I'm sorry, Andy, about guidance, which I'll come back with next.","David M. Zaslav","I'll hit it generally. A piece of that was Russia. And piece of it was -- you take a look at our market share growth. Our market share growth in the fourth quarter was a little bit better than 10%, whereas the rest of the year, it was more like 13% or 14%. And so that is sort of a measure that we follow like a laser. How many people -- are we getting more people spending more time with our channels? Our market share's doing a little bit better now. And part of it also has to do with the marketplace.","In -- aside from just Russia, we saw strength across Eastern and Western Europe. We saw a lot of strength in Latin America. And for the first time in the fourth quarter, Asia was not double digit where it's been, but it's been mostly made up for the fact that Brazil has been exploding.","One of the things that we're seeing in Latin America is how important Brazil is to us. Advertising revenue, up almost 50% last year in Brazil, and in the first quarter, we're seeing -- even though it's lapping, similar. So the fact that it's gotten to 30% penetration in Brazil, that's kind of triggered the advertising marketplace to start spending more time there.","So I think we're losing -- we lost Russia. We picked up a lot in Brazil. And the rest of the marketplace is pretty strong, with the exception of Asia.","Andrew C. Warren","And just to add to that, Todd. Part of this is just the law of large numbers, where we had almost $1.2 billion of total ad sales in 2013, international. In 2014, it's almost $1.5 billion. And so we're still expecting that, as we said in the guidance, for that to be still in that low double-digit range throughout 2015.","So the proof point is still there. We still very much have a larger share of audience and share of economics, and we still see that momentum continuing in most of our markets, with Russia and the Russia ad ban being a significant issue and one reason why, to your point, the growth is slowing a little bit.","Todd Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","That's very helpful. Pick up, Andy, again I'm sorry, on guidance issue, I'm just trying to square my math here as well. Really on the top line revenue guidance, which I think I heard is high single, low double-digit sort of constant currency. But then if I look at each of the line items of revenue, major line items, the only one that's double digit, I guess, is international advertising. And I heard high single digits for international distribution. You didn't give specific U.S. but it sounds like that's sort of maybe mid-singles for U.S. So I'm trying to figure out how we get to high single, low double given those -- you could see the line items. Obviously, some of that is Eurosport and even more the Hub. So maybe you could help us, if you take those out, what the sort of underlying core revenue growth rate is x those 2 pieces?","Andrew C. Warren","Got it. Well, no, Todd, you're right. I mean, the commentary about high single, low double includes Eurosport, includes Family. And so there's a benefit of consolidating more periods of time for those assets. But if you exclude those on a core basis, you're really kind of at mid- to high single on organic revenue.","To your point, we said that advertising will be better than the fourth quarter result. So call it in line or maybe a little lower than we had for the full year U.S. in 2014. We said we've seen acceleration of U.S. affiliate, because the deals that we successfully gotten done as well as the inclusion of Sony. And then for international, we said kind of high single affiliate and low double ad. So all those together kind of gets you to that mid- to high-single organic, excluding Eurosport and Family.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Alexia Quadrani from JPMorgan.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just to follow up on your comment about the investment spending in Eurosport, is that really going to be largely a 2015 event? Or do you think it's something, given the timing of some contracts, that's go into '16 and beyond?","And then I would just love your general comment, if you have any, on the current measurement system. And domestically, how that may be hampering your ratings? And any color -- any further color on decision, I think yesterday, to drop the life of [indiscernible].","David M. Zaslav","Great. Let me handle the Nielsen piece. As you look around the world, it's sad that you look at the U.S. as being on the very -- on the lower end of antiquated measurement systems. It's one of the -- it may be the most robust advertising market in the world and the most efficient. And yet, the measurement is very weak.","You look -- you go to markets like Norway and it's cue tone based. So anybody that watches anything, whether you're watching in a bar or you're watching at your vacation house, whether you're watching on your iPad, it counts. And viewership on -- in Norway is up 15%. Before they implemented last year this new system, it showed that viewership on television was down double digit. And it was a huge swing.","We're working with Nielsen, all the programmers are. The problem is it's a monopoly here in the U.S. it's a real -- it is a real challenge and there's no question that it's under-measuring, but it's the system that we have.","When you look at, for instance, how we do when you aggregate -- one of the reasons we went to live plus 3 is our viewership is up dramatically. And there's just a lot of unmeasured here in the U.S. So it is what it is. Outside the U.S., we do a little bit better. I think they'll fix it over time, but it's a problem.","Andrew C. Warren","And then on Eurosport, Alexia. Look, we will be and continue to be extremely cautious about which sports rights we go after. And again, it's all about a combination of both strengthening our Pan-European but also probably more importantly, the hyper local aspects of Eurosport and how we can get it to benefits.","So yes, we're going to have increased content spend in '15. We will continue to have increased content spend in '16 and '17. It will moderate relative to what we see the opportunity being this year. But again, I want to make sure everyone understands that we're going to do it in a very thoughtful, cautious and careful way. But we do think it's an asset that if we invest in, will drive a tremendous amount of long-term value for the entire international portfolio.","David M. Zaslav","And it's a playbook that we've been playing for a long time. It's how we went from 5% of viewership with 14 channels here in the U.S. to almost 13% of viewership now, when almost the majority of media companies have lost market share. We picked up hockey rights. They're not that expensive in Northern Europe.","So we know that we have this Eurosport channel that's in 130 million homes, the only platform like it. We know we have an average of 10 traditional channels in every market. But we have 2 to 3 other sports channels that we're getting paid on. They're in basic. And so when we buy the hockey rights, we now have a hockey -- a regional hockey channel in -- that we have launched in Sweden. And so it wasn't very expensive. And we've seen the value of the regional sports networks here in the U.S. with the YES Network -- the YES Network been more valuable than the Yankees themselves. And so we see the playbook. The cost of a lot of this content, when we can pick up affinity sports, is not that high. We already have the channels. We won't have these, what we're calling a regional sports networks in every country. But the ability to pick up rights and just flip a switch and have a Pan-European Eurosport, our 10 channels and then, boom, we got a hockey channel. Now we're going to distributors; we're going to advertisers; our incremental cost, not that high. We think that could be a real accelerator for us.","Operator","Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this call is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Andrew Slabin, Executive Vice President of Global Investor Strategy. Please go ahead.","Andrew Slabin","Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for Discovery's fourth quarter 2018 earnings call. Joining me today are David Zaslav, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Gunnar Wiedenfels, our Chief Financial Officer; and JB Perrette, our President and CEO of International.","You should have received our earnings release, but if not, feel free to access it on our website at www.corporate.Discovery.com.","On today's call, we will begin with some opening comments from David and Gunnar and then we will open up the call for your questions. Please try to keep to one question, so we can accommodate as many people as possible.","Before we start, I would like to remind you that comments today regarding the company's future business plans, prospects, and financial performance are forward-looking statements that we make pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are made based on management's current knowledge and assumptions about future events and may involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations.","In providing projections and other forward-looking statements, the company disclaims any intent or obligation to update them. For additional information on important factors that could affect these expectations, please see our Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2017, and our subsequent filings made with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.","And with that, I will turn the call over to David.","David Zaslav","Good morning everyone and thank you all for joining us on today's call.","Before we begin, I'd like to extend a warm welcome to JB Perrette, our President and CEO of International. JB and I have been working together for almost 20 years and I'm pleased that he'll be joining us on this morning's earnings call. With so much exciting activity taking place across our diversified international portfolio, JB can help provide some color and perspective on what's taking place in the many international markets in which we operate.","I'm pleased to report that we delivered a strong set of operating results this morning capping off a transformative year for Discovery.","Coming up on a year since our merger with Scripps, I'm proud of the achievements and progress we've made in a short amount of time and even more excited about the opportunities ahead.","Over the last year, we've reengineered our company, creating a leaner, more efficient, and more focused global operating structure, represented impressively in our expanding operating margins which increased by 600 basis points this quarter and we expect to expand our margins further in 2019 as Gunnar will discuss.","Our better than expected free cash flow generation and our significantly reduced net leverage reduced by roughly a turn in just 10 months. We are a free cash flow machine and we intend to drive it hard.","We've also taken meaningful steps to strengthen and solidify our core businesses by adding exclusive new content and capitalizing on the uniqueness of our global loved brand and treasure trove of IP. We are powering people's passions with Immersive 360 degree media ecosystems in popular and valuable content categories uniquely combining linear and direct-to-consumer experiences.","And we continue to enhance our global suite of brands and IP that have real utility and function, helping to further differentiate us from our peers. We have a growing opportunity to more effectively attract and engage viewers around the world and across all platforms, against the backdrop of our position as the number two TV Company in America including broadcast and cable.","Our leadership position in 200 countries and territories around the globe with multiple channels in every market making us the number one pay-TV company in the world. We cast a uniquely wide global net essentially unparalleled. Our existing reach allows us to drive awareness to our emerging set of consumer services.","I've referred to this in the past as having a brick and mobile presence or the ability to drive awareness on the ground to our mobile and direct-to-consumer presence. Our ubiquitous global brands and pay and free to air channels such as the Discovery Channel, Animal Planet, Food, HDTV MotorTrend, Science, TLC, ID, Oprah, and Eurosport and valuable strategic long-term partnerships like those with the Olympic Games and the PGA Tour, the European Tour, and Tiger Woods, helped to differentiate us on this front.","Our Global IP which we own above the globe is also distinguished by the fact that it married entertainment with function and utility. And in an environment where 5G and bigger broader pipes create wider lanes into the home and directly to consumers wherever they are, the nature of what nourishes people can and will change, we're extraordinarily well suited to capitalize on that.","We view our passion verticals like Food, Home, Natural History, Science, Auto, and Oprah, as representing great examples of where our functional content can extend into new ecosystems with a conversation with viewers, fans, and participants has elevated into an experience that brings watching and doing together. When it comes to traditional scripted content and movies, people watch that content. We have an opportunity to create content and experiences where people watch and do.","Additionally, our strategy has been to own and control virtually all of our content rights in every window, in every market around the world. We have purposely left meaningful revenue dollars on the table by playing the long game as compared to many of our peers that have for example hived off digital distribution to any number of streaming services or sold-off international rights. As a result, we will not have to buy back content and give up revenue to drive our strategy forward. It allows us to have great speed to market and accelerate our ability to scale as services gain consumer appeal.","For example, let's look at the Food and Cooking category, a broad genre that represents a multiple $100 billion addressable marketplace in which we have excelled as a perennial top cable network for decades.","We enjoy rich engagement with a strong and trusted brand that is loved by fans. The Food Network reaches over 150 million global fans per month on its digital properties alone and they consume over 450 million monthly video views, enjoy a leading social footprint, has 10 million monthly readers of our Food newsletter, and over 80,000 recipes that are regularly assessed. When fans think of Food, our brands are well represented and our relationships run deep and wide and serve as a great backbone from which we can continue to pursue entirely new business models.","In our drive to build and own the global cycling ecosystem, we acquired the Global Cycling Network last month. It is a targeted and highly valuable global audience including a sizable group here in the U.S. and it follows on the heels of our multi-platform global alliance with the PGA Tour in which we are seeking to super serve communities of passionate sports fans.","We first invested in the Global Cycling Network two years ago and recently took a large majority ownership position. We're now the leader in serving passionate highly participatory and high income cycling enthusiasts around the globe, $50 billion plus market. The business model has multiple revenue streams including advertising, subscription, commerce, and events among others, and by complementing Eurosport's position as the home of cycling in Europe we believe there is great upside to this combination and offering.","And it's a terrific blueprint much like MotorTrend, another strong example of the vertical where we have been able to drive an Immersive 360 degree offering by leveraging our linear presence, in-depth IP, and brand recognition with fans.","We've gotten off to a great start with Golf TV, our long-term relationship with the PGA Tour and we're very pleased with early product results. While we're still in beta and really just getting started, we're happy with the quality of the technological capabilities thus far and early engagement numbers are impressive after only a few events.","We're super excited about our global relationship with Tiger Woods and the initial Tiger content is proving to be a great driver of interest. Tiger is having a lot of fun with the interface with fans and we've already produced over 30 original pieces that have been consumed by millions of fans over just the first three tournaments. And we are enthused by the positive perception we've seen to both the linear and OTT product within the initial countries where we've come to market and we're hard at work building something truly unique in the years ahead.","As we dig deeper and refine our strategy in direct-to-consumer under Peter Faricy and his team, we gain a great perspective on how best to pivot our resources financially, strategically, technologically, and operationally to the consumer first mindset that engages fans across the breadth and depth of our functional content verticals. And building upon the experiences we've gained from our initial forays into this ecosystem such as launching the Eurosport Player and our GO apps which are now a several $100 million a year business and growing. We\u2019ve gained some great insights into what works and what doesn't.","You've heard me say repeatedly achieving success in the direct-to-consumer world will require a lot more than a simple shifting of content from one platform to another. We believe the successful offering requires an experience that is immersive, trusted, informative, educational, social, and community driven. And by virtue of our many functional verticals, we're well suited to successfully pivot our businesses forward.","Gunnar will take you through the financials in detail in a few moments, but I'd like to highlight just a few key items. Our brands continue to strongly resonate and feel differentiated within a content landscape that is increasingly cluttered and crowded. Whether marked by the continued momentum at TLC, picking up even more momentum from where it finished 2018 as the number one ranked channel in Prime in January for women 25 to 54, or the Impressive resurgence in ratings at both Food and HDTV that began midway through 2018, the continued success at ID which maintained its number one position in total day for women 25 to 54. Thus, even with the noted rating challenges at the Flagship Discovery which are improving and Discovery is still the number one network for men in Prime XSports.","Our portfolio still achieved domestic advertising revenue growth of 3% despite not having news or sports which speaks to the power of our broad portfolio balance.","We launched additional Legacy Discovery Networks late in the fourth quarter on Hulu and Sling solidifying our long held view that our portfolio brands does indeed resonate in an OTT world and we continue to strive to partner with every and all key OTT players in the marketplace.","Turning to International. While our results are somewhat skewed due to the tough comparisons against the China Mobile distribution deal and deconsolidation of our Eurosport Germany ProSieben venture, our underlying International performance remains solid particularly in light of softness in certain international markets such as UK with Brexit, Italy, and Mexico due to economic and political challenges. We remain focused on continuing to integrate and take full advantage of Scripps content and brands internationally.","It's still very early and will take time to see these benefits fully materialize but less than a year into it, we're seeing positive signs on our three main objectives and benefits.","One, driving meaningful cost savings by replacing acquired content. These content cost synergies are a meaningful contributor to yet another quarter of margin expansion that we have delivered in 4Q and anticipate more in 2019.","Two, leveraging the previously unexploited content and formats to strengthen our existing international networks. Scripps content is now making up from single-digit to low 20% of schedules in certain key markets such as Germany, Italy, Brazil, and Mexico and we are seeing continued improvements in performance as well.","And finally, three, launching new pay free-to-air and digital branded services focused primarily around Food and HDTV where in markets such as Europe and Latin America, we're securing commitments and getting off to a great start with new network launches.","Lastly, we believe that we have the right combination of linear and non-linear platforms. The strongest hand in Global IP and some of the strongest brands in creative curators in the world, all supported by a strong and de-levered balance sheet throwing off a ton of cash which provides us with great runway and optionality. We're confident in our ability to execute during this time of disruption and during this time of great opportunity.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Gunnar.","Gunnar Wiedenfels","Thank you, David, and thank you everyone for joining us today.","As David stated, 2018 was a momentous transformational year for Discovery, as we completed the acquisition and integration of Scripps and I'm so proud of what we have accomplished operationally, strategically, and financially. We remain well ahead of our original expectations in our synergy realization and overall company transformation and are very optimistic about Discovery's outlook.","Let me now walk through our fourth quarter and full-year financial results. My commentary today will again focus on our pro forma results which include the operations of Scripps as well as OWN and MotorTrend as if all had been owned since the beginning of 2017 and will be in constant currency terms for the International and total company commentary unless otherwise stated.","Please refer to our earnings release filed earlier this morning for all of the detailed cuts of our fourth quarter and full-year results. For the full-year 2018, Discovery achieved or exceeded all of our total company guidance metrics with 8% full-year adjusted OIBDA growth helped by a decline in SG&A and total costs due primarily to strong synergies from the Scripps transaction.","Over $2.4 billion of reported free cash flow as we benefited from strong operating performance and working capital timing and deficiencies partially offset by Scripps related acquisition and integration costs. And as David noted, we ended the year with net leverage of 3.7 times roughly a full turn lower than when we closed the transaction.","Looking at the rest of our full-year results, total company revenues were up 3% with 2% domestic growth which was driven by 3% advertising growth and 1% distribution growth and 8% International growth which was driven by 3% ad growth, 5% distribution growth, and almost 90% other revenue growth primarily from sub-licensing a portion of our Olympics rights in the first quarter. This was partially offset by a 66% decline for education and other due to the April sale of our Education division. Pro forma revenue growth excluding the impact of the sale of the Education business was 4%.","As I previously noted, adjusted OIBDA grew 8% well above revenue growth as total company costs were down year-over-year despite having the first quarter Winter Olympics in Europe and despite continued investment in digital initiatives as we realized significant synergies from the merger.","Full-year net income increased to $594 million versus a net loss in the prior year which was impacted by the non-cash European goodwill write-down. Our full-year tax rate came in at 33% higher than our latest expectation of the high 20% range due to higher than expected taxes in the fourth quarter primarily due to a book tax charge associated with net deferred tax assets as well as additional fourth quarter non-cash impairments and restructuring charges which impacted net income before taxes in our International division.","Focusing now on our total company fourth quarter results, total company revenues were down 1% with 2% domestic growth and flat International growth and a large decline in Education and other due to the sale of the Education business.","Adjusted OIBDA increased 16% and margins expanded a healthy 600 basis points helped by significant declines in costs both in the U.S. and internationally in large part due to merger synergy which more than offset continued investments in our digital initiatives.","Now let's look at our individual operating units, fourth quarter results, starting with our U.S. segment. Total U.S. revenues grew 2%. We had another quarter of solid advertising growth of 3% which was driven by strong pricing and continued modernization of our GO TV Everywhere platform, partially offset by the impact of lower linear rating particularly at the Flagship Discovery Network.","Distribution revenues grew 1% driven by increases in affiliate rates and additional contributions due to new carriage on Sling and Hulu towards the end of the year for certain key Legacy Discovery nets, partially offset by a decline in linear subscribers across the full portfolio for the three months.","Delving further into the drivers of fourth quarter U.S. affiliate growth, subscriber trends at our top fully distributed nets like Discovery and TLC which are driving the LION's share of our economics were flat at the end of December, a nice improvement versus down 2% in the prior quarter primarily due to the additional carriage on Hulu and Sling. While total portfolio subs declined 4% year-over-year as expected due to continued high-single to low double-digit losses at our smaller nets.","Total domestic costs were down 13% due to content synergies and lower personnel costs leading to 17% growth in fourth quarter domestic adjusted OIBDA and very strong 56% domestic margins or 700 basis points of year-over-year margin expansion.","Turning now to our International segment. Fourth quarter advertising growth came in flat year-over-year as increases in Europe primarily due to pricing were offset by declines in Asia and in Latin America where double-digit growth in Brazil was more than offset by declines in Mexico and other markets.","Fourth quarter affiliate growth of 2% came in ahead of our guidance as increases in Europe due primarily to higher pricing and increases in Latin America due to greater than expected increases in subscribers as well as pricing were partially offset by declines in Asia, our smallest market due to lower pricing as well as a tough comp versus contributions from our mobile licensing deal in China in the fourth quarter of last year and the continued impact from the proceeds in JV.","Turning to the cost side, operating costs were down 6% in the fourth quarter with cost of revenue down 9% primarily due to content synergy and flat SG&A with personnel cost reductions from the integration of Scripps offsetting increased personnel hiring primarily related to the digital initiatives. This led to 15% adjusted OIBDA growth and 500 basis point of year-over-year margin expansion.","So now that I have reviewed the highlights of our 2018 results, let me share some forward-looking commentary on 2019. From a total company perspective starting with free cash flow, we are very proud to have come in at over $2.4 billion of free cash flow in 2018 versus a target of around $2.3 billion that we said going into the year. I think this is a great result given our priority of de-levering the company as quickly as possible taking net leverage down roughly a full turn in less than 10 months. This represents a free cash flow conversion of over 55% of adjusted OIBDA which underscores the strong potential for cash generation at the new Discovery and nicely offset the significant step-up in operating investments in our direct-to-consumer and overall global digital businesses.","Looking ahead in 2019, we expect another year of healthy free cash flow growth based on further adjusted OIBDA growth and continued margin expansion even after further $200 million to $300 million digital P&L investments, lower cash restructuring costs to achieve which we currently expect to be around $150 million versus $400 million in 2018, and further focus on working capital efficiency.","There will be some offsetting factors such as higher cash taxes and a roughly $100 million step-up in capital expenditures as part of our further transformation efforts but we will continue to be laser-focused on driving healthy free cash flow growth after also making the investments necessary to build out our direct-to-consumer portfolio.","We will continue to update you over the course of the year as we refine the timing and magnitude of our digital investments based on progress, acceptance, and the ultimate success of our initiative.","I also wanted to share some commentary around our synergy progress. In 2018, we grew adjusted OIBDA by 8% despite significant investments in digital initiatives primarily due to strong merger benefits across the full global portfolio. While it will become increasingly difficult to identify synergy versus underlying business momentum, we continue to relentlessly drive our ongoing transformation, and as we look ahead to 2019, we will strive towards further cost and revenue upside. And while we expect to increase our investments in our strategic pivot, merger synergies will allow us to more than offset these investments and even after realizing healthy margin expansion in 2018, we expect to see additional margin expansion in 2019.","On leverage, we remain well ahead of our schedule to get our net leverage within our target range of 3 to 3.5 times and we expect to be under 3.5 times in the first half of this year.","We will discuss our capital allocation plans in more detail once we are within our target range, but for now, our priorities have not changed: first, to reinvest in our businesses; second, to pursue strategic and value accretive M&A investments; and third, to return capital to shareholders through share buybacks.","With two-thirds of the first quarter now under our belt, I will also give some color around our four key revenue drivers on the pro forma constant currency basis for the first quarter 2019.","First, for U.S. advertising, growth is expected to be up in the low-single-digit range with similar dynamics as in the fourth quarter of last year, continued pricing increases and the continued monetization of our digital and GO products, partially offset by lower linear ratings on a year-over-year basis. Portfolio ratings overall are currently similar quarter-to-date, though key networks like Discovery and TLC are slightly improved versus the fourth quarter supported by additional carriage on Sling and Hulu. Where our ratings end up for the quarter will help determine where we will fall within our guidance range. We would note that we expect a positive impact from having additional nets on Sling and Hulu to continue to slightly pick up throughout the year.","Second, U.S. affiliate growth is expected to be up around 3% to 4%, Instagram over the course of the year to be up comfortably in the mid-single-digit-range on a full-year basis again given expected tough growth at virtual MVPD. Note this guidance assumes no significant change in the industry's underlying subscriber trends.","Third, International advertising growth is expected to be down high-single-digits due to the tough comp versus the Olympics in Europe in the first quarter of last year as underlying trends remain relatively consistent with what we saw in the fourth quarter across our markets.","And finally, International affiliate growth will be around flat where again underlying trends remain relatively consistent with last quarter across our markets. So in the first quarter, we face a much tougher comp versus our China Mobile licensing deal in Asia as we delivered more than double the content in the first quarter of 2018 versus the fourth quarter of 2017 as well as some year-over-year impact from additional digital revenues associated with the Olympics and the Eurosport player in last year's first quarter.","Before I close, let me quantify the expected foreign exchange impact on our 2019 results. At current spot rates, FX is now expected to negatively impact revenues by approximately $150 million to $160 million and adjusted OIBDA by $65 million to $75 million versus our 2018 reported results.","In closing, we remain extremely optimistic about the outlook for the new Discovery which will allow us to accelerate the transformation of our business, drive free cash flow, and ultimately generate significant long-term value for our shareholders.","Thank you again for your time this morning and now, David, JB, and I will be happy to answer any questions that you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions].","Our first question is from the line of Jessica Reif Ehrlich with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Jessica Reif Ehrlich","Thank you. I have a multi-parter, first JB it's great to have you on the call and would love to take advantage of that. When we last met in Warsaw in fall, you gave a compelling view of TVM's growth. Can you give us -- can you talk about the importance -- let me put it this way, given the importance of Poland in the International portfolio, could you give us an update on the strength of that market, kind of the drivers of that market and maybe on a less positive note, can you give us some color on what's going on in Latin America with the ratings. And then for Gunnar or David, just to come back to the free cash flow comment on 2019, can you give us a little clarity on what the building blocks are for free cash flow? You talked -- you said it does seem like a little more to go in synergy both on the cost and the operational side but just a little bit of color on that would be great?","Gunnar Wiedenfels","Yes, good morning, Jessica. This is Gunnar. Let me start with some more background on -- my thinking around free cash flow. David and I've been speaking about free cash flow and the ability of this new combined company to generate cash quite a bit. And I'm actually very proud of the tremendous progress that we've made with the $2.4 billion number for 2018 again only 10 months into the combination. And again keep in mind that includes about $400 million of restructuring cash out, and also we have made all the investments in our digital and direct-to-consumer portfolio this year that we -- that we felt necessary.","So I think that's a great result and we're still very excited and encouraged by the further potential. And that's why for 2019, as I said earlier, we're guiding to a healthy growth. There's going to be significant improvement in the cash generated by the underlying operation of this business. And as we go through the year, we will make the decisions of how much and at what times we reinvest part of that cash and that's going to determine the reported free cash flow number.","In terms of the building blocks that you asked for, clearly we're expecting further underlying AOIBDA growth. And as I said, I'm expecting further margin expansion this year on top of the margin expansion that we saw in 2018.","Also again cash restructuring costs of course are going to come down. We're currently expecting about $150 million in cash out in 2019 after $400 million in 2018. We will continue to focus on working capital efficiency. I still see a lot of potential there. And that's going to be a focus area again in 2019 as it has been last year. And then clearly as we de-lever and pay down debt, cash and expenses is going to come down over time.","Now on the offsetting side, clearly there will be higher taxes as we grow our net income before tax. We're also planning for a roughly $100 million step-up in CapEx. That's essentially for two parts. Number one is building out our global tech stack. And number two is some transformational investments that we're making related to consolidating our real estate footprint systems integration et cetera.","And then of course the main factor this year is going to be the further P&L investments that we're planning to make. We've got a great portfolio, we've made some key decisions but other decisions are yet to come. And we want to maintain the flexibility and the number and the timing of those investments is ultimately going to determine how much we drop to reported free cash flow. That's why I didn't give a specific number but as you can see, we continue to be super excited and confident about the cash generation.","David Zaslav","What's critical here is when we closed on Scripps, I have laid out a little less than a year ago that we saw this company as being really unique and that we could generate huge free cash flow which we're doing and we'll continue to do and we see it accelerating. But the most important element here is the uniqueness of this company today. The idea that we can generate this kind of free cash flow, and as I said at the time, we can become a free cash flow machine. And what that really does for us in an environment of where there's challenges in the overall ecosystem, it gives us a moat and that moat is all this free cash flow. And as we look at Golf, Cycling, Natural History, we look at Chip and Joanna Gains and the power of their brands and their ability to reach. We look at those different initiatives and we could say this is really working well. We can deploy more capital here. This isn't accelerating, let's deploy less capital but we have full flexibility. And I think that makes us -- that gives us a really unique advantage. JB?","JB Perrette","Yes, hey Jessica. Thanks for the welcome; it's great to have you and so many of our investors over in Warsaw last fall. So on the two questions, first on Poland; we really see the Polish and the TVN asset as a big game changer for us. And really the focus is on three things.","Number one; there is strong number one position in TV. We had -- we closed 2018 with record audience share of 27%, our fall season reached an even higher percentage of 29% share with great fall season launches starting in September. And so we couldn't be more excited about the momentum on the TV side.","Second, we have the leading local OTT business in with all the content that TVN producers in that market and we continue to see strong double-digit growth across the board in our digital business in Poland.","And third, it's given us a major hub to produce both on the backend side of our business as well as on the production side at very low cost great shows. And so we've done some great production so far at 30% to 40% discounts is what we could do either in the U.S. or internationally with things like House Hunters International and some other shows and then we're moving more of our back office activities in some areas to a very low cost and very competitive and high skilled environment. So those three areas have frankly outperformed even what we thought and so we couldn't be more excited about the momentum of the Polish business at the moment.","On LATAM, it's frankly a little less; it's not so much a ratings issue. Ratings actually continue to perform well. We're getting as David alluded to in his comments earlier, great commitments from distributors to launch Food and HG, millions of new subs in that region. That's -- the momentum on the operating side both audience and distribution wise remains strong. The challenge really is frankly a lot about Mexico and volume challenges given the political instabilities in that market right now. And Brazil is doing well much better than we did, as David mentioned, we had double-digit growth in the fourth quarter and we continued to see strong improvements in the ad sales market in Brazil. So it seems like it's more of a cyclical issue for us in LATAM and we're hopeful that Mexico will over the course of the year begin to stabilize. And if Brazil continues on the progress it's made in fourth and first then we should have a better story as we get into the back half of the year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Alexia Quadrani","Hi, thank you very much. Just a question really following up on your International commentary bit more generally though in terms of how we should think about International advertising, obviously there is some weakness in Brexit you guys highlighted, does that -- in UK does that get worse before it gets better. And I guess when do you think the Scripps content generally make a difference to the International advertising story? And then just a follow-up for David if I may, I'd love to hear your commentary on how you view Netflix, is it a bigger competitor now in the unscripted content space both in terms of tracking the right content or resources for your networks or viewership just curious to hear your comments?","JB Perrette","So on International, look obviously it's one word as you guys know that's very complicated to paint with one brush given the number of markets but I would say it's -- we really see a bit of a mix. We've seen some markets that are particularly strong. Frankly for us, we talked about Poland markets, some of the Nordic markets which have historically been more challenging, we're seeing great actually growth in markets like Sweden. So there are some markets where the volume and the markets continue to be strong and we have seen then in some other markets which are softer that David alluded to. Brexit specifically, frankly I wish I could tell you, I think we're all sort of waiting as to what the outcome will be. I -- it's hard to say whether that will be a, I don't think it's a short-term fix. But ultimately there is an extension granted in some capacity could the market improve in the back half of the year possibly, it\u2019s just very hard to predict at this point.","On the Scripps content, look I think again in a market -- in a marketplace where we saw stronger markets in some of the biggest markets we have, the audience performance is actually trending very positively. So the good news is audiences and ratings are strong as the year progresses and if we see some of these bigger markets stabilize, we've talked about the UK, we have talked about Mexico earlier that I think the monetization will come in towards the back half of the year and over time as we go into 2020.","David Zaslav","On the Netflix Prime, Amazon Prime, HBO Showtime that let me answer it in two ways. One is Food, Travel, ID with Crime home, all those are growing. People are spending more time with us; they're watching more of our content it's growing. This is difficult stuff. And this is what we do for a living. We have a team that does only Food and we work with production companies that deal almost primarily with us. And we figured out how to create shows and build characters in that genre. In the Home genre the same, in the Crime, there's loads of people doing Crime, but Henry Schleiff and his team know how to do it and work with production companies in a collaborative way that I think give us a really unique advantage.","So we're seeing growth in those areas and it's what we do. When people go to HBO and they go to Showtime and they go to Amazon Prime and Netflix they're really going for something else, they're paying $10 to $15 for scripted series and scripted movies. That's what the brand is. And look on a broader basis as we get -- as we get further and further into our mission of powering people's passions, people spend about 50% of their time on scripted series and scripted movies and they spent about 50% of their time on everything else.","And we've picked out these passionate brands and categories that we think that have -- that are the most compelling in this everything else area. And the big opportunity here is that the right side this scripted series and scripted movies, people watch that stuff, that's all they do, is they watch it, they watch a great scripted series and they watch movies.","On our side, we're focusing on this idea that they watch and they do. And that's a huge opportunity. They watch Golf but they also buy Golf equipment. They also -- they will go to Tiger for instruction. They want to see where to take a vacation with Golf. They watch cycling but they buy equipment with cycling and they want to find out where to go to get to get the best clothing and what's the most -- what's the best coaching.","When it comes to Food, people watch our content but they also want recipes. They want to talk to experts about how to make, how to engage in, in that category long form and short form. And so we think between Home, Cycling, PGA, Natural History, Travel, Oprah, we're in these categories where people will watch and do and that's why we bought this cycling business. That's why we got into the PGA and even in categories like Natural History where we're the leader globally. People may watch a particular piece of content but then they can take a deep dive into our science or space categories. So we think we don't have -- we're in an environment where we're a real market leader. We're differentiated and we have this opportunity in this watch and do, that could create a real opportunity build businesses in these funnels.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Doug Mitchelson with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Doug Mitchelson","Hello, thanks so much. I guess two questions, JB curious regarding your sports strategy internationally in Latin America and Asia, with Fox Sports in Brazil and Mexico be a natural fit if Disney has to sell them for deal approval purposes and if not wanting to touch that one just more broadly given the viewing declines mentioned and the pricing declines in Asia, would sports in those markets be something that might make sense to pursue at some point similar to what you've done in Europe. And David on your end, I think a lot of investors look at the stock valuation and while they want you to invest in growth, I think they also think the company should be buying back stock hand over fist and I think what's been outlined on the call so far has been investing in lots of interesting niche opportunities rather than large scale acquisitions suggesting a lot of balance sheet flexibility should be remaining as you go through the year and I was just curious if you had any comment on that and whether I was missing anything there? Thank you.","David Zaslav","On the sports piece, we look at everything. We are -- we own with Liberty Formula E. We own the League in our partnership with Jay Monahan, the PGA. We have global rights everywhere in the world except for here. I deal with Tiger his rights that include the U.S. everywhere in the world. Cycling we just bought a business that's fully global and so we are opportunistic in terms of looking at sport as a passionate brand where we can super serve people's interest across the board.","But we're also -- there's a lot of stuff that we look at that we don't think fits our metric of being able to provide long-term growth. In most of those cases, we bought sports assets that have very long tail with --in the case of the PGA, it's through the end of 2030; in the case of the Olympics, we did it for a decade; in the case of cycling, we own the business. And so most of our rights on Eurosport, we paid low-single-digit increases and we got -- we would try to get six year deals. We don't like doing business with these three-year type Soccer deals which we're getting out of. And so I think we're going to be opportunistic, we're in the sports business; we may even be the leader in sports around the world when you aggregate all of our IP. So we look at everything and we will look at everything but we'll look at it in terms of what kind of a sustainable asset it is and JB.","JB Perrette","Yes, I think that's right. And on the Asia piece of it, the reality is the a) the Golf deal has put us in business in Asia in a major way. The two of the biggest markets in Asia for Golf are Japan and Korea. And so that has significantly changed the game. We announced obviously last quarter our expansion of our relationship with J:COM, our distributor there, who is now also our Golf partner, and in Korea we will be coming up next and then China as well. So we are in sports business through Golf which I think is a meaningful step for us.","And then the other thing that in terms of more things in Asia and sports, a lot of it becomes much more localized which I think is a bit of a challenge. The rights that are big in terms of Australian Rules Football, Rugby in Australia versus what works in Malaysia versus what works in Japan is oftentimes very different and so it's hard to get the same scalable play.","But as David said, we'll look at everything. But I think for now we're going to take the Golf product for a real ride here and we think that has great opportunity.","David Zaslav","And look, I think that we're building a platform that's unique. If we're successful with Golf and cycling, we're also doing MotorTrend and in addition to that, we have global rights to Natural History and these other brands. But if we're able to build, we're the only company that's doing business in over 48 languages and as we build this platform for which we've brought Peter over to build and we've brought over one of the most senior technology leaders from Amazon. If we build that and we're in multiple languages like we did the Olympics in 22 languages, we're going to do the PGA in over 40 languages. And so there's very few companies that can promote from the ground and convert into multiple languages and have a platform that's above the globe. And once that's done, we think the opportunity could be significant. There's a lot of sports with federations are going to want to try and reach above the globe but they're not going to have the scale to build the platform. Our platform is built. They're not going to have the scale to market in every country. We have multiple channels in every country and we have an online digital business in every country. And so we think once we build and we can prove out these ecosystems that we could be a platform that people come to where instead of paying for those rights that we can represent those rights and get a split.","Gunnar Wiedenfels","Okay. And then, Doug, on your buyback question, look I mean the way I look at this is I'm really proud of how the leverage number has come down. I mean again almost a full turn in only 10 months. The free cash flow number 2018 has been better than what we planned honestly and also what we guided to and this isn't going to stop. As I said, we're planning to get back into our target range of 3 to 3.5 times within the first half of this year.","That's great flexibility, as David said, that's very important in this environment and we see a lot of potential of underlying additional growth in our cash generation. And all those investments that we're discussing about again those are investments that we can fund out of our free cash flow growth. I think that's a very unique situation. I don't think we need any sort of major transactions but you've seen some of the partnerships we've been able to strike over the past 12 months. Those are great divestments into our future growth and doesn't change our financial profile. We've got a very strong balance sheet.","Regarding buybacks we're going to come back. Our first priority has always been to de-lever down to 3 to 3.5 times, when we get there, we'll come back and update you on what the capital allocation is going to look like. But again priorities are de-lever first, invest in the business, and then return capital through buybacks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Drew Borst with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Drew Borst","Hi, thanks for taking the questions. I want to ask about the costs in particular the cost of revenues which in the fourth quarter took a noticeable step down relative to what you had been doing in the prior couple of quarters. So I guess as we look into 2019, should we think about what we saw in the fourth quarter as kind of the run rate for 2019?","Gunnar Wiedenfels","Thank you. So well I mean the step down in Q4 actually has two components. Number one, as JB laid out earlier, we've really taken a new strategic look at the programming grid literally across the entire global footprint. And we've made more use of the SNI content replacing acquisition content so that obviously has a pretty significant impact on our cost of revenues.","In the fourth quarter, there was another U.S. component that was supported on a year-over-year basis because in the prior year fourth quarter Scripps had taken some significant write-downs on content. So that has been helping us on a year-over-year basis as well. So it's probably a little more pronounced but as we've said before this content synergy is one of the key elements of the merger thesis. We will continue to see improvements over the year. Keep in mind that the full first quarter is essentially excluding any synergy impact in 2018. So we'll see a step up in 2019 and we'll continue to be very, very focused on costs as I said. And as a consequence of that, we will see further margin expansion in 2019.","Drew Borst","Okay. Thank you for that. And if I could one more on the digital investments that you mentioned, I just want to make sure I understand it. I think you mentioned $200 million to $300 million for 2019; is that an incremental step-up beyond what you had been doing in 2018 or is that kind of an absolute number. So I think the last time you gave us an update you guys talked about sort of spending about $50 million per quarter, so call $400 million per annum maybe you could just describe that in a little more detail?","Gunnar Wiedenfels","Yes. So the $50 million per quarter indeed has been the run rate at which we have been investing since we closed the transaction and so that would add up to $200 million a year, I guided to $200 million to $300 million because again keep in mind there is some -- there will be some flexibility. This is not one fixed number. This is not a business where we put together a plan in the fall for the next year and then this is exactly what we're executing. We're -- we've got a lot of very, very promising initiatives on the table. We've seen some first successes and we need to have the flexibility to double down on anything that's really getting traction.","And on the other hand, we will not make certain investments. If we -- if the first feedback from the market doesn't look like we're on to something. That's why it's a bit of a broader range but the way to look at this is as previously that $50 million run rate now is a full-year range of $200 million to $300 million in incremental P&L investments.","Drew Borst","Okay, thanks. And just real quickly restructuring charges I assume are we done now like in 2019, we won't see any more restructuring charges related to the deal?","Gunnar Wiedenfels","We're mostly done. As you can see, we are expecting to pay out some of the 2018 accruals in 2019. That's why we still have about $150 million cash out in the numbers that I just discussed. And we probably will see round about $50 million of additional P&L charges. But I would expect that that's it though.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Todd Juenger with Bernstein. Your line is open.","Todd Juenger","Hi, thanks. I appreciate it. It's a bit somewhat mundane today, if you don't mind but I hope I can ask. So Gunnar just I was hoping on the -- thank you for the 2019 guidance on the affiliate fees consistent with what we've heard before. Just wondering if you could help us understand, if there's any licensing components in there, as spot licensing sort of what an underlying organic rate for pure affiliate fees versus other stuff. And the other question for either you Gunnar or David, just thinking about the portfolio of networks in the States and your comments about the fully distributed networks and their distribution stability and then some of the digital tier networks losing distribution faster. What are --as you think about -- is that -- what is the right number of networks for you guys at some point does it make some sense to think -- to rethink some of the digital networks and either reexpress them somehow in a different way than a linear full network. What is the trade-off there, what's the incremental margin from those? Any thoughts on that would be great. Thank you.","Gunnar Wiedenfels","So indeed the guidance that we're giving for Q4 for affiliate revenues both for Q1 and for the full-year is very clean number if you wanted to call it that. As a matter of fact, Q1 is actually slightly tougher comp versus last year regarding some Ava components that were in there last year. But it's a very clean numbers driven by our pricing step-ups in new and existing deals and the additional carriage on virtual MVPDs and the expected growth on those platforms.","David Zaslav","On the channels, we've said before that about 85% of our fees goes against our top six or eight channels. We have focused on the idea that if we grow our core eight that we really have an opportunity. We've been very successful now in getting our channels carried on the smaller bundles which exist everywhere in the world and not here. And we're hoping that this year as those grow, we think we'll benefit more than anybody else from those. We also have Chip and Joanna who we are hard at work and have been down to Waco. We think that is a very unique opportunity to enhance the channel and grow a channel.","We --no other media company in the last couple of years has been able to go on offense and grow as many channels in fact most media companies haven't launched any new channels and we have ID that didn't exist. The number one cable channel for women in total day, we have the Oprah Winfrey Network number one for African\/American women. We launched Velocity and we now have an opportunity with Chip and Jo to take a network that is doing okay and take it to the next level.","But to your point, we also have a real vision for that in terms of going direct-to-consumer. And when you think about this idea of watch and do, there's probably no better example of watch and do than Chip and Jo. They created a great show called Fixer Upper and then they created a whole multibillion dollar business called Magnolia based on the quality of their ability to design and build product.","And so there was an example where they built an entire ecosystem and we're reconnecting with them and excited about what we can do together. They're in Magnolia on their own. But we think there's a lot that we could do together to build our channel. So net-net, I think over time you'll see some fewer channels but we think we have at least one or two more that we could build strong here in the U.S. with big characters and big personalities that people love and want to spend time with.","And that's what we're about. That's why we did the Tiger deal, that's why we did PGA. That's why we're in cycling, that's why we were with Oprah and Chip and Jo. In the end, we have great brands but we have great characters that people love. And that's what this business is about spending time with people that you love and finding out what their stories are and what their challenges are and the things that they love.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Vijay Jayant with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Vijay Jayant","Thanks. One for Gunnar, one for David. Gunnar, you talked about the underlying trends in subscribers that are holding to what it was in 2018. Obviously, there's been a lot of movements in the virtual MVPD space. You guys are one of the few companies on AT&T Watch. Can you sort of talk about how you sort of think the virtual MVPD contribution as part of that would broadly be in 2019 given your position. And for you, David, obviously you've talked about the passion of your verticals in Food and Home and new ecosystem and you gave a full bunch of numbers about the TAM, you have also talked about in the past the strategic partnerships possibly with the Samsung and Amazon. Can you just sort of give us some insight on if those do happen, what is the monetization model there?","David Zaslav","Great. Let me just start with this whole idea of 5G is a part of the whole narrative of who's going to own the home. And the -- within the home, the place that people spend the most time is the kitchen. And as I've said, the question that everybody -- everybody in the world asks every day is what's for dinner, what's for breakfast? And the challenge of who's going to own the kitchen. I think we have a real opportunity. We have the greatest chefs, we're the leader in recipes, we're the leader in short form, we're the leader in brand and credibility, we're the leader in content. And so we're very active in aggressively pushing that ourselves and having discussions with everybody that's in the kitchen about how do we own the kitchen whether it's distributors with 5G or whether it's players that want to meet with voice activation in the kitchen or with screens in the kitchen. And so we're actively driving that in addition we think that do-it-yourself and home design is another area where we have a lot of experts, a lot of content, and a lot to offer.","And so we're pushing that hard and that's not in our current plan but we do think there's a real opportunity there because we have something that is real functional and something that could provide real value to customers aside from just watching entertaining content.","Gunnar Wiedenfels","And on your distribution question, I don't want to break out individual contributions of individual deals but as we've said before that mid-single-digit guidance for the U.S. affiliate growth is a combination obviously of the inclusion Hulu and Sling and then price increases on our traditional deals.","And I mean in terms of the mix in the market, we've always been a firm believer in the value of our content and I think our ability to hold those deals last year underpin that quality. And we've also been a firm believer in value of smaller bundles in the market. And I think we're seeing some confirmation there as well.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Nathanson with Nathanson. Your line is open.","Michael Nathanson","Thanks. I just have one simple one for you guys, on International M&A with David and JB, for a couple of years back, we've seen cable networks start buying broadcast assets abroad. You did at SBS; Viacom did it Telefe Channel 5. I wonder going forward do you think that's still a winning strategy to go into local markets buy broadcast assets and do you see any -- with your financials, any benefit of basically being both a broadcaster and a cable network based on your ability to drive returns higher growth or anything. So I love to hear about that.","David Zaslav","I would say directionally, we're much more focused on owning IP. We have a lot of free-to-air channels, we have cable channels. We're really focused on taking that IP to other platforms and maximizing the efficiency and free cash flow of our existing platforms. We look at everything but it wouldn't be the first place we go. And the overall idea of owning -- of owning broadcast assets really would make more sense in a market like Poland where it's protected because it's a unique language, they have a very strong portfolio and this strong GDP growth. But in general not at the top of the list of what Bruce Campbell, JB, and I are looking at right now.","JB Perrette","And ultimately markets that have other ancillary as we talk about in terms of Poland, their market position and strength and ability to pivot to digital and ability to provide us other benefits in terms of lower cost of production and back office services as well. There are other benefits to it than purely the broadcast assets. So that asset actually is fairly unique.","And we're seeing even in the Nordics, as you mentioned, as we're finally getting more traction and pushing more aggressively into the OTT space, a stronger growth on the OTT, so pivoting those businesses to be much more OTT and direct-to-consumer driven, leveraging the local content and IP as David said that they have in their portfolio is really the focus for us.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Steven Cahall with Royal Bank of Canada. Your line is open.","Steven Cahall","Yes, thanks. Maybe first, Gunnar, I was hoping I could at least try to pin you down a little bit on adjusted OIBDA growth for 2019. Just some of the trends that we've been seeing is a big pickup in U.S. OIBDA growth driven by I think the cost synergy. And then you've got a pretty easy comp in International in Q1 just because of the Olympics headwind that you had in 2018. So can you just help us maybe put in context should we see an acceleration in adjusted OIBDA growth in 2019 versus 2018 or anything there would be helpful. And then maybe to just pick up a little bit on Vijay's question you basically said your distribution guidance now accounts for not a lot of change in the subscriber trends that we've seen. Q4 was maybe a little bit out of trend in terms of both linear and vMVPD. So if we see a little more of Q4, is that kind of baked into your guidance. Do you have some buffer there? How should we just think about what we're seeing on the sub decline and what's baked into that guidance? Thank you.","Gunnar Wiedenfels","All right. Well, so I mean let me start with your OIBDA question. And I'm not going to give a specific guidance but a couple of building blocks, you are 100% right that Q1 is obviously going to be an easy comp because we have that special impact of the Olympics which for the quarter had a negative -- profit impact last year. We also look at the last quarter before closing the transaction, so there's literally zero synergy impact in the Q1 2018 number. So we should be seeing a nice step-up.","And for the full-year, let me reiterate what I said before. I do plan for an margin expansion on top of the margin expansion that we have seen in 2018. So that's number one. On an underlying basis clearly there is going to be significant AOIBDA growth but then, as I said before, we will continue to make P&L investments. And let me just clarify that based on what we have in the plan for 2019 that would add up with the investment that we've made last year to about $300 million maybe $400 million negative impact from those direct-to-consumer investments. Again keep in mind we're building out a portfolio for -- to drive our future growth.","And as I said before after that -- after that investment I am targeting margin expansion for the full-year and clearly AOIBDA growth to some extent that's going to obviously depend on the timing of the magnitude of the investments we're making.","On your sub number question. You're right; Q4 is obviously a very healthy step-up because for the first time we're looking at the additional subscribers from Hulu and Sling. Again, I mean, the -- I don't want to give any specific guidance what we have baked into the financial guidance of mid-single-digits for 2019 is assuming stable underlying trends as we see them today with no acceleration or deceleration.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question is from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Ben Swinburne","Thank you. Good morning, David. I think you closed the Scripps deal a few months before last year's upfront. I'm just curious now that you've had the acquisition done for a bit. How are you thinking, if at all about changing how you approach this year's upfront. Obviously a huge audience share particularly with female viewers. Any changes we should expect in terms of how do you go to -- how you go to market and package inventory, how Discovery GO might factor in any details there would be interesting. And then for Gunnar, I apologize, I know you've talked about it a couple of times but maybe I'm the only one who's confused. Could you just go back to the 2018 digital spend and then the 2019 just so we clearly understand what is incremental versus the total, has there's been a bunch of numbers thrown around that are different. Thank you.","David Zaslav","Thanks, Ben. We had a good upfront and we had a good calendar. We've said that we think this quarter will look a lot like four. And candidly, I'm on my way down to Florida now. I think that we probably left some points on the table for this quarter and we could do better. I'm not satisfied at all. We spent a lot of the last two weeks looking at our efficiency rate, looking at our sell-out rate how we sell and GO.","The reason I say that is TLC was the number one network in America for women in January, number one. And we have ID very strong, we have Food strong, HD strong, and Discovery improved and GO was accelerating. And so I think that our creative team is doing a good job. And I think we have a very strong ad sales team but we've got to get more focused, the way that we drilled down and had real work streams on cost. We now have developed co-work streams on our revenue on sales and I -- I'm not satisfied at all. I think we should have had -- we should have a bigger number this quarter. We're going to continue to drive to it but if we do our job right, I think you're going to see better numbers in the quarters ahead.","Gunnar Wiedenfels","Okay. Let me clarify the digital investments commentary. So as we've said previously, we have been investing on a run rate of about $50 million in the quarter since closing the transaction that is against our 2017 baseline. We're going to slightly accelerate that pace and I'm targeting $200 million to $300 million additional investments in 2019 and as obviously some of those investments started to pay off, the total dollar amount in absolute terms in our 2019 profits and cash flow will be between $300 million and $400 million total impact from investments on the digital side.","Operator","Thank you.

As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Andrew Slabin, Executive Vice President, Global Investor Strategy. Mr. Slabin you may begin.","Andrew Slabin","Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us for Discovery's first quarter 2019 earnings call. Joining me today are David Zaslav, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Gunnar Wiedenfels, our Chief Financial Officer; and JB Perrette, President and CEO Discovery Networks International.","You should have received our earnings release, but if not, feel free to access it on our website at www.corporate.discovery.com. On today's call, we will begin with some opening comments from David and Gunnar, and then we will open up the call up for questions with David, Gunnar and JB.","Before we start, I would like to remind you that comments today regarding the company's future business plans, prospects and financial performance, are forward-looking statements that we make pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are made based on management's current knowledge and assumptions about future events, and may involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations.","In providing projections and other forward-looking statements, the company disclaims any intent or obligation to update them. For additional information on important factors that could affect these expectations, please see our Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2018, and our subsequent filings made with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.","And with that, I will turn the call over to David.","David Zaslav","Good morning, everyone. And welcome to our first quarter 2019 earnings call. We\u2019ve started the year with very strong operating momentum across the company, with positive financial results domestically and internationally, as we continue to create, develop and acquire the highest quality content with broad consumer appeal in every market around the globe.","I have made it clear. Discovery\u2019s strategy is different than any other media company. While everyone else is focused on big and expensive movies and scripted series, very crowded space, we have a different approach. We have brand people identify with and love. We\u2019re gaining distribution in all key bundles in the United States and around the world and enjoy a unique global footprint.","We have a proven management team, best in the business. We have a de-levered balance sheet and capital structure that gives us great optionality, I believe we are the leading global IT company. And we have important, entertaining and useful content in categories that are loved, trusted and of safe. Our content has the broadest multi-generational consumer appeal and high proceed value among advertisers and distributors. We are powering people\u2019s passions and genres that are central to their lives, and we have niche channels, quality brands and talent that people around the world trust, respect and believe in. And we are now starting to see the results.","From revenue to adjusted OIBDA, to free cash flow and of course, virtually all operating metrics, we are seeing healthy momentum. We are benefiting from continued merger synergies from the Scripps acquisition; from strong consumer demand that is driving our adoption in multiple distribution packages and bundles in the U.S. and around the world; and progress we are making in building out our suite of direct-to-consumer products with best-in-class IP in passionate entertainment and sports categories.","Discovery looks different. Our strategy is different and different is really starting to pay-off. And what a difference a year makes. This time last year, we have just closed on Scripps. And there were questions about the future of our businesses. Our lack of inclusion on virtual MVPDs, our ability to leverage home and food around the world and the amount of debt we had taken on to close the transaction. A year later, while we don\u2019t have all the answers yet, we have made remarkable progress. We have proven the durability of our core business, the value of our beloved brands in an OTT world and the opportunities made possible by our global reach consumers in nearly every country.","We have reduced our net leverage to below 3.5 times, and we are seeing a healthy acceleration of our core businesses across the board. We are excited about our growing portfolio of new global direct-to-consumer services and the management and engineering leadership we are recruiting to Discovery continue driving the strategic advantage we have in our own technology infrastructure. Domestically, we've continued to make great headways toward near ubiquitous distributions of our key channels across the virtual MVPD landscape, most recently with an agreement to launch nine of our brands on YouTube TV. We now have the most widely distributed cable network group across all key OTT players.","Our team has done a terrific job advancing our position. We are thrilled to partner with YouTube, Hulu and Sling, ensuring that we are well positioned to grow as consumers migrate to new bundles and platforms. Additionally, our U.S. rating trends across many of our key networks continue to improve. In the first quarter, we have the top four cable networks on commercial delivery for women in prime from 8 to 12, with ID, HGTV, food and TLC, pretty remarkable and a first ever in the cable industry, helping us to drive domestic advertising at the top end of our peer group for a couple of quarters in a row now.","I\u2019m pleased with our performance and the trend lines we are seeing with our domestic advertising business. But as I said last quarter, I think we have some real productivity headroom and we have a number of initiatives in place that I think will advance our returns. The team has really dug-in and we continue to innovate through our targeted cost platform marketing capabilities. With 4% domestic advertising growth in Q1 and once again feel great heading into this year\u2019s upfront, our second as a combined company, and we\u2019ll keep you posted on our progress.","We are also pleased with our progress and outlook for our international segment as the Scripps content is beginning to gain real traction in key international markets. Building upon the heavy lift we detailed last quarter with regards to layering in Scripps content across our networks, we have also been hard at work launching new pay, free-to-air and digital branded services. We recently announced we will be launching HGTV as a new free-to-air channel in the large advertising market of Germany. We also have secured healthy subscriber commitments throughout Latin America, the new HGTV channel launches across all key countries, while at the same time, nearly doubling the distribution presence for the existing food network channel across the Latin America region.","We continue to assess demands in the market and what opportunities exist to fill those holes, both in the linear and digital ecosystems. We are gaining real traction in securing some truly premium IP programming and talent across a number of initiatives. We believe our ten year global relationship with the BBC will be a key milestone for Discovery. As we created a stronger and more efficient UK business that soon to be rationalized UK TV portfolio; secured some of the highest quality blue chip series for our linear networks, such as SERENGETI, which maybe one of the most visually stunning pieces of programming I have ever seen coming to Discovery Channel this summer; produced by Simon Fuller and Perfect Planet, which was produced by Alastair Fothergill who did Planet Earth for us, which is coming in the fourth quarter; and with the new co-development team, at the BBC hard at work creating a pipeline of high profile landmark factual programming over the next several years that we will harvest for Discovery in the U.S. and around the world.","The most strategic element of our BBC deal was securing all of the SVOD rights for the BBC Library of factual landmark series and specials, a marvel like library for the factual of natural history genre. Our ambition is to take that library along with the best of the Discovery Channel, Animal Planet and Science Library, together with additional exclusive original content, brands and IP in the genres of natural history, science, adventure, exploration, history, space and technology, packages together into the definitive natural history and factual streaming platform in the world and take that above the globe.","It is the perfect moment to create this type of service, high in both entertainment value and global impact and relevancy. Blue Planet 2, for example, not only ranks among the all time top shows ever aired in the UK, it ignited a major global call through action, after an episode on the effects of plastics in the oceans led to a ban on plastics in the UK and now adopted across the EU.","It is this wonderful content and IP we can aggregate around the globe. As we continue to build out our portfolio of brands and world class content, we are thrilled to be back in business with Chip and Joanna Gaines. They are true singular talents with great creative vision and an authentic ability to connect with audiences. Millions of fans follow their story-telling through the home, the kitchen, the garden and they incorporate strong family values more seamlessly than anyone else. We really want to win together and we are excited to help showcase to gain passion and talent. Discovery will launch a multi-platform global media business around their Magnolia brand, by rebranding DIY next summer, alongside an authenticated go-app. And we\u2019ll then launch a streaming OTT platform service in 2021.","GOLFTV is another example of where we have strengthened our content offerings with the best talent, most valuable IT and strong global programming. We\u2019re off to a terrific start. The support of Golf is on fire globally and our timing couldn\u2019t be better. Though still early and in beta, we are seeing real signs of traction in users on GOLFTV, both paid and registered, especially in countries with local heroes, like Japan and Italy and in markets where we\u2019ve taken advantage of Discovery\u2019s local presence.","And in Asia-Pac specifically, we are seeing a nice boost across our portfolio given the local must see nature of Golf. In places like Japan where we have put together a great partnership with J:COM. It\u2019s a great template as we look over the next three to four years for when we will have the full global rights, the PGA tour outside of the U.S. and be able to offer PGA, Tiger, as well as all of our Golf products everywhere in the world in a full on ecosystem. We\u2019ve successfully streamed over 35 tournaments across five tours with healthy user engagement, particularly for our Tiger content, Tiger\u2019s Masters' victory was clearly one of the all time great sports moments, and it\u2019s for a welcome and powerful story line to Golf. We\u2019ll be rolling out the exclusive Tiger Woods and structural master class series later this year. And this is just the tip of the ice berg. I couldn\u2019t be more excited about where this partnership with Tiger can take the platform over the coming years.","Finally, the global cycling network, which brings together entertainment, functional content, deep engagement and mobile commerce into an immersive lean-forward experience, a great example of what mean when we say view and do and this is beginning to gain some meaningful traction. Every month, millions of cycling enthusiasts, not only visit the site they immerse themselves in the site and with its community. They\u2019re checking out the Maintenance Monday repair videos, seeking help with how-to and ask CCM through the platform and other social media. And they're training along with our pros on famous terrain videos. And they're coming to our live forms, races and training camps, it\u2019s a full 360 degree cycling experience.","We believe all these initiatives make Discovery a stronger company, being consumer obsessed is our mission and guide everything we do. And last year, we reached outside of our industry to bring in a top executive from Amazon, Peter Faricy, who ran marketplace to further guide us in this mission. Peter has already added enormous depth to our senior team, has opened up a new office in Bellevue, Washington with a growing product development and engineering team with great depths of differentiated experience and perspective and building leading digital consumer products. Our office in Bellevue, Washington will be a new hub, driving platform excellence to support our strong global IT. While our eyes are very much focus on the path that Peter and team will lead us on in the future, what supporting at pivot is an underlying core business that is still very healthy and growing. And there is perhaps no strong reflection of our underlying operating momentum than having achieved the upper end of our leverage target nearly one year ahead of schedule.","At under 3.5 times net debt to adjusted OIBDA down from over 4.7 times a year ago, we are finally in the position of being more opportunistic with our excess capital. As you\u2019ve seen, our board has authorized $1 billion share buyback, which with our strong free cash flow, which over the trailing 12 months basis was over $2.8 billion or about $3.1 billion excluding cash severance, secures our ability to continue to reinvest in our growth strategy, as well as further reduce our financial leverage to align our capital structure to accommodate both the cyclicality of our industry and requisite investment demands.","We are in a great-great position. And this optionality affords us the flexibility to intelligently and judiciously allocate our large and growing free cash flow to further enhance our existing portfolio. We enjoyed a uniquely deep level of engagement with our viewers and consumers, and they look to us to nurture their passions. It\u2019s a completely different strategy that most of our peers are pursuing we are playing in a different sandbox than anybody else. We have a different look, feel and appeal than almost all other network groups.","And as I said earlier, we really see the different is paying off. And against the backdrop of continued disruption across our industry, I feel confident with our strategic response, the balancing industry headwinds by refocusing and repositioning our portfolio of recognized global brands into immersive passion driven experiences. We are supported by a strong and de-levered balance sheet throwing off a lot of cash, providing us with great runway and real optionality. And we are confident in our ability to continue to execute during this time of disruption and great opportunity.","Thank you. And I\u2019ll turn the call over to Gunnar to take you through the financials and the outlook.","Gunnar Wiedenfels","Thank you, David. And thank you everyone for joining us today. I'm extremely pleased with our very strong first quarter operational and financial performance, and with the strategic progress we have already made in 2019 as we continue to transform Discovery. And I remain very optimistic about our company\u2019s outlook.","Let me first share some financial highlights from our first quarter, which caps-off the first full 12 month periods in closing the Scripps transaction. My commentary will again focus on our pro-forma results and we\u2019ll be in constant currency terms for the international and total company commentary unless otherwise stated. Please refer to our earnings release filed earlier this morning for all of the details, custom drivers of our first quarter financial results.","In the first quarter, Discovery achieved or exceeded all of our revenue guidance metrics with 4% U.S. advertising growth, 4% U.S. affiliates growth, negative 6% international ad growth due to the tough comp for the Olympics last year, which growth excellent -- accelerating slightly towards the fourth quarter and finally, 1% international affiliates growth.","We also grew total company OIBDA by 21% due to continued strong synergy realization and due to the Olympics comp internationally. Total operating costs were down significantly with declines in both cost of revenues and SG&A in the U.S. and abroad. This led to 43% total company margins, up 900 basis points year-over-year with U.S. margins expanding 700 basis points and international margins up 1,000 basis points.","Additionally, we reported $498 million of free cash flow in the first quarter of 2019, which brings our trailing 12 months free cash flow to roughly $2.8 billion for the first full 12 months as a combined entity, which is after more than $300 million of cash severance and restructuring cost, as well as higher digital spending in the same 12 month period. Our laser focus on cash flow and cost management has allowed us to end the quarter with the net leverage ratio below 3.5 times inside the top 10 of our target net leverage range well ahead of our original stated goal to be back within our target range of 3 to 3.5 times by early 2020.","Against the backdrop of this strong improvement in our financial putting, I\u2019m pleased to announce that our board has authorized share repurchases of up to $1 billion. We continue to feel very comfortable with the company\u2019s outstanding ability to generate cash. This authorization increases our optionality and gives us yet another lever to create shareholder value. Regarding capital allocation, our priorities stay the same. Number one, optimize leverage. And within our 3 times to 3.5 times net leverage range, we currently plan to prudently de-lever towards the lower end of this range. Number two, at the same time, we will continue to evaluate value enhancing investments back into our business and strategic M&A. And number three, returning excess capital to shareholders.","Before I move on to our forward guidance, I would like to comment on our recently announced UK TV transaction that results our 50-50 joint venture, and the formation of our new SVOD partnership with the BBC. As part of the JV resolution, Discovery will take full ownership of three lifestyle channels in the UK. The transaction is currently expected to close by early June with the following financial impact. Discovery will consolidate the three networks post close. So we will no longer be including the small amount of earnings from our 50% share of UK TV earnings in our equity earnings line. And we will receive cash payment of around $240 million in total over the next two years.","All of the three lifestyle networks revenues currently come from advertising, and will be consolidated post closing, and we\u2019ll provide a couple of hundred basis points uplift to international advertising growth assuming the full year of contribution. From an adjusted OIBDA perspective, we expected 2019 impact will be minimal but ultimately, we would expect more meaningful impact over the next six to 12 months as we integrate the network and capture additional synergies. We are also extremely excited about the new 10 year SVOD agreement, which will showcase iconic BBC Natural History content. And I will note that any costs associated with this had already been baked into our digital investment guidance that we gave during last quarter\u2019s earnings call.","And now let me share some forward looking commentary. First, I will start with our four key revenue drivers on a pro forma constant currency basis for the second quarter 2019. First, for U.S. advertising, growth is expected to be similar range as the first quarter, up 3% to 5%, driven by similar dynamics, continued pricing increases and the continued monetization of our digital and Golf product, partially offset by lower linear ratings on a year-over-year basis. Our ratings performance for the quarter as always will be a key determinant of where we will fall within our guidance range.","We would note we expect continued outperformance versus the market, helped by our recently announced YouTube deal in addition to the uplift from now having additional mix on Sling and Hulu. Second, U.S. affiliate growth is expected to accelerate versus the 4% in the first quarter, primarily given additional virtual MVPD carriage. As noted, the first quarter should see the lowest growth of the year. Though, as always, this assumes no major change in subscriber content. And while there are lot of moving pieces, both headwinds and tailwinds, we still feel very comfortable with our full year guidance of U.S. affiliate revenue growth in the mid single-digit range, especially given our recently announced YouTube deal, and now best in industry representation across domestic, traditional and virtual distribution platforms.","Third, international advertising growth is expected to be up mid-single-digits. We expect sequential improvement across all regions and further continued monetization of our digital products. Note this also assumes around one month of contributions from the three new UK TV networks. And finally, international affiliate growth is expected to be up low single-digits. Underlying trends remain relatively consistent with last quarter across our markets, and we also continue to drive monetization of our digital subscription products.","Turning to total company guidance. As noted, we still expect another year of healthy free cash flow goals in 2019, and we will continue to be laser focused on driving free cash flow growth even after making the investments necessary to build out our direct-to-consumer portfolio. Our view on the puts and takes behind our ultimate full year free cash flow results have not changed versus what we laid out last quarter. As we had outlined, growth will be based on adjusted OIBDA growth and lower cash restructuring expenses, partially offset by increasing investments in direct-to-consumer, higher CapEx and higher cash taxes.","I continue to expect an incremental $200 million to $300 million of direct-to-consumer investments over last year. And the negative impact on the full year 2019 adjusted OIBDA is still expected to total around $300 million to $400 million on an absolute basis. Please note that a vast majority of the spending is still to come, and will be back half loaded given the timing of roll out. Given this cadence, as well as the fact that we have now completed the full four quarters of initial cost synergy capture post the Scripps deal closing, full year margin expansion will primarily be driven by the upside from the first quarter versus additional year-over-year margin expansion in the second to fourth quarter.","Moving on to taxes. Please note there is a one-time accounting driven and non-cash structural impact that will significantly lower our book tax rate in the second quarter and in the full year 2019 that I want to draw your attention to. As part of the integration of Scripps, we are in the process of streamlining and rationalizing our global legal entity footprint. The most significant accounting implication from these internal restructuring will be a one-time $450 million to $500 million tax benefits in the second quarter as we are recording in deferred tax assets, which will make our second quarter book tax rate a negative one.","With that, we now expect our 2019 full year book tax rate to be in the low to mid single-digit range. Again, this is a non-cash benefit and there is no impact to our cash taxes or to our free cash flow. Before I close, let me quantify the expected foreign exchange impact on our 2019 results. At current spot rates, FX is now expected to negatively impact revenue by approximately $180 million to $190 million and adjusted OIBDA by $70 million to $80 million versus our 2018 reported results.","In closing, I remain extremely satisfied with the financial footing of Discovery and optimistic about our outlook. Our strong balance sheet and financial performance will allow us to accelerate the transformation of our business, drive free cash flow and ultimately generate significant long term value for our shareholders.","Thank you again for your time this morning. And now David, JB and I will be happy to answer any questions you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question or comment comes from the line of Alexia Quadrani from JPMorgan. Your line is open. ","Alexia Quadrani","I guess my question for David maybe is on the international side. It looks like you guys are making a big push internationally. You guys had such great success out of senior legacy Discovery business and now you\u2019re making a bigger effort on the Scripps side as well. Can you talk about how big the opportunity is for the Scripps assets? And when we might begin to see some of these newer initiatives you\u2019ve talked about earlier in the call that is it results? And then I have a follow up after that.","David Zaslav","Historically, we\u2019ve gotten most of our growth by gaining market share. And when you take a look at our international results now and as we look going forward, we think we\u2019ve really turned the corner around our accelerating. Our market share is growing broadly. And now on the advertising side, we see mid single, which is a real acceleration. In the affiliate, we see low single. So we\u2019re back to being a growth business again. The Scripps content is starting to work in some markets really quite well. But I'm going to pass it on to JB as we talk about how we think we\u2019ve made this turn. It's been a lot of hard work. And JB is on the ground running that business.","JB Perrette","Alexia, as David said, when you look back a couple of years ago, it\u2019s a great -- the growth rates of C&I. The international business is really driven by share growth, as David mentioned. And after a while having utilized a lot of the Discovery legacy content to its max that began to slow in part. And then what\u2019s happened over the last six to nine months as we\u2019ve gotten Scripps library ingesting and started to take more advantage of it, we\u2019ve really seen content driving better audience share performance in a major way. And that\u2019s really begun to turn the story around for us. And so as an example, in the UK, we had our best quarter ever from a share perspective.","Unfortunately, the markets obviously from an advertising perspective are little bit of a mix bag. So the advertising market in the UK was still down mid single, but our shares were way up. And so while we\u2019re not expecting a major turnaround in the marketplaces in some of the more challenged international markets, we'll make this feel particularly optimistic and positive about what\u2019s coming is that our shares are growing, the Scripps content is working better and better and helping. And we\u2019re also launching new networks. As for example, the launch of our free-to-air HGTV in June in Germany, the biggest end market in Europe, the doubling of our footprint from a penetration and the subscriber perspective on food in Latin America with the launch of HG in Latin America.","And so we\u2019re seeing the theory that we have talked to you about a year ago of utilizing the Scripps content working better across Europe and Latin America, in particular. And then as David referenced in his comments, in Asia, which has been a trouble spot for us candidly, we\u2019re up content had been performing less well and maybe little less well of it.","The great news is things like Golf has completely change the game for us. Where we weren\u2019t having conversations or people weren\u2019t engaging with us in the same way, now all the sudden with Golf, we\u2019re having conversations -- active conversations in markets like Korea, which have been underrepresented by Discovery, historically, about launching new channels and new opportunities in that business, a lot of it drilling by that, the Golf product, as well as the coming BBC product, which also has enormous appeal, particularly in Asia, which has an overemphasis, obviously, on education and smart programming.","Alexia Quadrani","And just a quick follow up on your comments on the use of cash, thanks for that. I just wanted to clarify. Can we assume that you can balance being active in the new buyback authorization was for prioritizing investments in business and M&A?","JB Perrette","I think that\u2019s a good summary, Alexia. As I said, we\u2019ll for the time being, also focus on bringing down leverage a little further to the lower end around 3 times rather than 3.5 times given where we are in the transformation. And other than that, our priorities haven\u2019t change. We\u2019ll continue to make all necessary investments in the business, drive future growth. We\u2019ve talked about all the organic investments that we\u2019re making and we\u2019ll continue to balance that. I'm very, very happy with where we are. Keep in mind, it\u2019s been 12 months, we\u2019re down 1.2 turns on leverage, $2.8 billion cash flow generated in the first 12 months after closing the deal. So I think we\u2019re in pretty good shape and have a very, very strong balance sheet at this point.","David Zaslav","This team is really impressive. The Scripps transaction has really worked. We\u2019re now free and clear of that. We have some more synergies coming through. But we were at about $1.4 billion of free cash flow, they were at $700 million. And I\u2019ve been saying for a long time that this transaction, if we could really execute; makes us a free cash flow machine and set out a target of $3 billion that we would more than double our free cash flow; and the execution to be in a position now we\u2019re a year ahead; we\u2019re below 3.5 times levered, $2.8 billion in cash, $300 million on transactional related costs; and being in a position now to have full flexibility of investing in our business of looking at acquisitions.","There's loads of companies now that we have the flexibility to be looking at strategic assets that are sustained -- that provide sustainable growth, buyback and de-levering a little bit more. We\u2019re going to be generating lot cash. And so we don\u2019t see anything major. We love where we are right now; we don\u2019t see any major M&A; but the idea that we have all this cash and we have an ability to use it strategically in an unencumbered way around the world. It's just an exciting moment for the company.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Brett Harris from Gabelli Research. Your line is open.","Brett Harris","I wanted to ask about the competitive landscape for non-fiction programming. It seems that non-fiction would fit naturally into an SVOD service but most major services are really focused on general entertainment and you characterized that as crowded in your opening remarks. Hulu made an announcement about some cooking theme shows. Any sense that SVOD services are moving into non-fiction? And I guess the broader question is how should we think about your advantages as incumbent non-fiction provider?","David Zaslav","When we look at IP, we've worked very hard over the last five years to transition into really compelling IP, and what will people pay for before they\u2019ll pay for dinner is our mantra. And that\u2019s been a guide post for us. The excitement for us is that Netflix getting to 250 million subscribers it is they created a road and a path where people get used to paying for content. And 50% of what people watch on TV is scripted series and scripted movies, and they\u2019re going to be able to gorge on that stuff.","There's loads of opportunities from $7 to $15, and it will go up over the next couple of year. And people will probably have one, two, three of those and they're going to love them. And maybe they\u2019ll churn between them based on who has the great series or who has some great movies. But that\u2019s 50% of what people love. There's another 50% of what people love and that\u2019s what we have. And there is really nobody in our space. Yes, Hulu is doing a few food shows and Netflix does some stuff, a little bit of natural history. But all of the BBC content is coming off of Netflix. And the ability to create series and new big event programming Planet Earth 3 is coming to us globally everywhere in the world and the next Blue Planet is coming to us, our ability to use all of that IP.","But in addition to that, those brands stand for big entertainment that\u2019s why people buy them. They want to see the great series Mrs. Maisel, Game of Thrones that\u2019s the business that they\u2019re in. We\u2019re really much more in two different businesses, we think Natural History can be massive, every family, everyone in the world should want to have this. And as I\u2019ve said, it will be less than $5 but it\u2019s a product more and more is about learning, being smarter, being aware of the planet, this young generation cares deeply about what\u2019s going on. And we\u2019re going to be documenting the planet. And we\u2019ve gotten huge feedback from lots of players that say they want to be part of this in front of the screen and behind the screen.","But then when you look at some of these sub-groups, whether its food or home, we have a tremendous amount of talent that are affiliated with this, and we think we could build real ecosystem. We\u2019re doing with cycling now. We\u2019re doing it with Golf. We think we can do it with food. We think we can do it with home design. And so it\u2019s great that they want to play a little bit in this space, but we feel very comfortable. We also know how hard this is. Loads of people are playing in the crime space. Loads of people have tried to play in the food space. We are self-strided at the TLC.","After several years, we ended up with one show. And Ken Lowe and the Scripps team they know who are the best producers in food and they know -- they work through all the best talent. They have a fine team online that they build up. And so in each of these areas, we have a real expert team working with great producers, many of those producers only work with us because our production in each of these areas are so strong.","So I think it\u2019s a wide open field for us. And ultimately, we should be able to build significant businesses around all of them. I think the biggest one being Natural History and Factual as a global initiative that has really driven by family values. And then whether it\u2019s the games, or opera, or food, or home, or crime, I think we have a real, real opportunity. And it\u2019s exciting, because everybody is chasing that same ball and we like the best of the field and we\u2019re seeing it with Golf and cycling already that it\u2019s meaningful.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Jessica Reif Ehrlich from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Jessica Reif Ehrlich","I have a couple. I\u2019ve lost count of how many direct-to-consumer services you\u2019re launching over the next two to three years. But interested in how you're approaching the revenue model. Can you just talk about how you -- subscription versus advertising in both U.S. and non-U.S. markets. Next or second question is on advertising. You guys have done some of your upfront presentations. How different do you think the selling approach of process will be this year, and can you talk about expectations for the market? And then finally -- sorry for all the questions but finally, you're in a unique position as you mentioned earlier. You're on every virtual MVPD and of course on every distributor, traditional distributor given the loss of subs in the traditional universe. What are you seeing on the other side? Just overall what do you see the market going for Pay TV subs in the bundle?","David Zaslav","One, I\u2019ll just start up with the bundle point. I mean the smaller bundles I\u2019ve been saying this for a while. We\u2019ve seen it outside the U.S. where if we can get -- if we\u2019re 8 or 40, we tend to do much better on the advertising side. Our brands get stronger. Our content is more aggressively viewed. And if we can capture 85% of our revenue to 90% or between 80% and 90%, we end up with a net positive and in some markets very positive. So it\u2019s very hard for us to project where things are going. But we are on older bundles now and we\u2019re moving for all of them. And the skinnier bundles in many cases maybe much better for us, because people will spend more time with our channels and it's a younger audience, and we'll be able to monetize them with better CPMs.","And so the good news about us right now is whatever happens, Malone said to me four years ago, the key to long term sustainable growth in a business that has challenge is beyond every platform. If you\u2019re on every platform, you\u2019ve a real game. And if you can be on every platform and have top services on those platforms then you could find significant growth even in the business that\u2019s in long term secular decline. And so that\u2019s the position we\u2019re in. We\u2019ve worked hard to get there. And on those new platforms, we also get a lot more data and analytics that give us the superior CPM. So it\u2019s really additive in that regard.","On the pay and free, we\u2019re already in the market with MotorTrend, and it\u2019s doing very nicely for us. We have the Eurosport Player, which we\u2019ve been at for 4.5 years. We\u2019ve learned a ton. And it\u2019s what led us to Golf and cycling as individual sports and not just being sport but being transactional and providing a full social ecosystem, as well as information everyday that people can get up and read like you read a daily magazine, we've talked about Natural History. But in each of these, there are really two pieces. There\u2019s the funnel where you can go and see stuff for free. So eventually, Golf might be -- a 100 million people are playing around the free funnel and then that -- yes, we can promote in every country everywhere in the world what we have, funnel number one, which almost nobody else has in every language.","Funnel number two, is the free funnel where you don\u2019t have to give us your credit card and you can just hang around and see some tiger, or see some of the golf, or play around with the cycling. And here people talk about what else is going on behind the pay wall. And we can monetize that from an advertising perspective, which we are. And then that leads into the pay and so each one will be the triple funnel. And I think one of the reasons why we got the PGA and one of the reasons why we\u2019re so confident about our ability to aggregate and scale in this business is we have these affinity groups globally in every language spending time with us. And we did this with Eurosport. We built the Eurosport Player for free I mean the Eurosport.com and 30 million to 40 million people across Europe come to us with a number one place people come for free.","And then we get to say to those people. Well, here\u2019s what we have behind the wall. And so there is no other company that can do -- look affinity groups in every country [Technical Difficulty] and then you get the credit card. And so we're at the very beginning of this. But we think this could be quite compelling. And then we\u2019ll deploy our capital as we see it. If Golf looks like it\u2019s accelerating in a meaningful way, we\u2019ll accelerate in a lot of harder. Cycling is a very big global business and opportunity for us, and spend more money there. On Natural History, we\u2019re ready to spend the significant amount of money, because we think that everyone that has Netflix or has Disney\u2019s product or HBO, what family shouldn\u2019t also have this companion product. And their kids can see the greatest science and the greatest Natural History and learn all about space. And so that\u2019s the funnel environment that we have. Gunnar?","Gunnar Wiedenfels","I agree with all of that. And then, Jessica, I think one additional point is what you may see is that this evolves overtime. And we have that very unique position of having that global footprint in place with linear networks across the world. So for some of the deals that may be sublicensing elements in individual territory that\u2019s the benefit that we have combining the total rights that we\u2019re buying of our long deal terms, and owning our content and having their international complete global footprint in place. So from the perspective of our ability to exploit this content and contain the risks with some of the investments, I think it's the best position we could be in.","Jessica Reif Ehrlich","And advertising?","David Zaslav","Jessica, so you've got all the questions. You\u2019re covering the gamut. The upfront looks -- we finished our five city tour. We hit the upfront as strong, or stronger than we\u2019ve ever been. We have top, the top four channels for women, we were the number two TV company in America in terms of reach, now we\u2019re number three but only by a smidgen with Disney pulling in Fox, they were a little bit bigger than us. But we are one of the three big scale players in the marketplace. And so the upfront feels pretty good, scatter is strong that\u2019s accelerated. We feel stronger probably in all ways that it has. We don\u2019t know how long it\u2019s going to last. But the last few weeks have been very, very good, some of it maybe that there is a lot of underperformance at the broadcast and some other and some other places in the cable industry.","And so there is not a lot of inventory out there, a lot of people have a lot of make goods. So I don\u2019t know whether we\u2019ve been getting a unique advantage or whether that\u2019s the current situation. But we also have, as we go into the upfront, we think we have a unique advantage, which is if not a good it\u2019s a baddy for us, but it\u2019s a goody if we can turn it. And that\u2019s that you look at two guys in front of us their prime CPM is $55 plus. CBS's prime CPM is $55 plus, and so is Fox. So we got the four players around us in price at $55 plus. We\u2019re aggregating audience in prime across our networks. That\u2019s bigger than all of them and we\u2019re at a fraction of that. And so that\u2019s always been the case with cable.","But now I went myself and that with every major agency and I\u2019ve been meeting with clients, saying, broadcast is terrific and you can do the $55 and the $55 plus, whatever the increase is and the upfront whether it\u2019s seven, eight, nine, 10. But you could also move some money that where you\u2019re paying $56, $58. And we can give you a spot where you reach everybody at once across all of our -- across our top six networks. And we can deliver 20% of women in America. We can deliver 20% of prices. And we could do unique things with our advertising. And so how quickly that will happen remains to be seen. I\u2019ve been all over it. I\u2019ve been all over the city. We\u2019re starting to get some traction.","And the final thing is that the broadcast inventory, in general, as you go between the rating decline that they're on together with the fact that there\u2019s more sports and broadcast. Broadcast prime is shrinking. So that\u2019s a real goodie for us. And then we have DGO, which our authenticated apps where we\u2019re doing better than anyone else, because we have passionate affinity groups that have downloaded those apps and are spending -- a young generation spending a lot of time. So I think we\u2019re probably as well positioned as anybody right now, and we\u2019ll just have to see how the market plays out.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Drew Borst from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Drew Borst","I just want to go back to the U.S. affiliate guidance, the mid single-digit you guys have. And I was wondering if you could comment on what assumption is baked into that number with respect to subscribers. And you probably should pull out the virtuals right, because you guys have picked up a whole bunch of incremental carriers. But I'm just trying to understand how you guys are thinking about the traditional facility based sub counts for the balance of the year?","Gunnar Wiedenfels","So again as I said earlier in the call, we\u2019re very confident in our mid single-digit guidance. In terms of assumptions, this guidance is always a probabilized estimate of all the various individual drivers that we\u2019re seeing. Clearly, YouTube is helpful, you\u2019ve pointed out, for MVPDs, in general. That\u2019s clearly a helper, a helper this year. You\u2019ve also seen -- and mentioned the traditional subscriber numbers that come out in the first quarter and that\u2019s certainly working against the trend to some extent. But again, we have a lot of confidence. Our core networks in the first quarter have been down one. Obviously, continue to see larger numbers for the digital smaller networks. You can expect a little more support starting from the second quarter with YouTube rolling in, and that\u2019s -- and we\u2019ll take it from there.","Drew Borst","And then another question on free cash flow. You guys mentioned that when you look at the trailing 12 months, you\u2019ve done $3.1 billion excluding restructuring charges to a reported really impressive number. The street is sitting at -- for this year, sitting at about $2.8 billion, $2.9 billion of free cash. Can you help bridge that? I know the quarter was quite strong. But can you help bridge that. The street is basically not forecasting much growth. Are we being too conservative on the outlook for free cash flow in \u201919?","Gunnar Wiedenfels","Drew, two months ago when we reported fourth quarter earnings, I said that we feel very strong about our ability to generate cash flow. I'm very happy with the first quarter numbers. A couple of points as to remember that I pointed out when we reported 2018; we are going to see some more CapEx; and we are going to make those additional incremental investments in digital; and for what it's worth, we haven\u2019t -- the incremental investment hasn\u2019t been huge in the first quarter and there\u2019s a lot coming through towards the second half of the year. I continue to see a total absolute dollar amount of $300 million to $400 million of negative impact on our P&L when we ramp up all the initiatives that we\u2019re working on.","But that being said, I also see a lot of opportunity. The restructuring expenses, as you know, are going to come down very significantly. So I feel very good about it. But as I said, when we have spoke last time, we want to maintain the flexibility, because some of those investments are going to be on different timing and there is some variability. So I don\u2019t want to put out any specific guidance at this point. But I\u2019m very, very confident.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Doug Mitchelson from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Doug Mitchelson","David, on the Natural History and factual OTT service, which hopefully you'll give a name to relatively soon, so we know what to call it. But any thoughts on -- at what point is there a trade-off between building these OTT services and your affiliate negotiations with Pay TV providers, even its for the digital channels that are already have bigger declines. And Gunnar, as these services get launched, is there any rule of thumb that we can use in terms of how many subs were breakeven? David talked about the TAM being fairly large for the Natural History and factual OTT services. Is there any target that we all should keep in mind as we think about the growth prospects for those businesses?","David Zaslav","Well, first, Discovery is a primarily series-driven product. It tends to be the number one channel for men around the world. And as you look at our audience, the majority of our audience right now is coming from series. We\u2019re going to put in some -- we think we can get some meaningful upside on Discovery around the world and really super-nourish the brand by bringing in some more meaningful blue-chip content with this BBC relationship, as well as some other blue-chip that we\u2019ve had in the work. And so we\u2019ll put that on Discovery. And whether that blend is 90-10 or 80-20, it's mostly series with big tentpole content.","The Natural History and Factual product is a little bit different, or a lot different. We have the entire BBC library. We have all of their titles. We have our blue-chip library. We have all of our space content, all of our stem content. We have the best largest science library in the world. And you have 5G coming into the home and the ability to see we did a series, When We Left Earth, which is an eight part series where we took all of NASA family library converted into HD, put together a comprehensive great documentary. If you like that you're then going to get recommended into another 150 different things series that you can learn more about space or podcasts. And so we see this as both entertainment and life learning.","And it\u2019s going to be really driven by -- and there is a whole piece of this, there is a generation that has reached out to us about helping with this idea of understanding what\u2019s going on around the planet. And this stuff, if you look at Blue Planet 2 in the UK, it was the number one series, number one series for the entire year in the UK. And this content we think is very different, because it\u2019s -- people aren\u2019t going to be watching it and as a streaming product like they\u2019re watching Gold Rush, and Deadliest Catch and Naked and Afraid -- Myth Busters. We have great, great content on Discovery and we think we can grow it. But we think this is a different an ecosystem, which will be nourished by families that want to see some of the greatest IP out there in terms of blue-chip, but then really do a real deep dig down on history and science and space, and create a place that people can hang out like you would with Netflix, very different than Discovery, or Animal Planet, or Science. But we will promote. We have those affinity groups that are spending time with us. And we\u2019ll be pushing back and forth. But one is not a replacement for the other.","Gunnar Wiedenfels","And Doug, on your breakeven question, I totally understand the desire to get some support and modeling that\u2019s out. Obviously, we have our business cases. We have discussion scenarios. We\u2019re looking at all those questions from a management perspective. But we\u2019re also realistic enough to know that we don\u2019t have all the answers yet. And some of those assumptions are going to change as we go through the roll out, either because we\u2019re learning or because we're actively making different decisions. If we find something is really starting to work really well, we might want to get behind it with additional content investments, additional platform, whatever. So I don\u2019t want to have any expectation out there. So this is the number of sums we need to get to. That\u2019s why we\u2019re absolutely not at the point to communicate anything there yet.","Operationally, that\u2019s the second point. With Peter Faricy\u2019s arrival, I mean he and the team are very focused on operating metrics on the consumer experience on engagement et cetera, much more at this point than financial metrics and taking about revenue growth and breakeven. We are seeing some first growth contributions, but that\u2019s absolutely not a priority right now, and from a purely financial perspective that is perfectly fine for me.","The way I look at this is we have a portfolio of very, very attractive initiatives. I think we have all the ingredients in terms of the content, the global footprint and most importantly, a very, very incredible team for these offerings. And I look at the overall financial envelop. I\u2019ve given you guidance on how much of P&L loss we\u2019re absorbing in 2019. And I look at this and I see that the number is small enough to be absolutely acceptable from a risk perspective and large enough to allow some of those initiatives to really start having a positive impact a year, two years, three years from now.","David Zaslav","The key is, before we were looking to drive scale. So big mistake. First, create a great product that people love. Create a Golf product that people say. And if you love Golf you don\u2019t have this you crazy, this is the greatest thing. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re finding now with cycling. We have an ecosystem where people are telling each other, you\u2019re not on this. This has everything you want around cycling. Then we can apply an aggressive subscriber acquisition program. But JB has been is on the ground around the world looking at the interest in Golf and balancing that with Peter on, as well as cycling and now the BBCPs, which JB was a driver on with me, because we both think it could be quite big.","JB Perrette","The exciting thing we see from global opportunity is that these opportunities right now are still very early and very and we\u2019re at the beginning. But it\u2019s a playbook than we know extremely well. And if you think the Discovery playbook of taking products out of the U.S. and taking around the world, which has been our marquee for 30 plus years. The GC and cycling example, we have an English language product today that is working incredibly well where we are then doing exactly the same playbook we had where we\u2019re launching in German, in Spanish, in Japanese and taking that same product around the world, utilization the discovery infrastructure to help localize it. And so I think the growth opportunity when you do that across the different opportunities, we\u2019re just beginning to tap into what we think is going to be a very clean and robust global scaling of those products as we take them around the world.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Rich Greenfield from BTIG. Your line is open.","Rich Greenfield","David, you called out digital as a tailwind to ad spend. I think you mentioned some of the watch stuff earlier on in the conversation. But just -- and I look at the billion dollars of advertising that you\u2019re now reporting on a quarterly basis. How big is digital? Can you give us some sense of like how significant it now is that it\u2019s actually providing a tailwind to the whole number? And what are the key pieces within the digital that are really driving growth? And then just a quick follow up for Gunnar. When you look at the Q4 results, you talked about your core networks were flat. This quarter, you said they were down 1%, which surprised me just because you brought on Hulu late in the quarter, and you had Sling. Is that just a fall out being the traditional players, or is that actually some of the MVPDs losing subs as they raise pricing in Q1. I\u2019m just trying to square the sequential deceleration that you saw there. Thanks.","Gunnar Wiedenfels","Rich, I think, number one, you\u2019ve seen the numbers that have come out on the traditional side. One technical point is when we talk about sub losses on a quarter-by-quarter basis we\u2019re looking at the end of the quarter numbers. So you\u2019ve essentially had Sling and Hulu in the number for the fourth quarter. So you wouldn\u2019t expect any incrementals outside of the growth of those platforms. And then clearly, YouTube has not come on yet, I think that\u2019s the explanation for that discrepancy that you\u2019re seeing there. And then regarding the size of the digital businesses, again, we don\u2019t carve that out, it\u2019s part of our reporting segments and its, I should say, that it's still very small in terms of absolute numbers. But given the contributions to growth and probably the most important point here is TV everywhere, our Discovery Golf platform, which we\u2019re selling on an integrated basis with the linear traditional advertising. That\u2019s been contributing to our growth quite nicely for now a year and a half, almost two year now. So, on a relative basis meaningful, I mean, JB, I think you also saw some very nice contributions in the Nordic from that\u2026","JB Perrette","Rich, you've heard us. We\u2019ve talked for a while about some of the challenges we face in the Nordics and Northern Europe, which have been some of the markets that have been most aggressively globally hit by sub level declines over the last several years. And we\u2019ve been obviously finding that hard with pricing growth on ad sales and trying to get our digital products in better shape. And exciting thing for us in that market is we\u2019ve finally seen over the last few months a return to growth, largely driven by digital, both ad and the fact that through Peter's work and his team's work, we\u2019ve gotten our product in much better shape from two star rating to a four plus. And we\u2019re starting to seeing subscriber growth really turnaround and turn that region back into a growth story, which has been -- and that\u2019s the case for the last couple of years.","David Zaslav","So two points there, JB just said it, but we\u2019re bringing in Peter. And he brings in a team, including one of the top technology people from Amazon. And they created an attack team of -- look we got to make the products we have better. And so we de-play have a lot of great content, because we\u2019re the major scale player in Northern Europe with free-to-air and cable. Improve the products from a two star product to better than a four star product. And we started to see acceleration with time people spend on it and with the number of people -- and the number of people that are recommending it. So I think our products are getting better, it\u2019s a process.","The other piece on digital is its just encouraging from a consumption standpoint. As I talk to my peers, they don\u2019t have Discovery. They don\u2019t have these DGO products. You can\u2019t have DGO for general entertainment service. You have DGO, because people love food and they will authenticate and take a few minutes as cumbersome to get it on their device so they can watch all their favorite food shows, or all their favorite Discovery shows, their favorite home shows and it\u2019s scaling in a meaningful way. We get a lot of data. They're spending more time on it.","And the most important thing is that the average age is in the 20s. So what it says about us is yes the people that are watching HG, and food, and some of those channels are older. But by putting ourselves -- by having this authenticated platform, we\u2019re seeing that a lot of young people really, really like our content and the advertisers are seeing it. So it\u2019s a real plus for us.","Operator","Thank you. We have time for one more question. Our final question for the Q&A session comes from the line of Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Ben Swinburne","Two questions, David. One, you talked earlier about productivity headroom and ad sales. I think you mentioned in U.S. and that is your largest revenue stream. I wonder if you could talk about what you guys are doing there. You mentioned some initiatives to try to drive that even higher in any timeline we should be expecting. And secondly, you mentioned that now that you've de-levered, you\u2019ve got a lot of flexibility to look at strategic assets to help sustain growth. And I know you don\u2019t want to be specific nor should you be. But when you think about Discovery, historically, international was the driver of growth pre-Scripps and Scripps has made you a much more U.S. based business from an EBITDA perspective. I'm just wondering if adding international depth and breadth is something that you think would be interesting for the company longer-term.","David Zaslav","We look at everything, but we really like the company we have right now. There\u2019s nobody -- the only thing in our way is ourselves and satisfying the consumer with something they love. And if we do that this global IP company is going to take off, because we now have a traditional business. You look at this quarter coming, we were mid single. When you look at our affiliate domestic and international and our ad domestic and international, four major metrics, four are up mid and one is up low. We got a growth business. And on top of that, we got a lot of great content. And so we feel good about that.","The piece about advertising, we\u2019re just way under -- we\u2019re just punching the way under our way here. We're the third biggest TV company in America. And unlike tuning in for a series, people are watching HG and food like they watch Fox News or more, the length of view is higher. The largest length of view in America and the number one channel for women is ID we have. And with networks like Food and MotorTrend and HGTV, their advertisers that absolutely need to be on. So we are outperforming the marketplace with a great, great sales team.","And so on traditional metrics, I believe we will continue to outperform significantly in a meaningful way, because we got a great team. We also have -- the second piece that we have is I think we got a great trend. Broadcast is going to decline much faster than one us. I think the board interest cable channels are going to decline faster, and people still loving spending time with us. But even though we have a great team and we\u2019re outperforming the market, I look at it and say, we have real meaningful opportunity. The average CPM for broadcast is 55% and for us it\u2019s $20, or less. And we can provide you -- so you can go to a broadcast and buy a 0.8 for $55 or $58 and you come to us and buy a four for 40% of that.","So how do we capture that? We put together a program that I\u2019m going hand-to-hand with Steinlauf and fighting for, to say, hey, I don\u2019t do this as the favor to us, this is great for your clients. And here is the program that we can provide for you. And we\u2019re messaging that. We\u2019ve already gotten some money at much higher rates, but we wanted to be more scale. In addition, we\u2019re not sold out anywhere close on all of our digital products. And we have a team that's great at selling linear and we\u2019ve been doing -- we\u2019re in on weekend working on this DGO product, its hell of a product. And we\u2019re not sold out enough on it. It's great and people that are on it, they\u2019re doing very well. So how do we drive sell out on digital.","And then how we do -- we have to use the fact that we have these incredible audiences and the ability to put a spot across five or six of our networks and get a four, five or six. And so, I expect we will outperform the market in the traditional sense. Then we\u2019re going to get better at doing our digital products and selling them out, which will give us some incremental growth. We have DGO, which nobody else has, which is accelerating. And then we have this value proposition of, hey, if 8% or 9% more on $55 for a 0.8 on a broadcast network, if that\u2019s making you crazy, we got a great home for you here. And we got a great deal and we think we could deliver for you.","So I think you're going to -- we see that acceleration already, but we\u2019re going to the upfront really in a collaborative way this time. We\u2019re already in deep conversation with a lot of people about these initiatives. And they\u2019re listening, because the decline of broadcast is a big concern and we could be the answer to that, which could be a win-win.","Gunnar Wiedenfels","Ben, can I add one point to the question about the locale of our investments. Given that a lot of the stuff that we\u2019re working on into direct-to-consumer space, what\u2019s driving those $300 million, $400 million investment today as discussed, all of those are global in nature. So by that very nature, those are going to be internationally focused, because the U.S. is one market in 220 territories. So you should assume that a lot of that is going to hit the D&I P&L, both regarding initial start-up losses but also in the case of success obviously regarding growth rates. And then I also just want to be clear that when we talk about those investments, we feel very strong about what we have. There is no need for making any further investments. There is nothing coming through the pipeline that\u2019s visible right now. So just want to clarify that as well.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

Zaslav","Thanks, Craig. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Discovery delivered another strong quarter during Q2 as the strategic initiatives we have been driving across the company, over the last several years, are generating significant financial growth. At the same time, we are continuing to capitalize on the growth of Pay TV globally and a macro ad environment that remains healthy throughout the vast majority of the 200-plus countries we operate in.","Discovery's consistent focus on investing in our global platform, building new brands and leveraging additional growth opportunities resulted in another quarter of double-digit OIBDA growth, excluding the impact of foreign currency. The steps we have taken to broaden our global content offerings are helping to drive international expansion, while domestically, we are generating significant returns from sustained programming initiatives and audience growth, especially across our developing networks.","Andy will discuss the specifics behind our financial performance in a moment, but before he does, let me take a few moments to highlight some of the initiatives contributing to our sustained operational and financial success.","You've heard us talk in the past about Discovery's long-term strategy of investing in bigger, stronger brands and the highest quality nonfiction content. We've increased our success base content costs by about 7% or 8% annually over the last 4 or 5 years. This sustained investment in programming is delivering market share growth worldwide, and given the continued strength in the advertising market across the globe, we have been able to generate 13% total company organic growth in the second quarter.","The biggest contributor to this growth in percentage terms is our International business, which generated local ad growth of 22% this quarter. This business is a true differentiator for Discovery, and the significant advertising growth highlights the opportunity we have to exploit our global infrastructure by launching new channels, growing our audience and building stronger brands.","There is no better example than the global rollout of TLC, which most of you are familiar with by now. Over the last 2 years, we established TLC as another global flagship. TLC is the #1 most distributed women's brand in the world. It is now in over 150 countries, is making money and we are only in the early stages of its growth cycle. But that's just one example. We have a robust portfolio of 26 brands, 137 networks and 170 feeds around the world, and we are strategically investing in content to further capitalize on our market opportunities to drive audience and advertising growth.","Our latest initiative is to drive the ID brand in markets where we think it will have broad appeal. Earlier this month, we rebranded Liv, our fully distributed entertainment channel, in 38 countries throughout Latin America, to ID. After seeing the success of crime and investigation genre across our existing platforms. We are already seeing a larger audience on that channel. ID is now in over 100 countries globally, and we think this can be another growth driver for our International business over the next several years.","One of the unique aspects of our international growth story is that it is broad-based, with continued growth this quarter from every one of our regions. I know there is some concern in the marketplace regarding ad trends in Western Europe. And while the market is certainly slowing, we have been able to continue to deliver ad growth, led by our free-to-air revenues, most notably Real Time, which is now the #8 network in all of Italy, DMAX in Italy, Quest in the U.K., and our most recent launch, Discovery MAX, in Spain. Free-to-air revenues were up nearly 80% this quarter and have helped maintain a strong growth trajectory in markets where Pay TV growth is slowing, and we have deep content libraries. These channels are still growing market share significantly.","While free-to-air networks are not our primary focus, they are an excellent example of our ability to identify market opportunities and exploit them with our globally relevant content.","The other component to our continued 20%-plus ad growth is the further penetration of Pay TV worldwide. The subscriber base across our international business expanded over 15% versus a year ago, and the combination of a more robust program offering, a larger addressable audience, together is driving substantial viewership growth and, in turn, advertising gains.","While advertising is growing more on a percentage basis, the largest absolute driver of International growth continues to be affiliate revenue gains. And much like our ad revenue growth, our distribution revenue is broad-based, with double-digit increases across nearly every region, most notably Latin America and Central and Eastern Europe.","Latin America is our fastest-growing region, with subscribers growing over 20% versus a year ago, led by Brazil, which added almost 1 million subscribers in Q2 alone. We fully expect further Pay TV growth moving forward, given the low penetration worldwide. And with boots on the ground across the globe, as these platforms continue to proliferate, we are ideally situated to maximize the opportunity they provide.","While the domestic cable business is obviously more mature than the international market, we continue to deliver strong growth as we take market share and leverage the power of our existing and burgeoning brands.","Over the past few years, we have taken deliberate steps to broaden our portfolio and take advantage of the shelf space our 14 domestic networks provide. Since 2006, we have launched 7 new networks off of our existing distribution: ID, Destination America, Velocity, OWN, Fit & Health, Discovery Familia and The Hub.","There's been lots of talk about cable channel ratings declines, but when you look to the success of our new networks, it is apparent that if you invest wisely and deliver high-quality content that is unique and engaging, you can grow your audience and deliver increasing value to advertising and affiliate partners. There is no better example of this than Investigation Discovery, which continued its meteoric growth this quarter, expanding its audience by 41% in total day among its key women 25 to 54 demo. Despite only 30% awareness among Pay TV subscribers, ID, in less than 4 years, has become a top 10 network for women 25 to 54, and in daytime, a top 6 network for women, with only fully distributed networks ahead of it. It is one of the longest lengths of tune in all of television, remains the fastest-growing network in all of cable in 2012 and has clearly become another flagship network for us.","Equally as important, we are translating that viewership gains into substantial advertising growth. And while we have made considerable progress in increasing the pricing and volume on this network, we still have a significant ways to go to achieve parity, with the ratings ID is delivering today.","ID was not alone in ratings success this past quarter. Animal Planet and Science each grew adult 25 to 54 audience over 15%. And our most recent launch, Destination America, was up nearly 50% in June, following its May 28 launch.","We also saw continued ratings momentum at our joint ventures. The Hub delivered 54% growth this past quarter in total day among kids 2 to 11, its best quarter ever. And OWN built upon the 14% growth it delivered in the first quarter, with over 20% growth among women 25 to 54 in Q2 and well over 50% growth thus far in Q3. With all 8 of its charter advertising partners re-upping during upfront negotiations and ratings performance exceeding our recent expectations, OWN remains on track to reach profitability in the back half of next year.","The growth of our emerging networks offset some choppiness during the second quarter at Discovery and TLC and resulted in our total audience expanding 5% against the industry as a whole, which was down. The diverse ratings success we are delivering, along with our brand strength, set us up nicely heading into our recently completed upfront negotiations. We garnered mid to high single-digit price increases while achieving the highest dollar volume in our history.","Given the success of many of our younger networks, a priority for Joe Abruzzese's sales team during the upfront process was to generate higher volumes across these channels, and we certainly achieved that with advertisers recognizing the value and opportunity brands such as ID and Destination America provide.","Looking ahead, the third quarter does present some hurdles with the Olympics and limited premiere hours on Discovery until after Shark Week in August. But with a strong upfront under our belts, a scatter market that remains relatively healthy and a balanced portfolio of existing and emerging brands, we remain confident that we can deliver sustained advertising growth moving forward.","Building new brands and strengthening our content pipeline remain strategic priorities going forward. We will continue to incrementally invest in growth opportunities to ensure we are putting our capital to work appropriately and generating suitable returns on our investments. Capitalizing on our core growth opportunities is still our first strategic priority. But given our sustained financial momentum, the free cash flow we are generating, the strength of our balance sheet and the growth portfolio of our company, we have increased the pace of our buyback activity to further build shareholder value.","We have returned $1.9 billion in capital to our shareholders under our buyback program, and we will continue to do so aggressively if it is the best use of our balance sheet.","Discovery's had a great first half of 2012, delivering strong financial results while investing in our brands and platforms around the world. With strategic initiatives delivering additional returns, a relatively healthy global operating environment and a strong balance sheet, we are poised to deliver sustained operating momentum and continued financial growth for the rest of the year.","Now let me turn the call over to Andy.","Andrew C. Warren","Thanks, David, and good morning, everyone. Discovery continued to deliver solid operating results during the second quarter, this further execution of strategic initiatives and a favorable operating environment enabled the company to deliver double-digit advertising and affiliate revenue growth, excluding the impact of foreign currency.","Total company revenue in the second quarter increased 7% on a reported basis, while organic revenue growth was up over 10%, excluding the negative impact of currency movements, led by 19% international growth and complemented by 6% domestic growth.","Total operating expenses in the quarter were up 6% compared to the prior year, primarily due to increased programming costs from higher content amortization and $6 million of impairment charges related to the ID rebrand in Latin America, as well as some increased personnel costs primarily at our International sales operations. Excluding the impairment charge and the impact of foreign exchange, the increase in operating expenses for the company was still 6% versus the second quarter a year ago.","Discovery's continued ability to generate revenue growth in excess of expenses translated into a 6% increase in adjusted OIBDA during the second quarter. Excluding the unfavorable currency impact, adjusted OIBDA was 11% versus 2Q '11.","Net income increased 15%, to $293 million, reflecting the strong operating performance in the current year, as well as lower taxes, driven primarily from the benefit associated from reorganizing certain tax entities.","Free cash flow decreased to $138 million in the second quarter, as the increased operating performance was more than offset by higher content investment due to the timing of production spending and increased tax payments. For the last 12 months, however, free cash flow increased 5%, reflecting the improved operating performance and lower stock compensation payments, partially offset by higher tax payments and working capital. Our full year expectation for free cash flow in 2012 for over $1 billion remains unchanged.","Turning now to the operating units. The U.S. Networks continued to perform well during the second quarter, with revenues up 6%, led by 7% advertising growth and an 8% increase in distribution of revenue. Excluding nonrecurring revenue items in 2011, domestic ad revenues grew 9%, led by the strong performance of Investigation Discovery, as well as the sustained favorable pricing and demand environment. Current quarter ad growth was reduced by a couple of percentage points due to softer ratings performance of certain networks.","Though current ad market conditions continued to be attractive, with limited premiere hours on Discovery until Shark Week in August and given current ratings performance, we anticipate mid single-digit ad growth in the third quarter of this year, with, of course, possible variability from ratings performance.","Domestic operating expenses were up 4% from the prior year, with the majority of the increase due to expected higher content amortization, partially offset by lower SG&A expense, which included decline in marketing spend.","On a reported basis, domestic adjusted OIBDA increased 8%, and excluding the impact of the prior year nonrecurring revenue items, adjusted OIBDA was up 10% over last year.","Turning to the International operations. The momentum across our global platform continues, with revenues on a reported basis expanding 10%, led by 11% ad and 8% affiliate growth. Excluding the impact of exchange rates, total International revenues grew 19%, with advertising revenue increasing 22% and distribution revenue up 15%.","On the advertising front, our company delivered particular strength in Western Europe from the free-to-air initiatives David mentioned. In Latin America, the growth was led by Brazil and Mexico. And in our Asia Pacific region, India and Australia were the primary growth drivers. The affiliate revenue growth, which included 3 percentage points of benefit from lower launch support amortization, was driven by continued strong subscriber additions worldwide, with the Discovery Channel, our most widely distributed network, expanding subscribers 8% internationally versus a year ago. Latin America, led by sustained progress in Brazil and Mexico, and Central and Eastern Europe, with further development in areas such as Russia and Poland, continue to be the main drivers of International subscriber growth.","Operating costs internationally were up 13%, primarily driven by higher content amortization, as well as by increased personnel and infrastructure costs due to additional investment in growth initiatives and the build-out of our global platform to support our long-term growth expectations.","The quarter also included $6 million of impairment costs related to the rebranding of Liv in Latin America to ID. Excluding this impairment and the impact of foreign currency, operating cost growth was still 13%.","International segment delivered 16% adjusted OIBDA growth, excluding currency impact, as international team continued to generate strong revenue increases while thoughtfully investing in key growth initiatives.","Turning to our full year forecast. We are leaving our revenue, adjusted OIBDA and net income expectations unchanged despite the negative impact from foreign currency since we guided last quarter. It is very important to note that given the positive impact of the Netflix agreement in the third quarter of last year and negative currency expectations this year, we expect overall adjusted OIBDA growth to be in the low single digits for the third quarter of this year, with the resumption to strong double-digit adjusted OIBDA growth in the fourth quarter. Excluding the Netflix impact a year ago and foreign currency headwinds, OIBDA growth in third quarter would be well in excess of 10%.","Turning to our balance sheet. We further strengthened our financial position this quarter by completing the issuances of a 10-year $500 million debt offering with a 3.3% interest rate and a 30-year $500 million offering with a 4.95% rate. These issuances provided us additional financial flexibility while lowering our average cost to capital, lengthening of our average maturity profile and taking us to a more appropriate leverage level.","With a strong balance sheet that includes $1.7 billion in cash and with sustained financial and operating performance, we continue to return capital to shareholders for the execution of our share repurchase program. Our first priority remains investing in our core businesses to drive sustained, long-term growth, be it through investment in the existing networks and platforms or through exploring external initiatives. Given we have not yet found sufficient investment opportunities with attractive financial returns, we've accelerated utilizing the cash on balance sheet, as well as the cash generated from operations to repurchase shares.","Discovery repurchased over $400 million of stock in the second quarter, including $389 million of Class C shares. Given the liquidity constraints around repurchasing the Class C shares, we also repurchased $15 million of Class A shares during the quarter. We still prefer buying the more economic security, but given SEC volume limitations, as well as the long-term attractiveness of our securities, we will continue to repurchase both classes of stock.","We have bought back over $800 million under our share repurchase program thus far in 2012. Since November of 2010, we repurchased over 60 million shares in total, reducing our outstanding share count by over 15%.","Thanks again for your time this morning, and now David and I will be happy to answer any questions you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Mr. Doug Mitchelson from Deutsche Bank.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","David, I've got a question on International ad growth and a question on domestic ad growth. 22% international local currency ad growth is really something, with incremental growth coming now from TLC and free-to-air. When does that growth start to tail off? And will the newer growth initiatives, like international ID launches, be enough to sustain mid or high teens ad growth? That's international.","David M. Zaslav","Okay. Doug, we're seeing some real strength across the board, and it really has to do with the fact that we've been investing long-term. We now have Discovery, Animal Planet, Science, TLC, and we're getting ID built around the world. And our market share is growing, which is very helpful. At the same time, the Pay TV universe is growing. It grew 15% in the quarter. So part of it is that we're very well-positioned in -- around the world, with an average of 6 channels in 210 countries. But when you look at some of the real growth markets, Brazil, Mexico, Russia, India, Turkey, in a lot of those markets, we have 10 or 11 channels with a number of successful networks. And so part of it is a market share story, Doug, part of it is that Pay TV itself is growing. And finally, we're getting a little bit better at selling advertising. Some of these channels are new. So ID is just getting in there, TLC, so we're becoming more known in the marketplace. But also, when you see that our costs and some of the -- and International has grown a little bit, it's because early on, we went to a number of agencies in markets to sell advertising. And now that we're getting bigger, we're going into a number of those countries with our own boots on the ground. And so we've saved some money, and we think we can get some upside and we'll continue to get upside. A market like that is Russia, Brazil, those are markets where we're selling our own advertising now. So overall, we feel very strongly about our growth trajectory around the world. ID is another example of a channel that works well around the world that we feel good about. So internationally, we feel like we're very well-positioned.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","You occasionally give sort of a market share number. Is there still plenty of headroom as your market shares are moving higher? Do you start to worry about running into a wall at some point?","David M. Zaslav","Yes, I think we're reeling in the third or fourth inning here. We've just got TLC distributed. It's now the #1 most distributed women's brand in the world. And we're starting to see the benefit of having a strong female brand in almost every market. We saw that here in the U.S. because we get to see every advertiser. And whether it's -- in most cases, TLC right now is continuing to grow, because we're getting to know how to nourish that audience around the world. In some markets, it's really taking off. In Italy, we're very, very strong. In Western Europe, we've been able, with TLC, to take advantage of a very big market share story that has, in a difficult economy, given us substantial growth. We had very small presence in Spain, but we had a ton of content. So we put that content on a free-to-air channel at very low costs, and we're gaining a lot of market share with a very successful channel called Discovery MAX in Spain. So overall, we think there's a lot of opportunity for us to continue to grow market share.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And on domestic, if you produce mid single-digit growth in 3Q, or going to, despite the Olympics and given your upfront commentaries, is it fair to say investors should expect 4Q reaccelerates backup to high single-digit domestic ad growth?","David M. Zaslav","We're not going to predict fourth quarter, but I do think fourth quarter will be very strong. We have the anomaly of the Olympics, as well as we have a lot of strong content on Discovery that's out of cycle. So we had Gold Rush on Friday nights. That was the #1 show on television, including the broadcasters, we have a very good development slate. And a lot of that will be coming up in the fall. So we feel very good about fourth quarter, and I think you can expect to see some strong numbers on the advertising side, assuming that the market stays as is.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Is there any way to figure out what the Olympics impact might have been? Is there any ballpark, 3%, 5%?","David M. Zaslav","It's hard to tell. The Olympics have come out very strong. We stayed a little bit flexible. At this point, we're holding back a number of our premieres because we just feel that the Olympics right now has a significant amount of cultural momentum. If, in fact, the Olympics loses a little bit of steam, then we think we have some upside. In addition, when we come back after Shark Week, if our content is a little bit stronger than you'll also see on the ratings side, you'll see some more upside. But we've tried to be conservative here in our approach.","Andrew C. Warren","And, Doug, it's Andy. Just to add, importantly for the fourth quarter, we do expect the resumption to double-digit OIBDA growth in the fourth quarter. So that's a key outlook for us at the back half of the year.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just following up on the domestic trends in Q3, David, is any of the deceleration coming from just sort of market trends or any weakness in demand overall in TV in the U.S. or would you really chalk it all up to some ratings office in the Olympic comp?","David M. Zaslav","Yes, we're not seeing any softness in the market. The market remains strong. We had a very good upfront. We can talk a little bit more about it later. But overall, it was more demand than we've seen in the past. We were able to -- it was similar to last year, in terms of the amount of inventory that we moved, about 55%. And the pricing was quite good. And more importantly, we got a very strong receptivity to all of our networks this time. One of the key objectives was to get more advertisers into Destination America, more into ID, more into Science and Military. And so the acceptance of the strength of those brands was an important success metric for us for this upfront.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Great. And if I could just ask one follow-up internationally. You've been in the cable business for a long time. You're looking at the international opportunity as being early days still. I'm just curious, when you think about moving to free-to-air in some markets, it would seem like that's, to some extent, a hedge, if you think about long-term growth in Pay in markets, like Italy, for example. Are you sort of saying you think you can maximize Discovery as sort of profit or revenue pool in those markets by playing sort of both platforms? Do you expect the Pay TV penetration to resume growth as the economies heal over there? Just a little more on your thought processes moving to the free-to-air side of the equation would be good.","David M. Zaslav","Yes. Look, free-to-air is pretty limited for us, but when we've use it, we've been able to uniquely be successful. Strategically, when you take a market like Italy or Spain that has -- that's either mature or a small Pay TV universe, and you have one of the strengths that we have is we have a over 25-year library of content that we own all of the rights to, and so for us, free-to-air is a little bit different. We pick up a stick of free-to -- a channel, and we could essentially program that. Like in Spain, our cost is almost -- is very little. And so if you look at other markets, like Turkey, Russia, big growth markets like Brazil or Mexico, those are not markets where we would launch free-to-air because we're riding a very aggressive Pay TV market that feels a lot like the U.S. 10 years ago. And all those wins are in our favor there, where we're seeing sub growth, we're seeing viewership, in general, moving to cable, we're seeing our market share growing. And so in those markets, we will -- we'll be much more traditional. And in some of the more mature markets in Western Europe, this has been a very specific strategy, but a very effective strategy.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Mr. David Bank from RBC Capital.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Two questions, one on the programming expense side and one on the advertising side. I guess, on the expense side, it sounds like you're sort of calling out on the call and in the press release a little bit of a step-up in cash programming expenses for the quarter. Was that -- is that sort of a quarterly lumpiness throughout the year or is it a -- do we expect to see kind of a -- or could you tell us, do we expect to see a step-up on annualized amortization going into next year? If you could give a little bit more color around that. And the second question is, there is clearly a cyclicality of content in any given period, and you have some tough comps. And you have the Olympics, and you have like a lot of moving parts here. But we're kind of swinging from like really down in some of the flagships to expectations are really up. What kind of minimum ratings growth do you think you need on the flagships domestically at TLC and Discovery to kind of get back to that high single-digit growth, given the expected performance in the emerging networks, which seem to be really strong? Can you talk about sort of just, like at a minimum, what do Discovery and TLC on a sustained basis have to do?","Andrew C. Warren","Okay. David, it's Andy. I'll answer your first question. There's really no call-out on the cash timing. We knew that to be a little bit of acceleration of cash content expense in the second quarter. We had said for a while now that first half expense to be higher than second half. We still believe that overall from an expense profile. So there's no cash timing call-out. It just was a timing of cash distribution in the second quarter. David?","David M. Zaslav","Yes. On the flagships, there is cyclicality to it. We had a very strong fourth quarter and first quarter on Discovery. We were up high single digits, and we had a lot of our content really working, a lot of new content that was working quite well. In the summer, we were a little bit out of cycle. In the last 2 weeks in July, before the Olympics, we were up 15%, and that was without a lot of our premieres and our good stuff. So I do think it goes up and down. We expect that Discovery and TLC will grow. We have a very specific audience that we're going after, but we're also not just about ratings. One of the keys for us is the ability to take quality content and move it around the world. It's very efficient for us on Discovery, on TLC, on Animal Planet. And so for us, ratings isn't the only metric, but we do expect that we'll -- that those networks should grow and will grow mid single, and if we're more successful than that, double digit. We have very good creative teams in place there. At the same time, we've been one of the only media companies to affect the strategy that's built around the idea that we can still build meaningful audiences on new channels. So ID didn't exist 4 years ago, it's now a top 10 network in America. It's been probably 10 years since a top 10 network has launched, and we did it from scratch. We're seeing a lot of strength at OWN, we're seeing strength on Science, Animal Planet. Destination America is working very well, particularly in the travel category, where there's a lot of good advertisers. And so we're definitely focused on having TLC and Discovery grow, but we're also very excited about the fact that we have a number of other channels that are growing as well.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Andy, just to clarify, I just want to follow up and make sure I understand. So the -- whatever is going on in terms of the programming investment that you did signal going into the quarter, is there anything we could take away in terms of longer-term amortization changes? Has anything changed from sort of prior assumptions and programming investment trends?","Andrew C. Warren","No, David. I mean, no, we continue to see opportunity to invest, especially in our emergency channels that David has talked about. But there's no change here in the views we've given in the past and our kind of content structure for the second half and going into '13.","David M. Zaslav","Longer-term, we've been investing about 8% or 9%. And with that, we've been able to launch TLC around the world, to invest in all of these channels we just talked about. And it's all success-based investment. Next year or the year after, if that number goes up, we're going to be very happy. If that number goes up, it means that we're -- that the content is working even better, and therefore, we're investing more and we're gaining more market share. But so far, if you look over the last couple of years, it's been pretty steady into -- in the 8% to 9%. And that's where we expect it to be, unless we can hit a few more strong veins of program content.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Janedis from UBS.","John Janedis - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","David, the shelf life of programming seems to be getting a little bit shorter. When you look at over the next couple of years, do you see your number of new primetime hours increasing somewhat on both the mature and emerging networks?","David M. Zaslav","It's hard to tell. On the one hand, you're right that content seems to be cycling a little bit shorter. On the other hand, we have a new window with Netflix and Amazon, where we're able to take content that's 18 months and older, and in our case, the majority of that is 2 years and older, and create significant economics. On that score, we've been looking at that Netflix, Amazon window, and it's been very successful for us, with no degradation of viewership. So that is all incremental. It's a little too early at this point for us to figure out whether we're going to do more premieres. At this point, we haven't, particularly on our smaller networks. We're able to do much less and still get the benefit of significant repeat and using content on multiple channels on Discovery and TLC that are -- that have audiences that are -- that DVR a little bit more and are much stronger brands and stronger channels. On that, we're able to repeat a little bit less. But in general, we haven't made any decision to make any meaningful change.","John Janedis - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","All right. Maybe on your related topic, you mentioned Netflix and Amazon. How do you think about future opportunities from them or other players in both the U.S. and abroad?","David M. Zaslav","Well, we did a deal with Netflix that was a 3-year deal -- a 2-year deal with an option to extend for a third year. We have a very good relationship with Netflix. That new window of 18 months and older, which is the deal that we did with Amazon and Netflix domestically, looks to be working very well so far for us. And if it continues, then we're very happy that we have an opportunity to exercise a third year on that. There are a number of other players that are looking for content in that window and in a nearer-term window with TV Everywhere. And I think that's one of the reasons why it's such a good time to be in the content business right now if you own your content. Every one of those windows provides additional consideration for us, and they are potentially more growth. And since we own our content, we get almost all of that. Outside the U.S. is a little bit different. I mean, it really depends on the market. So far, we haven't done any of those deals outside the U.S. In mature markets, like some of the markets in Western Europe, it's very possible that we'll be doing some of those deals because you have a highly penetrated Pay TV market that looks a lot like the U.S., and the Netflix-type deals become incremental, with, at least at this point, no sense of degradation of viewership. That's very different than when you go to Latin America where Brazil is 25% penetrated or Mexico, 42% penetrated. And you're seeing huge growth in Mexico that was almost 1 million subscribers added in the last quarter. And in those populations, there's a C class that's adopting onto Pay TV that hasn't had Pay TV before. And so we're not convinced that doing an 18-month window and presenting content to those viewers is a good idea. It may be, but we're just not convinced. So we're going to -- in the emerging markets, we'll probably stay away for a period of time and ride the Pay TV window alone. But in some of the more mature markets, we'll look at it as being an incremental opportunity.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Todd Juenger from Sanford Bernstein.","Todd Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","One on -- quick one on -- another one on ratings and then one on the JVs. So the choppiness you mentioned at Discovery and TLC in Q2, I just wondered if you have any insight on, for instance, in June when Discovery and TLC had tougher months, where those viewers went, and how many of them landed on your other networks, and how many of them landed on competitive networks, and how you feel about trading those viewers back and forth like that. And then where you expect them to come back from. And then on the JV losses of the minority positions just came in really light on the loss there for the quarter. Just wondering what -- I know ratings are well -- are way up, but that was an extraordinarily much lower loss than we had seen earlier in the year. Just wondering if that's indicative of the future there. I know they're buying less services from you, so that's part of the financial improvement there. But any other color on what's driving that improvement.","David M. Zaslav","Okay. On the ratings piece, we really feel like it's cyclical. We didn't have many premieres, and our strongest content was not in play in June. What you'll see coming after Shark Week on Discovery is some of our better content getting even stronger as you go into September and October, so we're quite confident. On TLC, we have a number of our strong shows that are performing well, and you're going to be seeing more of them as the summer goes on. And we just launched a new night of wedding programming. We're the #1 network for women on Friday nights, with wedding programming, we have a whole slate of new wedding programming coming on Thursday. So one, we feel pretty good about where we are creatively. But where it goes, I'm sure that we pick up some of it from our other 12 or 13 networks here in the U.S. But people here -- this is the most competitive viewing market in the world. We have over 200 channels. So it's -- our job is to put on great shows with strong characters and great stories. When we do, we build very big audiences. In the end -- last 2 weeks in July, Discovery was up 15% because we were -- we put on some more good content. So that's how we see it on that. Before I pass it to Andy, on OWN and The Hub in terms of the actual numbers, both are -- both have really accelerated. The Hub has seen not only ratings growth, but Margaret Loesch has started to get a real sense of how to program that network to the kids' audience, 2 to 11. My Little Pony has taken off in a big way culturally, which has been a help, and Transformers. And on OWN, there's a great leadership team that's really stable now in place. Erik Logan and Sheri Salata, very strong, Oprah is engaged. And that network has grown every month from the beginning of this year. It's now performing even better than we thought it would. It was up 14%, then 20%, now 50%. It's more than 25% year-to-date. And more importantly, every advertiser that signed up before we went on the air has re-signed up to be part of OWN. And so we feel very good about it, and we're looking forward to OWN being profitable next year. And we're feeling very good about Hub. So a lot of work went into that, a lot of hard work by the leadership teams there to figure out the audience and how to nourish them. We got a ways to go on both, but they're both doing quite well.","Andrew C. Warren","Yes. Todd, the significant improvement in the other income expense line was driven by OWN. That's really twofold. One, in the first quarter, if you remember, we had the closedown costs of Rosie. We accrued all of those expenses in the first quarter. But also, it's driven by this better performance at OWN. I mean, OWN, operationally, expense-wise, advertising-wise, as David said, rating-wise, they had a better quarter. And so that flowed through to us. As we look forward though, the third and fourth quarter, important to highlight that we do expect slightly higher losses in that line, mostly driven by investing into the strength and the momentum at OWN right now, put more marketing, more content expense. So we will have a slightly bigger pickup of losses there. But again, it's investing momentum, and the second quarter was very good.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Jessica Reif Cohen from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jessica Reif Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just on the buyback, I just -- I know you guys commented on that, but the pace does seem to be picking up Q2 and into Q3. Can you just comment, will Q3 -- it looks like it will be over another quarter over $400 million?","Andrew C. Warren","Yes. Jessica, as you've heard me say before, my #1 metric that I look at and I drive is free cash flow per share. And so when we model out and when David and I, when we talk to the board about this, when we model out buying a stock today and free cash flow per share going forward in our forecast and creating that IRR, as long as that IRR is strong and double-digit, we're a buyer of our stock. And actively, enthusiastic about that. You saw that momentum in the second quarter, and we do anticipate continuing that. Ideally, we would continue to put money into growing organically and continue to look at perhaps acquisition opportunities. But in the meantime, we will continue to allocate capital towards rebuying shares, especially given our free cash flow per share growth profile.","Jessica Reif Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And then on that -- kind of the acquisition front, because you mentioned that in the press release earlier in the call, what kinds of acquisitions would be of interest to you, I mean, if you just kind of talk theoretically?","David M. Zaslav","Jessica, theoretically -- clearly, International is our strength. It's almost 40% of our business now. It's grown -- 4 years ago, it was $250 million. Last year, it was $650 million. This year, it will be dramatically more than that, with real meaningful, I think, strategic advantage. Our content works well. We have more channels than anybody else. We have local teams on the ground. And so building on that strength is a key strategic initiative for us. In addition, it's an important hedge. The U.S. has slowed down. We're growing in the U.S. because we're growing market share and because we have a good team monetizing with Joe Abruzzese the sales that we get. And we have a strong leadership team on the distribution side that over the next few years, we think, will do very well when our deals come up. But when you can -- when you have markets that are underpenetrated, like Turkey and Russia and India and all of Latin America, where we've been for so long so strong, to the extent that there are any meaningful opportunities where we can acquire something. But because of our position, we're likely to have more synergy than others. And because we're on the ground, we can make pretty quick assessment. But we're only going to buy something if we think it will help us grow faster. And so we have been looking very hard on a lot of things, but we haven't bought anything yet because we haven't found anything that's going to help us grow faster. We did make a small acquisition of Revision3 this past quarter. That's a video stream business. It's a leader in the video stream business, and that's consistent with us viewing ourselves as a company that satisfies curiosity on all platforms. And they're a very aggressive, entrepreneurial company in Silicon Valley, and we're excited about having them as part of us.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Mr. Michael Nathanson from Nomura.","Michael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Dave, I have 2 for you. Let me start with the first one. Given what you did in NBC and now Discovery, I wonder if you have any views or strategies of change looking at the DIRECTV-Viacom battle from last month on affiliate fees. Does that make you change your philosophy or strategy through your own deals going forward? So I just want to know what your view of that was.","David M. Zaslav","I don't really have a view on, specifically, what happened with Viacom, but we have a very clear strategy domestically and internationally. We've been saying it now for 6 years, which is, what's most important is that we build strong brands, grow our viewership and try and get affinity groups. It's not just the ratings of your channels, but it's how strongly do the groups of people that watch the channel feel about your channel. So the fact that Discovery is the #1 most valued brand on cable is important to us, the fact that we built a network ID that has women that feel very strongly about it as a channel that they love. So the fact that we've launched 7 channels since -- in the last 5 years, the fact that our market share is up significantly, and candidly, we have a very strong equitable argument. We were investing about $600 million. We're now investing over $1 billion. So our strategy is simple, and that's that we want to bring more value to the viewers. We want to be more important to the viewers. And if we are, we think that when we do our deals, we'll be able to get substantially more value because we're spending more money and we've earned it by having our channels be more important.","Michael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","And is going dark something that you would -- an option that you'd consider?","David M. Zaslav","I don't want to speak about the negotiations that we're going to have, but we feel very good about where we are in terms of the hand that we have because we think our channels in the aggregate are very strong. All 13 come up at once. We have good relationships with the distributors, but we'll be pushing hard to make sure that we get fair value.","Michael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. And let me just ask you just a point of clarity about the upfront. At one point, you said you guys had sold more volume, and then you said a number in the Q&A of 55% sellout. So could you help us square that -- did you sell the same volume on the mature TLC, Discovery networks and add more volume on the other? So how do those 2 comments work together?","Andrew C. Warren","It's really -- it's a little less on some channels, but remember, we have more inventory based on some of the new launches we have. So overall, more volume, but again, good mid to high single-digit pricing. And that 55% was right where we wanted to be going into what is still a robust scatter market.","David M. Zaslav","And it's not -- the point is it's not 55% across-the-board. There are a number of our channels that we're catching up on. It's going to take probably 2 to 3 years before we can get full value on ID, although we're making progress. And the same is true, we're working our way up with a lot of these brands, but they're new. And as a result of that, they're not getting the -- we believe they're not getting the CPM that they deserve. And so in some cases, for some channels where we got the right value, we took more. In cases where we think that we could do better by going into scatter, where we can push the CPM up higher and faster, we took less. But overall, we feel very good about how we did.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Anthony DiClemente from Barclays.","Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division","First, for Andy on free cash flow. I know your cash taxes stepped up by about $200 million in 2012. Wondering if we're at a more normalized level there as we try to model out free cash flow into 2013, if there's any anomalies in the calculation that you would point out, whether it's taxes or working capital. And then one for David, just following up on the question about distribution and the negotiations. Wondering if it's possible that any of your existing deals are opened up and extended early because of TV Everywhere authentication. Is that possible? And I'm just sort of wondering, if not, then why not? Is that sort of a commentary on the environment or anything? Wondering if you think we see those deals come -- open up before expiry.","Andrew C. Warren","Anthony, on the tax question, if you remember, last year, there was a real anomaly with the Section 181 catch-up. And so this year, we don't have that benefit. It hasn't been extended yet by Congress. If it is, that would be a really good guy. But right now, we're assuming it has not been renewed. So that last year was a real good guy. That's the difference between last year and this year on the tax side. As far as going forward, no real call other than one huge benefit we have at being such a globally diverse company is our ability to kind of maximize tax entity and structures. And so we are taking a look at our global content rights and how we can structure those in a way that's most tax advantaged for long-term. But for today, 35% is roughly the right number to think about. We did have that one discrete item in the second quarter that was helpful, and that will be a good cash guy next year. But broadly speaking, the main answer to your question is Section 181 last year.","Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Right. So broadly speaking, if I just model out your free cash flow trajectory similar to your cash flow from ops trajectory, then that's reasonable?","Andrew C. Warren","Yes.","David M. Zaslav","Anthony, on the distribution side, if you take away TV Everywhere in terms of the terms, the deals start coming up at the end of this year, and it's -- they kind of flow in pretty evenly over the next 4 or 5 years. As I've said earlier, TV Everywhere is something that we think is valuable. Many of the distributors would like it, and they would like authentication. We haven't reached agreements yet with anybody. We are in some tests with Comcast. We like that model. There's 2 ways we could do TV Everywhere. We could get valuable consideration for TV Everywhere alone or we can open up the deals early and do a roll-up renewal that includes TV Everywhere. Both have been discussed. We haven't decided which we're going to do, and we'll do the one that we think creates the most value for shareholders.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Tuna Amobi from S&P Capital IQ.","Tuna N. Amobi - S&P Equity Research","Just a quick clarification. Andy, your comments on the higher losses for OWN in the back half, I was wondering if that was relative to Q2 or relative to the first half. That would be helpful.","Andrew C. Warren","Definitely Q2. I mean, that operating improvement that we saw on the second quarter will continue, but we are going to put a little more money behind it, especially in the marketing side. So it will be slightly more relative to our Q2 performance.","Tuna N. Amobi - S&P Equity Research","Okay. And still on the OWN steam, David. So I think it's fair to say improvement in OWN has been remarkable so far this year, and maybe you guys aren't telling the story enough. But as I think about your -- the ratings and the breakeven target that you've given, is there something in there that perhaps you think may derail a sustainability of this trend that we're seeing? Can you point to maybe a couple of things that you've done that you think can make these kinds of gains to be sustainable, or not?","David M. Zaslav","Candidly, we're significantly ahead of where we thought we would be last quarter with the ratings, where we had started to really build ratings. We have a good leadership team in place. Most importantly, the viewers are coming back. They like what they see. We're giving -- it's very simple, we're doing less of what's not working, we're doing more of what is working. Oprah's much more engaged. She has a team in there that's in love with the brand, and we've been trying to figure out over the last year how do we nourish the viewers. We get to talk to them through oprah.com, which is a great advantage. It's a very strong online vehicle, one of the top for women. And between the leadership team and the new content that we have and a lot of that the new content that we have coming up, we're quite confident that we've begun to really find the recipe for a strong women's network. And we think that the OWN brand now is starting to be what Oprah and I talked about when we were all excited about this. The Oprah brand is one of the best brands in media. And for women, it's -- it may be the best brand in media.","Tuna N. Amobi - S&P Equity Research","And separately, with regard to the upfront strategy, so one might have thought that you guys may have played it a little bit more conservative, granted  a mid to high single digit is higher than, I guess, what the industry saw. But with all these new channels and rebranding and whatnot and the kind of ratings momentum, can you maybe elaborate a little bit more on why you kind of chose that strategy? I think you said the scatter market is relatively healthy. So a little bit few more data points on that would be helpful.","David M. Zaslav","Yes. We feel quite lucky having Joe Abruzzese, probably the best sales -- we think the best sales leader in the business. We were on the high-end of the market in terms of the upfront, and we were very strategic. Not only we were on the high-end of the market in terms of the pricing and the volume, but we were also able through Joe's team to put the dollars in the places where we thought would be most valuable to us and to give ourselves opportunity to go into scatter with some of our brands when we thought that they would be more valuable there or where we had more ratings momentum to take advantage of it. So overall, we were very happy with the upfront.","Operator","The last question comes from the line of Barton Crockett from Lazard Capital Markets.","Barton E. Crockett - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","I wanted to ask about the outlook for the third quarter ad growth internationally. You talked about how you see a bit of a slowdown domestically, partially in Olympics impact. Is there anything like that happening internationally or does the Olympics' impact really not matter over there?","Andrew C. Warren","Yes, it really doesn't matter over there, Barton, as much. We still expect double-digit growth there, a less visibility based on the market. But we still expect double-digit growth out of international.","Barton E. Crockett - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just a follow-up on the FX impact in this quarter, which was quite pronounced. I know you guys talk about 40% of your International segment revenues being dollar-denominated. Could you parse down for us a little bit more about where you actually saw the FX headwinds in the quarter?","Andrew C. Warren","Well, look, it's really twofold. The -- relative to a year ago, the euro weakened 13%. And so when you look at our FX impact, not only is it the transactional impact but the translation as well. From an accounting perspective, you take your short-term assets, like receivables, and you actually translate them at the lower currency rate. That also flows through to the income statement. So it's not just a transactional fees but the translation as well. The accumulation of those 2, given a significant move in the euro, translated into this meaningful amount of FX impact in the quarter.","Barton E. Crockett - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay. Do you see -- I mean, as you flatline on the FX going forward, does the impact remain similar in the third and fourth quarter or does it fade?","Andrew C. Warren","It fades relative to the year-over-year variance. The guidance we gave assumes really a constant currency from today, so we haven't really assumed any defluctuations in the market today. But it will wane a little bit based on just a year-over-year fluctuation in the currency.","Craig Felenstein","Thanks, everybody, for joining us. We appreciate it.

Joining me today is David Zaslav, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Andy Warren, our Chief Financial Officer.","Hopefully, you have all received our earnings release, but if not, feel free to access it on our website at www.discoverycommunications.com. ","On today's call, we will begin with some opening comments from David and Andy, after which, we will open the call up for your questions. We urge you to please keep to 1 or 2 questions, so we can accommodate as many folks as possible.","Before we start, I would like to remind you that comments today regarding the company's future business plans, prospects and financial performance are forward-looking statements that we make pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Zaslav","Thanks, Craig. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Discovery is off to a great start in 2012, delivering first quarter results that built upon the double-digit growth and strong operating momentum we generated throughout 2011. Importantly, our success continues to be well-balanced with growth spread across geographic boundaries and driven by diversified revenue streams, each of which are leveraging the strength of our content portfolio and robust distribution platform.","On our year-end call, I highlighted some of the elements that contributed to our success a year ago, from a strengthened programming library that capitalized on a robust global ad market and a growing demand for content across emerging distribution platforms to the opportunities we are exploiting across our international asset base.","As evidenced by our first quarter results, these drivers remain firmly in place. Andy will discuss the specifics behind our financial performance in a moment. But before he does, let me take a few minutes to highlight some of the opportunities we continue to take advantage of and also discuss some of the initiatives that we expect will contribute to sustained financial and operating momentum throughout the remainder of 2012.","Once again, during the first quarter, Discovery's long-term strategy of investing in bigger, stronger brands and the highest quality nonfiction content continued to pay off with consumers watching more television in total than ever before across conventional and emerging distribution channels. Simply put, it is a great time to be in the content business. Even more so, if your programming resonates with diverse audiences and you own the rights for the majority of your content. ","Our sustained investment in programming is delivering market share growth worldwide, and given the continued strength in the advertising market, we were able to generate total company global ad growth of 16% in the first quarter.","Domestically, our market share growth built upon the viewership gains we delivered in each of the last several years with viewership in the first quarter expanding over 6% in prime time among adults 25 to 54. This success was even more compelling when you consider that the non-Discovery cable declined slightly and broadcast was down 7% in the same period. Equally as compelling is the fact that our success was broad-based and not driven by just one brand. Discovery Channel grew 5% in primetime, led by the continued success of returning hits Gold Rush, the #1 show on TV on Friday nights for men, including the broadcast nets, Flying Wild Alaska and Sons of Guns. Discovery also benefited from the strong performances of several new series, including Moonshiners and Bering Sea Gold along with the premiere of Frozen Planet.","Animal Planet was up 18% in the first quarter, led by the growth of several returning series, including the second season of Finding Bigfoot, which grew 17% over its premiere season. ","TLC ratings declined versus a year ago, but has built a broad, stable of returning hits, including 17 series that are delivering over 1 million viewers, and TLC is the #1 ad-supported cable network for women on Friday nights.","ID continued its blistering pace, delivering its best quarter ever with 35% growth in its key women 25 to 54 demo. It remains the fastest-growing cable network and is now the fourth ranked network in all of cable during the day, behind only USA, TNT and TBS.","We also had viewership gains across all our emerging growth networks, including Science, Military, Velocity, Fit & Health, as well as the soon-to-be re-branded Planet Green.","We're always looking to drive the potential of our valuable distribution, our beachfront real estate, by breaking new ground that ignites viewers' curiosity. Along those lines, we announced that our upfront presentation, that Planet Green will become Destination America on May 28 just prior to the Memorial Day weekend. We believe by combining the very best of travel, adventure, food, home and natural history into one brand, we can create a new lifestyle destination that viewers will be engaged by, and it will deliver huge value to our advertisers. While the re-brand is not for several weeks, we've already begun to focus on these type of programming on the existing network and the result in the first quarter was viewership growth of over 30%, and we've only just gotten started.","Our ratings success was not limited to our consolidated networks. The Hub delivered 32% growth in Total Day among kids 2 to 11. And OWN delivered 14% growth this past quarter. OWN has already become a top 30 network for women with over 95 U.S. cable networks in just over a year, up from the #45 network a year ago.","With the creative team firmly in place, several established returning series and Oprah once again captivating audiences in the way that only she can, OWN is generating meaningful ratings momentum as we continue to build and grow this network.","In addition to the ratings success, OWN has taken significant steps recently that will help the network improve its financial position moving forward, including structuring deals with meaningful sub fees with the majority of MSOs, including most recently extending and broadening its affiliate relationship with Comcast. In addition, we attacked the cost structure by streamlining the operations and canceled several series that audiences were not connecting with. With an appropriate cost structure now in place, a broad affiliate foundation, 80 million subs growing to 85 million and most MSOs beginning to pay sub fees on January 1, 2013, together with ratings building quarter-to-quarter and continued advertising support, we remain confident in the growth potential of this network.","Given the current momentum and operating conditions, we anticipate funding to OWN in 2012 will be less than 2011. And we expect to achieve cash flow breakeven during the second half of 2013.","The diverse rating success we delivered in the first quarter across our consolidated networks helped as to generate ad growth of 13%, building on the 15% growth we delivered in the first quarter a year ago, excluding Discovery Health comparisons. Remarkably, this was the eighth quarter in a row that we delivered double-digit ad growth, underscoring not only the strong ad market, but also the breadth and depth of the brands we have built as well as the efforts of our ad sales team to maximize the market and viewership opportunities. This growth gives us a great start to 2012 and also puts is in a great position heading into what we hope will be a robust upfront.","We recently completed our upfront presentations. And while it is always difficult to predict where the upfront market will ultimately end up, with strong scatter volumes, scatter pricing well above last year's upfront, sustained ratings momentum across our networks, a diverse brand portfolio and the best ad sales team in the business, we expect to see significant increases in this year's upfront.","Advertising was not the only area where we leveraged the appeal of our content during the first quarter. I mentioned on our last call that in 2012, we anticipated additional opportunities to exploit the growing value of our content library. And this quarter, we did just that, announcing a digital distribution agreement with Amazon. Much like our Netflix agreement, we will once again able to generate significant value from our library content while retaining flexibility with regards to our distributors. A significant portion of the revenues from this agreement was recognized in the current quarter, but we anticipate our licensing agreements will continue to enhance our affiliate growth rates as we deliver additional content.","Having ownership of the vast majority of our programming provides us flexibility regarding emerging opportunities. Discovery remains platform-agnostic with regards to distributing our content, and we will continue to explore additional opportunities to leverage our expansive content library.","So with a broad and deep set of content assets, ratings momentum across our network portfolio, a healthy ad environment and emerging distribution alternatives, there's plenty of room for continued growth across our U.S. Network operations. However, the true differentiator for us remains our international business.","Just to provide some perspective. This is a segment that only 4 years ago was delivering $254 million of OIBDA with operating margins around 26%, and which in 2011, generated $645 million and 45% margins despite continued investment in developing new brands and compelling programming across multiple geographic regions. This rapid growth over the last 4 years highlights both our ability to execute on our strategic plans as well as the opportunity inherent in the global infrastructure we have built and nurtured over the last quarter century.","This financial and operational momentum only accelerated during our first quarter. The largest driver of international growth continues to be the progression of Pay TV globally, and given our footprint, we are uniquely positioned to benefit from further expansion.","Discovery subscriber base increased by over 10% versus a year ago, which helped drive affiliate revenue growth of 11% on an organic basis. Our subscriber growth is broad-based with double-digit increases led by Latin America and Central and Eastern Europe translating into double-digit affiliate revenue growth across nearly every region. And we fully expect further Pay TV growth moving forward, given the low penetration worldwide including less than 40% across Latin America as well as Central and Eastern Europe.","With boots on the ground across the globe as these platforms continue to proliferate, we are ideally situated to maximize the opportunity they provide. The infrastructure we have built provides us the unique ability to launch new networks and feeds to capitalize on market dynamics.","In the past, we have discussed how our global platform enabled us to establish another global flagship in TLC, now in over 153 markets and only in the early stages of its growth cycle. Today, TLC is in over 125 million homes, and it is the #1 most distributed women's brand in the world from no international distribution less than 2 years ago.","But that is just one example. We are continuously looking into launching additional feeds and new networks to capitalize on market opportunities and audience demand. Our recent launch of Discovery Kids in Asia is another example. We recognized the white space in the Asian market and believe there is an opening to replicate the success of our thriving kids business in Latin America.","To further feed our robust portfolio of 26 brands and further drive advertising growth, we also established a global content group to help drive the international viewership through development of original content. Many of the original shows that are developed by the global group will debut across the globe later this year and will have the added benefit of ultimately airing back on our U.S. Networks as well. ","The content group also works with our U.S. operations to utilize programming generated across our domestic portfolio of networks. Our U.S. content is resonating with international audiences, whether it is Cake Boss in South America or Extreme Couponing in Norway, our content view group continues to explore ways to further leverage our domestic programming abroad.","Our international team is also continuing to maximize the contributions from our more competitive markets such as Italy and the U.K. Led by Real Time and DMAX in Italy, as well as Quest in the U.K., our free-to-air revenues more than doubled this quarter and have helped maintain a nice growth trajectory in markets that are becoming more mature.","When you combine the larger addressable audiences across our international platforms with a more robust programming offering, the result has been substantial viewership gains. And these additional eyeballs are translating into sustained double-digit advertising growth, including 22% in the current quarter, building upon the 24% we delivered in the first quarter of 2011.","With advertising still only making up 1\/3 of our international revenue, we have plenty of room to grow this revenue stream and increase international margins. ","Building new brands and strengthening our content pipeline will always be our first strategic priority. But at the same time, we remain focused on thoughtfully allocating the capital we are generating.","We have a very strong balance sheet and as we mentioned last quarter, we expect to generate over $1 billion in free cash flow this year. We are always on the lookout for value-enhancing opportunities, whether organically or through acquisitions, that complement our existing asset base. And we continue to return capital to shareholders.","We have returned $1.4 billion in capital to our shareholders under our buyback program. And with the additional $1 billion buyback just authorized by our board, we will continue to do so aggressively if it is the best use of our balance sheet.","Discovery's off to a great start in 2012 with strong first quarter results and sustained operating momentum across our domestic and international operations. Our focus remains on building additional long-term value by investing in our brands and platforms while also delivering continued financial growth and returning capital to shareholders. ","Before I finish up, let me welcome our new CFO, Andy Warren, who will be a great partner as we look to further drive our business and exploit the growth opportunities that remain ahead for Discovery."," I will now turn the call over to Andy.","Andrew C. Warren","Thanks, David. And thank you, everyone, for joining us today. I'm really excited to be a part of Discovery. It is a company I've long admired, and I look forward to talking with each of you over the next several months. ","As David mentioned, Discovery delivered solid operating results during the first quarter as continued execution, the strength of our content and a favorable operating environment enabled the company to build upon the momentum that the team generated throughout 2011.","First quarter revenue growth of 16% was broad-based with double-digit increases across the U.S. and International Networks and double-digit gains for both advertising and affiliate revenue streams. Note that the current quarter includes $50 million of additional revenues from the new licensing agreement with Amazon and the expanded licensing agreement with Netflix. Excluding these agreements, our total company revenue growth was 11%. ","Total operating expenses in the quarter were up 12% compared to the prior year, primarily due to higher content amortization, increased personnel and marketing costs as well as $8 million of additional expenses associated with the Amazon and Netflix licensing agreements. Excluding the additional costs related to licensing agreements and the impact of foreign exchange, the increase in operating expenses was 11% versus the first quarter a year ago.","As is indicated on the year-end call, expense growth is expected to be weighted to the first half of the year with the full year increase in the low to mid-single digits. ","Discovery's continued ability to generate revenue growth in excess of expenses translated into a 19% increase in adjusted OIBDA during the first quarter. Excluding currency impact and the Amazon and Netflix licensing agreements, adjusted OIBDA increased 9%.","Net income decreased to $222 million as the improved operating performance in the current year was offset by a $102 million gain in the prior year resulting from the contribution of the Discovery Health into the Oprah Winfrey Network. Excluding this net-of-tax gain, net income increased 9% versus the first quarter a year ago.","Please note that during the first quarter, Discovery began recording 100% of OWN's net losses as the accumulated operating losses at OWN fully depleted their equity balance. We will, therefore, going forward, continue to record 100% of the OWN results through equity income as long as OWN has depleted equity. The net impact for the quarter of recording 100% of the losses was approximately $10 million net of tax or $0.03 per share. ","Free cash flow grew 10% to $227 million due to increased operating performance and lower stock comp payments, partially offset by higher tax payments.","The new content licensing agreement with Amazon did not impact free cash flow in the first quarter and will be received pro rata over the term of the licensing arrangement. ","On a per share basis, free cash flow increased in the quarter from $0.50 to $0.58 per share, reflecting the increased free cash flow and the impact of the share repurchase program.","Turning to the operating units. The U.S. Networks delivered substantial growth with revenues up 16% led by a 23% increase in our distribution revenue, primarily driven by the incremental revenues from the licensing agreements. Excluding the impacts of these licensing agreements, distribution revenue growth was 5% year-on-year.","Much like when the Netflix agreement was executed in the third quarter of 2011, the current quarter includes a significant portion of the revenues from the Amazon agreement as revenues are recognized upon delivery of the content through our distribution partner, and we delivered the bulk of the programming at the front end of the contract.","Next quarter, as additional content is delivered under both agreements, we expect that they will, combined, add 200 to 300 basis points of incremental growth to our domestic affiliate revenues.","As David touched upon, the U.S. Network ad sales team delivered its eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit ad revenue growth, up 13% over the prior year. This is on top of the 15% organic growth that was generated in the first quarter of 2011 and was led by the increased delivery across our networks as well as from the sustained favorable pricing and demand sales environment.","The attractive current market conditions continue to exist in the second quarter, and we anticipate high single digit ad sales growth with, of course, possible variability from ratings performance versus the prior year, which grew 13% organically.","Domestic operating expenses were up 13% from the prior year with a majority of the increase due to the expanded higher content amortization, along with increased marketing for Frozen Planet and the $8 million of expense related to the new and expanded licensing agreements I mentioned previously.","On a reported basis, domestic adjusted OIBDA increased 18% versus a year ago. Excluding the impact of the licensing agreements, adjusted OIBDA was up 6% over the prior year.","Turning to the international operations. The momentum across our global platform continues as revenues on a reported basis expanded 18%, led by double-digit ad and affiliate growth. Excluding the foreign currency impact, total revenues grew 20% as distribution revenue increased 16% and advertising revenue increased 25%. The affiliate revenue growth was driven by continued strong subscriber additions, particularly in Latin America led by Brazil and Mexico and across CEMEA in areas such as Russia and Poland. ","The Discovery Channel, our most widely distributed network, expanded subscribers 10% internationally versus a year ago.","On the advertising front, we delivered double-digit ad growth across nearly all of our regions with particular strength in Western Europe and Latin America. The sustained advertising growth in the more mature markets of Western Europe was driven by success of our free-to-air initiatives such as Real Time in Italy and the launch of Discovery MAX in Spain as well as by the global growth of TLC with particular strength in the Nordic region.","Operating costs internationally were up 14%, excluding currency fluctuations, primarily driven by higher content amortization as well as by increased personnel and infrastructure costs due to additional investment in growth initiatives and to build out our global platform to support our long-term growth expectations.","Excluding the impact of foreign currency, our international segment delivered 20% adjusted OIBDA growth as our international team continued to generate strong revenue increases while thoughtfully investing in key growth initiatives.","As we look forward to the remainder of 2012, we are encouraged that the improved pricing and ad trends realized in the first quarter have continued through April, both domestically and internationally.","For the full year 2012, we are raising our revenue and adjusted OIBDA expectations to incorporate current conditions as well as the impact of the Amazon licensing agreement. We anticipate total revenues to now be between $4.55 billion and $4.65 billion and adjusted OIBDA to be between $2.125 and $2.2 billion. It is very important to note that we expect overall adjusted OIBDA growth in the mid-single digits for both the second and third quarters of this year due to the timing of certain expenses as well as the positive impact of the Netflix agreement in the third quarter of last year with a resumption to double-digit adjusted OIBDA growth in the fourth quarter.","We now anticipate net income of $1 billion to $1.1 billion reflecting the increase in the operating guidance, partially offset by higher expenses associated with the mark-to-market equity-based compensation as well as higher equity losses through the earlier-than-expected accounting change regarding now recognizing 100% of the OWN operating results through our equity income line.","Turning to our financial position. With a strong balance sheet that includes over $1 billion in cash and with sustained financial and operating performance, we continue to return capital to shareholders through execution of our share repurchase program. As David highlighted, our first priority remains investing in our core businesses to enhance shareholder returns and drive sustained long-term growth, be it through investment in existing networks and platforms or through exploring external initiatives.","To the extent we have not found sufficient opportunities with attractive financial returns, we've accelerated utilizing the cash on the balance sheet as well as cash generated from operations to repurchase shares. Discovery repurchased $288 million of the Class C shares during the first quarter and has, in total, bought back $1.4 billion under a share repurchase program. Overall, for the last 1.5 years, we have effectively bought back over 50 million shares, reducing the total outstanding share count by 13%.","Given the successful share repurchase activity to date, we are increasing our share repurchase authorization by an additional $1 billion in order to enable us to continue to thoughtfully repatriate capital to our shareholders. We will continue to operate our buyback program under a 10b5 plan this quarter, and shares will be purchased according to a predetermined grid with forecasted free cash flow per share governing our share repurchase activity. This metric, in essence, drive the IRR expectation on all current and future share repurchases.","That's it. Thanks again for your time, and now David and I will be happy to answer any of your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We got first question from line of Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","One for David and one for Andrew. David, I'd say most people would probably weigh in that Discovery has been very deliberate in thinking about licensing digitally, but we've had this debate during earnings so far between sort of Time Warner, Viacom and DISH calls, talking about how much content can move online before you start to impact potentially your value proposition to your distributors. I know you speak to your distributors on a regular basis and you've got some big renewals coming up as you enter 2013. So I'd hope you'd be willing to weigh in on how you're thinking about that balancing act to make sure you're maximizing your long-term value versus taking more of a short-term approach in how you gradually expanded your Netflix and Amazon relationships. And I just had a clarification for Andrew. The high-single digit ad growth sort of guidance or pacing for domestic, was that for the remainder of the year or for 2Q? I just wanted to make sure I heard it right.","David M. Zaslav","Okay, thanks, Ben. Let me talk about the digital opportunity. This really is a great time to be in the content business because we've created essentially a new window. We worked very hard to figure out what works for us. And for us, this new window being 18 months and older is significant. Because we use our content domestically and around the world during that window, and so giving it to Netflix and to Amazon where they have 18 months, 2 years, 3 years, 4-year-old content and getting real value for it has been significant in terms of the value it provides to us. As we look at what impact that has on our viewership to date, we haven't seen any impact on the viewership on our traditional channels. And part of that may be that we're only 6 months in. It's very early days. But it's also interesting that a lot of the shows that are being consumed on those platforms are shows that were -- they're no longer on Discovery or TLC or Animal Planet. And so we did keep the deals short so that we have some flexibility. Our Netflix deal was 2 years with 1-year option for us to go for a third. And that dovetails with our deals that come up, Ben, so that if there was a real problem, we could pivot. But so far, we see it as a real opportunity, an additional window that's providing significant value to us. In addition, we have TV Everywhere out there, which provides another opportunity for us to monetize our content. It hasn\u2019t materialized yet in a meaningful way, but it's an attractive platform that would be, if Netflix and Amazon and LOVEFiLM are -- if those platforms are 18 months and older from our perspective, then TV Everywhere would be more of a catch-up and provide some additional incremental value. And so, for us, we've been able to grow market share and take advantage of those platforms. So it's been a good experience so far.","Andrew C. Warren","Ben, regarding your question on ad sales, that's a 2Q number only. Given that's early May, we have good line of sight into 2Q, so that's a 2Q forecast only.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, and I know you said that the favorable conditions continue in 2Q, but that is at least, I guess, technically speaking a little bit of deceleration. Is that sort of conservatism or anything else you're seeing? I just wanted to see if those 2 comments together.","Andrew C. Warren","Well, look, the high single digits it's still a very good number. It's coming off last year's 13%. You still have several weeks or months plus of scatter to book, and ratings mix certainly impact that as well. So we feel good about that number. It's a solid high single-digit, so -- and again, it's coming off a big number last year.","Operator","Next question is from Doug Mitchelson from Deutsche Bank.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So David, I think what stood out this quarter was international. I'm curious how much Western Europe and the U.K. might have been a drag on international ad growth. As strong as ad growth was, could it have been even stronger if those marketplaces were healthier? And separately, I think TLC has been pretty impactful on your growth at International this past year. Do you have enough new networks and feeds in the pipeline that you see new growth drivers stepping in as TLC's growth cycles out?","David M. Zaslav","Thanks, Doug. The international business is really accelerating, and it's a number of things: one is the sub-growth that we're seeing and you see that on the affiliate side, but it also reflects itself in the overall reach, and therefore, viewership. So you see, Discovery's the #1 most distributed channel in the world and it grew 10% and our overall distribution grew 16%. So that's a helper. And just to give you a sense, Brazil grew 766,000 subscribers in the first quarter. That's more subscribers than the U.S. has added in -- between 3 and 4 years. So we're seeing real growth across Latin America, Russia, India and that's a helper. But more importantly is we've become a strong content company outside the U.S. and the strength of our brands are really resonating. So if you go into Latin America where we have, on average, 11 channels, we have 4 of the top 15 channels. We have Home & Health, which is essentially the Home and Garden of Latin America, and that's a top network for women. We have Discovery Kids, which is, in Brazil it's the #1 cable network in all of Brazil. It's the USA Network of Brazil, but it's strong throughout Latin America. Discovery, Animal Planet and we've launched TLC. And so you see us around the world building those channels. TLC now, all around the world, is a strong female network. Discovery getting stronger. Animal Planet getting stronger. And specifically, in Western Europe and the U.K., we've actually deployed -- it's specific to only a few markets, but in the U.K., we've been able to grow our overall market share by having a broadcast network there where we -- the cost to us is very low because we have our existing content. We also launched a broadcast network in Italy called Real Time, which is a female network, the equivalent of TLC, and that is now the #8 network in all of Italy, including the broadcasters. And so Western Europe and the U.K., for us, has not been a drag at all. We've been able to grow those markets because we've been able to significantly grow market share and take advantage of a robust advertising market. Although maybe not growing, we've gotten a bigger share. And when you look at India where we just launched our new Kids network or Latin America and Russia where we just launched an office and 2 more channels, we're finding that market share is probably 2\/3 of our growth and 1\/3 of it is the underlying jetstream of subscriber growth.","Operator","Next question comes from Jessica Reif Cohen, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jessica Reif Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Couple of questions on OWN. My recollection was that the first 2 years you pretty much gave the channel away to the Pay TV operators, and you just made a comment that sub fees really kick in next year. Can you talk a little bit about that and what we should expect on the affiliate fee side for a moment?","David M. Zaslav","Sure. Thanks, Jessica. First, I wanted to talk a little bit about what the real story is at OWN. There's been a lot of noise out there. And I wanted to give you my sense of the report card and where we are. When we started OWN, it had virtually no sub fees. We've added about 10 million subscribers, a number -- some of those subscribers will come on this year from Comcast. But the majority of the distributors have now signed up for substantial fees for OWN, and those will kick in on January 1. So what -- we've added 10 million subs, and we've put together a very strong subscriber fee structure. We have strong blue chip advertisers in place, supportive of what Oprah and I and Erik and Sheri are driving. The recipe of what we're doing there in terms of trying to find the right blend of content to nourish the audience is getting -- we're making real progress. We're, on average, about a top 30 network in March. We were the #27 network in America. Despite what you read, we're making real progress. We grew 14% in the first quarter. We're up 17% this quarter. And when you look at us from a standing start, 14 months, and I've launched a lot of networks, here we are 14 months later, we're beating 2\/3 of the existing networks in the U.S. And we're ahead of a number of women's networks that have been out there for 5 or 10 years and have been pushed and driven to nourish an audience, and we've gone by them. We've got a long way to go. I feel better about where we are than I ever have. We've done a lot of good work to get the cost structure in position. We're listening to the audience. Oprah's having a lot of fun. She's working very hard. And we said today on the call that we -- we're convinced that by the end of 2013, this business will be cash flow-positive. And we'll spend less money this year funding the business than we did last year. We're committed to the business. We think this has an opportunity to generate significant asset appreciation for us and for Oprah over the long term. We are a long term-driven company. We're growing assets like TLC around the world long term that's now accretive. ID, which was not making a lot of money for a long time, we invested in, we believed in it, now a top 10 network in America, the #4 network during the day. What we do is we build brands, we grow brands and what we see gives us a lot of confidence that this will be a significant asset for us.","Jessica Reif Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And along those lines -- my second question is really along the lines of what you just said. Given the growth you've seen in the last 5 or so, since you've gotten there, your channels are in a completely different place than they were. Can you help us think about, as your contracts come up over the next couple of years, what range we should be thinking about for affiliate fee growth? I mean you're kind of at the lower end now relative to your peers, what do you think the growth rate can get to over the next 1, 2, 3 years?","David M. Zaslav","Thanks, Jessica. Well, look, our core job is to become a stronger content company, which really means that we want people spending more time with our brands, more time with our channels and to feel more connected to the shows that we have and the characters that we have. And we've been doing that. We've been growing market share year after year. Our overall share of the cable viewership pie has grown significantly. We also have meaningful affinity groups around Science, around ID, around Discovery, around TLC. So we feel that we have a very good story. We were investing about $550 million in content when I got here. Today, we're investing over $1 billion in content. And so we have a very good story. Our deals come up beginning at the end of this year and they feather in between the end of this year and 2015. As we've said before, you'll see a steady flow there. It's not particularly lumpy. We don't have a ton coming up at the end of this year. But our goal is going to be to sit down and talk about the fact that our channels are stronger, and we think that we have a good hand. We think it's recognized by the distributors who are making more money selling our channels. And with the exception of OWN where we've done almost all those deals already, our other 12 channels come up all at once, which we think is a value to us. So we think we're going to do well, and we'll see over the next couple of years how we do, do.","Andrew C. Warren","And Jessica, it's Andy. Just to elaborate on that for a minute. As David said, the affiliate deals roll in over time. There are 3 up end of this year, so there's no impact in 2012. It should be a relatively small impact next year. While we feel very good about our position and our stance today, relatively small impact next year. And again, these roll in over the next several years.","David M. Zaslav","Primarily because the size of the distributors aren't the big ones this year.","Jessica Reif Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","One last thing. You made some SVOD deals in the U.S. What about International? How much of an opportunity is that?","David M. Zaslav","Which deals, Jessica?","Jessica Reif Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","The SVOD, Amazon, Netflix, et cetera.","David M. Zaslav","We've -- the U.S. is a mature market and carving out this window of 18 months and older has been -- we're very comfortable with at this point and we think it's working quite well for us. And so we're excited about having more and more players who want to play in that space in TV Everywhere. Outside the U.S. is really more of a country-by-country. It works -- it's much more effective in a mature market where you have viewers that have learned how to consume television in the traditional way and this becomes an add-on. So we're just going to see market-by-market. We own the content and we'll make the decision market-by-market.","Operator","We go to the next question. It's coming from Michael Nathanson from Nomura.","Michael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","I have 2 for Andy. One question will be the $50 million loss you had this quarter from other net, which is OWN, Hub. What would the number be? I know you've had some restructuring at OWN and some program write-downs, so what's kind of an ongoing number of that $50 million? So how can we think about if this was a normal quarter for the $50 million?","Andrew C. Warren","Yes, Michael, we're not going to quantify OWN specifically. I did say that this accounting nuance of our now picking up 100% of the operating losses relative to what we expected was a $10 million after-tax impact, so about $0.03 per share. So it is important just to describe that accounting nuance for a minute to answer the questions that some of you have had. When OWN started with contributed equity, as they ramp up and incur losses, those losses deplete their equity. The accounting nuance is that once their equity is fully depleted like it was in the first quarter, we, as the funding partner, have to pick up 100% of those losses and we will continue to do so, pick up their losses and eventual profits, until they get back into a positive equity position. So we will continue to talk about 100% of losses and profits going forward based on this accounting nuance. But we did have $50 million of other income losses in the quarter. It was predominantly OWN, but we're not going to quantify it specifically.","Michael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Can you just help us with the run rate then for the year of where do you get to for the whole year for that line?","Andrew C. Warren","Yes, it certainly will be less going forward. I mean, there was a -- it was an usual first quarter in that there was the Rosie write-off. There was the lot of restructuring costs associated with rightsizing their cost structure. So those were unusual events in the first quarter that added to that loss profile, but there will definitely be less losses going forward.","Michael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay, and then one question for you is reprogramming costs within the U.S. I know it's lumpy because of your write-downs last year, but what's a good way to think about the online program expense growth for the year and maybe the seasonality of that for the rest of the way?","Andrew C. Warren","Okay. Well, it clearly is higher in the first half. Basically, it's amort catch-up of prior year investments. I think it's important to look at what our cash was on content for the first quarter, that was up high single digits, so that's probably a better indicator of what that will look like going forward. But clearly, there's a bit of an amort catch-up here in the first half that will abate in the second half as we catch up on prior year investments on content.","Operator","We go next question from David Bank from RBC Capital Markets.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Two questions. I guess the first, a little bit of a follow-up on Oprah, David. You gave us a target, I think, a free cash flow breakeven, I think for middle of next year. And I was wondering if you could kind of give a little bit more commentary around profitability of the channel, expectation of when it's no longer a drag on earnings. And maybe to put some context around it, if you took the ratings and cost structure as they are today, right, and you layered in the affiliate fee increases that you sort of have contracted, but maybe not recognizing yet, would that be enough to basically get you to profitability? And the second question, Andy, sorry to make you go back to a year ago. But a year ago, in the second quarter, you guys, I think, had an $8 million nonrecurring benefit on the advertising side. And is that part of what's causing a drag on the pacing or is that x that impact? Well, not a drag, but is that impacting the pacing comp?","David M. Zaslav","Thanks, David. On OWN, I had said we're confident that in the second half of 2013 that it will turn cash flow positive. And I don't want to get into a lot of detail, but we have substantial fees, sub fees, coming in. We have good participation with advertisers. We have growing ratings. The channel right now is the #30 channel. We do not -- we're on plan, we're ahead of plan this past -- all throughout this year. And so the expectation here is not that the channel needs to morph into -- to find dramatic additional rating increases. We expect that it'll continue to improve based on the continued improvement that we'll be able to get to profitability when you count in the subscriber fees and the advertising, and we feel good about that. So I don't want to get into any more detail, but we're making a lot of progress. We're building an audience. On average, we have a weekly cume of about 15 million people coming into OWN. And based on the rating trends that we have right now, we're comfortable that we'll be -- that we'll make the turn in the second half.","Andrew C. Warren","And to answer your question on the $8 million. Yes, that does actually dilute our year-over-year growth rate. It is impactful to the second quarter last year. So yes, it impacts the growth rate.","Operator","The next question from the line of John Janedis from UBS.","John Janedis - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","David, you often talk about the opportunity at ID and the gap between the network and getting networks to similar ratings. With the ratings growth there that you're seeing, have you been able to close the gap, or is the network just growing so quickly that the gap's harder to close?","David M. Zaslav","Thanks, John. ID, I love to talk about ID because in my 25-plus years in the business, I haven't seen anything like it. I mean, if you look over the last 10 years, ID is now from a standing start of 4 years ago, top 10 network in America and the #4 network in daytime. And to answer your question, no. And we -- Joe and the team have done a very good job of beginning that journey of growing the CPM to monetize the ratings growth within ID. But it's probably going to take us another 2 to 3 years to that. It is improving. There's no question that the advertising community is recognizing that if they want to reach women during the day that ID is a fantastic vehicle. It has the largest length of view of any cable channel in the U.S. And the other thing that's really interesting about the ID growth trajectory is of the people in America that have ID, and that's in about 80 million homes, only 50% of them know they have it. Now that's up from 30% about 1.5 years ago or a year ago. But you will see growth from ID by -- you're seeing it by word-of-mouth. Have you seen this channel? You got to watch it. So we think we're going to continue to grow the overall audience. But more importantly, even if the audience was flat, we would see substantial growth for the next 2 or 3 years as Joe and the sales team get through this catch-up process of getting real full value for a very strong female service.","John Janedis - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And David, maybe on Destination America, can you talk a bit more about it? The content seems like it may have a lot broader appeal than maybe Planet Green. What kind of investments are you going to put in there? And is there an opportunity for broader distribution over time?","David M. Zaslav","Yes, we're going to start off small. We -- the great thing about Destination America is it was really generated through talking with advertisers, about how do we create a service that's more friendly. And if you look at our core strategy, we're about all -- within the U.S., we're about all of America. So TLC has become a top network for women by really servicing women in America, but primarily -- not New York and L.A., America. And a lot of Discovery, although it's broader based, does come from servicing all of America. And so Destination America is, we think, is within the sweet spot. The great thing about it is we have this huge library of content that will work very well under Destination America. It already is. We're up 30% by just changing the mix of content that we already own. So the investment will be small, but we expect that we're going to be able to do a success-based growth strategy where over the next couple of years, as it grows, we'll invest more money. But it will be small, and we think the results should be pretty good to start.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Spencer Wang, Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Spencer Wang - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Two questions. First, I just want to drill into the U.S. distribution revenue, I guess for Andy. So we take out the $50 million in the digital licensing revenues, the growth was about 4.7%. So we assume that there was a little bit of uplift from digital subscriber growth as the core affiliate rate growth per sub in the kind of 4% to 4.5% rate, so that's the first question. And then second on advertising in the upfront this year. Some of the online video providers like YouTube and Hulu and Vivo are making a more active push this year. Do you think online video for the upfront is incremental to the market, or do you think that marketers allocate some of what they spend from linear to online?","David M. Zaslav","Let me take the second one in terms of online video. It's too early to tell. There's a lot going on there. We made an acquisition. It was a small in terms of the overall economics for us, not material. But we acquired Revision3. One of the reasons we did is they had about 100 million streams viewed last month. And 100 million streams in a month is significant. It's not highly produced content. It's a different approach that we take. But we think that there may be something there. We don't know. We love the management team and so when you take our entire library and a small asset like Revision3, it allows us to be contemporary and play in that space and build some competency there. There's no sign that economics are moving there in any meaningful way. But we have to watch it, and that's why we set up some -- a camp there where we can play in that space and get to know the whole crew there. On the distributions side, let me pass it over to Andy.","Andrew C. Warren","So the affiliate number, the 5% was a combination of both digital rate and subscriber growth, say, about 4% of the total 5% was rate growth, though, in total.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Anthony DiClemente, Barclays.","Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I have 2. At the risk of putting too fine a point on your 25% constant currency international ad growth, you mentioned the subscriber growth of 10%. So I guess that leaves about 15% that's either coming from impressions per user or pricing. I'm wondering which of those 2 is a bigger driver.","David M. Zaslav","I would say it's probably pretty balanced. One of the things that you see when you saw our cost structure go up a little bit is that 4 years ago we were selling Pan-European and Pan-Asian. So we set out on the strategy of doing local sales in each market. In many of those markets, we have boots on the ground. But in certain markets, we just had an agency representing us. And so one of the things you've seen in terms of costs is we've taken over some of that. So I would say in terms of our ability to monetize our content, it varies region-by-region. But we were probably a C or a C- minus 5 years ago. Today, we're probably a B. In some markets, maybe a little bit better than that. But we're doing a better job of dealing with our -- the power ratio and getting our fair share, and some of that is because we set up our own operations in Russia, in each of the markets in Latin America, taking back as we get more scale, our own sales team. And of course, you look at markets like Brazil, it's 24% penetrated, Mexico, 36% penetrated. If you can remember back to the U.S., that not only is that broad CPM differential, but viewership on cable tends to cascade. As you hit that 30% and 35% penetration, more and more people start spending time on the cable platforms, so viewership on cable grows and the advertisers becomes more palatable for -- starts with a direct response. But given the price differential, advertisers start to move over. And so in the emerging markets, whether it be India, throughout Latin American and Russia, you're starting to see that as an additional wind.","Andrew C. Warren","And Anthony, just to add to what David said, the 16% number also benefited from the lower launching amort in the quarter. So it was actually about 11% in absolute growth, 15% when you include the lower amort.","Operator","We go to next question from Alexia Quadrani from JPMorgan.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Can you give us any color, I guess, how you're thinking about how additive TV Everywhere may be to your affiliate revenues when you renew some of those deals or even before? And just following up on your earlier questions, I guess on content, your digital deals for content, are you hearing any pushback from MSOs about these deals? And do you think it becomes sort of a bigger issue or an issue at all in your upcoming affiliate negotiation?","David M. Zaslav","Okay, thanks so much. On TV Everywhere, the good news is that we're in agreement with all of our distributors that in order to do TV Everywhere, we have to reach an agreement and at this point, we haven't reached a deal with anybody to provide TV Everywhere. We are supportive of TV Everywhere as a business model. It allows us -- pretty soon, we know that it's measured on the computer. It'll soon hopefully be measured on the iPad. And therefore, it becomes an advertising opportunity in order to maintain our overall viewership share. But we haven't reached a deal yet. And so we are supportive and the discussion now is about value, and we think the value is significant. And it will be over the next couple of months that we figure out between us and the distributors how to fairly parse that value and how that value could come to us, whether it be in terms of subscriber economics or additional distribution or -- there are a lot of different ways that we could exchange value for TV Everywhere. So we're encouraged by it. We hope that we can reach some deals over the next year. In terms of the content, we were pretty disciplined about the type of content that we put in and we carved out a very specific window, which is 18 months and older. Before we did the deal, we sat down with all of our distributors and talked about what we were doing. And so we didn't get a lot of pushback from providing this deal. I think part of it has to do with it may be different than others. Yet, we didn't put all of our best content on. We only put content that was 18 months and older. And if you look at it in the aggregate, most of the content is 2 and 3 years old. And so we don't think it'll have an impact. But having said that, given how fast the world changes and moves, we did keep the deals tight. So that if we find ourselves before our deals come up that, in some way, it does present a problem that we could -- we have an opportunity to readdress that issue. But at this point, we don't see that and we see the economics as incremental, which is a positive for us.","Operator","We got the next question from Richard Greenfield from BTIG.","Richard Greenfield - BTIG, LLC, Research Division","When you look at the benefit you're getting from the digital revenues, curious if there's some way you could put it into context. Do you get a sense -- I know it's been a couple quarters now for Netflix, how much viewership of your content do you think you're actually getting on these new platforms, specifically Netflix? Really, it's probably too early for Amazon. And how do you think that relates to the price you're generating from that content? Does it -- is it actually too much? Is it too little? And what are you getting in terms of early data? And then just quickly, if you x out the digital deals in this quarter, you did have a little bit of margin contraction. Could you just give as any more color on when we should expect to see that turn because of the costs? Will you expect that to turn in the third quarter, does that make sense?","David M. Zaslav","Thanks, Rich. First of all, the issue of -- Netflix and Amazon, we think, have created a great service to consumers where they can view content that they otherwise wouldn't be able to see and obviously because of the demand for it, consumers are enjoying it. From our perspective, and you won't be surprised by this, in the content business, I strongly believe that content drives all of those platforms. Whether it be -- I've talked about the deals that we did in the content business with Apple. As compelling as those platforms are or the devices, without the content, whether if it's a wire or a platform, I'm not going to say that it's a dumb pipe, but it is a device and without great content, it's just a device and the sexiness of it doesn't last. And so the value that we provide to Netflix, to Amazon or to TV Everywhere or to any of these or to Apple is to really, in the long term, drive the demand for those platforms. Because in the end, the way that you can manipulate whatever's on there is only fun if you want to consume the content that's on the platform. So we think that the value of our content is very high. It has been -- we have seen meaningful consumption. But it's been a surprise. Some of our best shows continue to be consumed primarily on traditional linear television and there are some older shows, some ones you would never expect where there's a lot of energy behind...","Richard Greenfield - BTIG, LLC, Research Division","Can you give us some examples?","David M. Zaslav","I don't want to get into detail, but there's a fair amount of viewership of shows that we're not even carrying and haven't carried for a while on our networks. And so I think it's very early days. Consumers are trying to decide how they want to use those platforms and different ways to consume. So for us, it's good. And we expect that over time, as long as there's competitive environment, that we'll be able to get good price for our content because our content is strong and it's demanded by consumers. On the margin piece, we've -- we did say all along that the first half would be -- we would spend more, whether it's on marketing for Frozen Planet or investing in TLC or ID and that it would -- the margins would grow in the second half, particularly in the fourth quarter, but let me pass it to Andy for a final.","Andrew C. Warren","That's right, Rich. The OIBDA margin was impacted by really 2 timing events: the catch-up on the content amort as well as what Dave said, the premiere of Frozen Planet and the marketing support of that. We definitely expect in the second half for the OIBDA margin to get back to normal levels.","Richard Greenfield - BTIG, LLC, Research Division","But is there any way to look at what organically margins did this quarter if you x out kind of the onetime events?","Andrew C. Warren","Really flat.","Operator","And now I would like to turn the call over to Craig Felenstein for the closing remarks. Go ahead.","Craig Felenstein","Sure. Thanks, everybody, for joining us.

Zaslav","Thanks, Craig. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us.","Discovery's strong financial and operational performance continued in the second quarter, as the company further capitalized on the organic growth initiatives we've been driving around the globe, while also beginning to take advantage of the opportunities provided by our recent strategic acquisitions.","The backbone of Discovery's success remains constant. Sustained investment in broad and diverse on-screen content, with great storytelling, compelling characters and real stakes is enabling us to capitalize on global ad opportunities and a growing demand for content across emerging pay-TV markets and new distribution platforms.","There's no question that consumers around the world are watching more video content than ever before, both on conventional television and through emerging distribution channels. With our sustained investment, global appeal, demographic reach and content ownership, Discovery is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this audience demand wherever it emerges on any platform in any market around the world.","The sustained financial results we are delivering are a testament to the targeted investment in content we have made over the last several years and reflect our ability to translate the larger audiences that we are generating into consistent ad gains.","This past quarter, we generated 13% total company organic ad growth, building on the double-digit growth we delivered in the first quarter of 2013.","Domestically, the ad market remains quite strong, with scatter pricing well above last year's upfront, and cancellations at very low levels.","When you combine this market strength with the 6% viewership growth we delivered in prime time among our key demographic, the result was double-digit domestic advertising growth during the second quarter.","Despite the noise surrounding cable channel ratings, when you look at the sustained success of our portfolio and the multiple new brands we have built, it is apparent that if you invest wisely and deliver high-quality content that is unique and engaging, you can grow your overall audience and deliver increasing value to advertiser and affiliate partners.","A great example of this was the phenomenal success of Skywire Live last month on Discovery.","Nik Wallenda's breath-taking walk across the Grand Canyon captivated audiences, highlighting how powerful Discovery's mission of showing compelling content that satisfies curiosity can be. Skywire was the most-watched show on cable for the entire quarter, drawing more than 13 million viewers, and it matched that success online where it generated over 2 million streams.","Not only did Skywire help drive Discovery Channel's ratings up 6% this past quarter, but it also served as a great platform for launching Naked and Afraid, the latest hit series on our flagship. Naked and Afraid aired immediately following Wallenda, and was Discovery's highest rated new series premiere of the year.","While Discovery Channel success this past quarter certainly helped drive our advertising growth, the biggest viewership gains among our network portfolio were in Animal Planet, which expanded its audience another 11% and delivered the best quarter in its history, led by the successful returns of River Monsters and Call of the Wildman, as well as the debut of the new hit show, Treehouse Masters.","Animal Planet is a brand we have carefully cultivated over the last 5 years, and it has now grown from a top 40 network to a top 20 network for men, delivering real value to advertisers.","Discovery and Animal Planet were not alone in ratings success this past quarter. TLC and ID were up 4% and 6%, respectively, in their key women 25-to-54 demo. And we also saw success from our emerging networks, including Destination America, which was up 16% year-on-year among adults 25 to 54; and Velocity, which increased 49% versus the second quarter a year ago.","The diverse ratings success we are delivering, along with the strength of our brands, put us in a great position heading into our upfront negotiations, where we were able to negotiate mid to high single-digit price increases, while generating the highest dollar volume in our history.","Equally as important, given the investment we have made in several of our younger networks and the viewership growth they are delivering, Joe Abruzzese's sales team, during the upfront, was able to garner higher volumes across these channels, as advertisers recognize the value and the significant opportunity that brands such as ID, Velocity and Destination America provide.","Looking ahead, with a strong upfront under our belts, ratings momentum across our portfolio and a scatter market that remains very healthy, we are confident that we can deliver sustained advertising growth going forward.","The ratings success we are enjoying across our domestic portfolio is not limited to our wholly-owned networks. The Hub delivered 32% growth this past quarter in Total Day among kids 2 to 11, its best quarter ever and its seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit growth.","At OWN, the addition of Tyler Perry's 2 new series has further accelerated the network's momentum. Tyler delivered 2 bona fide hits with the Haves and Have Nots and Love Thy Neighbor. And along with the success of returning favorites Our America with Lisa Ling, and new series Raising Whitley and Life With La Toya, led viewership gains of 39% in the second quarter among its key women 25-to-54 demo, the highest growth of any cable network in the second quarter.","OWN also became a top 20 network in June for women and is now a top 3 network with African-American women and #1 network for African-American women several nights a week.","That ratings success is translating into significant advertising growth, including signing over 30 new clients during this upfront and driving double-digit scatter pricing. As a result, I'm proud to report that when combined with the long-term affiliate fees that the channel has previously secured, OWN is now cash flow positive and starting to pay down the investment Discovery has made in the venture. This was ahead of the originally anticipated second half of the year goal of cash flow breakeven.","I want to congratulate Oprah and the entire team at OWN for this significant milestone, and we remain very bullish on its long-term trajectory and our ability to drive continued asset appreciation in the future.","The second quarter results for our domestic networks also highlight the value of our content across nonlinear platforms, as we began to recognize revenue from the third year of our Netflix agreement. Owning the vast majority of our programming provides us flexibility regarding when and how we monetize our content library. We remain platform agnostic with regards to distributing our programming and continue to explore additional opportunities to extract value by leveraging our expansive library, while protecting the existing pay-TV ecosystem.","While the growth and momentum across our domestic business continues, the biggest driver and the one with the most opportunity remains our businesses outside the United States. Our robust portfolio of 45 brands, 183 networks and 238 feeds across more than 220 countries and territories around the world provides a unique opportunity to capitalize on the continued penetration of pay television in the developing global advertising landscape.","On the distribution front, we continue to drive subscriber growth from the further evolution of pay-TV, especially in markets like Brazil, Mexico, India and Russia, where there is growing demand for content from the burgeoning middle class.","Overall, excluding the SBS acquisition, we expanded our subscriber base 12% versus the second quarter a year ago, which not only drove 14% organic affiliate revenue growth, but also was a significant contributor to the 21% organic ad growth we delivered this quarter.","Much like in the U.S., we are strategically investing in content to further capitalize on market opportunities and drive audience and advertising growth. We do this through broader partnerships with our domestic networks, investment in targeted local content and through development of original series from our experienced international production team.","We also continue to roll out several of our global brands into additional markets, by diligently capitalizing on opportunities that our existing broad distribution provides, such as expanding ID's reach into now over 160 countries or by further broadening the global distribution of our female flagship, TLC.","TLC is now in 164 countries and most recently launched in the U.K., where viewership has more than doubled since its rebrand last quarter.","As a result of the subscriber growth we are generating and a stronger content portfolio, we were able to grow viewership this past quarter over 20% globally, making us more and more attractive to advertisers. And this growth is not predicated on one market, rather we are delivering double-digit growth in every one of our regions.","I know there is some concern in the marketplace regarding ad trends in Western Europe. And while the market is certainly not robust, we have been able to continue to deliver better than double-digit ad growth due to our strategic programming initiatives. It is certainly difficult to predict how these markets will perform going forward, but we remain optimistic about our long-term growth prospects, given the strong double-digit increases we are delivering today, despite a relatively slow economic climate in many of the countries we operate in.","As we continue to invest in our organic growth initiatives, we are also beginning to take advantage of some of the synergy opportunities associated with our recent acquisitions.","The combined SBS Discovery Media business in the Nordic region has significant market share, including nearly 40% in Norway, 30% in Denmark and over 20% reach in Sweden. And we are just starting to scratch the surface of what that market strength provides. We have already integrated the sales teams and are beginning to explore joint sales opportunities to fully capitalize on the attractive consumer demographics these networks deliver.","On the cost side, we have acted quickly and carefully to reduce redundant positions and consolidate office locations where appropriate. We are also in the midst of a full content portfolio review to explore the opportunities to leverage program libraries across our suite of networks.","At the same time, we already have taken several steps to deliver on the opportunities associated with our 20% ownership interest in Eurosport Group, including creating a joint affiliate sales organization to utilize the local relationships Discovery has across Europe.","It's still very early days, but we are more confident than ever that these assets are a great complement to our organic growth story, further strengthening the unmatched platform Discovery has built up over the last 2 decades in helping to bolster our long-term growth outlook.","Overall, Discovery's second quarter results are very much a continuation of the strategic focus and financial execution we delivered throughout 2012 and into the first quarter of this year.","Discovery remains committed to building our diverse portfolio of brands, developing our global distribution platform and capitalizing on our strategic opportunities to best position ourselves for durable and sustained growth, while delivering strong financial results and returning capital to shareholders.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Andy.","Andrew C. Warren","Thanks, David, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. As David mentioned, Discovery continued to deliver strong operating results in the second quarter, as we've further executed upon our key strategic growth initiatives around the globe.","On a reported basis, total company revenue in the second quarter increased 30%, led by 61% international growth and 13% domestic growth. Please note that current quarter results include several newly acquired businesses and additional licensing revenue, primarily related to our deal with Netflix.","Excluding these items and the impact of foreign currency, total company revenue growth was 10%.","Total operating expenses on a reported basis increased 37%, primarily due to the inclusion of newly acquired businesses, as well as the expected higher content amortization and marketing spend during the quarter. Excluding the newly acquired businesses, the additional cost related to our Netflix agreement and the impact of foreign currency movements, total company expenses increased 15% versus the prior year.","As we indicated on our last earnings call, given the higher content amortization and the timing of marketing spending, it is anticipated that organic operating expense growth would be in the mid-teen range in the third quarter before abating in Q4.","On a reported basis, adjusted OIBDA in the second quarter increased 23%. Excluding newly acquired businesses, the licensing agreements impact and foreign exchange, Discovery's continued ability to generate revenue growth in excess of expenses as we continue to invest in future growth opportunities, translated into a 5% increase in adjusted OIBDA.","Net income from continuing operations increased to $300 million in the second quarter, driven by strong operating performance, partially offset by $54 million of higher tax expense and $19 million of increased interest expense associated with the debt we issued in March of this year.","It is important to note that SBS Nordic's contribution to net income was not material in the quarter as the OIBDA generated was mostly offset by higher purchase accounting amortization associated with the acquisition. The SBS purchase price allocation to amortizable trade names, distribution contracts, broadcast licenses and other assets would result in additional amortization expense in 2013 of about $130 million, with a similar amount anticipated in 2014.","Free cash flow increased 125% in the quarter to $311 million, as the improved operating performance and lower tax payments, primarily resulting from the extension of the accelerated content cost recovery under Section 181, were partially offset by higher content investment.","As David highlighted, the increased programming spend continues to pay off in terms of ratings momentum and higher advertising revenue, as we still expect content spending growth to slow down considerably for the full year, excluding newly acquired businesses.","While not part of our free cash flow, I do want to highlight that OWN was cash flow positive in the second quarter, well ahead of our previously anticipated time frame, and that the joint venture did begin to pay down its outstanding obligation to Discovery.","Now turning to the operating units. The U.S. Networks continued to perform well during the second quarter, with total reported domestic revenues up 13%, including 17% affiliate revenue growth, due in part to $37 million of additional licensing revenue in the quarter.","Much like when the Netflix agreement was originally executed in the third quarter of 2011, the current quarter includes a significant portion of the revenues from the third year of the agreement. Revenues recognized upon delivery of the content and titles already in Netflix's possession are now considered to be delivered for the third year. We anticipate additional revenue under this agreement in both the third and fourth quarters to deliver new titles under the agreement with full year total licensing revenue similar to 2012.","Excluding the additional licensing revenue in the current quarter, total domestic revenue increased 8%, with distribution revenue of 5%, predominantly from higher rates and to a lesser extent, additional digital subscribers.","The U.S. Networks ad sales team delivered another strong quarter of growth with advertising revenue up 10%, driven by higher delivery, most notably from Discovery Channel, Animal Planet and Destination America, as well as from higher pricing across all networks.","The current market trends continue to be encouraging, with double-digit scatter pricing above the gains we garnered during last year's upfront negotiations. And given the ratings momentum across many of our networks, we anticipate low double-digit ad growth in the third quarter of this year.","Turning to the cost side. Domestic operating expenses were up 17% from the second quarter of 2012, primarily due to higher content amortization associated with the increased cash spending on programming over the past 3 years, and additional marketing costs for series such as North America, Deadliest Catch and Skywire Live on Discovery, as well as Breaking Amish on TLC, and Call of the Wildman on Animal Planet.","The current quarter also included $5 million of additional content costs associated with the digital licensing agreements.","On a reported basis, domestic adjusted OIBDA increased 11% versus last year's second quarter. And excluding the impact of licensing agreements, adjusted OIBDA increased 3% year-on-year.","Turning to our international operations. Current quarter results reflect the impact of the newly acquired businesses: SBS Nordic, Switchover Media and Fatafeat, a pay-TV channel in the Middle East.","For comparability purposes, my following international comments will refer to the results, excluding these acquisitions.","Our international segment continues to deliver strong momentum across our global operations this past quarter, with revenues expanding 13%, led by 20% ad and 12% inflated growth.","Excluding the impact of exchange rates, total revenue growth was 14%, with advertising revenue increasing 21% and affiliate revenue up 14%.","The advertising revenue growth was broad based, with double-digit growth across every region, led by Western Europe, mainly from the continued success of several of our free-to-air initiatives, particularly in Italy and Spain.","On the affiliate front, the growth was driven by subscriber growth, especially in Latin America, from the continued growth in Brazil and Mexico, as well as by the consolidation of Discovery Japan.","Operating costs internationally were up 16%, excluding the currency impact, primarily driven by consolidation of Discovery Japan, as well as by higher content amortization and increased personnel costs, as we continue to expand our global footprint.","The international segment delivered 12% adjusted OIBDA growth in the second quarter, excluding foreign currency, as our international team continued to generate strong revenue increases, while thoughtfully investing in key long-term growth initiatives.","Turning to the remainder of 2013. We're encouraged by the sustained momentum across our portfolio and the continued strong ad sales trends, both domestically and internationally. We're updating our revenue and adjusted OIBDA guidance to reflect the continued operating momentum across our businesses and the impact of the SBS transaction closing over 1 month later than originally planned, as well as the additional foreign currency headwinds.","For the full year 2013, we now expect total revenues to be between $5.55 billion and $5.625 billion and adjusted OIBDA to be between $2.425 billion and $2.475 billion.","Importantly and as anticipated, we are also adjusting our net income guidance to reflect the impact of the SBS purchase price allocation. As I mentioned earlier, we expect $130 million of purchase price amortization expense related to the acquisition in the current year.","Our new net income guidance, including this amortization impact and an increase in stock compensation expense due to the appreciation in the stock price, is $1.1 billion to $1.15 billion for 2013.","Turning now to our financial position. With a strong balance sheet and sustained financial and operating momentum, we continue to return capital to shareholders through execution of our share repurchase program. As we discussed, our first priority remains investing in our core businesses to drive sustained, long-term growth, be it through investment in existing networks and platforms or through exploring external initiatives.","While that is our first priority, given the free cash flow we are generating, our gross leverage targets and the long-range free cash flow per share growth assumptions, we have the unique opportunity to continue returning capital to shareholders, as we also invest in our businesses.","During the second quarter, Discovery repurchased over $520 million of stock, and we still anticipate returning similar amounts of capital to shareholders through buybacks in 2013, and we did in 2012. Since we began buying back shares towards the end of 2010, we have spent over $3.6 billion buying back shares, reducing the outstanding share count by over 81 million shares or 19%.","Thanks, again, for your time this morning. And now David and I will be happy to answer any questions you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Jessica Reif Cohen from Merrill Lynch.","Jessica Reif Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Two questions, limit. The first question, I guess, is on international margins. They seem exceptionally strong, at least relative to our expectations despite the increased purchase price accounting and D&A. Could you just talk about the outlook for long-term margins? Is there still some upside there? And then I have a second question.","David M. Zaslav","Thanks, Jessica. First, sorry about the technical difficulty there. International is -- it's encouraging in that the strength continues. The markets really haven't rebounded in Western Europe, and yet we're still growing 20% there. If -- as we look at Latin America, subscriber growth is continuing. In Eastern Europe, we're seeing some strength, as well as in Asia. And so we found a way through the cost of content. We spent some more money in the last couple of years getting our sales teams in place and building some real infrastructure. And so now, we're -- of the incremental dollars we're seeing, a lot of that is coming to margin. Working against that is the SBS acquisition, which we've indicated to you is going to have -- will give us some margin pressure for another few quarters. But overall, if this kind of growth continues, you'll continue to see the margins grow. But they won't be as high as the U.S., where we can feed to 100 million homes much more efficiently. But Western Europe in the aggregate is as big or bigger than the U.S. alone, and so we see international as a big opportunity for us. And as I've said before, if we can grow like this, when 2\/3 of the countries we're dealing with are flat or in recession, we're not -- our expectation is not that those countries are going to turn. But if they did turn, you would see even more aggressive growth, and therefore, more aggressive margin expansion.","Jessica Reif Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And then the second kind of question or topic is on advertising, which was solid, as you guys said, across the board, I mean, double digits U.S. and international. How do you think you've done competitively? How would you compare? And can you give us any more specific color on second half?","David M. Zaslav","Sure. Well, first, the upfront, we head into the upfront, really, with some good ratings momentum. Our ratings were up in prime time about 6%. But more than that, we have brands that are really resonating with viewers. OWN now being the #1 or #2 or #3 for African-American women. We have Velocity really starting to build a viewership with men. Animal Planet was the #30 or #40 channel in America for many years. It's now a top 15 network. And so we have a lot of networks that are on the upswing. I think you'll see some additional growth because it's -- ideas in that category, Destination America. These are channels that over the next 3 years, even if viewership was flat, will get CPM growth because the viewership that we're delivering -- there's a catch-up. But we did well on the upfront. We saw a mid to high single-digit as well as volume increase. So I do think we're outperforming the market. Joe Abruzzese and his team are very strong. We did get volume and we did get a lot of new advertisers in a number of our -- the networks that we've launched over the last few years, which is -- whether it's 30 new advertisers in OWN, abroad, a slot of new advertisers in Velocity and Destination America, more in Science. And so it's not just the volume, it's the quality of advertisers. So domestically, we feel good. Internationally, last quarter, we were at 20. This quarter, we were at 21. The market is continuing, maybe even getting a little better outside the U.S. for us. And so on the advertising side, we feel good domestically and we feel maybe even a little bit better internationally.","Andrew C. Warren","And just to add, Jessica, to that for a second. For the third quarter, where our line of sight is obviously much, much better, we think we'll have low double-digit growth in the U.S. And for the fourth quarter, where today, cancellations and options are kind of at or below historical levels, we certainly have some good momentum there as well.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Doug Mitchelson from Deutsche Bank.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","David, I sort of wanted to follow up on that -- at that question looking a little bit longer term. You're very confident about the sustainability of international growth. Given the growth is being driven by ID and TLC expansions in free-to-air stations and a few markets, as those growth drivers expire, what's waiting in the wings to sustain growth internationally?","David M. Zaslav","Thanks, Doug. Well, first, we have been very effective in getting ID and TLC rolled out around the world. That was an objective of ours 2.5 years ago. And today, TLC is the most distributed women's brand in the world, over 165 countries, and ID is in over 160. But they've lapped themselves. So the growth that we're seeing now on ID and TLC is real, and it's an indication that crime is really working around the world. And in many of these markets, there hasn't been a strong women's network. So in Italy, we have a top 5 network for women, including the broadcasters there, and that network has been around now for over 2.5 years and continues to grow aggressively. And when we look at all of our free-to-air channels, we've lapped all of them. And so what you're seeing now is really core to our strategy. Now, we're investing more money in content. And we're doing it with confidence because we have a lot of returning series, and we're investing in brands that we think are resonating here in the U.S. and around the world. And so we're growing market share here in the U.S., about 6%. Outside the U.S., we grew market share over 20%. And again, that was pretty pure, and we feel like there's some meaningful momentum that we have in terms of our channels growing. And ads in the U.S., a lot of these channels that are 2, 2.5, 3 years old, we'll get the same kind of advertising lift as we're getting more and more on the agenda of the advertising market makers. Because in each case, it takes a few years. First, you want to have them come into your channel and then you get to drive up over a period of years the true CPM you should be getting.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Very helpful. And then one for Andy. The PP&A adjustments that drove the higher D&A, are those items that ultimately will require cash in the future? Or are those essentially noncash items related to the step-up in some asset values that don't require future capital?","Andrew C. Warren","Yes. No, they're all noncash and there's no future capital required.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. So and that D&A adjustment that we saw in the third -- in the second quarter, that's a good base of D&A to use going forward?","Andrew C. Warren","It is. It includes, Doug -- we've finalized the purchase accounting adjustments for SBS. And so when you go through the allocation, the purchase price, you allocate that value to both hard assets, like content and cash receivables; goodwill; and then the intangibles. And so that's the piece that we get amortized over time is the intangibles around distribution contracts, trade contracts, et cetera, that's the piece that now we've finalized and that's the piece that has about $130 million of amortization impact this year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Todd Juenger from Sanford C. Bernstein.","Todd Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Moving around the world, let me be the guy who maybe checks off the questions on domestic affiliate fees. I think you described them as up about 5%, I guess, on a core basis, year-over-year for the quarter. I know you don't give guidance on a line-item basis, but is that sort of emblematic of what we should expect for the rest of this calendar year until your next round of distribution renewals come through? And remind us when those start. I think over the course of next year, you get another 20% or so, is that correct?","Andrew C. Warren","That's right, Todd. We said that the negotiation is staggered. So roughly 20% a year starting in 2012 through the remaining 5 years is when you kind of have these renewals. We do expect this year about 5% a quarter. Because again, last year, we only did 20%. This year, we'll do another 20%, and that's at year end. So we think staggering would create roughly a 5% for this year.","Todd Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And just a quick follow-up for my second one on that. You mentioned in the press release a little bit about some distribution gains at your digital tier networks. Would love to hear whatever you'd be willing to provide on how much that contributes to the sort of 5% growth and how big a priority is that for you going forward. And should we expect maybe to see more of that roll through as part of your distribution expansion efforts?","David M. Zaslav","This quarter was quite small. But it's a freebie for us because with our 14 channels here in the U.S., we have deals that require the operators to launch all of our channels, non-analog channels, on digital when they distribute a digital box. We saw 2 or 3 years ago -- well, 4 years ago, when the economy was a little bit better that, that was -- there were significant growth. If the economy picks up, that will be a freebie, and we'll get some extra dollars because all of our channels get launched on digital when a new box rolls out. And for the rest of this year, you'll see some more Netflix come in. Netflix will be in the $75 million to $80 million, similar to what it was last year, only some of it came in so far. And last year, we did significantly less than 20%. So you're not seeing much of our new deal stuff, that will really kick in beginning next year. But yes, if, in fact, things picked up and there was more digital boxes deployed, that would be -- we'd be the immediate beneficiary of that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Bank from RBC Capital Markets.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Quick question, David, I'm wondering what your discussions with Mr. Abruzzese have been around the announcement of the Publicis-Omnicom merger, and the potential for sort of more concentration in the media buying area, and how you think that might sort of impact business.","David M. Zaslav","Sure. Well, look, I don't really think it's going to have an effect. We have a good relationship with both of those companies. Having them come together is probably a good thing for us. The focus is how strong are our brands and what kind of growth are we showing. 6.5 years ago, we were a little less than 4% of the viewership on cable. At this point now, we're more than 11%. And we have -- before, with the demographics that we were reaching, we're smaller. We have -- now, we have the #1 channel for Hispanic men with Discovery Espa\u00f1ol. We have a top -- we have 2 top networks for African-Americans, Oprah being at the very top and ID. The diversity of our audience is broader, and the reach of Discovery and TLC and Animal Planet are up. So I think as long as we continue to grow our audience, we're going to find that we're going to have a very receptive buyers, also because the marketplace is changing. The ability to reach a broad audience is more and more on cable. And so the 30% CPM differential -- 30%-plus that advertisers are paying for broadcast feels a little softer. And so it's one of the reasons why our volume picked up in the upfront. It's one of the reasons why we've been doing better in scatter, and I think if our market share continues to grow and the audiences that we can deliver, whether it be Wallenda, where we get 13 -- where we have the #1 cablecast of a show for last month, or whether it's Sunday night on TLC, we can deliver big numbers. The justification for the 30% to 35% discount to broadcast seems more challenged, and I think will attract more dollars.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I have one for David and a follow-up for Andy. David, could you talk about how the upfront results played out, particularly as it relates to some of your growing and more emerging digital networks, like ID, Velocity, Destination America? I would have assumed that given the growth there, you would have seen more of a shift out of what used to be DR into cash and that might have led to you selling more of your inventory across the portfolio in the upfront than you did last year. Wondered if you can comment on sort of the strategy and results there, if you could.","David M. Zaslav","Sure. Thanks, Ben. We sold about 55%, so it's pretty close to what we did last year, maybe a little bit more. The overall strategy was to get better advertisers into those brands so that they could see the value of it. The good news for us on Destination America and ID is they skew very female and very strong on the DR during the day. The real gain for us with these brands that are growing aggressively is to get the CPM up. And so we're not so keen to increase volume. We're much more keen, over the long term, to increase price. As a backstop, we do pretty well with DR, but we've been able to get that price up and we still think it's going to take us 2 to 3 years, but we would give up and we have in the last 1.5 years the option of taking more money and we've leaned toward getting more price. In the long term, if -- ID is the #5 network in daytime and late night and it's the #9 network in America. There's very, very significant upside for us, if we can get the CPM to where it should be, much more so than taking 10% more dollars at a lower price. And so we feel good about the fact that we're very successful in getting more quality advertisers spending time with those brands, and we think that's going to help accelerate the strategy of ultimately higher pricing and much more economics in those channels over the next few years.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And then, Andy, just 2 numbers or 2 lines on the financials I want to ask you about. One on the cash spending on programming, which I think was up 30% year-on-year. I didn't know if that was impacted by the acquisitions and sort of that's not a clean number or how we might want to think about that for the full year. And then on the affiliate revenue, is the slowdown from 6% to 5% from Q1 to Q2 x digital, is that just sort of noise? Or is anything you'd call out behind that deceleration?","Andrew C. Warren","Okay. Ben, on the first one, yes, that number is significantly impacted by the consolidation of predominantly SBS, but also Switchover Media. We do anticipate for the full year '13 our kind of apples-to-apples content spend to be up in the mid-single digits. So clearly, a lower run rate than we've had the last couple of years as the number of original hours and launching new channels is largely behind us. And so now we're at a different kind of run rate. So clearly, the SBS was a big impact there. On the 6% to 5% affiliate growth, it really is more of a one-off, onetime item there that drove that increase -- the decrease down to 5%.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rich Greenfield from BTIG.","Richard Greenfield - BTIG, LLC, Research Division","Couple questions. Investors are quite excited about the potential of consolidation in the cable sector, with John Malone kind of leading the charge very vocally. And their focus -- the investor focus is really on the significant programming cost synergies. The obvious implication for Discovery is that some of your deals could be reset lower. And I was just wondering how you think, as you go look out over the next couple of years, how you think about that risk of significant consolidation in the MVPD space. And then just a housekeeping question on your MVPD contracts, are you prevented from selling by your current deals to nonfacility-based players in the MVPD space like Intel?","David M. Zaslav","Thanks, Rich. First, our agreements are clean. We own all of our content, and we have a right to sell our content to anyone that we want to. I think that's probably, at least for the next few years and particularly now, there's probably never been a better time to be in the content business. That was an argument 4 or 5 years ago, in this tug-of-war between content and distribution, which one is going to be more successful. I think as you look at the dollars that have moved into content and the successful -- and the success that content players have had with distribution, I think you have to say that distribution has been a must-have. And so for us, at least, with Amazon and Netflix on the SVOD with TV Everywhere, which the cable guys want, along with the fact that this is a very competitive market, you have 2 satellite guys, 2 phone guys and a cable guy, I think if there is -- there very well may be consolidation, although there already has been, there may be more consolidation. But we think we'll be able to continue to get significant -- do very well and get significant increases. A big piece of it is, how are we doing? How are the channels doing? Are more people spending more time with your channels? And the people that have your channels, do they feel activated by it? Do they feel emotionally connected to the channels? And so that's the journey we've been on. We are up to 11% of viewership on cable from a little less than 4% several years ago. But more importantly, we have activated people that love science. Discovery is still the #1 most valued brand on cable, and that's from the cable operators survey this year themselves. And so with our brand stronger, our reach larger and the fact that there's a competitive market, I think you'll see us continuing to do better. Some of these additional sales of content are incremental to us and very high margin, if not dropping all to the bottom line because we own all of our content. And to the extent that there is an Intel or there is over-the-top players that end up coming into the space, we are platform agnostic. And if the business plan -- the business model works, it's just somebody else bidding up for the ability to offer our content to viewers, so that's a good thing.","Richard Greenfield - BTIG, LLC, Research Division","And just a quick question for Andy. What is the total OWN liability currently before -- in terms of what's left after what was ever paid back this quarter?","Andrew C. Warren","$509 million.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of John Janedis from UBS.","John Janedis - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","David, there's been talk, broadly speaking, about a slowdown and maybe some issues in Latin America. Your comment suggests it's still pretty strong. At this point, are you concerned about the trajectory of pay-TV penetration and growth? And how does the ad environment look?","David M. Zaslav","It really depends by region. A lot of Western Europe looks a lot like the U.S. The U.K. looks a lot like the U.S. There's a lot of -- pretty flat. But then there are a number of markets like Russia where there's only 35% penetration, where there's very substantial growth and HD is first rolling out. There's an overall aggressive pitch to the C class in Latin America, which is providing -- still providing a lot of growth. Mexico is still only 42% penetrated, Brazil only 26% penetrated. In Asia, we're seeing a significant amount of growth in India. So it's a mixed bag. But in the aggregate, we grew our sub base, just the pure sub base, 12% from a year ago. And so we still see very significant growth. And in some countries, it feels a lot like the U.S. did 10 years ago, where we're seeing sub growth, advertising growth, CPM growth and viewership growth. And so those are the markets like Brazil, like Mexico, like Russia where you -- where it's very attractive.","John Janedis - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So speaking of CPM, so I think we all tend to focus, as you know, on the gap between the U.S. broadcast and cable. You talked about the global ad opportunities. Can you talk about any CPM gap dynamic in Europe? And to what extent you're able to benefit, given the weak macro?","David M. Zaslav","It's massive. What you find in a lot of the markets is that there's 2 or 3 broadcast players that dominate the market. Now this isn't true of all, but in a number of markets. When you go to Europe, you hear power ratio everywhere you go. And you're looking at this formula of the value that you're getting. Here, we're discounted by 30% or 35%. There, we may be discounted by 70% or 75%. If you look at the overall -- one of the things that made SBS so attractive to us is that we had this huge power ratio deficit in all those markets by just being a cable player that had 5% share. So by doing that deal with SBS and emerging in Norway with 40% share or in Denmark with 36% share, we get the piggyback on their power ratio. So that's why we've formed the joint sales team there, which we're starting to do now. And our view is we can go out with all of our packages together. They're getting much more dollars for their cable networks, even ones that were getting lower ratings than ours. And so the package together gives us that lift. And as our market share grows, we continue to eat away at that power ratio issue. And finally, as cable becomes gestationally more attractive because the younger generation is spending more time watching cable versus broadcast, you see that phenomenon. It's slower, but you see what happened here in the U.S. That when you want to reach younger viewers in the 18 to 30 group throughout Europe, then cable becomes more attractive, and maybe you have a little bit more leverage to drive pricing.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Anthony DiClemente from Barclays.","Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I hope you can hear me. Just one clarification, I wanted to make sure I understood. Will the amortization you spoke of go away next year and start to taper? Or is it a similar amount in '14 as it was in '13? And then I have a quick follow-up.","Andrew C. Warren","The amortization does taper off a little bit next year and in following years. But the amortization, that intangible for SBS, goes out several years. So it's about $40-plus million a quarter this year and a little over $30 million a quarter next year. So you do see a little bit of tapering, but it's still has a meaningful amount of amortization for the next several years.","Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, great. And then a question for David on SVOD -- or first off, I guess for Andy. Does your guidance imply or include the prospect for any new SVOD deals besides Netflix and Amazon for 2013? We assume it does not. And then for David on SVOD, just wondering if you could talk about the strategy or strategies of the players out there shifting around a little bit. For example, Netflix going to more exclusivity of shows. And as you look at that and as you look at potential new players in that space, how does that change how you think about SVOD and the distribution of your content in those windows?","Andrew C. Warren","Yes. The SVOD number for this year does not include any new deals. It only is deals that have already been completed or extended.","David M. Zaslav","So if we did a deal, we wouldn't have [ph] done a deal yet with Hulu...","Andrew C. Warren","That would be all incremental.","David M. Zaslav","So Anthony, I think the -- from our perspective, there's pretty good alignment in how we run the cable business and then how we approach these different windows, which is the more quality shows we have with great characters, the better our storytelling, the more people are going to be spending more time with our channels, the more valuable we're going to be in the SVOD universe, in the TV Everywhere universe and in the long tail of our library. So the fact that Discovery now has a big hit in Naked and Afraid on Sunday night and a big hit with Fast N' Loud and Deadliest Catch last night did over a 2 2 and won the night, including beating the broadcasters in the male demo. All of that, I think, is good. On TLC with Honey Boo Boo and Long Island Medium and Breaking Amish or great shows on Oprah with Tyler having 2 big hits on Tuesday night, being a top 5 network for women with the Haves and Have Nots. All of that, I think, helps us when we sit down with cable operators and it helps us when we sit down with Reed or with Amazon and they say, \"Okay, what do you got?\" And so the more shows that we have that people are spending more time with, I think the better our hand. And we have more shows now that have a story arc, which I think helps us. To the extent that we're building shows like Gold Rush, Breaking Amish, those are shows that have a longer story arc and it's way too early to tell. But so far, we haven't seen any degradation in audience from content that we've given to the SVOD window. And we're starting to think that the story arc shows on that platform may actually help viewership of the new seasons when they come out. And so it is something that we think about that maybe these story arc shows can be creating more value for us. But I do think bigger hits that have more traction with viewers and bigger characters that the viewers love are important, and that's -- we're moving in that direction and having some success.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alexia Quadrani from JPMorgan.","Caroline C. Anastasi - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","This is Caroline Anastasi for Alexia. Can you just talk a bit more about the demand you saw on your upfront deals and whether certain categories stood out or whether strength was broad based? And secondly, can you give us a sense of how much of the domestic ad strength you're seeing this quarter reflects a bit of a catch-up from last year's Olympic comp?","Andrew C. Warren","Sure. The overall demand was broad based. I mean, there's particular success in financial, pharmaceutical, insurance had strength. But really the strength in the demand was broad based, which allowed us, as David said, to not only allocate dollars across the different platforms, but drive some good CPM growth. The next question was? What was your second question again?","Caroline C. Anastasi - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just how much of the domestic ad strength you're seeing this quarter reflects catch-up from last year's Olympic comp.","Andrew C. Warren","Yes. It's a little bit of it. I mean, clearly, we're seeing some strong strength in scatter. It's still 20% above what we garnered in the upfront last year. And so while there's a little bit of an improvement based on the Olympics last year, this low double digits that we've highlighted for the third quarter is a little bit of that, but mostly just strong ratings, strong CPM and overall momentum of the overall sales.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alan Gould from Evercore Partners.","Alan S. Gould - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","I've got 2 questions. First, David, with respect to that 30% to 35% cable-broadcast CPM differential, we've been hearing about this for years. What was that differential a few years ago? And what's going to make that change now -- what's going to make that start changing? And then secondly, following up on Rich's question. If there is consolidation in the domestic distribution companies, do your affiliate fees contractually drop to the lower rate immediately after those mergers are completed?","David M. Zaslav","Thanks, Alan. It was in the 40% to 42% range a few years ago. And so it's now in the 30% to 35% range. You're seeing more and more. I think Josh at AMC has done a great job. FX has done a great job. I think we've done a great job. Almost across the board, Turner, we're all finding major audiences, which chips away at that mindset that the way to reach a big audience is broadcast. So I think it's just going to take time. I think we make progress in every upfront. The fact that we can get mid to high single-digit CPM increase and drive -- and get more volume is, that's sort of a way of saying that we're chipping away at that. So I think it's going to take some time.","Alan S. Gould - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. And on the consolidation question?","David M. Zaslav","It really depends. It depends on how the agreements are written. So sometimes on acquisition, they would pick up -- if the bigger guy has a lower rate, they'd pick it up. And sometimes, they don't, depending on how the agreement is written.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bernard Crocket, Lazard Capital Markets.","Barton E. Crockett - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","It's Barton Crockett from Lazard. I was wondering about the margin trends. So in the U.S., organic EBITDA was up 3% on what was very healthy ad growth. Internationally, you had good double-digit growth, but your EBITDA grew a little bit less than that. Looking longer term in your business, what kind of revenue growth do you really need to get margin expansion? I mean, you'd think that these levels would get you there, but you didn't get there this quarter. So how should we think about this longer term?","David M. Zaslav","Well, first, strategically, we've been very clear. We were spending, 7 years ago, $500 million on content. This year, it's $1.5 billion. Our strategy is we're going to invest in content. We are very local outside the U.S. And we started out where we did, we had people selling our advertising. When that happens, you have to give them an agency fee, and you get packaged with a number of other programmers. And so our strategy, and you see that cost escalation, has been that we've been spending more money on content and we've been spending more money on getting boots on the ground. We're starting to see the real benefit of that in terms of getting better at selling advertising and being able to get the benefit of our -- the value. And on the content side, you're going to see that abate significantly, that additional investment. And part of that has to do with the fact that as we've talked about before, as you're building brands, you're trying a whole bunch of different shows, as you have more and more shows returning. That's true on Discovery. It's true on Animal Planet. It's true on TLC. It's true on ID. That the amount of new shows you have to try to get a show to be successful drops, and so we think we're going to be able to abate that, and therefore, start to -- having cost come down and margin start to grow. Andy?","Andrew C. Warren","Yes. Barton, just to add 2 comments to that. The -- for the second quarter, we had this high amortization. And even though, as I said, the content spending growth for this year will be kind of mid-single digits, so you'll certainly see the amortization come down over time. And so most importantly, you'll see our incremental margin on profit growth and revenue growth in the future will be much higher. So we have a bit of this anomaly now of an amort catch-up based on productive and successful content spending the last couple of years. But as that content spending abates, and as I said, this year being mid-single digits, you'll see the expense come down, and therefore, we'll have a much higher uptick on the incremental margin for additional dollars, particularly internationally.","Barton E. Crockett - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","And then if I could ask one last question. The equity in JV, that number at minus $7 million in this quarter versus minus $6 million in the year ago, I would have thought that the improvements in OWN would have driven some improvement in that line year-over-year. But we didn't see it. I was wondering if you could explain what happened there. And also from an accounting perspective, I think you're -- we're accruing 100% of the OWN results for a while. That might change as they start to kind of -- recoup your losses in excess of your cost base. So how do we see the accounting changing there over the next few quarters?","Andrew C. Warren","Yes. Well, look, most importantly for OWN, as we know, they did in the second quarter way ahead of schedule, actually have a net paydown of debt and positive cash flow. OWN has a similar situation we have, where there's a higher amount of amortization, and that impacts their net income line, which is what we pick up. So you'll definitely see a positive earnings out of OWN in the second half of this year. And so we'll have that positive equity pickup on our line, as well as continued paydown of debt in the second half as well. So the OWN story continues to evolve, and we definitely see a positive momentum and more importantly, some big second half numbers.","Craig Felenstein","Thank you, everybody, for joining us today, and please give us a call with any follow-up questions in the office.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.","I would now like to the turn the conference over to Jackie Burka, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.","Jackie Burka - Vice President-Investor Relations","Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for Discovery Communications' first quarter 2016 Conference Call. Joining me today are David Zaslav, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Andy Warren, our Chief Financial Officer. You should have received our earnings release, but if not, feel free access it on our website at www.discoverycommunications.com.","On today's call, we will begin with some opening comments from David and Andy and then we will open up the call for your questions. Please keep to one question so we can accommodate as many people as possible.","Before we start, I would like to remind you that comments today regarding the company's future business plans, prospects and financial performance are forward-looking statements that we make pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are made based on management's current knowledge and assumptions about future events, and they involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations.

Zaslav - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'm pleased about Discovery's operating and financial momentum, with current trends in the U.S. particularly strong and international investments driving new value across our portfolio. While we continue to face certain secular and economic challenges in various markets around the world, we are evolving in a consumer video marketplace with 7 billion worldwide screens and are optimistic about our global growth profile in the more than 220 markets.","As Andy will discuss in more detail, we are focused on spending more on growth, in content and in direct-to-consumer platforms while relentlessly driving down cost growth in all non-content cost areas. If it is not going to nourish audiences or help us grow long term, we are attacking it. As a result, I'm pleased to announce today that we will have real constant currency margin expansion for the full 2016 year.","The ultimate goal is to maximize growth. First and foremost, in our linear TV business, while aggressively pursuing new opportunities to diversify and strengthen our content and bring it to more screens and more people around the world. These cost savings will allow us to continue growing our business by focusing our investment in four key areas: more investment in content, more investment in our international growth markets, more investment in digital services and OTT products, and more investment in sports.","Our expansion into sports is well underway with Eurosport. We have been on a journey to revitalize the brand with locally relevant sports rights and programming. And we are realizing the potential of this cash flow positive business and we're starting to see meaningful results, including double-digit growth all across Europe. And we're leveraging the power of sports programming by driving meaningful affiliate value across our whole portfolio, which you will see grow further in the years ahead.","In addition, the Eurosport Player is generating value by offering a deeper, more immersive experience all across Europe. It's a separate offering with unique content from what we have on our Eurosport channels all across Europe. Tennis fanatics were able to watch up to 16 courts at the Australian Open. And at the beginning of the year, SQUASHTV launched as a dedicated channel on Eurosport Player with 500 hours of squash action a year.","Our distinct digital offering allows us to have a direct economic relationship with viewers and gives us an opportunity to go deeper into the sports they love. It's a richer, different value proposition from all linear channels. In the first quarter, subscription growth increased double-digits versus last year, proving Eurosport's content and brand power is a multi-screen opportunity for us.","We continue to monetize our Olympics investment by signing sub-licensing deals in The Netherlands and Finland, which followed our deal with the BBC in the UK. These agreements significantly exceeded our plan. We have retained all rights to the Olympics on all platforms so that we could pursue incremental value and deals on mobile, on social media with players like Facebook Live and Twitter or going direct to consumer on our Eurosport app. The Olympics will not only be profitable, but based on the deals that we've done already, we expect the Olympics will make real money for us on each of the games.","Moving on to our entire international portfolio. Our international average audience was up over 5%, driven by worldwide viewership strength from Discovery Channel, especially in Russia, Brazil and Mexico, and strong performances from our female networks in Latin America. And Germany also enjoyed strong double-digit growth, driven by TLC and DMAX. Across all of our international markets, we are getting good value for our portfolio of global brands and sports, and the momentum remains strong with recent renewals.","As I mentioned last quarter, we pulled our channels in the Nordics to Telenor subscribers as we stood up for the value of our content. And we were able to win significant increases in our renewal and lock in long-term growth. We believe in the value of our content and we will continue to stand up and fight for the value.","Looking at our U.S. portfolio, we had another quarter of very strong results. We are extremely pleased with our current domestic trends, and ad growth remains solid as we head into the second quarter and the upfront. Discovery Channel had its second highest rated quarter ever in primetime with eight of the top 10 unscripted shows on cable, including Gold Rush, Fast N' Loud, and Alaska Bush People ranked one, two and three. ID was the number two network for women, and had its best quarter ever in primetime. Velocity had its highest delivering quarter ever, and Science its highest rated quarter ever.","And starting next month, we welcome back Patrice Andrews, who was most recently with ITV and A&E, as the new General Manager of Animal Planet. Patrice is a fantastic storyteller and a great creative leader. She'll be a big help to driving the value of Animal Planet.","Beyond traditional pay TV distribution, people want access to our brands and content across all screens. As we own most of our IP, we are driving our digital strategy and making progress in diversifying how and where we reach consumers, particularly younger viewers. Across all these efforts, we are building audiences, learning consumption habits, and expanding monetization models.","Part of our digital strategy is to add value to pay TV subscribers through our own TV Everywhere products, such as Discovery GO in the U.S., Discovery Kids Play in Latin America, and by extending the availability of our content through distributor TV Everywhere products. It's very early days for Discovery GO, but we are pleased with our initial results. The platform is clearly appealing to a younger audience as 50% of our visitors are in the 18-to-34 demo, and we are selling CPMs at a significant premium, highlighting the appeal of our long-form content in the digital space.","Second, we continue engaging millennials and younger audiences with Discovery Digital Networks. Today we average more than 300 million streams each month and we are now focusing our web-native efforts under two key brands that are resonating with advertisers and with users: Seeker and SourceFed.","Over the last two years, we have drilled down and developed the best-in-class virtual reality content. The Discovery virtual reality app has over 30 million views in the last few months. And we have developed over a hundred pieces of virtual reality content with a new offering every week. We're very excited about the possibilities to immerse audiences in new story formats and create meaningful opportunities for advertisers. As content gets closer to real, our content brands move to the top of the heap.","Finally, we're focusing on delivering for superfans with select direct-to-consumer offerings. In Europe, the Eurosport Player and Dplay exemplify our aim to grow audiences across platforms and continue to provide captivating exclusive content across more screens than ever before. And we recently took a minority stake in RugbyPass, the definitive OTT product for rugby fans in 23 markets in Asia. Across all these efforts, we are learning viewing habits and amassing data on how best to reach consumers across all screens.","As we begin another year, Discovery is well-positioned to broaden our reach and relevance with our audiences. We end the quarter with a lot of optimism. Our U.S. business is a real meaningful growth business, even given small subscriber universe declines. And as a company, worldwide 50% of our revenues come from long-cycle distribution agreements with strong contractual growth rates.","In our international business, we've turned the corner on currency and are now starting to realize some tailwinds that could grow stronger in the months and years ahead. And we're investing in the growth areas for the future. We are confident in the long-term growth profile of the company and our ability to create sustainable shareholder value.","I will now turn the call over to Andy for details of our financial results.","Andrew C. Warren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP","Thanks, David, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Before I review our first quarter results, I want to highlight a few very important and positive updates regarding our 2016 guidance. As David mentioned, we are now committing to total company constant currency margin expansion for the year. We want to ensure that we position Discovery for growth in both existing and new areas and continue to embrace change to drive innovation across the company.","As the industry evolves, we will continue to evolve with it. We have consistently highlighted our flexible cost structures and the fact that we own or control most of our own content across all global platforms as two of our most critical competitive advantages. And these advantages are allowing us to maximize our profit growth while taking advantage of new opportunities as the media ecosystem evolves.","As a company, we have for several years now taken a very hard look at our cost structures and continue to see and realize opportunities to become leaner while freeing up dollars to continue investing in new platforms like mobile and OTT. Spending on global content and IP will always be our priority. We're focused on managing down growth and all other cost areas to ensure that our constant currency revenues will grow faster than our constant currency costs.","Our 2016 SG&A cost productivity has been much better than planned. You may have seen yesterday that we filed an 8-K, specifying additional personnel-related cost reduction initiatives that will yield cost benefits in the second half of 2016 as well as full year 2017. We remain highly focused on paring back cost growth in non-content expense areas and reallocating traditional linear business costs to new media platforms and content development around the globe, such as mobile, short-form video, sports, and direct-to-consumer initiatives.","As a result of this commitment to margin expansion as well as our better-than-planned U.S. ad sales performance to-date, we are also raising our 2016 adjusted EPS and free cash flow guidance to being up at least high teens on a constant currency basis. With our first quarter constant currency margins up almost 100 basis points, adjusted OIBDA ex-FX up 7% and adjusted EPS ex-FX up 18%, we're off to a very strong start to the year.","In addition, with the U.S. dollar softening year-to-date, currency headwinds have begun to subside and are meaningfully better for 2016 than we quantified on our year-end call. More on this later.","Now let's talk about our first quarter results in more detail. Reported revenues and adjusted OIBDA were both up 2%. Excluding currency impacts, revenues were up 5% and adjusted OIBDA was up 7%. On an organic basis, so excluding the impact of foreign currency as well as prior-year contributions from SBS Radio, which we sold on June 30, 2015, total company revenues and adjusted OIBDA both grew 7%.","Net income available to Discovery Communications of $263 million was up 5% from the first quarter a year ago, primarily driven by improved operating performance, a lower effective tax rate, and a gain from the SBS Radio sale, partially offset by higher stock-based compensation, and a decline in income from equity investees. We were able to lower our effective tax rate by another 400 basis points from the full year 2015 rate to 29% this quarter.","Earnings per diluted share for the first quarter was $0.42, 14% above the first quarter a year ago. Adjusted earnings per diluted share, a more relevant metric from a comparability perspective as it excludes the impact from acquisition-related non-cash amortization of intangible assets, was $0.46, a 10% improvement versus 1Q 2015. Excluding currency impacts, adjusted EPS was up 18% for the quarter and was up 11% for the last 12-month period over the prior 12-month period.","First quarter free cash flow increased 62% as improved operating performance and lower cash taxes were partially offset by higher content spend. First quarter free cash flow growth, excluding currency effects, was strong and increased 53% for the last 12-month period compared to the prior 12 months.","Turning to the operating units. Our U.S. Networks had a spectacular quarter with total revenues up 8%, led by 8% distribution growth and 7% advertising growth, and adjusted OIBDA was up a very impressive 11%. Our 7% advertising growth, which accelerated from 5% in the prior quarter, was due to higher pricing and proactively managing and monetizing our inventory to take advantage of the strong demand in a scatter market, offsetting lower delivery. The ad market currently remains quite healthy; and looking ahead to the second quarter, we expect advertising revenues to have another strong quarter, with the second quarter's year-over-year growth similar to that of our first quarter.","Our domestic distribution revenues were up 8% while total portfolio sub again declined by about 1% versus the first quarter of last year. We continue to benefit from the higher rates we garnered from our recent deals, including our most recent deal with Comcast, which went into effect on January 1.","Turning to the cost side, operating expenses in the quarter were up 3%, cost of revenues were up 7% while SG&A declined 4% due primarily to lower personnel expenses. Our focus on controlling base costs led to impressive domestic adjusted OIBDA growth of 11% with margins expanding by almost 200 basis points to 59%.","As we look ahead to the rest of the year, U.S. cost growth in the second quarter is expected to rise at a slightly faster rate than the first quarter as we increase marketing spend, partially due to an earlier Shark Week, which starts on June 26, and then expense growth will abate again in the second half of this year.","Turning now to international operations. Excluding currency, revenues increased 3% and adjusted OIBDA decreased 2% as changes in currency mix reduced revenue growth by 6% and adjusted OIBDA growth by 12%. For comparability purposes, my following international comment will refer to our organic results only, so we'll exclude the impacts of foreign exchange and the previously mentioned SBS Radio sale.","International organic revenues increased 7% and adjusted OIBDA declined 2% for the first quarter of 2016. The 7% first quarter revenue growth was comprised of 12% distribution growth and 4% advertising growth. Our 12% affiliate revenue growth was due to higher affiliate rates in Eastern and Northern Europe where we've been successful in leveraging our expanded content portfolio that now includes sports to drive higher contracted pricing increases, increased subscribers in Latin America, as well as contributions from Eurosport France, which was not consolidated until the second quarter of last year. Excluding Eurosport France, affiliate revenues were up high single-digits. Going forward, we still expect organic distribution growth to remain in the high single digit-range for the rest of 2016.","Turning to our first quarter international advertising results. While we benefited from higher pricing and delivery in Southern Europe and higher volumes in Central Europe, growth in these markets was partially offset by declines in Northern Europe, our largest advertising region. Northern Europe was impacted by the February Telenor blackout in the Nordics that we highlighted on our year-end call, an overall softness in the UK and Nordic markets due to macro factors and lower ratings across the region, especially at our female skewing networks.","While the Telenor blackout did have a negative impact beyond the 10 days we were dark as advertisers shifted their money elsewhere due to the uncertainty around our contract renewal, our standing up for the value of our content paid off as the long-term economic upside from the new deal is significantly greater than the temporary advertising losses incurred while going dark.","Excluding the impact from the Telenor blackout, first quarter international advertising revenue increased 7%. We're delivering on our promise that the investments we're making in content and brands will drive sustained global affiliate growth and this very positive Telenor deal outcome supports this thesis.","Another factor that impacted our first quarter ad results and will continue to affect results for the rest of the year is a shift in the Middle East where we are pivoting from a free-to-air model to a pay TV model. As part of our exclusive content deal with two key affiliate partners, we have locked in long-term affiliate fees, which enhance our OIBDA but shift ad revenue to affiliate revenue.","Our international ad sales is currently trending at high single to low double-digits, but we do expect the ad growth to accelerate to low double-digits in the second half of the year. Second half growth will be led by increases in the UK as we expect pricing and ad market pressures to ease post the Euro championships and the June 23 Brexit vote as well as continued strong growth in Latin America, Eastern Europe, and Southern Europe.","Turning to the cost side, operating expenses internationally grew 11% in the first quarter, primarily due to higher content amortization as well as costs associated with Eurosport France, and adjusted OIBDA declined 2%. Looking ahead, it is very important to note that cost growth and therefore adjusted OIBDA growth will be lumpy on a quarterly basis, mostly driven by the timing of sporting events.","We currently expect second quarter organic expense growth to be similar to that of the first quarter. Cost growth will then significantly moderate in the back half of the year to being up mid single-digits as we're able to more fully leverage our preexisting sports rights and local market people and infrastructure.","Lastly, regarding our financial expectations for the Olympics. As a result of the very positive and better than planned sublicensing deals that Dave highlighted in the UK, Netherlands and Finland, we now expect meaningfully positive cumulative Olympic-related cash flows through the 2024 games. We forecast that aggregate revenues from this deal will significantly exceed total costs.","Now taking a look at our share repurchases. In the first quarter, we repurchased a total of $373 million in shares. We have now spent over $7 billion buying back shares since we began our buyback program at the end of 2010. And we've reduced our outstanding share count by 36% as we continue to find the return on repurchasing our own shares very attractive.","Getting back to our full year guidance, as stated, we are raising our constant currency adjusted EPS and constant currency free cash flow growth to being up at least high teens. Our guidance includes potential upcoming personnel-related and other restructuring charges of approximately $40 million to $60 million as outlined in our 8-K and also assumes full year stock-based compensation of approximately $55 million and no further P&L impact from the Lionsgate investment we made last year. We also now expect our full year 2016 effective tax rate to now be approximately 29% versus our prior expectation of 30% as we continue to realize significant benefits from our multi-year global tax strategies.","I also want to update the expected year-over-year foreign exchange impact on our full year reported results. As a result of the dollar weakening year-to-date versus most of the global currencies, the expected year-over-year FX impact has significantly improved since we last guided on February 18. Assuming current spot rates stay constant for the rest of the year, FX is now expected to reduce our constant currency revenue by $100 million to $110 million and adjusted OIBDA by $70 million to $80 million. We now also expect a positive FX impact to adjusted EPS of $0.01 to $0.05, due to the net effect of this year's adjusted OIBDA impact and last year's over $100 million of below the line FX impact.","In closing, I'm extremely pleased with Discovery's start to 2016. We are fully committed to constant currency margin expansion and our higher full year 2016 guidance metrics. As I noted earlier, we will continue to assess operating trends and proactively manage Discovery's overall expense base to best position the company for growth as the media industry evolves. I remain very optimistic about our global portfolio as well as our overall financial and operating momentum.","Thanks again for your time this morning. And now Dave and I will be happy to answer any questions you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from Alexia Quadrani from JPMorgan.

Zaslav - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Alexia. We've really been focused little by little on this. If you've seen over last couple of years, we've been focused on it. But we really decided that it was time to kind of to really drive what we call the left side of the business. We broke the business in half. The right side is growth. And we've been investing significantly more in content each year, more money in creating \u2013 on the whole creative side of our business as well as our direct-to-consumer business and our TV Everywhere business. And as we look at the overall infrastructure, we just felt that there's lot of opportunity to attack all of our other costs.","And the $40 million to $60 million is something that we think will make our company more efficient. We think there's probably more opportunity there as we're looking at additional technology opportunities. We have satellites all over the world, we have technology infrastructure all over the world, and a lot of that over the next year or two we think we could also get more efficient. So our overall strategy of continuing to invest in more content, build relationships with consumers on all platforms, just lightening up our existing infrastructure cost helps our margins, gives us more opportunity to invest in all those platforms and makes us stronger.","Andrew C. Warren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP","Yeah. Just to...","Alexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And it sounds \u2013 go ahead.","Andrew C. Warren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP","Just to elaborate on that, Alexia. If you think about the thesis that we've laid down over a couple years, we said that we expect to have high single-digit growth in content and marketing and low single on all other costs. And so we've had traction on that for a while now. We've been very focused on what I call base cost productivity. And this is just another example of our driving that. As we think about productivity in some of our people areas, some of our support areas, some of what I call back office, we continue to see opportunities to do things better, quicker, faster.","David M. Zaslav - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Just the technology of cloud computing itself, we have one of the largest media libraries in the world over the last 30 years that we've aggregated and digitized. We have all of that on the ground. And the ability to use cloud computing just gives us the chance over the next two years as we move more and more toward that technology to reap additional significant economic benefits. And we're looking to take advantage of every cost opportunity we have so we can spend more on telling better stories and engaging people on every platform.","Andrew C. Warren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP","And there's one more important point to make. The $40 million to $60 million is the restructuring costs that we've outlined. The actual benefit \u2013 annualized benefit of that is significantly higher. Those restructuring costs, but then benefit annualized is going to be kind of 2x plus that. So the benefit we're going be seeing both on the cost, on the cash and the P&L is going to be meaningfully more significant.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And it sounds like that benefit is a little bit towards the tail end of this year but also maybe bulk of it in 2017; is that fair?","Andrew C. Warren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP","That's correct. Some of the benefit would certainly help this year. But all of it \u2013 all of that two times the $40 million to $60 million that I just spoke about will all be in 2017 and beyond.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Todd Juenger from Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed.","Todd Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Oh, hi. Good morning. Thanks. A super quickie and then a little bit of longer one. The super quickie, just thanks for your insight into how Q2 domestic advertising is pacing. I just wanted to clarify when you said it would be similar to Q1, was that including the change in timing of Shark Week or that was sort of not including that change in timing?","And then the longer question, I guess, there's been so much press this week with the New Fronts going on, with all of these new apparently over-the-top maybe skinnier type of bundles being contemplated. Right now, you guys I don't believe are on Sling in any way. I don't know if you've been talking \u2013 you're not part of the Hulu group. YouTube is out this morning. There's all these things going on. So just anything you can share on your conversations and just your attitude about being included in those groups, your willingness to put some of your networks versus all of your networks in those groups, what sort of terms on on-demand and sort of affiliate fee and rate increases you would need to see to be included? Thanks, guys.","Andrew C. Warren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP","Sure, Todd. To answer the first question, it does include Shark Week being earlier, but I'll say that it would be high single-digit, both with or without.","David M. Zaslav - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And Shark Week will be four days in the quarter. So the advertising market remains robust. We'll talk about it a little bit later. We don't have that much information on the upfront. But the pricing in scatter is very strong, and cancellations and options are down significantly from the last few years. So the environment feels quite good going into the upfront I think for us and the whole marketplace.","On the point of over-the-top, I think one of the things that makes us very well-positioned is we have our 14 channels, which represents about 12% of viewership on cable. And even though we're looking at high single to double-digit affiliate growth domestically, we still only get about 5.5% of the economics. So 12% of viewership, 5.5% of the economics. And you have \u2013 ID is the number one or two channel for women, the most valued channel on cable in Discovery. Oprah, the number one channel for African-American women with OWN, and TLC, one of the top two or three networks in Middle America. And so we're very, very good value with our channels, including Animal Planet being one of the top three or four channels that people value in terms of brand, but also in terms of economics.","If you took just our top six channels, that represents about 83% of our affiliate. If you only took four, it would be 70%. We are talking to everyone. And one of the things \u2013 I think there's kind of two baskets. If it's a non-sports package then I think we will be an extraordinarily powerful piece of that, as we bring so many demos and so much strength to a package like that. But for all packages, we're very economically attractive. And with Discovery, ID, Animal Planet and Oprah, it's very difficult I think to have a compelling package without us.","So we're talking to everyone. The reason that we're not on Sling right now is that our deal \u2013 Charlie tends \u2013 those deals tend to get done on Sling as the deals come up and our deal with Charlie is not up. But we look at over-the-top as a real opportunity. And we could even see it in our TV Everywhere product how much our content is being consumed by consumers, which is quite attractive.","Todd Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Very helpful. Thanks, Scott (35:03).","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Nathanson from MoffettNathanson. Please proceed.","Michael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC","Thanks. I have two for David. David, firstly, over the past few years, you've been very candid and also early about talking about U.S. cable advertising weakness. So I wonder what do you think is driving this market to these now strong levels? And how do you feel about sustainability of this market past 2Q? And then I have a follow-up.","David M. Zaslav - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, the market is certainly robust and it's very hard to predict, so I'm not going predict where it's going to be in the quarters ahead. We thought in second and third quarter of last year that it was going to really be a challenge. Some of the things that are happening is: one, the measurability is getting better. A number of companies that moved more quickly to digital found that their market share \u2013 they had market share challenges. And so I think you have two baskets: how effective is television advertising? It's still probably the most effective of all advertising. And two, knowing that you're getting the actual value and it can be proven. And, in fact, when you get paid only on L3, for us, we leave about 14% of viewership on the table. And there're a lot of people in the industry that do more than that.","So the fact that you're getting \u2013 that the advertiser is getting the full value and they only pay on what you watch the first three days, they've actually an over-delivery. So, at least for now, I think the view is that it's quite an effective way to reach a broad audience and to reach across demos. And you don't get embarrassed by finding out nine months later that there was an issue with it. And you don't have to worry that it's not going to deliver in terms of your \u2013 the ability to move product. It does feel good right now. The whole U.S. market feels good.","I think this whole narrative of \u2013 toward the end of last year, this idea that universe numbers were declining precipitously as a result of distributors losing subscribers, that overall viewership on cable was declining, that advertising was going to decline at an accelerating rate, all of those have moved I think in our favor. So, at least for the near term, we see the U.S. now as a meaningful growth market. And for the near term, I mean for the next several years with having high single-digit affiliate growth locked in, with 80% of our deals done, even if the universe declines, which we don't \u2013 which it looks now like it's stabilized, and even if the advertising market declines, we'll still have a U.S. growth market. And if the advertising market stays like it is now, we'll have a very significant U.S. growth market. So it feels good for now and let's hope it continues.","Michael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC","Okay. And let me just ask this. The past couple years, you've been \u2013 you've acquired, you consolidated SBS and Eurosport. What's your appetite to do more deals of that size at this point?","David M. Zaslav - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Michael, one more time. Sorry, I missed it here.","Michael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC","I was going to say, over the past few years, you've done some very large international acquisitions. And I wonder at this point what's your appetite for doing more large deals abroad? Or are you happy with the footprint you've built now?","David M. Zaslav - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Look, we're the number one pay TV media company in the world. The good news for us is we did go on a \u2013 we've had a different strategy than most media companies. We have local infrastructure around the world. We're embedded with creative talent, commercial talent in serving 220 countries. And all the cost has been embedded. When we did do Eurosport and as we've tucked in channels, we've been able to get meaningful synergy because we have 10 to 12 channels in every country. We're always opportunistic, but I think we're very happy with our existing mix.","The way we see it now is we have this great sports IP in Europe and Discovery is on brand and growing with real pull-through. And in our most recent deals, the negative is we've had to pull our signal three times. We did it with Telenor, the largest distributor in the Nordics. We did it with Telia in Sweden and we did it with Boxer in Sweden. And so we took near-term hits by doing that. But in all three cases, we were back up and we got very significant increases. And the deals are long term, which give us \u2013 which move us from the potential to go from mid single \u2013 we're now at high single \u2013 and we're looking to get to double-digit. And so we think we've improved our IP portfolio. The same is true for us in Latin America where kids has gotten a lot stronger and we have a number of female networks that are stronger. So I think we're in a very good position now. We've improved our IP.","As our deals come up, I think you'll see our affiliate line growing internationally because our content has improved. We're taking some of that content direct to consumer and we're having some success. And so we would have to see something that would help us grow faster because we sort of took a step back with SBS and we took a step back with Eurosport. We've acquired the sports IP we think we need, and I think we're making the turn. We're very happy with the Olympics and margins should start to grow now on Eurosport. So I think we like the position we're in. We've worked hard over last three years to get in this position, to get all the infrastructure in place. And so we got the synergy if there's a good asset out there, but it's going to have to help us grow faster.","Andrew C. Warren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP","And just to elaborate, Michael, on that. From a pure financial perspective, we've long said that the criteria that we use for any acquisition is A) it has to be free cash flow and EPS accretive day one; two, it has to have an un-levered IRR of at least low teens; and third, maybe most importantly, it has to have a better IRR than allocating capital buying our own stock. And so when you look at our free cash flow model and our IRR from a free cash flow perspective, it's such a strong mid-to-high IRR that it's an important threshold that we look at a lens through on all allocations of capital.","Michael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC","Hey, thanks, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good morning. David, could you spend a little more time just revisiting one of the themes from last year's Investor Day on international distribution and sort of the state of TV Everywhere overseas versus the U.S.? We've seen Sky roll out a number of \u2013 I don't know if you want to call them OTT platforms or skinny bundles. The market over there, particularly in Europe, seems to be evolving quite rapidly. Just talk about how Discovery sees that landscape, how it fits in, and are there changes you're seeing going to help drive acceleration in the high single-digit growth you've been putting up internationally? Or how should we think about the financial (42:20)?","David M. Zaslav - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Thanks, Ben. Look, I think the thing that's going to drive our distribution revenue the hardest is the fact that our share has been growing over the last several years. And as these deals come up, we have more share and we have \u2013 as well as sports rights or kids. And we've been standing up for our value in a way that we haven't in the past. And part of that has to do with \u2013 through this recession and challenge over the last eight years, most content players have reduced their content investment. So we go into these deals where we've increased our investment, we've increased our share, and we've been able to get more significant dollars.","The second piece that is important is that there's been a change in the marketplace over the last year, and that's distributors are now looking to decommoditize their platforms. They don't want to just be pipes to the home or pipes to a device. So they're looking to get exclusive content. So what you saw us do in the Middle East where some of our advertising revenue went away, it's because we did exclusive deals with OSN with beIN for each \u2013 we did our regular package and then we gave each of them some exclusive content and we were able to get significant economics.","In addition, we did a similar thing with Canal Plus and we're in a number of discussions with distributors. This is something that could \u2013 right now you see our affiliate line internationally growing. We want to push that to double-digit. If the opportunity for exclusive content continues, you're going to see that line begin to move up higher in a way that's a lot easier to be moving the advertising line. Our goal on advertising is to get it back up to double digit, which we think we can do. But the distribution line we're quite optimistic about.","On TV Everywhere, the point that we made a couple of months ago is that TV Everywhere is just much more effective in Europe because TV Everywhere really means TV Everywhere. Everything is on the platform. It's helpful because I think it's an impediment to the SVOD platforms coming into those markets. So you have two things helping kind of a pushback on Netflix and some of the other SVOD platforms. One is that a number of us are going direct to consumer ourselves, like us, with Eurosport app or Dplay. Two is that players like Fox and Liberty Global are going direct to consumer with their TV Everywhere platforms. And they have everything.","So unlike here in the U.S., which is finally getting it together and we're seeing the great benefit of that, and Brian is leading in that with X1, in Europe it really is TV Everywhere. And that is a big benefit to us and it'll help us on advertising.","And Sky is having a real positive with Now TV. And you got to take your hat off to James and to Jeremy Darroch because they've really \u2013 they've invested and we're on Now TV. And so being part of a cable operator's platform for us is a much more favorable environment.","Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","That makes sense. And just one follow-up maybe for Andy. Just on the domestic affiliate revenue, the nice number in Q1, Andy. Is that something that we should expect to continue through the year, even including any impact from Charter-TWC? Or should we be thinking about some moderation at all one-time?","Andrew C. Warren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP","Well, look, Ben. It is strong. It does reflect the continued \u2013 every deal we've done has accreted greater pricing and has continued to increase that line. We do expect that pricing benefit to continue as new deals come in. Look, one of the variables is obviously what happens with the sub universe, but our pricing growth and the inclusion of Comcast continues to be a benefit as we roll in all these new deals.","Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you, both.","Operator","Your next question comes from Doug Mitchelson from UBS. Please proceed.","Doug Mitchelson - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks so much. One for David and one for Andy. David, when we're thinking about the upfront, one, I'd love it if you were willing to offer what your scatter pricing is versus the upfront these days. How should we think about your positioning going to the upfront versus broadcast pricing? I'm sure you heard Les say the other day he's expecting double-digit pricing for CBS in the upfront. How should we think of Discovery relative to broadcast pricing?","And for Andy, looking at your balance sheet, it seems that access to that capital might not change that meaningfully even if you decided to go down a notch. And I'm just curious if you've thought about whether it's worth getting more aggressive with the balance sheet relative to any impact on debt market access? Thank you.","David M. Zaslav - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks. So, as I mentioned, scatter is up high teens or in the 20s%, and volume is up. So that all bodes well. I love the fact that Les is talking about being double-digit. On a practical level across all of our domestic portfolio, we tend to be maybe one point behind. So if broadcast gets nine, maybe we get eight. If broadcast gets 11, maybe we get 10. If they get six, we get five. That's the way it's been historically.","Having said that, our channels are very firmly on brand. And we've been able to get some significant benefit. So some of our channels like ID and Velocity have been up 50% or 60% higher in CPM over the last year. Discovery CPM is up higher. So I think there's a real benefit as you look at OWN, ID, Discovery, Velocity, even Science. So we've worked hard to get back to brand and to really be nourishing a very specific demographic audience. So we've been rewarded on those channels I think a little bit more. ID still has a lot of headroom for us. Its length of view is the highest of any channel on cable, and we have an ability to reach women all day where we're number one on cable. Late night, we're number one and so we think there's still some significant upside on that.","But when you average all of our channels together, we'll tend to do about \u2013 a little bit \u2013 probably a little bit behind what some of the \u2013 maybe the best broadcast network does. And if we can get a little bit lucky with ID and pushing it, maybe we can \u2013 even though we don't have the same amount of reach in terms of being able to roll out a product, we could maybe reach it. But we'll do well I think.","Doug Mitchelson - UBS Securities LLC","All right. Thank you, David. That's helpful.","Andrew C. Warren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP","Yeah. And then, Doug, just to go through your capital question. Look, there's a couple of important points here. One, we are extremely committed to investment grade. It gives us access to launch from capital, gives us access to multi-currency commercial paper. So it absolutely is the right kind of capital assessment for us in investment grade. Also, if you look at our access to capital today, we issued a long-term bond earlier in the year, many times oversubscribed, rates that were actually more in the BBB rating. So even though we intentionally took our rating down to BBB minus, the markets still view us as being more BBB, especially with our mid-teen free cash flow to debt yield.","And look, the other point I'd make, Doug, which I think is so important. When you think about our capital expansion, given our high single OIBDA growth and given what is an improving currency environment, we're seeing a lot of available capital based on just our profit growth and our ability to leverage that profit growth. So there's no shortage of capital that we have to be proactive and to play offense with either buying stock or allocating capital towards acquisitions.","Doug Mitchelson - UBS Securities LLC","Well, that makes sense. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Janedis from Jefferies. Please proceed.","John Janedis - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. David, maybe going back to the sports theme, there seems to be a little less demand for smaller sports properties in the U.S. and rights fees have moderated with less competitive bidding. So I'm wondering if there's any early sign or potential for that in Europe, and to what extent that could accelerate the margin opportunity outlook for Eurosport? And then maybe along those lines in terms of non-U.S., can you give us a little more color on international ad trends? Thanks.","David M. Zaslav - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. The U.S. market is really quite different from the international market because the U.S. is really just one culture and it's one satellite. And so it's football, baseball, basketball, hockey. And because there's a very competitive environment by some of the biggest media companies to get into that space, because that's where most of the affiliate revenue has gone over the years to those that have those sports rights. Those rights have accelerated, as you've seen. And the fight for those four sports more and more has generated huge increases.","In Europe, you see that for soccer in market. So you've seen that kind of huge increases on renewals. What we've been able to do with Eurosport is we've done over 70 deals on Eurosport, and all of our deals are in the low single to mid single-digit increase. Even on the Olympics itself, we were able to get the Olympics for mid single-digit increase on what it had gone for four years earlier. And so we've been quite disciplined about getting our sports rights.","And Eurosport now remains profitable. We've made the turn. We don't think we need to own a lot more IP. We'll do it opportunistically. And again, when we pick up speed skating, we're picking up a sport that might be the number one sport in four markets, all across Northern Europe. When we pick up handball, we're picking up a sport that's the number one sport in Poland. So a lot of the \u2013 picking up tennis and cycling. So, for us, we're sort of the home for everything but soccer. And we've also picked up a lot of IP for very little. And remember, there is no bidder for sports in Europe that can provide the platform that we provide. Eurosport has three channels in every market, but we have 150 million homes on just one of our channels. So ESPN is a little less than 100 million and we have 150 million.","So when a federation wants to sell a sport, soccer is sold locally, but most other sports are sold either across Europe or you have to do 55 deals. And so I think that's the unique advantage that we have is a very complex market both in terms of taste, culture and language that we're set up to deal with. And the fact that we have the only Pan-European sports channels gives us a unique advantage. And I think over time, our ability to continue to get these rights should be pretty stable. There's not a lot of people that are bidding for the kind of sports that we're building our business on.","Finally, on the international advertising, Telenor hurt us this quarter. It hurt us significantly. It is the biggest distributor in the Nordics, which is one of our biggest markets. We were off for 11 days. And so not only did we lose on those 11 days, but some money moved. It's all back now, but it had an impact. But it really resonated in the market. We were able to get very significant economics, and driving that long-cycle top line for us is critical. If you put Telenor back into our economics, we would've been \u2013 our international business would've been positive in the mid single-digits versus negative. But we're fighting for the long term. So this quarter, we expect \u2013 the first two quarters, we expect to see in the high single range. And in the second half of the year, we expect acceleration into the double-digit range. And whether on average that ends up being high single or low double, we'll have to see.","Andrew C. Warren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP","And John, just to add to that. We have to look at the regional components of this. We're still seeing very strong double-digit growth in Latin America, Southern Europe and Eastern Europe with Eurosport. So yes, there is some nuances. Telenor, the Brexit exit discussions that we laid out that's coming up. But no question, strong double-digit growth in the second half ad sales and the majority of our regions are seeing strong double-digit growth still as we've seen the last several quarters.","John Janedis - Jefferies LLC","Thank you very much.","Operator","Last question comes from the line of Anthony DiClemente from Nomura. Please proceed.","Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. I totally understand that the cost-savings initiative here is aimed at non-content-related costs. Andy, you were clear about that in your remarks. But I wonder, will there be any realignment in terms of the networks, the infrastructure costs against your networks? I just wonder, just given the underperformance in terms of ratings at some your networks if, as part of this initiative, you would consider rationalizing any of the underperforming smaller cable net?","And then secondly for David, just going back to the theme and the subject of new over-the-top platforms in distribution, I feel like we all went through this period of hand-wringing last year about whether Apple was going to launch something like this. And I think you and I spoke about it. My thought was that profitability was the real reason that Eddy Cue and Apple decided not to move forward, the fact that the RSNs were just going to be too costly as part of this sort of virtual MVPD bundle and so forth. What do you think about the fact that the new Hulu venture is likely to be unprofitable out of the gate? Does it surprise you that others are deciding to move forward with a business like that, even if it's operating at a loss or as a loss leader? Thanks a lot.","David M. Zaslav - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Look, Hulu's a great product. So I don't want to speak specifically to Hulu. But in general, we as an industry have to make some compromises. And if we do, I think we'll be healthier. So, if in the end we're going to do an over-the-top bundle that's 30 channels for $30 then each of the media companies can't have every one of their channels, every one of their sports channels, every one of their regional sports channels carried.","For those that have the leverage to include all of them, then it's not going to be the best of what we have to offer. And so, for instance, we have 14 channels. Having six or eight of our channels carried in a package to me seems quite effective. We would get 85%, 86%. If it's only six, we'd get 83% of our dollars. We've done this in a lot of markets where \u2013 a lot of it happens in Brazil. The major programmers all decided, look, we'll get a little bit less money, but we'll be on this beginning tier. It will serve a different audience. In the case of Brazil, it was the C class. In the case of the U.S., it would be more of a millennial audience. And so if we all came together, and if you saw it's kind of the best of cable, where we would have six of those slots, then I think it can be quite attractive.","But if we each try and put all of our kids in there, which is how we are used to doing business, I think it's going be overly bloated. There's going to be a lot of channels that aren't that strong. It's going to be quite expensive, and it's not going to be that attractive. But the marketplace is quite rational. So it will \u2013 I think in the end, the smaller bundles that are working around the world are those that have 20 or 30 channels and those are kind of a best-of-bouquet, and that's probably where it will end up in the U.S.","As I've said, with all the talk about this, the only place that the skinny bundle is going to present is over-the-top. Because in the next three to four years, almost every programmer is contractually committed to have all their channels carried. And so with the exception of maybe being able to go down from, lose 5% of your distribution or 10% of your distribution, most deals provide that you need to have all your channels carried to at least 90% or 95% of the package.","And so having said that, I like the skinny bundle. I was very interested in what Apple was doing. And I think, again, the fact that we have the number one channel on cable, the number one channel for women, the number one channel for African Americans, and our channels are reasonable with high quality content, puts us in a position to be part of those bundles and we'll have those discussions, and over time, I'm confident that we will.","In terms of rationalizing costs for smaller networks, two things. We had quite a good quarter. But we also \u2013 our content channels were hurt I think a little bit more than some others by the news networks. The news networks were up 38%. But every night whether it was a Republican or a Democratic debate, a lot of that energy came out of some of our nonfiction channels. We feel pretty good about how we're going to do this quarter. There's some of our channels we need to improve. One of those is Animal Planet, we just brought in a new GM. We're working hard on turning TLC. But Discovery, Science, ID, Velocity, OWN are all running very strong. And so we're looking at everything. But in the end, this cost cutting that we're doing right now isn't related to the channels. The channels are a journey to find \u2013 to make sure our brands are right and we're reaching an audience. The cost cutting is really the other side of the house where we're having some effective efficiency.","Andrew C. Warren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP","And part of that, Anthony, is a few important cost points. Look, as we've highlighted, we are ruthlessly driving down non-content costs. Look, Dave and I also look at content spend and any spend as being an investment. And we need to get the best return and the best growth for that cost investment. So that's certainly part of our rationalization and reallocation, which is why look, an important thing that we said today in this call is that we're committing to margin growth. You saw it in the first quarter, up 70 basis points, and we are committing to revenues growing faster than costs. And so those are two critical elements of our strategic financial plan, and a big piece of that is not only accelerating top line but managing cost so that it grows slower than revenue.","Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Thank you very much.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much.

Zaslav","Thanks, Craig. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. 2012 was another year of successful operational execution and strong financial results for Discovery as we delivered sustained growth, further invested in our global brands and content and developed new and diverse strategic opportunities around the world.","Since becoming a public company in the fall of 2008, Discovery has demonstrated a unique ability to generate healthy and consistent returns, capitalizing on the sturdiness of our business model, the widespread appeal of our content and the unparalleled global distribution platform we have built for more than 20 years.","As technology rapidly evolves and economies ebb and flow, Discovery's underlying focus remains exactly the same, delivering long-term value by creating the highest-quality content with great storytelling and compelling characters that can be leveraged around the globe and across a growing number of digital and consumer platforms. Our targeted investment strategy emphasizes geographies and brands that offer meaningful advertising and affiliate upside, a key factor in our strong and dependable growth over the last few years.","The success of this strategy was never more evident than in the record results we delivered in 2012, which were driven in large part by the market share gains in the U.S. and around the world as we strengthened our existing brands, such as Animal Planet and ID; launched new brands, such as Destination America; and extended strong brands globally, such as ID in Latin America and Discovery Kids in Asia.","Domestically, this was our fourth consecutive year taking market share as viewership across our portfolio was up 6%, and our best-in-class ad sales team translated the larger audiences into double-digit ad growth, excluding one-time items. This growth speaks partly to the strong ad market, but also to the breadth and depth of our brand portfolio and the ability of our ad sales team to maximize the market and create value-enhancing ad campaigns for clients.","On the viewership side, ID continues to be a juggernaut. It celebrated its fifth anniversary last month, and our sustained investment in increasing its content offering continues to pay off. ID just delivered its 45th straight month of year-over-year primetime gains in its key demo, the longest streak among any ad-supported cable network. And in January, they premiered their newest hit, REDRUM, which delivered the network's best performing primetime telecast ever. ID has the longest length of tune in all of television in both primetime and total day and finished 2012 up over 20% in all of its key demos. This momentum is poised to continue in 2013, with a great development slate, 35 returning series, increased distribution and viewership and most importantly, still discounted CPMs relative to its audience and reach.","Animal Planet also had its best year ever, with viewership up 17% versus 2011, led by the success of River Monsters, Finding Bigfoot, Call of the Wildman and Tanked, all of which grew versus a season ago. It was one of the fastest-growing networks in all of cable in 2012 in terms of viewership. And with 15% more returning hours in 2013, we expect Animal Planet to continue growing its audience in the year ahead.","Our newest brand, Destination America, also delivered big growth this year, up 30% versus 2011, and we only launched Destination America 7 short months ago. In addition, Science and Velocity also experienced double-digit gains for the year and continued their strong momentum. The success of these emerging networks provides a great launching pad heading into 2013, especially when coupled with the big momentum we currently have at our flagships, Discovery and TLC.","Discovery built upon the strong audience it generated during Shark Week in August and delivered its best fourth quarter ever, with viewership up 14% versus a year ago. Its success was broad-based, with returning hits such as Gold Rush and Moonshiners growing versus last season, all-new series such as Fast N' Loud, Jungle Gold and Amish Mafia emerged as breakout hits. In fact, Amish Mafia delivered the highest-rated premier in the network's history, building on the huge audience generated with American Chopper Live. Several of these series also helped Discovery get off to a great start in 2013, with viewership on the channel up over 20% in January. It was the best month in Discovery's history. And with more returning hits than ever before and a great slate of new series and specials, Discovery Channel is extremely well positioned to take additional share in the year ahead.","TLC also had a strong finish to 2012, with fourth quarter viewership up 13%, led by returning favorites Long Island Medium and Sister Wives, both of which built their audience from last season; and by the new hit, Breaking Amish, which was TLC's highest-rated new series ever. For 2013, TLC has 30 series returning to its schedule. And with a robust development pipeline, we expect to further build its audience in the year ahead.","So as you can see, we finished up 2012 in great shape across our domestic portfolio, and we've built upon that momentum with our viewership market share up 7% in January. We're off to a great start this year. And while still early, with real momentum across our portfolio, strong upfront under our belts, continued strength in scatter pricing and cancellations less than a year ago, we're confident that we will deliver another year of significant advertising growth domestically.","We're also enjoying some meaningful momentum at our joint ventures after strengthening their content pipelines and driving viewership throughout last year. Hub is now available in 72 million homes, up from 56 million at launch. The network built its audience every quarter in 2012, including 14% gains in the fourth quarter among kids 2 to 11 in both total day and primetime, making The Hub the fastest-growing kids cable network in 2012. And with a great slate of new and returning series set for 2013, it is poised to further build its audience in the year ahead.","At OWN, Oprah and her team continue to connect with more and more viewers each and every month. In 2012, OWN delivered 12 consecutive months of year-on-year ratings gains and generated 36% audience growth for the full year. And that success is poised to continue with more tent-poles returning than ever before and the slate of new series scheduled for 2013, including 2 new series from Tyler Perry, one of the great writer\/producers in media, which is set to launch in May. I've seen the scripts and the shows, and they do look strong. Very exciting for us. With OWN generating real audience growth and with support from all of our original advertisers, and all of our affiliate deals completed now, except for one distributor, we are fully on track to reach our previously stated goal of cash flow breakeven during the second half of this year.","So as you can see, our content investment strategy is generating real momentum across our domestic portfolio, and the increased market share is translating into sustained financial growth.","Same story is playing out internationally. We have made targeted content investments globally to capitalize on our unparalleled distribution platform. And as a result, we are increasing our share in the growing pay-TV universe and capturing more and more advertising dollars. Overall viewership across our international portfolio expanded by more than 25% in 2012. And that growth was very much broad-based. We delivered double-digit increases across nearly every region, led by Italy and Spain in Western Europe; Mexico and Brazil in Latin America; and Russia and South Africa. We're certainly benefiting from an expanding subscriber base, with overall subs growing about 12%. But we are also leveraging the success of our domestic programming, like Gold Rush on Discovery and Cake Boss on TLC, while our international production team is providing local markets with compelling content that's really resonating with viewers.","Having a presence in over 210 countries allows us to identify additional opportunities to further expand our reach, depending on the market dynamics. Whether it's launching free-to-air networks in countries like Italy, where we use mostly existing in-language content to keep costs low, rolling out Discovery Kids across Asia or our expansion of ID into 138 countries to capitalize on the worldwide popularity of investigative and forensic programming. As we invest in organic growth opportunities, we have kept our eyes open to identify external opportunities to create additional long-term value and further strengthen our growth portfolio. We believe the 2 transactions we announced at the end of last year do exactly that. As we've demonstrated over the past several years, we are highly selective when pursuing external assets.","The acquisition of ProSieben's fully distributed suite of Nordic networks, which is expected to close this quarter, will expand our portfolio and deepen our footprint across some of the most well-penetrated and stable cable TV markets in the world. These assets are primarily dual-revenue-stream businesses in strong and stable TV markets with attractive consumer demographics and where Discovery has tremendous experience, having launched our first international network in the Nordic region more than 20 years ago. These are well-positioned channels that complement our non-fiction networks in terms of genre appeal and demographic reach, and we believe the combination of these 2 businesses will create nice synergies while strengthening our relationships with existing advertisers and affiliate partners.","The transaction with TF1, which closed in December, allows us to further diversify our network portfolio, including most notably a 20% interest in Eurosport Group and an enhanced presence in France, where we have been traditionally underrepresented. Five separate Eurosport networks are in nearly 60 countries and reach 130 million subscribers, making it the most widely distributed sports network group in Europe. And given our strong expertise with local ad sales, we anticipate driving value for both TF1 and Discovery.","Both of these transactions strengthened the tremendous platform Discovery has built over the last 2 decades, the broad distribution we have, the strong EPG channel placement, the brand loyalty and the critical relationships that come from working in local markets for many, many years. Our international growth story remains strongly intact. And these transactions further bolster our long-term outlook by deepening our geographic footprint, broadening our portfolio with new networks and brands and enhancing our creative pipeline with new talent, personalities and formats. As we invest in our existing businesses and integrate these new assets into our portfolio, delivering sustained financial results and operating leverage remains a top priority.","Andy will walk you through our 2013 guidance in a moment, but we fully expect another year of strong organic growth while returning significant capital to shareholders. We have nearly $1.5 billion remaining under our recently expanded buyback program, and we will continue to return capital to shareholders aggressively if it is in the best use of our balance sheet.","2012 was another great year for Discovery as we continued to deliver strong financial results while further executing operationally and strategically to better position the company for sustained long-term success. In 2013, with continuing operating momentum across our domestic and international portfolio and a current favorable operating environment, we remain committed to capitalizing on the growth opportunities across our platforms to build additional shareholder value.","And now let me turn the call over to Andy Warren.","Andrew C. Warren","Thanks, David. Discovery produced another strong quarter of operating results during the fourth quarter as we leveraged the large audiences we're generating around the globe to double-digit worldwide ad revenue growth and the increasing subscriber base we're delivering outside the U.S. into double-digit international affiliate revenue growth.","On a reported basis, total company revenue in the fourth quarter increased 8%, led by 15% international growth and 4% domestic growth. Organic revenue growth, where it excludes the impact of foreign currency movements, as well as nonrecurring ad revenue and additional licensing revenues in the prior year, was up over 10%. Total operating expenses on a reported basis increased 6%, higher than previously anticipated, primarily due to strategic transaction costs, a greater impact from foreign currency movements and increased marketing and personnel costs. Excluding the transaction costs and the impacts of foreign currency, as well as higher content costs a year ago from impairments and changes in amortization rates, total expenses increased 8% versus the fourth quarter last year.","Discovery's continued ability to generate revenue growth in excess of expenses translated into a 9% increase in reported adjusted OIBDA during the fourth quarter. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, as well as the previously highlighted revenue and expense items that are onetime in nature in both the current and prior year, organic adjusted OIBDA grew 12% versus the fourth quarter a year ago.","Net income from continuing operations decreased to $224 million as the strong operating performance in the current year and improved equity earnings were more than offset primarily by higher taxes, as well as increased mark-to-market share-based compensation expense through depreciation in our share price. The increase in book taxes versus a year ago was predominantly due to $112 million of foreign tax credits recognized in the fourth quarter of 2011. Higher-than-normal tax rate in the current quarter was driven by increased tax reserves and the impact of restructuring our international operations that I discussed last quarter. As previously mentioned, the restructuring will ultimately lower our effective tax rate over time, and we do anticipate an effective tax rate of around 38% for 2013.","Free cash flow decreased $20 million to $304 million in the fourth quarter as the improved operating performance was more than offset by higher content investment and increased cash taxes. The programming spend in the current year is certainly paying off in terms of ratings momentum and higher advertising revenue. That content amortization growth will be in the low- to mid-teens to 2013 as content amortization catches up with the cash investments made in both 2011 and 2012. We do anticipate that programming spending growth will slow down considerably in 2013 versus last year.","Looking back at the full year, Discovery's 2012 financial performance demonstrates our sustained ability to deliver consistent revenue and adjusted OIBDA growth while continuing to invest in our networks and operations worldwide. On a reported basis, for the full year, we delevered -- delivered 8% revenue and 9% adjusted OIBDA growth. Excluding foreign currency, revenue grew 9% and adjusted OIBDA increased 12% versus 2011, which resulted in our adjusted OIBDA margin expanding by 100 basis points in 2012.","Turning to the operating units. The U.S. Networks continued to perform well during the fourth quarter. On a reported basis, total domestic revenues increased 4% as advertising revenue grew 9% from viewership gains across our portfolio, as well as favorable pricing and demand environment. Affiliate revenue increased 2% versus a year ago, as higher rates and digital subscribers partially offset by a decline in digital licensing revenue. Excluding the nonrecurring ad sales item in 2011 and the higher licensing revenue from the fourth quarter a year ago, U.S. advertising increased 10%, and affiliate fee growth was 5%.","For the full year, our U.S. sales team delivered another strong growth with ad sales, excluding nonrecurring revenue items, up 10% on top of the 15% organic growth we delivered in 2011. Current ad market trends continue to be encouraging, with double-digit scatter pricing above the gains we garnered during the upfront negotiations. We have some nice ratings momentum across many of our networks, as David mentioned. And with the healthy macro environment continuing, we anticipate high-single-digit ad growth in the first quarter of 2013, building upon the impressive 13% organic growth we delivered in the first quarter a year ago.","For the full year, our distribution team also achieved very strong results, delivering 4% growth on top of the -- 12% increase we delivered in 2011 on the back of our digital licensing agreements. We also completed a few new affiliate deals with existing operators that secured higher rates across the portfolio, as well as additional distribution for a number of our emerging networks.","Turning to the costs side. Domestic operating expenses were down 1% from the fourth quarter of 2011, which included higher content costs due to impairment charges, changes in amortization rates and costs associated with digital licensing agreements. Excluding these costs, our operating expenses increased 7% compared to a year ago due to higher content amortization and increased personnel costs.","On a reported basis, domestic adjusted OIBDA increased 7% for the quarter and 8% for the year. Excluding the impacts of licensing agreements, content impairment charges and changes in amortization rates, domestic adjusted OIBDA increased 4% in the fourth quarter and 6% for the full year.","Turning to our international operations. We continue to deliver some good momentum across our global operations, with reported revenues expanding 15% and by 16% ad and 12% affiliate growth. Excluding the impact of exchange rates, total revenue growth was 18%, with advertising revenue increasing 18% and affiliate revenue up 15%. As we mentioned on our last call, it was anticipated that ad revenue would accelerate in the fourth quarter, and we exceeded our original expectation of mid-teen growth. We delivered double-digit growth across nearly all regions, led by Western Europe, mainly from growing market share, as well as the continued success of several of our free-to-air initiatives, including Real Time in Italy and Quest in the U.K.","We also saw a double-digit growth in the quarter in Latin America, driven by the success of our U.S. Hispanic networks, as well as growth in Mexico and Venezuela. The affiliate revenue increase, which included 4 percentage points of benefit from lower launch-support amortization were driven by further strong subscriber additions worldwide and by continued growth from Brazil and Mexico in Latin America, as well as Russia and Turkey.","Operating costs internationally were up 10% on a reported basis and 11% excluding the impact of foreign currency, primarily driven by higher content amortization, as well as increased personnel and infrastructure costs due to additional investment in growth initiatives and the buildout of our global platform to support our long-term growth expectations.","Our international segment delivered 21% adjusted OIBDA growth in the fourth quarter, excluding currency impact, as our international team continued to generate strong revenue increases while thoughtfully investing in key growth initiatives.","The fourth quarter completed another year of rapid growth and terrific performance from our international team, with revenues and adjusted OIBDA both up 18%, excluding foreign currency, in 2012. These results follow up in the 13% revenue and 18% adjusted OIBDA growth delivered, excluding currency, in 2011.","As we look ahead to 2013, we are encouraged by the momentum across our global portfolio and the continued strong pricing and demand environment in many of our key markets. We anticipate closing on the SBS transaction during the first quarter. And our full year expectations include our forecast for these Nordic businesses for the remainder of the year.","For the full year 2013, we expect total revenues to be between $5.575 billion and $5.7 billion. We anticipate adjusted OIBDA to be between $2.425 billion and $2.525 billion, with revenue growth partially offset by higher operating expenses due in large part to the higher content amortization I discussed earlier. For comparison purposes, excluding the SBS results from our full year expectations, we are forecasting double-digit revenue and adjusted OIBDA growth in 2013. It's important to note that the first quarter growth rates will be lower than the remainder of the year, given the positive impact from the Amazon agreement in the first quarter a year ago.","Net income is expected to be between $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion, led by the strong operating performance and the improvement in equity earnings due to continued progress at OWN. This growth will be partially offset by the increased tax rate I mentioned earlier, as well as higher interest expense due mostly to additional debt raised in conjunction with our SBS and TF1 transactions. Our guidance assumes no material purchase accounting adjustments upon closing the SBS transaction, and we'll update you next quarter on any changes to these expectations.","Free cash flow is expected to grow significantly in 2013 from improved operating performance, as well as the benefit from the extension of the Section 181 domestic content production deduction, which is extended retroactively to the beginning of last year.","In 2012, with a strong balance sheet and continued financial and operating momentum, we returned nearly $1.4 billion to our shareholders through execution of our share repurchase program. Since August 2010, we have spent nearly $3 billion buying back shares, reducing the outstanding share count by over 70 million shares or 17%.","Our first priority remains investing in our core businesses to drive sustained, long-term growth through investment in existing networks and platforms or through exploring external initiatives. But given the free cash flow we are generating, our gross leverage targets, as well as our long range free cash flow per share growth expectations, we have unique opportunity to continue returning capital to shareholders, while we also invest in our businesses. We anticipate returning similar amounts of capital to shareholders through buybacks in 2013, as we did in 2012. However, as previously highlighted back in December, having capital needs associated with the timing of closing the SBS transaction, we do not anticipate buying shares until the second quarter of this year.","Thanks again for your time this morning. Now David and I will be happy to answer any questions you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question is from the line of Doug Mitchelson from Deutsche Bank.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","David, do you see any other interesting acquisition opportunities right now? And for 2013, from your viewpoint, what are the most important execution priorities? I mean, where could -- you laid out your guidance and your outlook. Where do you think there's a potential to do better, where you think there's the risk of doing worse?","David M. Zaslav","Okay, thanks, Doug. In terms of acquisitions, we have a great balance sheet. And we have a real opportunity with our existing platforms to grow organically, and we've been doing that over the last several years. The idea of buying additional assets is we're always opportunistic, but we were looking for the past 6 years, and it took us 6 years to find Eurosport and SBS and Switchover. The real focus for us is we're only going to do an acquisition if we think we can grow as fast or faster, as well as having real strategic value for us. So we will continue to look. If we find assets that meet that formula, we'll go ahead. But in the meantime, though we have -- we've expanded our platform dominance. And we're doing a better job, I think, than we ever have creatively in terms of populating our channels with great storytelling and strong characters and growing our market share, so I feel like we're in very good shape right now. And we'll see if anything else comes up. In terms of priorities, I think the #1 priority is to continue to grow market share. We are unique in our approach. And in the last year alone, we increased our investment in content by $200 million. But we did grow our market share last year by 8% in a market that was flat. The year before, we grew 3%, and the year before, we grew 7%. So as we look at this company, the focus is to continue to deploy capital to take full advantage of the fact that we have 14 channels here in the U.S. And as you look around the world, we have better -- we have a better platform portfolio than anyone. This past year, we grew 25% market share outside the U.S., including launching a number of new channels, where we're using our existing content. And so if we can continue to grow our market share and continue to create an environment where we have the best creatives working with us to build our brands, you're going to see a significant amount of growth because there's more and more windows for our content, and there's more and more platforms for us to put it.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Does that suggest that you should be ramping your investment in content even further than you already are?","David M. Zaslav","Well, last year -- we've taken it up significantly over the last 5 years. And because we had so much success last year, as you look at Discovery, Animal Planet, ID, TLC, the success that we've had, including at Science, we have a lot more returning series than we've ever had. And returning series that are really, that are freshman or sophomore. So we don't have a lot of older series in our portfolio right now. And so because of that, you will see this year that we'll be relatively flat. And that will be significant because we won't have to go out fishing as much to find new content for 2 reasons. One, our creative team, I think, is better than we've ever had, and we understand our brands and what the viewer is looking for on each channel. But also more importantly, we have a lot of returning series, more than we've ever had, on each channel. So we're in this odd moment where we could spend about the same amount of money and get a lot more creative content because remember that within our business model, when we have series that work, we own those shows for the long haul. So the additional costs of those shows in Season 2, 4, 5 is -- there is no opportunity to come back and really leverage those, and so that's a real opportunity for us. So it will level off, Doug, and I think that, that will help with -- you see a big pickup in amortization this year, you'll see that level off significantly because we're going to be tapering down, but I think we'll taper down and we'll accelerate market share.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I wanted to ask about the distribution renewals that you talked about, Andy, in your prepared remarks. Now that they're behind you, can you tell us how many subs they covered and whether you expect, if you sort of cut through all the noise with digital and launch amortization, if the affiliate revenue growth will accelerate in '13 versus '12? I think it was around 5% in '12. And, David, what was the strategy going in, I think Andy mentioned more distribution, higher fees. But there are a lot of things you guys could go for, more ad inventory, higher fees in ID in particular, and you had a lot of ratings strength. What was the sort of goal for the team going in other than just getting as much money as possible?","David M. Zaslav","Thanks, Ben. I do think we're very well positioned for these discussions. Six years ago, our market share was about 4% on cable. Today, it's about 10%. We have a lot more channels that are -- that have niche audiences, that are -- that feel that our channels are very -- and brands are very important to them. So that -- and all of our deals come up at the same time, as we've discussed. So I think we have a very good hand. We also have a very good equitable argument with distributors because we've spent a lot more on content as our market share -- has grown. And I think all of our distributors would agree that our channels have become much more important. The viewership is up, they are making more money selling them. So it was a very good backdrop. For this year, there were just very few deals that came up. We said the deals were going to be coming up over the next -- last year and over the next 5 years. This year, it was a smaller percentage. And so we did very well in terms of getting increases in fees, well above where -- what are -- what's in our existing deals, which is 4% to 5%. In addition, we were able to get more distribution for a number of our channels, which doesn't -- which helps us. When you take a look at ID, that was in 55 million homes, and it's now in over 80 million. That's becoming a big asset for us. Science, that was in 45 million homes. That's in over 70 million now. So we get the increase in rate, we then get paid on those channels that get rolled down, and then we get additional ad revenue on the viewership of those channels. But you won't see a significant bump this year because the scale of the deals that came up were just small. And we always mention that they feather in over the next 4 years. So I think if we do -- we expect that we'll do as well going forward, and you'll see more of it in '14 and '15 as more deals come up. And one other thing. We did not give any TV Everywhere rights as part of these deals, which I think is -- was important for us. We couldn't determine what the right value was. And it was amicable, but we agreed in this case to table it. I think there's a decent chance we'll do some TV Everywhere deals over the next few months. But the good news is there is no distributor in the U.S. that has TV Everywhere rights for our content. And given that we are almost 10% of viewership on cable, I think that, that is a very valuable opportunity. And it's a good opportunity for us because TV Everywhere is -- it's measured on computers, it'll be measured on pads soon, and it provides a good economic model that's measured -- that will be measured for us.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So it sounds like these deals set the stage for that 5% to accelerate, but it's going to take multiple years as it phases in as the deals get bigger. Is that a fair takeaway?","David M. Zaslav","Correct. And now having said that, if TV Everywhere -- we could do TV Everywhere this year as a separate basket of consideration. Or there could be deals that are up next year, the year after, in 2015 or '16, where a distributor wants TV Everywhere rights, where we could either do it independently, or we might decide to roll forward a whole new deal as part of that. But assuming that, that doesn't happen, then it'll feather in over the next couple of years.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Todd Juenger from Sanford Bernstein.","Todd Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Just a couple quick ones for you. So in terms of international advertising, in the past, you sometimes have been willing to talk a little bit about Europe specifically. Obviously, a lot of stuff going on there, including your free-to-air launches in the macro environment. I wonder if there's any comments you'd be willing to make about how that all came together for you in the quarter and what you're seeing for the year. And I might as well ask my follow-up quickly, and it's more a tidy -- a housekeeping one. On your guidance for the first Q [ph] of '13, it looks from the interest expense as if your debt seems to be more or less keeping flat. I'm just wondering what your thoughts are on leveraging the company going forward and if I'm interpreting that correctly, or why you wouldn't raise the debt level commensurate with the EBITDA growth.","David M. Zaslav","Thanks, Todd. I'm going to give a -- just a quick on international and then pass to Mark Hollinger, who's the CEO of our International business. We had -- you saw we had 18% growth in advertising. The fact that we're in 210 countries, yes, there was some softness in France and Germany, but on the other hand, we had so much market share growth, where we grew 25% market share that we were able to continue to grow. And you have subscriber growth in the aggregate of about 12%. So we have a lot of winds at our back. There's a number of markets, particularly Latin America and India and Russia, that feel a lot like the U.S. in -- back in the early '90s, where you're gaining market share, more and more advertisers are coming on, and we're well positioned. The reason we're doing so well in Western Europe is we have an odd and effective strategy on free-to-air. We use it as a compliment in a few markets, but we have existing content that's already paid for in-language, so we're really -- we get a broadcast network in a market that doesn't have high paid penetration. And then we're able to basically gain market share by putting on a lot of content at very, very low cost. But Mark's done a great job last year. I think we outperformed certainly our expectations, and we're accelerating now into 2013. Let me pass it to Mark.","Mark G. Hollinger","Thanks, David. Yes, I think if you look overall, the ad sales growth for the quarter and for the year was actually a nice balance across a number of regions. Clearly, Western Europe was probably the leader of the pack, driven by a lot of the free-to-air initiatives. Italy, and Quest in the U.K. But I think if you look more broadly, you can see that there was strength in Latin America with Mexico and Colombia and Venezuela. There was strength in Central and Eastern Europe with Poland. And India ended up being a great story for us. So I think we found that with lots of different market dynamics in different places, that we're well positioned having the breadth of portfolio and frankly, again, the combination in markets where free-to-air can play a big piece that we have. We have the platforms to continue to drive double-digit growth on the ad sales side. Again, the pacing for first quarter is looking the same. It's a nice broadly sort of distributed pacing for first quarter.","David M. Zaslav","The attractive piece for us is we're gaining market share around the world not just in channels but in viewership. And we're seeing, whether you call it softness or recession or weakness, in a ton of markets. Having said that, we're able to grow aggressively in -- even across a challenged environment. So Brazil still is growing strong in terms of subscribers, but the economy has been soft. And when those economies begin to turn, when you're seeing the kind of growth that we see right now with really challenged environments -- so our strategy is grow market share, do it inexpensively with a lot of in-language content. And we're very confident about the year ahead. But as -- if we can get a turn in some of these economies, then we can really -- we can see even more growth. Andy?","Andrew C. Warren","Todd, regarding your 2013 debt and interest question, as you've heard us say before, we're very focused on a gross leverage ratio of 2.5x to 3x. So given the EBITDA growth we are forecasting for '13, as well as the SBS transaction, we do think we'll have about $1 billion of additional debt, year-end '13 versus year-end '12, and therefore, about $50 million of additional interest expense as well in '13 than '12.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of David Bank, RBC Capital Markets.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Two quick ones. The first is, if you look at the success of Animal Planet versus -- and versus the success of ID and how you're monetizing both, are you -- do you feel like you are monetizing the audience increases in Animal Planet? I think to a certain extent, you've been going out of the typical demo in some of those audience increases. And so how is the monetization of that going, and is there like a transition period? And the second question is I guess as you have successfully hit, or look on target to hit, the guidance with respect to OWN and its breakeven point, at what point do you think it'll be time to sort of update the guidance, move out the targets and start talking about the positive contribution and giving us a sense of how that could sort of move the needle below the OIBDA line?","David M. Zaslav","Thanks, David. Look, Animal Planet was really, I think, the breakout surprise for last year. With all of the effort that we made in -- over the last 6 years and even the years before I got here, it was a channel that everyone said that they loved but not a lot of people watched. And so we built a very strong creative team led by Marjorie Kaplan, and we invested money for the last several years trying to find the audience and grow the channel. And candidly, we had our ups and downs. But before this year, we were really struggling with how do we get this from being the #35 channel, #40 channel, in America to something that's more meaningful because we were able to get much lower CPMs on this channel, and the viewership has been low. And Marjorie has really broken through. This -- the channel is now a top 20 channel in America. On Sunday, Marjorie had 2 shows that were the top 20 shows. It was the #1 channel in our portfolio on Sunday. There's a number of series that have a lot of traction. The demo has converted from being more female to more male and young and quite attractive. The good news and bad news is we have a very good audience now, and it's compelling. It helps us strategically in fighting against the other non-fiction channels like Geo and HISTORY, both of which do a good job, but having a successful Animal Planet helps that. The bad news is that our CPMs are still low on Animal Planet. But the good news is that over the next 2 to 3 years, you'll see us continuing to get a premium and catching up. It's going to take some time. We're already starting to do better. The advertisers are excited about our success. So in the cycle, that will be a CPM","[Audio Gap]","it's over a period of time. And it -- more so than even TLC, the success of Animal Planet we'll take around the world, and we've already started to. So part of that 25% market share growth is we got better and better content that works well around the world, moving. ID, as we've talked about often, is still on the backside of its CPM entitlement. And if ID didn't grow at all in terms of viewership over the next 2 years, we would -- you would see very substantial growth because of the CPM. During day time, ID is a top 10 network, sometimes it's a top 5 network in America. And the amount of women that it's delivering is very valuable, and we're way underpriced still, although we're making progress. So both of those, we think, are going to be a helper. On OWN, we're ahead of where we thought we'd be on rating. Oprah's doing a great job. Beyonce will be on this Saturday. You saw what we did with Lance, and we took that all over the world. We said we'd fund less in 2012 than we did in 2011, we did. Everything is moving in the right direction. Maybe most importantly, this was a channel that had no sub fees, or virtually no sub fees, when we entered into this business. And today, we've done deals with every operator in America, except for one, paying sub fees that started on January 1, and so we feel very good about it. Oprah is really energized. And we got Tyler Perry working with us, one of the great talents in the media business, and he's working very hard on a comedy and a drama. He has actually started shooting. He was -- has sent me some pictures. Oprah was in the control room yesterday with him in Atlanta, very -- so OWN is going very well. And Andy will talk to you about when we'll update you.","Andrew C. Warren","Yes, David, just to give you some more thoughts on that. It was about a year ago that we said we would have funding in '12 less than '11. And as you said, the second half of '13 would be cash flow neutral. We couldn't feel better about the momentum and the results we have today. As David said, we achieved our financial objective for '12 funding, it was less than '11. And I've mentioned, we have -- really gives us a real line of sight to some very positive results out to 2013. So it is a big driver of our improvement. And EPS and the other income line will be significantly improved this year versus last. We will throughout the year give you all an update on the results, and particularly on the second half view, which we see now as being a debt reduction and a pay-down of our debt obligation, particularly in the second half of this year.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Jessica Reif Cohen, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jessica Reif Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I wanted to go back to the affiliate deals. I know you haven't exposed a lot, but I was just wondering if you could give us kind of what percent of the contracts come up at the end of this year. Or if 2013 isn't the big year. Year-end contracts from 2012, you said, were small. When do we start to see -- what is the big year in terms of affiliate renewals? And within the rights again, David, you said you're not giving TV Everywhere, but you're giving VOD rights. And just the strategy of going for distribution, even with balancing distribution, increased distribution versus rates, I'm just wondering if you can -- I don't know, if there is any help that you can give us at all with the overall revenue growth on that side over the next few years, how much will it accelerate?","David M. Zaslav","Thanks, Jessica. We've said -- we said last year that it comes in over 5 years and that it's -- there isn't any 1 year that has 60%. So we don't want to get any more specific than that. Our #1 focus is that the actual fees go up. And getting the fees to go up, which are long cycle, which we can bank, and that's the most important piece of the strategy, and we think given the fact that our fees have only been going up 5%, but our market share is going up more than that, our channels are more valuable and they all come up at once, that we have a good argument, and the operators that we dealt with this year agreed with us. Having said that, if you can pick up several million subscribers with a guaranteed sub fee against those subscribers, that becomes a guaranteed affiliate also, if assuming that those are -- that you're able to be moved down in a way that you would have never otherwise. So I think the second thing that we look for is to get more carriage for our channels with guaranteed fees against those, which when you put those together and you add them up, it adds to your overall increase in affiliate fees. There are a bunch of other things that you can look at, but those are the 2 biggest ones. And TV Everywhere and VOD, we've held back TV Everywhere. There are some distributors that are looking for SVOD to compete with Netflix, which is great for us. And I've always -- I've said recently, this is probably the best time to be in the content business because there's more players, more people that want to pay us for our content in more windows. The fact that some operators want to get into the SVOD business is another bite at the apple in addition to TV Everywhere, but we haven't given any SVOD rights, we haven't given any TV Everywhere rights, and we've given limited VOD, which has been our operandi from the beginning. Andy?","Andrew C. Warren","Jessica, we're clearly not going to give any forward-looking viewer guidance on how the affiliate growth is going to look. But 2012 was a good year. The growth of those deals was good. The standard distribution, as David mentioned, was good for us, especially on the emerging nets. So we're not going to give any forward look, but at least the first year of that 5-year cadence was productive.","Jessica Reif Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And then you said long cycle, how long are the newer contracts?","Andrew C. Warren","Look, we don't -- we're not going to disclose specifically. But in general, our international deals tend to be about somewhere in the 3-year range shorter than the U.S. In the U.S., our deals have historically been in the 5-year range. There are some of the players in the market that we've seen have gone longer than that. It's something that we will look at, and whatever -- if, in fact, there is value there, we would go longer or we might go shorter.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Michael Nathanson from Nomura.","Michael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Let me have one for Andy, and then I'll come back to David on affiliate fees. Andy, if you look at your domestic network profitability this year, it's kind of amazing. You converted almost every dollar of revenue incremental into profit. And I wonder, when we look at the recent trends in domestic business, what do you think is kind of the right range of incremental conversion of revenue, let's say in the next 1 or 2 years? So what's kind of the right way to think about that?","Andrew C. Warren","Domestic, Michael, would be probably in the, long term, 50% to 60% [ph] range, especially given the higher content amort that we talked about. Content amort, that catch up relative to the cash spend in the last couple years, as I said, it's going to be in the low to mid-teens. So that certainly will have an impact on that, but we still expect solid flow-through of margin domestically.","Michael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. And then, David, just going back to affiliate fees. It's a good question. When you look at how people have done deals, some people have gotten big step-ups year one. Some other people have just taken the step-ups over the life of the contract. How do you think about that balance? Are you going for a big 1-year step-up or should we think about this over like the life of a new deal?","David M. Zaslav","When we're looking at doing a deal, it's really how do we get the most value for our overall package. I guess our preference would probably be straight line. If a distributor wanted to give it to us in some other way because it was more beneficial, we certainly -- we could just tie in value back-end, front-end, to make a determination. The deals that we've done have been straight line so far. And so I think you'll see it flow in evenly.","Michael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","So therefore, if you look at the step-up in '13 to '12, we can't assume -- that's just not -- that you can't assume really anything from like, hey, that's the 1-year step-up. It's going to be...","David M. Zaslav","We didn't do any front-loading of anything so far.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Richard Greenfield from BTIG.","Richard Greenfield - BTIG, LLC, Research Division","When you look at broadcast TV, it appears from the ratings that collectively the business is in serious trouble. And I think when you look at the success that shows on your networks have had in terms of 18 to 49 or even just broader demographics, things like AMC with The Walking Dead and FX have attained, we've -- there's been this like steady market share bleed between broadcast and cable, and advertising has followed. But we haven't seen any kind of big gaps in terms of change year-over-year. Is that a 2013 or 2014 event? Like what has to happen so that you see huge chunks move broadly in advertising? And when we look at networks like you have like ID, et cetera, when do we start to see much bigger-size movements?","David M. Zaslav","Rich, it's hard to tell. I think that we have subscriber growth flat in the U.S. We have viewership flat in the U.S. The one win that we have at our back right now is the fact that there is still a 32%, 33% CPM differential between broadcast and cable. They do deliver, in general, a bigger audience, but that's becoming less and less so. When we put Gold Rush on, on Friday night, we're the #1 network in America. We beat the broadcasters. When we put on Honey Boo Boo or Breaking Amish or Long Island Medium on TLC, we could be #1 with women 18 to 34, 18 to 49. So clearly, the justification for the CPM differential is eroding. Having said that, these things take time. We haven't seen any significant step differential, but we have seen more money coming to cable, and we have seen that spread every year get a little smaller, which is to our advantage. That's the wind at our back. We're always making the argument that we're delivering bigger audiences and we should be getting more money. Alebrije [ph] does a great job at that, and we'll continue to bang on that door. The good news is I think you'll probably see over the next couple of years that will be the sustained wind at our back as we continue to grow market share as an industry, that more of the dollar should come to us at some better pricing.","Richard Greenfield - BTIG, LLC, Research Division","And then just a follow-up, when you look at all of the SVOD deals that have happened, have you seen -- obviously, Walking Dead has had these blow-out ratings from the leverage they've gotten from their viewership. When you look at this type of programming you've put up on Netflix and Amazon, can you point to shows that weren't as successful, where they've come back and been much more successful year-over-year, and you think you can tie it to the introduction of those shows in prior seasons to new audience members?","David M. Zaslav","Here's what we've learned so far. Netflix and Amazon have been great partners for us. We have a unique deal with them in that our content -- the content we'd put on there is older. We were conservative coming in, but we did -- we were able to move a lot of content onto those platforms. And we put our brand on. Any time you look at a show from us, you'll see our brand. We spent the last 1.5 years taking a look at how is our content consumed and what impact does it have. The good news is we don't see any degradation. It's way too early to tell, but in our type programming, in shows like -- a show like Gold Rush or Deadliest Catch, there's an argument that people consume that, consume a whole season. They might consume a season from 3 years ago, and then they want to see the new season. So if anything, we think there may be a little bit of a helper with that, but I think it remains to be seen. The good news for us is that as our market share has grown, I think we've become even more attractive. As the number of hit series we have across all of our portfolio have grown, I think we've become more attractive, and it's been a very effective window for us. There are some series that surprise us. There's a couple of things that aren't on Discovery or TLC anymore that do quite well, and I think that falls into that kind of the campy -- it'll really surprise you sometimes what people will watch on a rainy Saturday afternoon.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Alexia Quadrani from JPMorgan.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just staying on that SVOD topic right there. Could you give us a sense on how we should assume those revenues will fall in, in 2013? I believe you have the right to extend your deal with Netflix this year. Should we assume that's going to be in the numbers? Any color would be great.","Andrew C. Warren","Sure, Alexia, it's Andy. We do have a third-year extension on that, and the predominance of that revenue would be probably recognized in the second quarter, with some as well in the third. It really depends on the timing of when the content is delivered to Netflix, but think in terms of predominantly 2Q and some in the third quarter.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Do you think that the total then SVOD dollars could be up year-over-year in '13 versus '12?","Andrew C. Warren","We're not going to quantify specifically, but it's a significant amount, and it's certainly in line with the total SVOD in 2012.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then just lastly, on the comments about the holding off the TV Everywhere rights, I guess what's the hesitation there? Is it waiting for the ratings to come in other media? And I guess what sort of holds you back?","David M. Zaslav","Well it's 2 things. One, it needs to be -- we feel like it needs to be measured. So right now, if anybody is viewing our content, if we broadly deployed it and people were viewing our content on pads, it wouldn't be measured. So one of the attractions of TV Everywhere is that your content could be viewed on other platforms, but it is measured. It's measured by Nielsen, and you could accumulate the fair value for it. That's one. But two, if distributors are offering our content on other platforms, and the fact that they are able to do that enhances the experience that a consumer has with their distributor, whether it be Comcast or Time Warner or Charter, if in addition to getting their phone and their broadband, they also have TV Everywhere and they can watch on any device and if it has an effect on the way they feel about the distributor, if it has an effect on the churn, it's not clear exactly what the value is, but the value -- there is real value in us providing that, and the operators agree with that. And we just need to figure out how to apportion that value. And we haven't yet agreed on how to do that.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Alan Gould from Evercore.","Alan S. Gould - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Two questions. Andy, can you just give us an idea, do you have digital distribution revenue up versus 2012 built into your 2013 guidance? And, David, the ratings have been terrific. But is there any risk that you're going off-brand a little bit? I think of a show like the Amish show, for example.","David M. Zaslav","Okay, let me start with Discovery. Because I don't think Discovery has ever been more on-brand. If you take a look, we have Africa running on Tuesdays, which is very core to what we are. We have Gold Rush, where we're going out to Alaska and learning about how to mine for gold. Moonshiners, we have a number of -- we have Curiosity on Sunday nights. So the balance of specials together with real series about adventure and survival, we're in this perfect balance right now. Breaking -- Amish Mafia, which is on Discovery, and has been very popular, it is on-brand. It's -- as you think about how people live in America and around the world, what are the different societies and subcultures, that's certainly part of it. But as you look at the bull's eye of Discovery, it is things like Gold Rush and Curiosity, as well as a lot of our Survival, which we still have and will have more of. MythBusters. So we feel right now that Discovery is in a sweet spot. We do have a great creative team. Eileen O'Neill, who runs Discovery and TLC, really spent -- she's been running it now for 3 years. It took about 1.5 years to figure out what is Discovery when it's at its best, who is the audience, how do we build it? And you saw our strategy of standing down during the Olympics and then coming forward with our best creative series after that. And we -- so far, it's been no looking back. Obviously, there's ups and downs in this business. And creatively, every show isn't going to work. But I think Discovery, from a brand perspective and from a viewer perspective, is the best it's ever been.","Andrew C. Warren","Alan, regarding your digital question, it is yet to be determined as actually which titles will be delivered this year. But broadly speaking, think in terms of a flat revenue, digital revenue in '13 versus '12.","Operator","The next question is from David Miller from Riley Caris.","David W. Miller - B. Riley & Co., LLC, Research Division","David, just a question about the diligence process with regard to SBS and TF1 Eurosport. When you guys were looking into these deals and just doing your diligence and just kind of justifying the price that you paid, which obviously looks like it's just -- it's going to turn out to be super accretive. Was the thinking there that -- particularly with SBS, that some of these networks are broken and you could turn around the ratings with some of your library programming, and you could realize the upside there? Or was the thinking more that this is a macro call and that you're going in when obviously Europe just has a lot of structural problems, and hopefully, they kind of work their way through that and you can realize the upside there? Or was it a combination of both? Just interested in your thoughts.","David M. Zaslav","Well, with both the Eurosport and in particular, SBS, we paid less than our multiple. We have 8 channels in Norway, Denmark and Sweden, so we have some synergy. We also have been in that market for 20 years. They're actually a great leadership team. They've done a good job of growing market share. And the markets are stable. Mark spent a lot of time over there. The deal isn't closed yet, but, Mark, why don't you give an update on SBS and Eurosport and how you see it?","Mark G. Hollinger","Yes, look, I think with SBS and frankly, in the Nordics with the combination of SBS and Eurosport, we have an opportunity in, as David says, really great markets. Great pay-TV penetration, strong economies, economies that are well positioned vis-\u00e0-vis the rest of the Eurozone to really drive scale in a way that we have never been able to. The Nordics have traditionally been some of Discovery Network's highest audience share markets. I think we may have the highest audience share anywhere in our pay-TV world in Norway, for example. To be able to combine that with what SBS has done. And then also, potentially to bring Eurosport into the mix, from a sales point of view, from a content-sharing point of view, I think we see that there are sort of multiple upsides. It's not about things being broken. It's about I think bringing all those assets together in a way they can really drive growth. I think that there is probably in Sweden where TLC has been a bit under-distributed and where the SBS portfolio is smaller than it is in the other markets, but we do have a chance for a new channel or 2 in the Swedish market, which would be terrific. But this is definitely one where we have taken on great assets with a great management team in great markets. We think that now the combination of our networks and Eurosport can really drive that even further.","Craig Felenstein","Okay, that's all we have for today, operator. Thank you very much for joining us, everybody. If you have any follow-ups, please give us a call. Thank you.","David M. Zaslav","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Andrew Slabin, Executive Vice President of Global Investor Strategy. Sir, you may begin.","Andrew Slabin","Good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us for Discovery's second quarter 2019 earnings call. Joining me today are David Zaslav, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Gunnar Wiedenfels, our Chief Financial Officer; and JB Perrette, President and CEO, Discovery Networks International.","You should have received our earnings release, but if not feel free to access it on our website at corporate.discovery.com. On today's call, we will begin with some opening comments from David and Gunnar, and then we will open the call for David, Gunnar and JB to take questions.","Before we start, I would like to remind you that comments today regarding the company's future business plans, prospects and financial performance are forward-looking statements that we make pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are made based on management's current knowledge and assumptions about future events, and may involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations.","In providing projections and other forward-looking statements, the company disclaims any intent or obligation to update them. For additional information on important factors that could affect these expectations, please see our Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2018 and our subsequent filings made with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.","And with that, I will turn the call over to David.","David Zaslav","Good morning and welcome everyone to our Q2 earnings conference call.","Discovery had a strong quarter, with healthy operating and financial results with the benefits of the Scripps acquisition flowing through all areas of our global business, while making significant strides across a number of our strategic initiatives around the world. We are on solid financial footing and remain extremely well-positioned, to continue our pivot towards the streaming and direct a consumer marketplace, where we see exciting opportunities to aggregate and super-serve global fan communities.","For the quarter we met or exceeded all of our core guidance metrics, with accelerating revenue growth both domestically and internationally. This quarter, our numbers are 6, 5, 5 and 3. We achieved 6% domestic advertising growth, 5% domestic affiliate fee growth, 5% international advertising growth, and 3% international affiliate fee growth. It's one great set of numbers, the company is operating on all cylinders and I'm very proud of the team and this quarter's performance. And, we anticipate another quarter of healthy growth in Q3, which Gunnar will take you through in detail.","We've got a nice tailwind at our back, and I believe we are performing at the top end of the television advertising business domestically and perhaps even globally. The television industry is far from dead, here or abroad. Contrary to what many believe, we are getting real meaningful growth from the core TV business around the world, and it feels sustainable.","And our position with the industry has never been stronger. And I believe, poised to grow like no other. HDTV, Food, TLC, ID and OWN, the top networks in America for women. These networks have made us the number one media company for women twenty-five to fifty-four across all of television. The number one media company in America for women, broadcast on cable with a 16% share. A huge accomplishment and meaningful testament to our creative storytellers, our strategy and our network leadership.","This past Sunday night, nearly 35% of the female audience was watching one of our networks. To be clear, there's a lot of great scripted content from any number of great media companies. Really amazing stuff from Disney, Warner, NBC, CBS, Amazon, but it's across an incredibly crowded, expensive and competitive landscape. But there was only one company playing at our level in the other 50% of the content pie, and that's Discovery Inc.","We have the highest quality and recognizable brands that audiences love and tune into more than any other media company, including networks that have the highest length of view and engagement on television. And it's been a hugely successful calling card for us with advertisers which led a robust and comprehensive upfront sales season, delivering record numbers behind healthy CPM increases, reinforced by the prominence and resonance of our brands, the value of our brand-safe and mobile-first go apps and traction for new sales products, like Discovery Premier, which was sold in the upfront for the first time, and has had some super traction within the industry.","On go, we're seeing great traction across all of our apps setting records in total daily streams, much of which doesn't get picked up fully by Nielsen. For Shark Week alone we've seen over one million streams each day.","The performance of this best-in-class platform serves as a great example of how well our content travels within a mobile-first ecosystem, as well as to younger demos. Internationally, our operating momentum feels stronger, than it has been in quite some time, driven by growth in our global audience share across all key regions, continued pay-TV subscriber growth, positive reception to the continued integration of Scripps content, while at the same time promising launches of Food and HD branded lifestyle networks, particularly in Latin America and Europe.","I'm pleased to note that, our linear share of market across our top ten international countries was on average up a healthy 5% in the quarter, with growth in six of the top ten markets, two of which were up double digits. And our audience delivery was up an average of 4% across the top ten. These are terrific results and they're really helping to sustain our overall, international momentum. This tailwind, at a time when there are still, real pockets of macro headwinds, positions us well, if and when certain markets and economies stabilize.","Strategically, Discovery has made a differentiated bet with a different portfolio of IP and assets. We own virtually all of our IP across all territories and platforms, in genres that have great utility and functionality. We have many of the most beloved and iconic brands on the planet, in people's passion areas, home, food, travel, cars, crime, natural history, science, oprah, and live sporting events like the Olympic Games, the PGA Tour, Grand Slam Tennis and cycling.","We produce over 8,000 new hours of original real-life programming a year with unrivalled scale in our genres. A powerful content engine, at a time when the value of IP in our industry has never been more strategically important. Globally, we have nearly 500 free to air and pay-TV channels with roughly ten to twelve in every key market around the globe.","The combination of our strong and trusted brands, and huge reach for marketing and top of funnel promotion, we believe, gives us a real head start when it comes to building a direct consumer portfolio around immersive experiences. Our strategy and approach has been focused on doing that across three broad consumer categories sports, lifestyle, and factual.","First in sports, we have three main products the Eurosport player across all of Europe, Golf TV a fully global platform, and global cycling network. Within Lifestyle, we are working on three different subscription-based offerings, all with different product cycles. First, Motor Trend focused on car lovers, second our new multi-platform Magnolia joint venture with Chip and Joanna Gaines that we are building with plans to launch in 2020, and things are going, terrifically well. And we also continue to actively look at the food and cooking space. And look forward to talking to you more about our plans in that category over the coming months.","And within factual, our soon-to-launch service which brings together the very best of Discovery and BBC real-life content will offer a comprehensive view and do experience, one that is immersive and interactive, across this important vertical, this important family-friendly vertical around the globe.","Additionally, there are three important products in Europe that speak to the breadth and depth of our direct to consumer strategies globally. One, the TVN player in Poland, which is the number one SVOD product in all of Poland. ","Dplay in the Nordics our Hulu like AVOD, SVOD offering which has enjoyed robust growth over the last year. And three, Joyn in Germany, our venture with ProSieben which has gotten off the ground in May to a very solid start. Overall our ambitions are to create strong multi-platform ecosystems, driving opportunities for multiple revenue streams from advertising, subscription revenue, sponsorships, as well as e-commerce retail, as well as instruction across a growing suite of direct-to-consumer platforms and regions.","Underpinning these efforts is our evolving technology stack, which under the direction of Peter Faricy and his team, is being repositioned to drive a better consumer experience, range of efficiencies and functionality, that will allow us to dramatically reduce the resources and time to market for existing and new products.","As many of you will remember, we got Peter from Amazon where he spent over a decade, building Amazon marketplace. We remain excited about both where our business is today, and where we are headed. We are maximizing our position within the core linear ecosystem, generating stable revenue and free cash flow growth, while at the same time, appropriately and judiciously investing to position ourselves for future growth.","At a time of rapid and structural change for our industry, we recognize there are risks, but also great opportunities, and we believe we are as well-positioned as any global player, to capture viewers as they migrate to alternative platforms. And while we are still in the very early stages of launching our global direct -to- consumer verticals, we believe they will provide us with solid long-term runway. ","With that, we are assertively leaning in, where we see opportunities to leverage our breadth, depth and functionality of IP such as in food and home , where we believe that there are many unique ways to reshape our vertical know-how into a more direct and distinctive relationship with our passionate fans around the world. With that, thank you very much.","And I'd like to turn the call over to Gunnar, to take you through our financials.","Gunnar Wiedenfels","Thank you, David, and thank you everyone for joining us today.","I am extremely pleased with our very strong second quarter operational and financial performance, which demonstrated an acceleration across every one of our four core revenue metrics, as well as the progress we are making strategically as we continue to transform and pivot Discovery.","We are performing at a high level and still at the very early stages of leaning in, to the many unique and differentiated growth opportunities we see in front of us. And as such, we are delivering top of industry performance and enjoying the benefits of our scale and presence in the U.S. complemented by our breadth of global distribution, which is uniquely supporting our efforts to build direct-to-consumer and streaming products that power people's passions.","I'd like to share some financial highlights from our second quarter. As always, my comments will be in constant currency terms for our international business and for the total company, unless otherwise stated. And foreign exchange did have a material impact on some of our metrics this quarter. Please refer to our earnings release filed earlier this morning for a more comprehensive view, of all the drivers of our second quarter financial results.","In the second quarter, Discovery again achieved very strong operating performance with 6% U.S. advertising growth, 5% US affiliate growth, 5% international ad growth, which included a one-month impact from the consolidation of the three networks acquired from U.K. TV, which added roughly one percentage point of growth and 3% international affiliate growth.","We also grew total company adjusted OIBDA 7%, a function of our strong revenue growth and the benefit of an 8% decline in U.S. expenses modestly offset by an 8% increase in international costs, which we've previously noted would begin to increase as we invest in our growth businesses.","Additionally, we reported $596 million of free cash flow in the second quarter of 2019, bringing our trailing 12 months of free cash flow to $2.9 billion still, accounting for roughly $200 million of cash restructuring costs. This allowed us to end the quarter with a net leverage ratio of 3.3 times.","Now, let me share some forward-looking commentary. Starting with the four key revenue drivers for the third quarter of 2019. First, for U.S. advertising growth is expected to be in the 3% to 5% range driven by similar dynamics in pricing, monetization and ratings, as usual. Remember, though we are facing a slightly more difficult comp against last year's 5% growth in the third quarter.","Also, please keep in mind, there are some high-profile events this quarter on the Discovery Channel like Serengeti which premiere this Sunday night that will be a key factor in our ratings driven contribution this quarter. If you live in New York City you've no doubt seen a bus or billboard promotion, where all very excited about this series.","Second, U.S. affiliate from today's perspective is likely to grow 5% again in the third quarter. This assumes no major change in subscriber trends beyond what we have seen up until now and while there are indeed a number of both headwinds and tailwinds, we can reaffirm our full year guidance of U.S. affiliate revenue growth in the mid-single digit range, particularly given our best in industry representation across the virtual distribution platforms.","Third, we expect international advertising growth to nicely accelerate driven by share growth in our top markets and contributions from our digital investments, we also expect a full quarter of contribution from the U.K. TV Lifestyle business, which should add an additional two to three percentage points of growth, thus international advertising is expected to grow at least high single digits in Q3.","And finally international affiliate growth is expected to be up mid single digits as we've seen continued improvement in the underlying subscriber trends across a number of markets, aided by continued monetization of our digital streaming products and investments and new channel launches in a number of market.","Turning to total company guidance, we continue to expect another year of healthy free cash flow growth in 2019, even after making the necessary investments to build out our direct to consumer portfolio and the previously noted step-up in CapEx from such items as global real estate consolidation, and transformation projects related to technology infrastructure and software development.","The cadence and magnitude of our investment profile will be determined by the ultimate opportunity set across new and existing initiatives and the level of success based spending, we will need to support these initiatives.","Accordingly, our view on the puts and takes behind our ultimate full year free cash flow has not changed versus what we laid out last quarter. As such, growth will be based on adjusted OIBDA growth and lower cash restructuring charges, partially offset by increased investments in direct to consumer, higher CapEx and higher cash taxes.","We continue to expect a negative impact of our D2C investments on full year 2019 adjusted OIBDA totaling roughly $300 million to $400 million depending on the timing of the rollout of these investments.","And though, we, again, enjoyed another quarter of total company margin improvement, which in Q2 was 100 basis points as we've previously noted, the expected ramp in our digital investment spending will flow through more heavily in the second half of the year.","And with respect to the step-up, Peter and his team are creating a more robust global technology platform to better serve all of our global direct to consumer and streaming businesses. We will discuss this in incremental detail later in the year as we proceed further. However, in terms of scale and scope, our digital products currently operate on over a dozen different owned and operated platforms and depend upon a dozen third party platform.","Streamlining this, will materially boost the functionality and consumer experience as well as the efficiency and speed to market. Dplay, our broad general entertainment AVOD and SVOD app that is very popular in the Nordics is a great example of how much improvement this new technology can produce. Dplay was among the first existing services to migrate to our new platform and we've delivered a marked improvement in consumer experience and reduced churn, resulting in strong subscriber growth, up nearly 150% year-over-year in the second quarter.","Importantly, I believe it is worth calling out once again the acceleration in revenue growth that we're seeing, particularly across our International segment is in large part a function of both a stable core linear business, as well as early traction we are seeing from our direct to consumer and streaming initiatives.","Moving on to taxes. As we had previewed, there was a one-time non-cash $455 million tax benefit in the second quarter, which made our second quarter book tax rate negative 38%. With that we now expect our 2019 full year book tax rate to be in the mid-single digit range. Remember this was a non-cash benefit and there is no impact to our cash taxes or to our free cash flow.","Regarding capital allocation, our priorities have not changed. There is still two, number one optimize leverage and within our 3 to 3.5 times net leverage range we currently plan to continue to prudently delever towards the lower end of this range over time.","Number two, concurrently, we will continue to evaluate value enhancing investments along with strategic M&A. And number three, finally, we will opportunistically return excess capital to shareholders.","Before I close, let me quantify the expected impact that foreign exchange will have on our 2019 results. Given the movement of the dollar at current spot rates, FX is now expected to negatively impact revenues by roughly $185 million to $195 million and OIBDA by $80 million to $90 million versus our 2018 reported results.","In closing, I am very pleased with both the operating performance of the company, our financial and outlook as we continue to generate healthy free cash flow from our stable core business and embrace our global pivot towards direct to consumer media. ","Thank you again for your time this morning. And now David, JB and I will be happy to answer any questions that you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jessica Reif Ehrlich with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Jessica Reif Ehrlich","I have two questions. First for David, can we go back to the U.S. advertising market. I mean it's incredibly robust and besides price you seem to have some of the levers to benefit from the market. You talked about monetizing digital content, maybe a little bit of inventory. Could you give us some color on where you-- what you can pull? And what is the - what are the drivers of demand? I mean, it seems like there is a lot of growth in or will be even more growth in non-advertising platforms like Disney Plus. Is this driving advertisers back into more traditional media?","And then I guess for Gunnar or JB, some of the spending, we saw international expenses go up a lot, which you've talked about, can you talk a little bit more about the benefits that you will derive over time, the tech platforms and anything else you\u2019d want to call out?","David Zaslav","Thanks, Jessica. Well, look the, so the upfront was very strong and leading up to it scatter was strong and it was accelerating. And I think a piece of it is that and I spent a lot of time talking to the agencies as we try and kind of lift ourselves up to where we see broadcast in the high '50s and low '60s and we are still getting CPMs that are much lower. The ability to really sell product, advertisers are finding that television is still one of the most - is the most effective platform to do that, and so I think there is a move back.","In addition to that, there is a feeling of safety, what are you next to? What are you buying? Who is the talent that you're buying? What\u2019s the environment that you are buying? You can do that on television and in digital, there is a fear of that.","And the overall narrative for a lot of these digital companies has changed. And so I think that sets an overall environment that's more positive, but for us this is a big moment for our company. I said, I've said for a while that we have the top four channels in America for women and no one's ever done that before ID, TLC Food, and HG and the number one channel for African American women with OWN.","And we've worked hard to do that, but when you put it all together. We are now the number one TV company in America, in terms of the women we reached, the time they spend with us, it's Discovery.","And as a guy that started out in the cable business and looked to broadcast when I was in New Jersey looking over the river. This is really a big moment, bigger than really great broadcast companies where the centerpiece of their companies are ABC and NBC and CBS. And so the reach that we have with women and to be able to go into upfront with that reach with safe brands with brands that people wake up and want to watch before they go to sleep they want to watch it and the other thing that we have that we\u2019re not proud but we\u2019re trying to really drive is that even though we're the number one place to reach women, the most effective demo, our CPM is less than half of the broadcasters going into the upfront.","And so we've really worked hard on developing some new products. We have Discovery Premier, which is a unique product, which is much higher than our traditional CPM, but why would you spend money on a broadcaster and get a 0.8 when you can come to us and get a six rating on a given nine or five rating or seven rating. And so we made some progress with that.","We're also the only media company I believe that has a really effective authenticated apps and the reason for that is people won't go to, in general, these general interest services and download them to spend time with them, they go to those channels for series and they go to the broadcasters for series.","And so the idea that we're doing over 1 million streams on Discovery and millions of streams where people are getting up and spending time with Food and HG and ID and the average age is in the '20s and the length - and the length of time is quite high.","So overall, we have great safe brands. We have the largest share of women and the advertisers also recognize and this is something I've been saying for a long time is we expect that our share is going to continue to grow that broadcast is sustainably declining in a double-digit fashion. And a lot of those broader services that have reruns and that are competing with the scripted series and scripted movie businesses, more and more the only place to go for quality content that you could see live is us.","And so we had a great, great upfront. We're going to - I think you're going to see some meaningful growth flowing through for the next year, and we feel really - we feel really good about it.","And at this moment, scatter remains strong and for the moment, TV is back, and I think with the lead horse in that game and we're not taking for granted where the world is, that's one of the reasons why we're investing so much in IP with a leader in IP globally and we're deploying that IP around the world and you will see that and you'll see us invest in that for the more sustainable long-term growth. Gunnar?","Gunnar Wiedenfels","Yes, good morning, Jessica. So listen, I could not be happier with the financial profile that you are seeing in this quarter. We're making a lot of progress and we're doing exactly what we said we were going to do.","We continue to benefit from cost synergies. It was another quarter of margin increase, even though I had already spoken about sort of that coming to an end at some point and I had guided to $300 million to $400 million of negative impact from our startup investments in, in the digital space and we're seeing some of that kicking in.","Peter Faricy is coming up on his first year, a lot of the initiatives are picking up speed and to your question on the International expenses. That's what's reflected in that expense number, Golf TV has started its global rollout. There\u2019s obviously IP amortization coming through a digital in general, Dplay, we're pushing.","You also had, you also had the consolidation of UK TV kicking in for one month, that's added on the like-for-like basis, a little bit of expenses. But bottom line is we're making these investments as initiatives start to accelerate and you're already seeing some impact on the revenue side as well.","The very strong numbers in the second quarter, 5% in ad sales growth, 3% on the affiliate side, and maybe you just heard, we're guiding to an acceleration for both metrics. Obviously to some extent it is driven by the first, a contributions from those digital investments. So it's really-- it's really working very well for us.","One last comment I want to make on segment expenses going forward. It's more, it's more insightful to look at the total company cost base because as we went through our transformation, we have shifted around a little bit in the cost base. So a lot of the expenses that JB is now carrying on the D&I segment are going to be leveraged as we roll out those products on a global basis. For 2019, the investments are somewhat D&I-heavy and that's going to, that's going to even out as we move forward. So again, could not be happier with where we are.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Alexia Quadrani","I guess, first off, David, maybe a bigger picture question. You've done, such a fantastic job with the Scripps acquisition and continue to see the benefits clearly in this quarter and the outlook. I guess, I'd love to hear your thoughts on the scale, need for scale, longer term, do you have the portfolio to compete with some of these larger players, some of which you referenced in your opening comments or do you feel it would make sense to continue to kind of look for acquisitions or potentially a merger with someone else to be more competitive. Just I'd love to hear your updated thoughts on the current environment and Discovery is positioning.","And then secondly, just a bit more specific.TLC has been really strong. Ratings are little softer Discovery, I guess any more color you can give there? Are you looking at Serengeti, a sort of a delta to maybe change the rating trends in that channel? And any other program and Discovery maybe Discovery Channel we should look forward to?","David Zaslav","Thanks Alexia. The Scripps transaction has really exceeded our expectations on all levels and you see that in our free cash flow, you see that in the fact that together their quality together with our quality on the leadership side, on the content side, that's what makes us the number one TV company in America for women and positions us to continue to grow in a meaningful way.","When I think of scale I guess, I think of it two ways. One, we're the largest player in the international space. We're the - we're probably the only one, JB will give you a little bit more color making over $1 billion.","But we\u2019re - as the Disney and Comcast deals with Rupert show that the need to view the world as more than just the U.S. and be global. We have infrastructure in every country. We have content in every country. We have credibility and brands and IP in every country. And so scale, I think we have a leader outside the U.S. and we're also the leader in sport so and the quantity of sports that we have and et cetera. So on a scale side in terms of international and sport we are the bigger guy and there is a lot of players that are going to want to try and catch up to us.","In terms of the genres we've chosen, we feel great about it right now - everybody going after script at movies. It's creating an environment that is creating more and more opportunity for us. I've said this before that I think where our share is going to accelerate, but there are so many choices for scripted series and scripted movies and you now have four or five offerings between $6 and $15. And then you have the broadcasters and the big entertainment services.","And so to play in that space, they're going to have to get bigger and bigger in each of them is already kind of indicated they don't have enough IP. They need more stuff, they need more and more and more, and they're talking to us about giving them more, but we're not doing any of that right now we like owning all of our IP. We like the fact that we have great female friendly content mail content and in our genres in the area of food, we are the dominant player in the world.","In the area of home, we are the dominant player in the world. In the area of natural history together with the fact that we bought the entire BBC library globally for more than the next decade, we have the majority of science and natural history. We are the dominant player in the world. In crime, we are the leader. So it depends on how you define things we\u2019re number one for women and with the leader in each of these quality categories that we have chosen.","And then we've picked new categories, which is character different categories, which is Oprah and Chip and Joanna Gaines. So I think we feel pretty good about where we are, we think we're going to continue to grow and as the ecosystem continues to have challenges. I think that challenge is going to be what do I want to watch, where do I get the next scripted series, how many of them do I have stacked up. This 50% of what people watch is that stuff the other 50% is us.","And that's why I think our share is going to continue to grow and that's why I think from our perspective, what we're trying to do to scale up is buy more stuff - get more IP from the BBC, do Golf Digest and lock in Tiger Woods globally with us it's about getting reinforcing in our genres. And no one else is playing in our space. So we think we're in a very good position on TLC Howard Lee is having a great run two years ago - we were dealing with the TLC that was down for a period of 24 months.","And Nancy Daniels and Howard Lee and I dug in this is what we do for a living. We have improved our leadership team now, even more with Kathleen Finch and a lot of the great people from Scripps. So these channels are going to go up and down. We got a great team now with discovery that we have a lot of confidence in. And SERENGETI if you haven't seen it, is I think the best thing that we have seen and some of the best natural history content globally that we pushed out. We put it on Discovery we actually took the last two minutes before SERENGETI started on Sunday and we did a 2-minute promo across every one of our channels.","So if you're watching food, HGTV, ID and that's something we could do that no one does. At 8 o'clock - turn now to SERENGETI on Discovery and it did very well. We're going to get more of the L3, but it did very well and Discovery is back in its core natural history and with all of our BBC, IP, Planet Earth, Frozen Planet, Walking with Dinosaurs, Woolly Mammoths, we are really compelling and formidable.","Operator","Our next question comes from Drew Borst with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Drew Borst","Thank you for the additional detail on some of your streaming initiatives. I wanted to dig in on one of them if I could, which is the PGA streaming service, because I believe you're in the first year of your 12-year arrangement. I think you went live and potentially up to eight markets. So I wonder if you could just share some of the early learnings in this first year, and how that deal is progressing?","David Zaslav","Sure, it's going very well. I'm going to be seeing Jay Monahan tomorrow morning over at Liberty. What led us to this is the fact that we had the Eurosport player and we were going direct to consumer for several years. We've learned a lot about that business and one of them is that you need a lot of content. The actual live sports IP, you need local and you need something that people can always read or learn about or transact with.","And so after a lot of work JB and I - it came to this conclusion that if we could get Golf it's the best IP in the world because it's 52 weeks a year, it's four days a week of loads of IP and 50% of the PGA tours is local then we added in the European tour, the Asian tour, the Latin American tour. And then, we did Golf Digest where we, you can go in and read about any golf course figure out where to take about vacation.","So we are, we're doing very well, some of our bigger markets are going to be coming up on the first of this year. Over the next, by three years from now we'll have everywhere in the world outside the U.S., but we're also attacking the U.S. now as well with Golf Digest and with Tiger. JB just thoughts on direct to consumer, because I think what led us to golf is a lot of what you're doing in the international space?","JB Perrette","Well I think on the golf piece particularly Drew the great news there is also it\u2019s a bit of a two-for-one. We have the great traction that Alex and the team has developed on the product itself in our direct consumer app. And as you said, its early days, but we're seeing great traction and pick up in the first 6 months of the year as the product is launched. And it's also helping us on our core traditional business which is, I know you've heard us talk about the fact that in markets like Japan and Spain where those markets were up earlier this year.","Not only do we expand our relationship on the direct to consumer side, but we leveraged it for our entire portfolio to expand and strengthen with great revenue on our core. We have other key markets like Korea for example to come up next year. And that's a market that today in the Discovery legacy business is way under served. It's a very small market for us and we're using those conversations there to see if we can actually develop additional channel opportunities in our core business.","And so you're seeing that 2 for 1 opportunity of great digital and direct to consumer traction that it will take - continue to take time and accelerate over time. But also more immediate impact of helping our core business through traditional affiliate relationships and broadcast relationships in those markets which are allowing us to launch and accelerate the growth in a couple of those markets.","Drew Borst","And if I could get a follow-up in - probably for Gunnar I wanted to ask about U.S. networks margins. For the past few quarters it\u2019s been hitting 60% of EBITDA margins here. Historically, this is a business that had more typically been caught the mid 50s maybe even low 50s in certain years. I understand your comments about Serengeti and some content, but as we look out over say, the next 12 to 24 months. Is this a business that you think or segment that you think could hover in that high 50s maybe even low 60% vicinity?","Gunnar Wiedenfels","Yes, look I mean Drew a couple of points. Number one, we have been enjoying massive cost synergies from the integration with Scripps and obviously a lot of the U.S. footprint was sort of one-for-one overlap. So that's why you're seeing such a significant share of our cost out hit the U.S. Number 2 is, I made this comment a little earlier already, we got to look at this from a total company basis, because we've been. You see some increase in corporate expenses, which is sort of cost moving out of the U.S. segment.","So, all in all, from a total company basis another 400 basis points of margin increase in the second quarter. And as I said, when we presented the first quarter results, we do not manage the company for margin. The reason why we're seeing that margin increase is just all that cost saving coming through, but it's not an objective for me to keep increasing margins over time it's much more important to make the right investments in the topline. And you're seeing some of that topline growth come through now, which I have guided to previously as well.","That being said, if you look at the U.S. business, I see no reason for margins to decline in the core business there is none of that. However, as you know, we are working on a couple of investment initiatives. And as I said earlier, the first part is really hit D&I a little more in terms of incremental expense that may change next year when we start rolling out products like the BBC factual product some of those, - those are obviously also going to drive cost in the U.S. footprint, but again it's two very separate world, a highly efficient, highly cash generative core business that's in absolutely perfect shape. You've heard our guidance for both at an affiliate revenues gives us a lot of runway. And then the investments in future growth.","Operator","Our next question comes from Doug Mitchelson with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Doug Mitchelson","Thanks so much. I guess a couple of questions, first, David you teased us at the end of your prepared remarks with comments on food and home being reshaped into distinct and direct relationships with fans around the world. So if you could talk about the opportunities you see in that regard, and I think for both you and Gunnar, look, when you start to roll forward to the end of the year, you'll be at the bottom of your leverage target range. I think you've talked about this sort of run rate are approaching $3 billion of free cash flow annually. When you look at the next year, that means $3 billion plus of excess capacity. Are you seeing strategic opportunities to invest that on an inorganic basis, you've certainly been looking for a while. So, any thoughts on that would be helpful? Thanks.","David Zaslav","Okay, look, I think directionally in terms of the industry, this is another area where things are moving our way. You talked to Hans and he\u2019s talking about 5G.You talk to Randall, he is driving 5G.What is 5G? 5G is not about being able to download a movie in six second in two seconds versus seven seconds, it's about providing real utility in value in the home.","And the question is, okay, now that we got it. What do we do with it, and this is where the content that we have. If, whoever can own the kitchen is going to own the home and where the people spend money? They spend it in the home. They spend it on their home office, on their living room, on their kids room.","And so we have these genres with food and cooking and with HG and now DIY will be relaunching as Magnolia with Chip and Jo. We have the greatest experts in both of these areas. We have credible - content needs to be curated, purchases need to be curated and if you, if you look at what everyone else is doing with scripted series and scripted movies, they're creating fantastic, robust, better than ever viewing experience is a script of movies and series and that's great.","So you can watch Fleabag, which by the way is one of the - is one of the all three production companies, and one of the big hits on Amazon. So all you can do is view it. That's great. You can view it and laugh or cry but that's it. You just view it.","Our content has a real ability to view and do or view and transact. So imagine a world where you've got a lot of people fighting for subscribers that people pay a monthly fee for and all they can do is view but our content has subscribers but they can also transact. That's true in food, it's true in home, it's true in Golf, it's true in cycling, and if you go back to the world that Malone helped create in terms of full circle,100 channels, and then he has HSN and QVC that he owned but in running QVC and HSN and creating a lot of shareholder value along the way, it was, it's completely inefficient and a lot of the people that were on food at home were going over and trying to get an audience to come over and spend time with them on QVC or HSN and buy stuff.","Stuff that they really wanted that needed to be - that they wanted to know what is the - what's the best, what's the best kitchenware. And so what we can do over time and we're fighting like hell to do it is if we can aggregate these passion groups, not only are they going to view with us, but they're going to be able to do with us.","So we view the home and 5G is, we're having discussions with everyone, how do we take all of our expertise, all of our talent or and all the content that we have and create some real utility. So I would say, stay tuned, but the Holy Grail to aggregate audiences globally that have a passion and then to be able to have them hit a button and go on to Golf vacation by the Golf clubs that they love, where we're Tigers wearing, get a recipe and get all the groceries. So that's what we're working on. We're working real hard on it and stay tuned.","Doug Mitchelson","Thanks. And on the M&A side.","Gunnar Wiedenfels","Well, yes. Let me start I mean you made reference to a leverage in the free cash flow. So just before David answer the M&A question, continue to be super excited about our free cash flow development. You saw that we have $2.9 billion end of Q2. Still, after $200 million of cash restructuring, I've also spoken to the sort of key puts and takes for the rest of the year.","A good part of that, the cash tax increase has already come through in the first half. Whereas some of the CapEx increase digital investments are going to kick in a little more in the second half of the year. But bottom line is feeling very good and we really only just started on free cash flow improvement.","As you saw, our leverage has come down slightly 3.5 to now 3.3, also probably not a bad thing in the current environment, so we're happy with that progress as well. And regarding M&A and David will add more, but we're very happy with our hand. But obviously, continue to evaluate strategic opportunities but David is there anything else you want to add?","David Zaslav","We're always looking opportunistically, but we don't see anything as significant at this point, Bruce Campbell and JB or we kick the tires on everything. We have the UKTV deal was quite good for us. I mean, maybe can you update on that and what you are looking at some of the things that you're, that you think could make sense.","Gunnar Wiedenfels","We do see opportunities as you know, part of our strategy as we've bought the Scripps assets is to really try and take HG and food around the world and we see there is an opportunity there. We have selectively looked at, at bringing in either assets that help us rebrand UKTV's an example will bring in there to food and home channels into the portfolio on a consolidated basis, rebrand them HG and food network and then take those off and really try and drive that with the Scripps content as the bedrock of it.","And then there is additional channel opportunities which we're looking at selectively to accelerate the core where we can buy a Channel positions or slots to get some of those channels launched in additional markets in addition to organic ways that we're doing it. So we do see opportunities on the sort of smaller mid-scale to tuck-in and rolling some things that we think can help accelerate our core business.","David Zaslav","And there are some smaller players that are, that are coming to JB and saying much bigger. I have a lot of infrastructure and cost here. There are some things that we could do to get. And so in some cases you've created advertising country-by-country advertising groups and tucked-in some smaller players, what we've gotten the benefit of CPM. There all others that want us to do things for them. Who want to tuck-in with us because it's tough to be playing in this space in 200 countries when you have where you have to, where you don't have a lot of scale.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Ben Swinburne","David or JB, when you look at your D2C portfolio. I think you've got four services in the market and I think you've listed out seven in your prepared remarks. I was just curious how you think about the longer-term strategy. Are you looking to sort of build specific verticals and kind of tie those verticals back to your linear brands or were you also thinking about potentially pulling some of these together, for example, the sort of Magnolia food and cooking factual stuff into a single app.","And I'm just wondering how you think about how the universe evolves, given the sort of explosion of these kind of streaming services around the world and also how you think about putting these to the U.S. or if you view the U.S. market is sort of fundamentally different, just given the maturity of the pay-TV model here.","And then just on the same topic, maybe for Gunnar on the numbers. Can you help us at all to think about that $300 million to $400 million as we roll into next year? I don't know if you have line of sight there yet or want to talk about it but do you expect to start scaling that cost base or do you expect investments to ramp and lean in more any color at this point would be helpful. Thanks guys.","David Zaslav","Well, look, I have talked a lot about us aggregating IP and being the leading global IP company. We now have a company that's growing mid-single in its core business even against us investing significantly and holding on as Gunnar says. As you see the BBC Natural History Library, all of the, most of the PGA, most of the PGA and the European Tour, and most of the golf in the world.","And so most of the cycle, a lot of the cycling in the world so we've been adding up all this IP because we believe being above the globe is going to give us a huge opportunity to create significant value. And if some of it works in ways that we think we could create real businesses that you guys give a huge multiple to. In order to do that and we've been trying it for a while. We've learned a lot. And what we are doing different than anybody else is we have core New Media and Digital people running these businesses now.","We have had our existing - great TV, cable strategic business executives that we're doing all these things. A few years ago and we were in the trenches fighting, talking to consumers, dealing with platforms and in the end we said, we got to bring in the pros. And so, we brought in Peter Faricy who built marketplace and worked at Amazon for more than a decade. We brought - the best product people from Amazon over here. We brought two people from DIRECTV.","One that built DIRECTV from 12 million subscribers to 20 that all about SAC and subscriber acquisition and Karen Leever and Alex Kaplan who built SUNDAY TICKET. And so, we brought people that do this for a living. And I saw this when I was on the Board of Sirius. It's a different business subscriber acquisition, so we have a whole new team and we've hired, we have well over 100 engineers. We have a whole team that we're building in Redmond.","And so, we see that as a real separate company that is going to disrupt our industry, but we're not going to disrupt ourselves by getting somebody who ran Eurosport to now built the Eurosport player and build our golf business. We're hiring the people that - were disrupting us. And so, I think that gives us - one advantage but JB a little bit of color on your side.","JB Perrette","Yeah, I think Ben, to your question and to the early question also about how we see scale. The reality is we don't look at - in the traditional lens we look at our competitors is the normal lot that we talk about the Disney\u2019s and NBC the CBS. In the direct-to-consumer world, all of them are trying to build out these supermarkets a video and it's very expensive and so far very cash flow negative. Our strategy and that space is frankly less about them as competitors and more about building out what we sort of look at as much more specialty stores.","And in those specialty stores unlike them, we're building out services that are only watch, we are watch, play, learn buy and that's how we see ourselves is very different. And we do see ourselves of having a portfolio of these some may be over time 10 million, 20 million, 30 million, 40 million, 50 million subs some maybe single-digit million subs. But that portfolio in aggregate, we think has huge potential when you roll it out globally.","David Zaslav","Go ahead.","Gunnar Wiedenfels","And then - Ben on your second question regarding scaling digital expenses it's obviously a little bit too early to talk about guidance for next year. But a couple of points I want to make that we have spoken about in the past as well. We will be flexible here and we're not afraid to get behind what's working if we won\u2019t something. But just the same way, we've also pulled back on some other products where we didn't see the progress that we needed to get comfortable with additional investments.","And so, expect us to be aggressive if we're onto something and very careful where we're not seeing the progress that we need. And again, if you look at it from a top down perspective spending somewhere between 5% and 10% of our underlying a, little bit up or for future growth it doesn't sound crazy. It's not betting the farm, but on the other hand it's enough to potentially make a difference - sooner rather than later.","Ben Swinburne","Yes, makes sense. Thanks for the color everybody.","David Zaslav","The last point is the cost of driving these. I've talked about this before, but we have all these channels. We have free to air channels with - equivalent of NBC and CBS in a number of markets in Europe. We have 10 to 12 cable channels everywhere. So people are watching us in these affinity groups already and we have scale. And so the ability to, we don't have to go out and buy and to tell people to sign up for a particular product.","We can be promoting it from the ground up, which I think is a, as a real helper. And finally, in a really confusing environment, the real question for the future is curation. What the hell do I do? I got a choice of everything and so, you have - all the media saying come to me I got great movies in great scripted, let me tell you about this next great scripted series I have and spending a ton of money in order to tell people hey, come to Amazon. I got Fleabag. The Crown is back - re-subscribe or don't churn. And for us we have existing infrastructure so, and that's one of the reasons that the PGA came to us.","For a fan company you have to have existing infrastructure and we have personalities. When people don't know how to curate they go to personalities\u2019 that's been true for long as time. And so, you want to know what's going on in golf, Tiger Woods I talked to the PGA players.","If you want to know what's going on in the home talk to Chip and Joanna Gaines they'll curate it for you. You want to think about how to make your life better come talk to Oprah and she will make a lot of recommendations for you about what you can do and what she loves. And so, we're a company of those - we think those personalities are going to be real bridges to curation, the Property Brothers.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.","Michael Nathanson","I have a couple for David, JB first one is, you guys called out the growth in international viewing share. And I wonder how much of that share can you attribute to the Scripps integration I know that was one of the assumptions you had the Scripps would help. So anything you should share about what you've seen with Scripps is content internationally. And then could you quantify for international, how big is that, is the benefit from those international players that you've developed. So is that becoming a meaningful driver of the growth that you're now talking about?","JB Perrette","So for the international share and audience growth is really driven by 2 or 3 factors. Number one is, our core organic content, we've been working hard to try and improve the performance of it local commissioning, better investment reviews on a content commissioning and re-commissioning. And so, we're seeing stronger performance of our organic particularly local content in some of our biggest markets.","The second is, we've obviously been a year into making the Scripps content work hard largely initially on our own networks to try and strengthen and see how we can actually introduce audiences, because I think part of this that people forget is a lot of these content types in some markets where the content was not yet seen you need to introduce it.","We've seen this in Latin America, where we had the Scripps content actually licensed in on our networks for several years and it took almost 18 to 24 months initially in those markets several years ago to get the audiences' introduced to it - accustomed to it and then liking it.","And what's great is we track now month to month the performance since we started hearing this content in sort of third and the second quarter, third quarter last year. Ad we've seen continuous improvements in the performance of the content on our existing networks. So that's the second sort of key driver.","The third is, we are obviously now seeing opportunities to launch whole channels, which you've seen us do in Germany. We're obviously rebranding in the UK with the UK TV assets. We've launched a series of channels, we have commitments for more launches in Latin America for HG and food to get those channels, almost 50% plus distributed across the market. And so we're seeing a big opportunity there.","The monetization is coming I'd say we've only seen the beginning of it, because at the end of the day we've seen the beginning of it from a licensee perspective in the markets where we launched those channels as pay. And the audience improvements where we put the content on our existing networks. But what we haven't seen yet, which Dave talked to which the team here in the U.S. do so well is really the strength of these assets is the endemic categories that they own and the ability from an advertising perspective, sell sponsorship and high CPM packages to these endemic categories.","And that's the piece that we're continuing to rework and we see great upside over the next several quarters as we get better and better internationally at selling that endemic category uniquely now that we have the channels of the product, working better over time. So we see continued growth on the distribution side and we see an accelerating growth from the beginning to be able to monetize those audience as much better in this endemic categories.","David Zaslav","Can I add one point Michael, I mean if you remember back when we close the deal. We talked about this international Scripps opportunity as sort of three layers. The first layer being the cost savings that we got very quickly then utilizing the content on our existing platforms and then, we said that launching the networks was going to take some time. And we're now at the point where we're actually seeing some of that happening and contributing to our numbers.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Rich Greenfield with TBD. Your line is open.","Rich Greenfield ","Just two quick one. One, on David, you were talking before about the importance of bringing in Peter Faricy because things like churn and subscriber acquisition are new. I guess as you look back over the last year, what are you learning like how do you keep a subscriber for the full year. And how are you, how do you start thinking about what the charge for a service relative to the lifetime value given churn at all the things that go on in a direct-to-consumer subscription business and then I've got a quick follow-up.","David Zaslav","We learned a lot, the way people consume content on a small screen is very different. You don't go to a TV and rub your finger on it and expect it to get an update. And when you get up in the morning and you're paying for something you expect to see something. So one of the things that we learned very early on is that you need, you need IP, it needs to be updated regularly and we also began to understand that the definition of IP is different than what we thought. We thought it's just professional content, it's Planet Earth, then it's frozen Planet or it's live content on the PGA or the U.S. Open.","That is maybe one of the reasons that they're buying it. But one of the other reasons is that they are passionate about the particular area. They're in. So the reason we bought Golf Digest, and the reason that we did the deal with Tiger and the reason that we have a lot of the PGA players working with us is the short-form content that they create every day. What they're eating for breakfast. What they're working on, what they hate about their game or content that their teddy takes of them on the hitting practice shots or trick shots. That's all IP.","What they're worried about in writing is IP and so one of the - what Peter had to build and what we're building, we brought one of the best technical people over from Amazon, is our Chief Technology Officer, is this idea of one global platform that we can use for natural history, for Golf, for science and it's, we're investing up but it's a lifetime global value that we can put on that.","And so we learn that you need to multi-published through the day, we learn that you need real usable bite sized content in addition to the long-form content, so Golf Digest is a great example of people are hanging around, they want to see what are the best clubs. What are the best drivers. They want to take a planning lesson. They want to learn about where to take a Golf vacation in Australia and Golf Digest has all of that.","And when we bought that we also got the authority on Golf in the world. Jerry Tardy and the greatest editorial staff, the greatest photo library on Golf and then we put it together with the PGA and so we would have never done that before, but we understood that just owning the tours was not enough.","And so, and then we can - so that\u2019s one. And the second thing we learned is if you're in passion groups. We have an opportunity that the rest of those guys don't have and that's free funnel, that's advertiser driven and pay.","So ultimately, what you might see for Natural History, what you might see for science or for Golf or for cycling or for Chip and Jo is you have a funnel like Eurosport.com is free, gets 30 million people a month come there, that's, that really is an advertiser platform.","And so ultimately maybe there is a 100 million people that come to Golf for free, but they are kind of pre-screened. They are they because they love Golf, they want to see scores, they want to see what people are wearing, they want to see what's going on in the Golf world and we've aggregated then all those people that love Golf, that's an advertising platform. That's like a global broadcast network for Golf. We're global broadcast network for home, the Chip and Jo are doing and that's free but we make advertising dollars.","That's the new broadcast network of the future and instead of being trying to be something for everyone, they are hanging out there and they go there, all the time. That's number one. And then, of those people, how many of them want to be able to take the free Golf lessons from Tiger Woods?","How many of them want to be able to see all the tours and see them and see them live on their device, maybe it's 10% of them, maybe it\u2019s 3%, maybe it's 40%, but that's the pay model. And so we end up, you're not going to have a lot of people hanging around for free monetizing with advertising on Netflix, but for us we have this ability to create a massive funnel and we've already done it with Eurosport.com.","We are, where the leader around in Europe, what people come and they hang out with us for free. We don't think that that's a little thing. We think that could be a huge thing if we aggregate people that love these affinity groups and advertise it and put sponsors on it and then you go up to the next level and you pay but we created a whole ecosystem.","Rich Greenfield","Then just a quick, just. Okay, go ahead guys.","Gunnar Wiedenfels","Yes, I guess the only thing I'd add to David's point is I think a lot of also with Peter is brought in over the last year, which is maybe the less sexy and seemingly less but is absolutely critical look, we've been a great content company for three, over three decades and inherently in that great stories rely on great creative instinct and got the product side of the world, as you know well is much more of a databased environment and Peter has driven a discipline and a cadence now with all of our teams, which starts with the data, starts with everything we see with the data and trying to collect it in a way we can actually use it and using that to drive better UX better distribution, looking at stream quality, buffering rates, customer service response times all the kind of blocking and tackling elements of great product experiences that are still a little bit sort of for and to traditionally content media companies.","He's brought a lot of that discipline and infused it or direct-to-consumer organization and frankly infused it across the entire leadership team and I think that's a lot of also what you're seeing in the biggest proof point of that is, I think you've heard us maybe talk about in deep play in the Nordics, part of our problem a year plus ago was we had a two star rated app that was not well distributed and over the course of the last six to nine months, we now, all of sudden have a four plus store rated app that is getting strong customer reviews, our customer response times have gotten better on feedback and responses to the consumer.","And so part of the product piece of this is also been a huge improvement. We still got a long way to go, but it's a big step forward for us.","Rich Greenfield","Just a quick follow-up for Gunnar, I think you're the only media company that\u2019s going to report Q2 with subscriber trends improving driven by vMVPD carriage deals you've signed over the last 12 months. Bunch of your peers have certainly been talking about the challenges facing the vMVPD that they raise price. I'm just curious as you look at Q2, 2019 versus Q1, 2019, if you add up all the major vMVPD, is the vMVPD universe net growing flat or actually shrinking due to the price increases, how should we think about that universal of subscribers.","Gunnar Wiedenfels","Well, it's certainly growing, again I don't want to go into and do a lot of detail, but it's certainly growing. And clearly, we have gone from some people calling out to have not, not even a year ago to best distribution in the entire affiliate landscape both traditional and virtual and you see that reflected in not only subscriber numbers, but also our revenue growth rate.","David Zaslav","And look the marketplace here in the U.S., it's yearning for sports and retrans slammed down, prices going up every year, extenuating you will - you pay for the sports network then you pay for the regional sports network and a sport and then every broadcaster also has their own sports network and then they use sports to drive retransmission and the ratings on every one of them is going down.","And so there is, there is a reckoning, there\u2019s a slam down, that's going to come and when that slammed down comes, the consumers in the U.S. are going to get the content that they want, and the content that they spend time with, and then we're going to be like every other country in the world where we will have a $20 or $25 service.","I don't have the services that people want and will have, will have a huge piece of that because we have the quality of content that people like that they're spending time with and they are not being forced to carry us. They're coming to - every one of those platforms came to us, because we were the top choices of the consumers, but every one of them is being forced to carry retrans being forced to carry regional sports and forced to carry those sports networks.","And there is a reckoning coming because the consumers don't like it and, all of those MVPD's that are stuck with those fees are pissed and it's going to come a moment when it's enough and that's what you're seeing now you're saying it's enough, I'm looking at the numbers and it's enough.","Operator","Thank you.

Joining me today is David Zaslav, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Andy Warren, our Chief Financial Officer. You should have received our earnings release. But if not, feel free to access it on our website at www.discoverycommunications.com.","On today's call, we will begin with some opening comments from David and Andy. After which, we will open the call up for your questions. [Operator Instructions]","Before we start, I would like to remind you that comments today regarding the company's future business plans, prospects and financial performance are forward-looking statements that we make pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Zaslav","Thanks, Craig. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Discovery's consistent financial growth and strong operating momentum continued during the third quarter as our diverse family of brands and deep content portfolio attracted larger audiences around the globe enabling us to capitalize on a stable worldwide ad environment. At the same time, we further exploited the evolution of pay television across our unique international distribution platform and took further advantage of some of the opportunities that our recent strategic acquisitions provide.","As we maximize the synergies associated with the SBS Nordic assets, our strategic priority remains exactly the same: Invest in high-quality content with broad and diverse appeal in those geographic locations that provide the most significant, long-term advertising and affiliate opportunities. This underlying focus has allowed us to keep our organic growth story strongly intact, as evidenced by our double-digit revenue and profit growth this quarter, excluding acquisitions. And this growth is broad based, with advertising and distribution revenues expanding nicely across both our domestic and international portfolios.","Equally as important, by incrementally spending only on those brands and regions that have demonstrated meaningful upside, we can ensure that the majority of the revenue growth over the long term will fall directly to our bottom line, delivering sustained organic margin expansion, even as we invest in future growth. While investing judiciously is important in all facets of our business, it is especially true domestically, given the maturity level and competition in the U.S. market.","Over the last several years, we have continuously expanded market share, grown ad revenues and delivered profit growth in the U.S., even as we invested in developing many new brands and strengthening our existing flagships. Since 2008, we have built several new networks off our existing distribution, including Investigation Discovery, Destination America, OWN, Hub and Velocity, while refocusing our existing networks such as Animal Planet and Science and reinforcing our 2 biggest networks, Discovery and TLC.","Our targeted investment spend domestically has resulted in sustained audience growth, with viewership across our portfolio, up nearly 60% over the last 5 years. This past quarter, Discovery's domestic networks delivered their best third quarter ever, with viewership among key adult 25 to 54 demo, up 10% in prime time, led by 18% growth at the Discovery Channel.","Discovery Channel produced record third quarter ratings, led by the best Shark Week in our history with over 50 million viewers tuning in. Remarkable, given that it has been on the air for 26 years. Shark Week's longevity, along with the success this past quarter of returning favorites, Deadliest Catch and Fast N' Loud, demonstrates the depth and range of Discovery's content and the enduring power of our mission to deliver high-quality content that satisfies curiosity. And with new hits such us Naked and Afraid joining the stable and a slate of exciting new content in the pipeline, Discovery Channel is poised to continue captivating audiences and delivering value to advertisers and affiliates.","Our 2 other fully distributed networks also delivered nice viewership growth this past quarter. TLC was up 4% in its key female demographic, led by Sister Wives, Breaking Amish and Here Comes Honey Boo Boo.","We continue to work to drive our relationship with our viewers through social media. Earlier this month, TLC paired the strength of Long Island Medium's Theresa Caputo, one of our most popular characters, with the power of Twitter in a season premiere that allowed fans to tweet to win a reading and maybe see their tweet on TV in real time. With live cut-ins of Theresa throughout the night, TLC had its most social day ever, generating more than 1 million tweets and 8 Twitter trending topics, and starting to prove out that Twitter and TV can be powerful partners.","And Animal Planet increased viewership 5% this past quarter, driven by returning hit, Call of the Wildman and freshman series, Treehouse Masters, both of which delivered over 1.3 million viewers, helping Animal Planet finish as a top 20 network for men for the third consecutive quarter.","The viewership gains across our flagship networks certainly fueled the overall portfolio growth during the quarter, but we also continued to develop our newest growth engines. ID was up 5% in its key demo, as it remains a top 10 network during the day and is the top ranked network in all of television for length of tune.","Destination America was up 18% this quarter among adults 25 to 54 and is delivering real value for advertisers. And Velocity, the fastest growing men's lifestyle network on cable, was up nearly 30% versus the third quarter a year ago, as it delivered its best quarter ever.","The combination of ratings growth and a relatively healthy ad market enabled us to deliver another quarter of double-digit ad gains during Q3. And looking ahead, with sustained ratings momentum, a strong upfront under our belt, cancelations that are still at low levels and a scatter market that thus far remains robust, we remain confident that we can deliver sustained advertising growth moving forward.","The ratings and advertising success we are enjoying across our consolidated domestic portfolio also extends to our joint venture networks. The Hub delivered its eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth this past quarter among kids 2 to 11 in Total Day. While OWN continued its torrid pace, with its highest quarter ever, growing over 50% in prime time versus the third quarter a year ago. OWN's multifaceted success has been driven by Oprah, Tyler Perry's 2 new hit series and Saturday's powerful lineup of Iyanla: Fix My Life, Welcome to Sweetie Pie's and Six Little McGhees. The overall rating growth is translating into significant advertising gains. And when combined with the affiliate fees that the channel had previously locked in, OWN was able to deliver additional cash flow back to Discovery this past quarter.","Discovery's third quarter results also further demonstrate the value of owning the vast majority of our programming, as we recognized additional revenue under our existing license agreements. Owning our content provides flexibility regarding when and how we monetize our content library. We remain platform agnostic with regards to distributing our programming and continue to explore additional opportunities to extract value while operating within the existing pay-TV ecosystem.","As we continue to build new avenues of growth across the more mature U.S. business, the bigger opportunity remains the potential of our international portfolio, where we are diligently applying our targeted investment approach to exploit our unparalleled market position and capitalize on those areas with significant upside from the evolution of pay television and the developing global advertising landscape.","Discovery's thoughtful investment over the last 2 decades in securing distribution and establishing relationships with key affiliates, suppliers and advertisers in each market has given us a huge head start internationally. But it's the additional steps we have taken over the last several years to take advantage of our market position that is driving such strong results today and will allow us to continue to grow even as pay-TV penetration growth begins to slow eventually.","As markets have developed, we have aggressively opened new offices in key countries, like Turkey, the Ukraine and India, to closely connect with an evolving middle class. At the same time, we have established in-house sales functions in markets where the revenue opportunity dictated a more hands-on approach, such as Russia, Colombia and Argentina. On the content side, we've increased our programming spend internationally by over 80% since 2010 to capitalize on market opportunities, including broadening the reach of our female flagship, TLC, into over 165 countries, making TLC the most distributed women's brand in the world from a standing start 24 months ago. Also expanding the footprint of our successful investigative and forensic content into 150 countries with ID, and we expect to approach 180 countries in the year ahead; or launching the kids network recently across Asia. All in, over the last 3 years, we have launched over 60 new feeds and 5 new languages to satisfy the growing demand for our content, and the strong revenue growth we are delivering today is certainly due in a large part to the this targeted investment.","The strength and local feel of our suite of network brands, Discovery, Science, Animal Planet, ID and TLC, bringing 5 channels, which share content and content that we own and reach a diversified demographic of both men and women is really working. Together with the significant subscriber growth we are experiencing in many markets around the world, the result is more and more viewers connecting with our suite of networks, providing sustainable market share growth and corresponding ad growth this quarter of 29%.","While it is certainly difficult to predict how the various international markets will perform going forward, we remain optimistic about our long-term growth prospects, given the platform we have built, the investments we have made and the growth we are delivering today, despite a relatively slow economic climate in many of the countries we operate in. As we continue to invest in our organic growth initiatives, we're also making significant strides integrating our recent SBS Nordic acquisition. The joint ad sales team we've assembled is closing deals in the spot market, while preparing upfront presentations to message during the first quarter that lay out the compelling content offering and value proposition we can deliver to ad clients.","On the cost side, we have carefully eliminated any redundant positions and consolidated physical locations where appropriate, while programming teams have identified thousands of hours of content that can be shared across the combined portfolio.","It's still early days, but after digging in, we remain certain that the combined entity of SBS Discovery Media further strengthens the unmatched platform Discovery has built up over the last 2 decades and helps to bolster the long-term growth outlook of our international portfolio.","Overall, we head into the fourth quarter of 2013 with continued financial and operating momentum as we execute on our strategic priorities. Our focus remains building out our diverse set of brands and further developing our global distribution platform for long-term growth, while delivering consistent financial results. At the same time, given our strong balance sheet and the free cash flow we are generating, we are committed to returning additional capital to shareholders, so we can further build shareholder value.","And with that, I will turn the call over to Andy.","Andrew C. Warren","Thanks, David, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. As David highlighted, Discovery's financial momentum continued during the third quarter as we delivered double-digit underlying revenue and OIBDA growth by further executing upon our key strategic growth initiatives in a relatively healthy global operating environment.","On a reported basis, total company revenue in the third quarter increased 28%, led by 10% domestic and 59% international growth, which included several newly acquired businesses, most notably SBS Nordic, as well as additional licensing revenue primarily related to our deal with Netflix. Excluding these items and the impact of foreign currency, total company revenue growth was 12%.","Total operating expenses on a reported basis increased 34%, primarily due to the inclusion of newly acquired businesses. Excluding these acquisitions, the additional cost related to our Netflix agreement and the impact from foreign currency movements, total company expenses increased 12% versus the prior year due to the expected higher content amortization and marketing spend during the quarter.","As we highlighted on previous earnings calls, underlying operating expense growth will meaningfully abate in the fourth quarter. However due to anticipated several onetime expense items, which will result in reported operating expense growth similar to Q3. These onetime items include a charge related to the recently announced termination of our program and agreement with the BBC, as well as additional content impairment expense largely associated with the recent management change at TLC.","On a reported basis, adjusted OIBDA in the third quarter increased 20%, excluding newly acquired businesses, the licensing agreements and foreign exchange. Discovery's continued ability to generate revenue growth in excess of expenses while also investing in sustained future growth opportunities translated into a robust 11% increase in adjusted OIBDA.","Net income increased to $256 million in the third quarter, up 24%, driven by the strong operating performance across the company; $22 million of better equity results, primarily due to significant improvements at OWN; and a $19 million gain related to the sale of our Petfinder business. These items were partially offset by $29 million of higher tax expense, $12 million of increased interest expense related to the additional debt we issued in March of this year and $53 million [ph] of increased amortization expense, primarily related to the purchase accounting associated with the SBS Nordic acquisition.","As I mentioned last quarter, the SBS purchase price allocation to amortizable trademarks, distribution contracts, broadcast licenses and other assets results in additional amortization expense for the last 9 months of 2013 of about $130 million with a similar amount anticipated for the 12 months of 2014.","Earnings per diluted share for the third quarter was $0.71, 29% above the third quarter a year ago. Adjusted earnings per diluted share, a more relevant metric from a comparability perspective as it excludes the impact from noncash acquisition amortization of intangible assets, was $0.80 compared to $0.55 in Q3 2012, a 45% improvement.","Free cash flow increased 24% in the quarter to $438 million, as the strong operating performance and lower tax payments primarily resulting from the extension of the accelerated content cost recovery under Section 181, was partially offset by higher content investment. Content spend year-to-date is up only mid-single digits, excluding the newly acquired businesses. And as David highlighted, the increased programming spend continues to pay off in terms of rating momentum and higher advertising revenue.","Before I move on to the divisional results, I do want to highlight that while not part of our reported free cash flow, OWN accelerated its cash repayments to Discovery during the third quarter, as the joint venture paid down approximately $20 million of its total outstanding obligation. For the fourth quarter of this year, we expect OWN to further accelerate its cash repayments to Discovery, while generating positive equity income for the first time in the joint venture's history.","Now turning to the operating units. The U.S. Networks continued to perform well during the third quarter, with total reported domestic revenues of 10%, including 10% distribution revenue growth due in part to additional licensing revenue. Excluding the additional licensing revenue, total domestic revenue increased 8% with distribution revenues up 5%, predominantly from higher rates and to a lesser extent, additional digital subscribers. Please note that we do not anticipate significant additional licensing revenue under our existing agreements during the fourth quarter of this year.","The U.S. Network ad sales team generated another quarter of strong growth in Q3, translating to higher delivery, most notably from Discovery Channel, Animal Planet and Destination America, as well as higher pricing across all networks into 12% advertising growth versus the third quarter a year ago. Thus far in the fourth quarter, the current market trends continue to be encouraging with scatter pricing up double digits from the mid to high single-digit gains we garnered during our recent upfront negotiations. We do, however, have fewer premiere hour scheduled for the remainder of the year versus the same period a year ago. But given the strong market conditions, we still anticipate high single-digit advertising growth in the fourth quarter.","Turning to the cost side. Domestic operating expenses were up 11% from the third quarter 2012, primarily due to anticipated higher content amortization associated with the increased programming cash spend over the past few years, additional content costs associated with digital licensing agreements and higher marketing costs for series on TLC and ID. Domestic adjusted OIBDA increased 10% on a reported basis versus last year's third quarter and 6% excluding the impact of licensing agreements.","Turning to our international operations, current quarter reported results reflect the impact of newly acquired businesses, SBS Nordic, Switchover Media and Fatafeat. For comparability purposes, however, my following international comments will refer to the results excluding these acquisitions.","Our international segment continued to deliver strong momentum across our global operations this past quarter, with revenues expanding 14%, led by 27% ad and 11% affiliated growth. Excluding the impact of exchange rates, total revenue growth was 18%, with advertising revenue increasing 29% and affiliate revenue up 14%. The advertising revenue growth clearly benefited from the impact of the Olympics a year ago, but we delivered broad-based increases with double-digit growth across every region, led by Western Europe, mainly from the continued success of several of our free-to-air initiatives, particularly in Italy and Spain; and by Latin America, from higher pricing and delivery across the regions.","On the affiliate front, the year-on-year 14% increase was driven by subscriber growth, especially in Latin America from the continued expansion of pay television in Brazil and Argentina, as well as by the consolidation of Discovery Japan. Excluding Japan, our international affiliate revenue growth would have been up high single digits.","Operating costs internationally were up 19%, excluding the currency impact, primarily driven by higher content amortization, increased personnel costs, as we further expand our global footprint, and the consolidation of Discovery Japan. The international segment delivered 17% adjusted OIBDA growth in the third quarter, excluding newly acquired businesses and foreign currency, as the international team continued to significantly grow revenues on investing in long-term growth initiatives.","Taking a look at our financial position, with a strong balance sheet and sustained financial and operating momentum, we continue to return capital to shareholders through execution of our share repurchase program. As we've discussed, our first priority remains investing in our core businesses to drive sustained long-term growth, be it through investing in existing networks and platforms or through exploring acquisition opportunities. While that remains our core focus, given the healthy free cash flow we are generating, our gross leverage targets and strong long-range free cash flow per share growth assumptions, we had the opportunity to continue returning capital to shareholders, as well as investing in our global businesses.","During the third quarter, Discovery repurchased nearly $450 million of stock, and we still anticipate buying back a similar amount of stock this year as we did in 2012. Since we began buying back shares towards the end of 2010, we have spent over $4 billion buying back shares, reducing our outstanding share count by more than 87 million shares or 21%.","Turning to the remainder of 2013, we are encouraged by the sustained momentum across our portfolio and the continued strong ad sales trend we are seeing both domestically and internationally. Therefore, despite the additional fourth quarter onetime expenses I mentioned earlier, we are leaving our total year guidance unchanged. For the full year 2013, we still expect total revenues to be between $5.55 billion and $5.625 billion, adjusted OIBDA to be between $2.425 billion and $2.475 billion and net income to be between $1.1 billion and $1.15 billion.","Thanks again for your time this morning. And now David and I will be more than happy to address your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne, Morgan Stanley.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","David, I was wondering if you could comment a bit on the domestic TV Everywhere conversations. And the reason I'm asking is when you look at your results, you can see the value of your content coming through in the ad sales and digital licensing. And when you listen to the cable operators, who I know you're intimately involved with, they talk about the need for TV Everywhere to be pushed more aggressively, yet we seem to not be seeing as many deals as we would expect, particularly in your -- at your company. So if you could spend a minute on what the issue is and how you think this gets resolved and then maybe any timing around that as you head into another renewal discussion at the end of this year, I think that would be helpful. And then I just have a quick follow-up for Andy on corporate. The press release makes the corporate cost drop sound recurring. I just wanted to see if you could comment on that as we look into Q4.","David M. Zaslav","Thanks, Ben. Look, TV Everywhere in concept is terrific for us because we get measured with our spots. Currently we only get measured when you watch it on your computer, but pretty quickly we'll be measured if you watch it on your pad. And so it's kind of -- it's an opportunity for us to move with technology on a fully measured basis. Our position is that right now, the cable operator only has the right to carry our channels through to the TV set. And giving that pliability to the consumer is a real benefit to the cable operator. And so for us, right now, we're just at this -- a little bit of an impasse on value. We think that there's substantial value in us allowing our 13 channels that represent almost 12% of viewership on cable to go. And from our perspective, and eventually it will happen, one of the reasons, I think, it hasn't happened with us as quickly is our deals haven't come up yet. So most of these get done when you do your deal. So it includes new -- launching of additional subs for channels and your fees go up, and then -- and TV Everywhere and what's the value for that, and in that value bundle, the TV Everywhere has gotten done for a lot of the other guys. So for us, I think we're having discussions about doing it separately. So you'll either see that we did a TV Everywhere deal or you might see that we did a deal early, which includes TV Everywhere. Or what will most likely happen, because we're supportive of TV Everywhere, is as we do renewals in the future, if we get the right value, we'll do it. The most important thing for us is that we've built our viewership on cable from about 5% or 6% to almost 12%, with real affinity networks. And when a distributor says TV Everywhere to consumer, TV Everywhere means to consumers that they can watch the shows they like and the channels they like when they want to. And I think we're in a very good position because people are really liking our channels. And with that kind of scale, the distributors are going to need to have us on TV Everywhere for it to be successful.","Andrew C. Warren","Great. Ben, it's Andy. Just to add one point to that. One element that we've talked a lot about is the need for measurements of authenticated viewership. And Nielsen's committed to, in 2014, a measurement approach for that, that we can monetize on Madison Avenue. But that also is a big question mark. And then on your corporate cost question, as we've said, we are very focused on cost containment and cost productivity, especially in our corporate area. So yes, the costs were down year-over-year in the third quarter. And yes, they will be down again year-over-year in the fourth quarter. So it's been an area of focus, and we've had some success.","Operator","The next question comes from David Bank, RBC Capital Markets.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","If you guys look at your advertising growth for this quarter and for recent past ones and kind of near-term upcoming, can you quantify the contribution of, generally, of how you see kind of CPM growth, audience growth and then the growth in sort of integrated advertising as playing a role? Those sort of 3 distinct items. And if it's easier just to talk about the current quarter, that's fine too.","David M. Zaslav","Thanks, David. We are seeing some CPM growth, particularly in the U.S., where the market has been pretty healthy. Outside the U.S., most of our strength so far has come from audience. But the fact that we were growing market share over the last 2 years and our scale is getting bigger; outside the U.S., we've been able also to push price. I think you'll see more of that in the quarters ahead. This quarter, our viewership was up 12% outside the U.S., and we were able to get 29% advertising growth. It's because we're starting to be able to get a better power ratio. On the integration piece, we're very well positioned for that because we produce all of our own content. And when you look at our 13 channels, we have the ability because we produce our content to do a lot of integrations. Joe Abruzzese has a terrific team. We have a whole group that focuses just on this. And it gets us an added hurdle of benefit when you take a look at the upfront or the scatter. And then we're able to bring in some premium advertisers because we can provide unique value. We're not doing as much of that outside the U.S. but we're doing more today than we were 1 year or 2 ago. So I think that will be something that we're going to continue to push on and should help us.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Is there any way -- you said it kind of gives you an added hurdle. Just as a follow-up, is there any way you could give us sort of a ballpark contribution level for what that hurdle is?","David M. Zaslav","I mean, I would say right now in the U.S., it's an added benefit. It's not significant but it's not immaterial. So it's one of those things that we look at us an edge on a lot of our competitors because we do produce our content. We have an intimate relationship with the advertisers. And so every time we can do it, it's added dollars and it's added benefit for the advertisers. So it's one of those things, I think, we can build on and it's unique to us and a couple of other media companies that really produce all of their own content in niche affinity groups.","Operator","The next question comes from John Janedis, UBS.","John Janedis - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","David, I know it's early, but did you say that 1Q cancelations are in line with historical levels? And can you talk a bit about the recent ratings trends at Discovery and TLC? Is some of the weakness related to the reduction of premiere hours you talked about? And would those tick up in 2014?","David M. Zaslav","Sure. Thanks, John. Right now, in terms of cancelations, they're quite low. They are consistent with what we've been seeing. So we had a good upfront where we were mid to high single in terms of the kind of economic increase we were able to get. And so first quarter looks good. On the ratings side, for October we pulled back a little bit. The broadcasters have been strong. They were coming out with a lot of strong content. Football was coming in. And we felt like we should hold some of our powder and let the broadcasters have their thing. Let the viewers like -- wanted to try out a lot of that content. And so we're now feathering in. We just launched Gold Rush this past Friday. We launched Moonshiners on TLC. We rolled in some of our new content, which you're going to start to see this quarter, this week and the next 3 weeks. So I think that you'll see a real stabilization over the next 2 months with -- on TLC and Discovery. On our other networks, we didn't really change our approach because they're much more niche networks. And we didn't think the broadcast piece was going to have much of an effect on ID, much of an effect on Destination America or OWN; and in fact, it didn't.","John Janedis - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And then just separately, you referenced SBS. Now that you've owned it for a few months, can you talk about what you're seeing relative to expectations? And are your synergies tracking in line from both the timing and cost savings perspective?","David M. Zaslav","Sure. Well it's doing better than we expected. It's a very strong business. Just to remind everybody, it's about a 30% subscriber fee business. We've been effective in attacking the cost structure in terms of how we house our people. And we've -- we're now in the process of taking advantage of our revenue synergies. They get a lot more for their advertising than we do. They also -- because of scale, they were operating at 20%, 30%, 35% of market share in terms of viewership. So with distributors, they were stronger. So on advertising, we'll see it pretty quickly. And on the distribution, we'll see it as it -- as those deals flow in, which will be over the next 2 to 3 years, there's a shorter cycle. The revenue synergies, again, will be over time -- I would say, probably 2\/3 of the cost synergies we've attacked. We've been over there a number of times. We've got a really good team, so a little more to come on that. You'll see the advertising again before you'll see the distribution. But it's all working as we hoped, and we think it's going to be a terrific asset for us.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Todd Juenger.","Todd Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Staying over across the pond, love to hear what's going on with TF1 and Eurosport, just generally how is that going. And any benefit that it's giving you across your portfolio? And then assuming you're going to say it's going well, any thoughts on your timing of when you might look to buy in the rest of that stake and if that might happen sooner than later? And then I have a follow-up.","David M. Zaslav","Thanks, Todd. Things are going very well with Eurosport and with TF1 Group. They're great partners. Martin Bouygues is -- just getting a chance to get in a room with him and see how he sees the market in France and learn from his experience in Eurosport has been positive for us. We like the business a lot. We've been learning about the business. It's unusual. It's in 59 countries with between 1 and 4 channels, so it's a true Pan-European sports vehicle. I would say we think it -- looking at it now from the inside, we think it even has more potential, really because of the unique nature of it. It's -- all that distribution, in some ways, it falls in the category of what do we do and what do we understand. When I got to Discovery, we had all these channels all around the world. And the question for us was how do we maximize those to make the most money and reach the most viewers? And so Eurosport, like Discovery when I got here 8 years ago, has a fantastic platform portfolio. Nobody comes close. Nobody even -- there's no one that can tie even half of those countries together with even 1 channel, let alone 1 to 4. And so our challenge, us and TF1 together, is how do we take something that's doing well and has a unique platform and make it even stronger. And so we're going to attack it the same way we attacked Discovery, more local, looking at content in each country, looking at partnerships in each country. And we have that right to take control, and that -- it's a unilateral right, and we'll look at that over time.","Todd Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And just a quick follow-up for Andy. Andy, you made some comments about the rate of spend in cash basis in terms of programming. Not always easiest to figure out on the outside the amortization schedule. Any comments you can make about how the rate of cash spend on programming this year and past years will translate into program amortization? How we should be thinking about that for the next year or so?","Andrew C. Warren","Sure, Todd. We said earlier this year that you'll see the -- or kind of moderate our investment in content, given the original hours that we invested in 2011 and '12. We all know there were some double-digit cash increases. We had some nice payback on that. This year though, one thing I highlighted was on an apples-to-apples basis, we're in the mid-single-digit growth year-over-year, which is what our commitment was earlier in the year. So from an amort perspective, you will still see double-digit amort coming through in 2013, but you'll see that abate in '14, as the single-digit cash investment this year helps next year's amort. So think in terms of a decreasing cash investment in 2013 and then a decreasing amort in '14.","Operator","The next question comes from Doug Mitchelson, Deutsche Bank.","[Audio Gap]","Unknown Analyst","advertising growth since it's so terrific. First, is there a way you can quantify how much the Olympics comp helped your growth?","Andrew C. Warren","Yes. Roughly, if you look at it on a 2-year basis, clearly last year, there's a lot of advertising money, particularly in Europe, that was moved out of the third quarter into fourth. So say it's 5% to 10% of an improvement in the third quarter that helped the 29%. And then conversely, you'll see on a 2-year basis a similar kind of growth rate year-over-year. So there'll be roughly, call it, 20-plus in the fourth quarter.","Operator","The next question comes from Michael Nathanson from MoffettNathanson.","Michael Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC","I have one for David and one for Andy. David, I wondered you made investments in Western Europe and you mentioned that Italy and Spain were definitely a bit better this quarter. What are you feeling about kind of the turn in Western Europe? Do you see potential green shoots of growth? Or was this more of an Olympic comp question? So I wondered kind of what your view is of the economic turn there?","David M. Zaslav","Thanks, Michael. Well look, the good news about the way we've been able to build this -- our economic attack across Western Europe is we're the biggest cable program player in Western Europe. We make more money than anyone else in Western Europe. We have more channels than anyone in Western Europe. But because we can use our content across those countries so efficiently and because our channel position and sub fees are strong, we're -- we've been able to get sustainable growth, not just in terms of sub fees, but more importantly, we've been able to grow more than 20% in ad revenue across Western Europe when the majority of those countries are flat or in recession. And so for us, that's a big part of our growth strategy, is maintain high -- sustainable high-growth in a flat or recessionary environment. Now 2 weeks ago, I was in Madrid, and Munich and London. And you read about things getting better. Candidly, the buzz is better. As you go into those countries and you meet with the advertisers and you sit down with the government and you ask what are they seeing, what do they expect. Everyone seems to think things are better. Having said that, I would say it's pretty stable. Italy is still really struggling. France is struggling. Spain, they're saying that maybe they're going to make the turn and go to a plus 1%. We'll have to wait and see. I would say it's certainly not getting worse. But for us, I think we're in great shape. If a year from now, 2 years from now, 3 years from now, you start seeing Western Europe improving, then we're going to -- you're going to see a ton of energy against us because our market share is growing in those markets. Our pricing power is growing in those markets. And we're growing 20% in those markets given these conditions. So we feel very good about Western Europe. And for us, with a long approach to this, we see Western Europe as the new emerging market. We bought assets there. We've launched channels there. And in the aggregate, Western Europe is bigger than the U.S. So Latin America is huge for us. But Western Europe, we've been very opportunistic and we've been very careful in terms of how we spend our money. That could be a big growth engine for us.","Michael Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC","Okay. And then can I just ask Andy one on SBS? I know it's lumped in and acquired with a couple of other assets. Can you give me a sense of your organic revenue growth, SBS, what the EBITDA growth was for that asset alone?","Andrew C. Warren","Yes, Michael. We -- if you look at the press release, we have a table that kind of lays this all out. For the third quarter, they're -- all the acquisitions together were about $33 million of OIBDA. And that's -- while, we're not highlighting specifically what their growth was, they've had some very nice growth year-over-year. And their performance, as David mentioned before, is at or better than our expectation going into the acquisition. So their performance is strong. And again, if you look at the table, we lay out specifically what the acquisitions -- what their impact was on both international and total company.","Michael Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC","Right. But I just wondered what the base was off of last year, so we could look at our forward models and try to figure out if we're modeling the correct growth rates of these assets for the next couple quarters.","Andrew C. Warren","We look at it in total. So we're not going to split it out, Michael. But if you look at it in aggregate, it's -- again, the growth rate has been strong and it's been better than our expectation. But we're not going to specifically lay out SBS.","Michael Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC","Okay. Then let me ask this question, seasonality is 3 -- how would 3Q compare over the 4 quarters as a contributor to EBITDA? Is it lighter? Is it stronger? So in terms of run rates, does fourth quarter compare [ph] for seasonality?","Andrew C. Warren","Yes. It's similar to what you see with our business. There's certainly some seasonality. You'll see growth in the fourth quarter is based on advertising and holiday spending. So you'll see seasonality exists there as you see in other parts, particularly in the ad supported businesses. So you'll see a greater contribution, a greater performance out of SBS in the fourth quarter.","Operator","The next question comes from Alexia Quadrani, JPMorgan.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","You mentioned earlier that we should not -- we're not likely to see anymore additional licensing revenue in the fourth quarter of this year. I guess, can you talk about -- I don't know if it's too early, but should we expect some coming in 2014? I can't remember what your renewal cycle was. I think you might have a renewal up in the first quarter?","Andrew C. Warren","Yes. For the fourth quarter, it's going to be very small, Alexia. I mean, the revenue we had in the third quarter was largely driven by the extension of the Netflix option we had, but there will be a very immaterial amount of SVOD revenue in the fourth quarter.","David M. Zaslav","And for next year, it'll depend on what deals we do. We haven't done deals outside the U.S. We did one very small one, but there's -- we're really contemplating where could we take advantage of that new window, which is almost all incremental margin for us, with companies like Amazon or LOVEFiLM, which is Amazon outside the U.S., and Netflix. So we're looking at that. We also have some deals coming up inside the U.S. that we could do. We have found that there's been no degradation of audience from the deals that we have done. And we think as we go into those discussions, as there's a lot interest in our content, we have series that are doing better. We have brands that are stronger. We have a lot more content. So right now, it's a very good time to be exploiting that market. Having said that, there are some markets where TV is really just growing. I was down in Brazil last week, and if you're -- you go to -- you're in S\u00e3o Paolo and you're in Rio and that you're looking at what's going on with the cable market, that you have a whole C-class that's opting on to television for the first time. And so for us, we're on that first starter C-class package. So if NET Brazil launches to approach the C-class with 12 channels, we have 5 of those channels. And that's how people are being introduced to TV, and it's quite hot there. And it's -- and then they get -- over time, they get -- they try and get the cable operators or distributors trying to push them up to a broader package. So in some markets, there's a real concern about doing some of the SVOD deals so early on. And so we're going to -- we're taking the long look at how do we grow our business in the long term, and we're -- if doing SVOD deals means extra dollars, extra value, extra eyeballs, we'll do them. And where holding off for a period of time is better for us in terms of long-term branding and growth, we're going to do that.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And just a follow-up question, I think, on your earlier comments about the level of current cash investment in programming. It sounds like given the ratings success you've had in terms of the level of cash investment, should we assume sort of roughly the same level next year?","Andrew C. Warren","Yes. What we said is that going forward, model out high single-digit growth year-over-year in content spend, and there -- correspondingly increase of high single digit on a content amort. That's kind of our long-range planning and modeling around maximizing the value of the content, maximizing the value of our global reach. So high single digit is kind of our long-range thinking and planning.","Operator","The next question comes from Richard Greenfield, BTIG.","Richard Greenfield - BTIG, LLC, Research Division","When you look at the broadcast cable ad dollars shift, the broadcasters seemed to be cheering quite a bit that if you look at their live ratings, yes, they're down meaningfully. But if you go to live plus 3 or live plus 7, it's all going to be okay. Discovery doesn't seem to talk about the big benefit from DVR viewing. It seems like you do a lot better in live year-over-year than your broadcast peers. And just wondering as you move into the upfront and even into just overall '14, '15 advertising, how do you think that changes or accelerates the shift in ad dollars?","David M. Zaslav","Thanks, Rich. Well, first, we are not at the top of the list of channels that have high DVR shows. Having said that, we're moving in that direction. Because if you look at OWN, a lot of Oprah's Next Chapter, Tyler's shows, Sweetie Pie's, if you look at Discovery, we have more and more series. And so we're finding that we're getting a more meaningful pickup on the DVR plus 3. Having said that, I'd say 80% to 90% of the viewership on the DVR, we do get picked up in the first 3 days. I think the broadcaster will benefit more than we will if it goes to 7, but we'll get some benefit. The overall viewership trend that helps us in a market that's flat here in the U.S. is that, one, we're growing our market share, which is important. Two is we're growing women with OWN, ID, TLC, Animal Planet, Destination America. We have a real suite of women's networks. So that as viewers move off of broadcast, the viewers that are sometimes in the most demand are women, and we've really built that -- built up a very strong offering in that area. And the fact that the CPM is still significantly different. And so look, I think broadcasters had a good start to the season. They've been -- last quarter they were down 22%. Starting in this season, they're up a little bit and with DVR, they're up a little bit more. Good for them. I think it's good for all of us. More people are watching TV, more people are engaged in shows. We're often not the first choice. We're often the second or third choice, and that's a good thing. People, they may watch The Voice, and then they get a little bit bored and say what's my favorite and what are my 2 or 3 other favorite networks, and if we're -- if we get a good amount of that second, third viewership on Animal Planet, on ID, on a lot of our channels, that's how we make a lot of our bread and butter. So overall, I think if it goes to 7, it will help the broadcasters more but it'll help us some. And right now, it's pretty good for us.","Operator","The next question comes from Barton Crockett, FBR Capital Markets.","Barton E. Crockett - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","As you're coming onto the renewal cycle domestically in the fourth quarter, I was wondering if you could update us on how you feel about the current state of negotiations? And what do you see about the potential for you guys to see something like we've seen with the other operators, a bit of a blackout. You haven't had that historically. Do you still feel confident you won't see that? And then how do you feel about the potential for you guys to eventually move closer to the kind of high single-digit core affiliate growth rates that you see at many of your peers?","David M. Zaslav","Thanks, Barton. Well, look, I think we're having a great run. We've built a terrific creative team and we've invested a lot of money in our content. And our viewership share has gone from 5% when we did most of these deals, or 6%, to almost 12%. OWN is the #1 or 2 network for African-American women in the U.S., beating BET, which is a fantastic network, 2 or 3 nights a week. We have TLC as a strong network. Discovery, the most valued network on cable, according to the cable operators surveys. ID, a top 10 network in America. So we've come a long way. Science is a great affinity network; Hub. So we've come a long way, and we've done it the hard way and the old way, old-fashioned way. We've invested more money in people, invested more money in content. And when we sit down with the cable operators who we have very good relationships with, they recognize that. Our cost of content has gone up a lot more than our subscriber fees. And we're probably the only guys that, that's the case for. And one of the reasons for that, I believe, is our deals haven't come up yet. And so what we've been doing is we've been good actors. We've done what we said we were going to do. We've got more and more people loving our channels. And now when we sit down and we negotiate our deals, we're going to be looking for fair value. And fair value for us is going to be substantially more than we were getting before because we've doubled our market share, our channels are working, we've invested a lot of money. And the cable operators and the distributors have gotten a lot of value out of that. They've been selling our channels. And so I think we've got a great hand, all of our deals come up together. So that when we sit down with a distributor, if we do have a collision, then we have all 13 of our channels. We have the #1 network for Hispanic men, with Discovery Espa\u00f1ol. So we have really been building these affinity niche groups. So our expectation is that we will get meaningful value in return for the strong performance for our channels. And if we don't, then we're going to have to stand for the value that we deserve. We've been doing it around the world, and we'll do it here. We did very nicely in our deals last year, but a very small percentage of our deals came up. We got higher increases; we got channels rolled down. We got some issues on channel position addressed and we didn't even use TV Everywhere. So I think we got a great hand. And if we have to, we'll stand up for ourselves because it's our time.","Operator","The next question comes from Michael Morris from Guggenheim Securities.","Michael C. Morris - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Hoping you could talk a bit about, a bit more about your free-to-air initiative internationally. You highlighted it as a driver of international ad growth. And I guess, a couple of questions are: how much of that is -- are you organic now in terms of that growth? Or was there some additional channels there in terms of the year-over-year growth? And how much did that contribute to that 29% growth? Also, do you see more opportunities for free-to-air channels either in Europe or in other geographies? And what's the risk that it cannibalizes your pay-TV, your traditional revenue stream channels?","David M. Zaslav","Yes. Thanks, Michael. Well, first, this is all real growth because we fully lapped all of our launches. So what you're seeing now is pure year-over-year. The free-to-air is pretty limited. We've done it in markets like Spain that has low pay-TV or Italy that has low pay-TV and Germany. Germany has a massive market but there's only 3.5 million pay-TV subscribers, and we've been in that country for 15 years with great content. Remember, when people say free-to-air, they tend to think of one -- of a broadcast network. We really have what I would call a hybrid model. We buy a free-to-air channel, say, in Spain. But then our cost of content is virtually 0 because we have 15, 20 years of content in language that's never been seen in that market or by the overwhelming majority of the population. And so -- and we continue to churn out that content in other countries for channels that are in language. And so when we go into Spain, we start making money immediately. So we discovered -- we launched Discovery MAX in Spain, and it's getting about 2% market share from nothing. So -- but our cost of content is incredibly low, and so it's quite profitable for us. So we launched a number of free-to-airs in Italy. We're looking to launch another one in Spain. We launched the second free-to-air in Germany. All of them are profitable. And they become nice marketing vehicles for us because we could promote to our pay-TV channels in those markets. In Italy, in particular, the market is down 10% and we're up dramatically. We have our women's broadcast network in Italy, is 1 of the top 4 networks in all of Italy. And it's been a huge success for us, so we launched a male channel over the air there. And that's been a big success for us. And then we promote the Discovery, we promote the Animal Planet, we promote to our channels that are on SKY. That also helps us because when we sit down with SKY, there are some markets that only have 1 or 2 players. In Italy, it's SKY Italia and it's Berlusconi [ph], but Berlusconi [ph] is quite small. And so it gives us some optionality. They didn't want to give us a significant increase for our women's channel on the SKY platform, so we put it on broadcast, and it became a huge asset for us. They now want to carry it, an HD version of it on SKY Italia because it's so popular. Having said all of that, in -- as you look at Latin America, as you look at Russia and the Ukraine, as you look at India and Indonesia, those are growth markets we're playing the dual revenue stream game. That's the game we know how to play, that's the game we're going to play and we're not going to go into any market that has broad pay appeal with free-to-air channels.","Andrew C. Warren","And, Michael, just to add a little more financial color. If you look across all of our regions last quarter, we had strong double-digit ad sales growth in every region. And in 3 of those regions, we don't have free-to-air. So while free-to-air is a nice help -- helper, the core business, the dual stream business has had tremendous ad sales growth in really almost every market. So the real story here is consistent solid growth across our platforms.","David M. Zaslav","The final thing that you see is -- suppose we're in a market and we have 5% market share, and then we launch a broadcast network, which gives us a couple more points. We're approaching in some of these markets with scale, and we've reached in some of these markets, Italy in particular, where we have enough scale that even in a down market, we can push price. And so sometimes, that's part of the thinking in some of these markets, and that we can bring along some of the pay-TV channels in price as well.","Operator","The next question comes from Vasily Karasyov, Sterne Agee.","Vasily Karasyov - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Andy, I have a couple for you. One is about SBS Nordic advertising revenue seasonality. How much of a sequential ramp in advertising revenue should we see this year? Is it comparable to last year? Was the Olympics a factor or not? If you could give us any color, would appreciate it. And then you mentioned that OWN is doing very well currently. Could you give us an idea when you expect to start recognizing only your portion of the income there?","Andrew C. Warren","Sure, Vasily. On the first one, very similar kind of answer. Olympics had an impact, arguably a little less so for SBS, just given the market dynamics there. But the seasonality is very real. And you'll definitely see a meaningful, higher proportion of ad sales in the fourth quarter, and therefore, overall revenue growth for SBS in the fourth quarter. So the dynamics are very similar. With regard to OWN, look it's -- look, as David said, we're incredibly happy with the OWN performance. The $20 million net paydown of debt in the third quarter is tremendous and that will accelerate further in the fourth. With regard to our picking up 100% of what we expect to be profits in the fourth quarter, that will continue for a very long time because the nature isn't -- while they still have negative equity, we pick up 100% of their profit and losses. So as OWN moves to a profit profile, which again should be happening in the fourth quarter, we'll get 100% of that for the foreseeable future until their equity balance is fully restored.","Craig Felenstein","Thank you, everybody for joining us.

Please proceed, Sir.","Craig Felenstein","Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for Discovery Communications' 2014 First Quarter Earnings Call. Joining me today is David Zaslav, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Andy Warren, our Chief Financial Officer. You should have received our earnings release, but if not, feel free to access it on our website at www.discoverycommunications.com. On today's call, we will begin with some opening comments from David and Andy, after which, we will open the call up for your questions. [Operator Instructions]","Before we start, I would like to remind you that comments today regarding the company's future business plans, prospects and financial performance are forward-looking statements that we make pursuant to the Safe Harbor Provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are made based on management's current knowledge and assumptions about future events, and they involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations.

Zaslav","Thanks, Craig. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Discovery's off to another strong start in 2014. The consistent financial and operating momentum we have generated over the past several years continued in the first quarter. Solid organic growth, combined with contributions from our new international acquisitions, gave us a diversified and balanced performance across revenue streams, network brands and geographic regions. The sturdy foundation of our global business model continues to give us both sustained long-term organic growth but also great optionality to invest in future growth initiatives around the world.","Our primary focus continues to be the same: exploit Discovery's unparalleled global infrastructure built over the last 29 years; invest in bigger, stronger brands with more content on the screen; increase our market share and audience delivery; and take advantage of the ad sales and platform opportunities that an evolving global media landscape provides.","Given the deal activity across the industry right now, along with media speculation regarding potential Discovery involvement, I know there is some interest in our investment strategy, so let me take a few moments at the top to address that question.","Our first priority remains to create long-term shareholder value by producing quality content that grows our audience and can be leveraged globally and across platforms. There is still plenty of organic growth ahead from the expansion of the global pay-TV sector. And with more people viewing more content on more screens than ever before, it is a great time to be in the content business, especially when you own all of your own content. Where we can put money back on the screen, into stronger brands, into new formats and talent, into valuable IP and top creative leadership, we will look to make the most of those opportunities.","Secondly, we are opportunistic regarding acquisitions that exploit our strategic advantages, especially our local international sales force and technical infrastructure, and give us more must-have content, a stronger brand portfolio and more penetration in key growth markets around the world. We are very fiscally disciplined with regards to deploying capital and have great balance sheet flexibility. Given the strong organic growth opportunity across our asset base, we are only focused on assets that will help us sustain that profile over the long term, primarily complementary dual revenue stream channels that can provide more scale, like Eurosport and SBS; or assets that offer valuable IP or creative talent in must-have programming categories, like our recent acquisition of the award-winning production company, Raw.","I will not comment on every auction or sale process that has been covered in the media lately, but I am confident of the rigor, discipline and strategic focus we are bringing to the marketplace to help supplement our strong organic growth. And if we cannot find any additional opportunities to strengthen our portfolio or position for the next generation of growth, we are committed to returning value to shareholders through our robust stock repurchase plan.","Andy will provide some context surrounding our underlying financial results in a few minutes, but before he does, let me also walk you through the key drivers of our organic growth, along with some of the strategic initiatives we are focusing on to maintain momentum in the years ahead.","Discovery's biggest driver is, without question, our ability to attract more and more viewers to our diverse channel lineup. Demand for high-quality content with great storytelling and compelling characters has never been higher, and our broad reach, combined with a sustained investment in stronger global brands, is enabling us to attract larger audiences worldwide.","I mentioned on our year-end call that we have delivered 5 consecutive years of viewership growth across our domestic portfolio. And that momentum has certainly continued into 2014 as we delivered the best first quarter in the company's history.","Viewership across our U.S. Networks was up 9% in primetime this past quarter among key adult 25 to 54 demo despite the competition from the Olympics. And this growth was broad-based, with success from established brands as well as from emerging networks as we identify and invest in new avenues to satisfy curiosity. The audience gains at our established networks were highlighted by TLC, which delivered 12% audience growth in its key women 25 to 54 demo, led by strong gains from returning favorites Here Comes Honey Boo Boo and the Little Couple; and ID, which generated viewership growth of over 30%. ID is now the fourth-ranked network for women 25 to 54 in Total Day despite only being in 85 million homes, and ID has the longest length of tune of any network on television.","Discovery Channel ratings did decline year-on-year during the first quarter, primarily due to the Olympics' impact, but they have regained their momentum in April with viewership up 12% in primetime versus a year ago, led by returning hits Naked and Afraid, Fast N' Loud and Deadliest Catch. Catch returned for its 10th season 2 weeks ago and is delivering its largest audience in 3 years, remarkable staying power for this iconic series.","As we further strengthen our established networks, we continue to broaden our portfolio by investing incrementally in an expanding set of emerging brands. I have said repeatedly that we believe we can invest wisely and deliver content that is unique and engaging. You can still attract new audiences and deliver real value to advertising and affiliate partners. No better example of this than the success of OWN network, which built upon its 25% audience growth in 2013 with viewership up 59% in the first quarter in its key women 25 to 54 demo, led by the return of Tyler Perry's hit series, The Haves and the Have Nots, and Love Thy Neighbor, along with the second season premiere of OWN original series Raising Whitley. Most importantly, OWN delivered significant cash flow and equity earnings to Discovery in Q1. And these returns should only grow given the momentum across the network.","OWN is not the only emerging brand that is growing significantly. Destination America was up 25% this past quarter among people 25 to 54, while Velocity grew its key demo over 40%. And our newest network, the American Heroes Channel, was up 19% versus a year ago, when it was still the Military Channel.","Driving the potential of our valuable distribution real estate by investing in new brands and breaking new ground that ignites viewers' curiosity remains a priority, and we will continue to invest incrementally in these networks if they demonstrate the ability to attract larger audiences. The ratings momentum we are generating across our portfolio has given us a good start to 2014, with 5% ad revenue growth this past quarter, but also puts us in a nice position heading into what we hope will be a robust upfront. While it's too early to predict where the upfront ultimately ends up, with scatter pricing well above last year's upfront, sustained ratings momentum across our networks and what I think is unquestionably the best ad sales team in the business, we expect to do very well in our discussions with our ad partners.","Advertising is not the only area where we are capitalizing on the success of the content we have invested in over the last several years. Towards the end of 2013, we completed our latest round of affiliate negotiations, and we were very pleased with the outcome as our distribution partners continue to recognize the value of the brands we have built and the must-have content driving the audiences we deliver.","While our investment domestically is certainly paying off in terms of market share gains, new avenues of growth and sustained financial momentum, there is no question that the U.S. is a more mature market. The faster growth today and the greater opportunity moving forward certainly lies internationally, where pay-TV penetration is still expanding nicely in many markets and where the investments we have made over the last 2 decades are allowing us to take full advantage of the burgeoning demand for high-quality content. It has been 25 years since we first launched our first channel across the U.K. and the Nordics, and we now have more channels in more markets with more subscribers than any other media company.","The unmatched global distribution platform we have built is the backbone of our international growth as it enables us to not only capitalize on the further evolution of pay-TV, but given our local market experience, we can also quickly identify new opportunities to launch networks and satisfy new consumer demand. The result has been sustained double-digit subscriber increases, and while the rate of subscriber growth will certainly slow over time, pay-TV penetration is still well below 50% in countries like Brazil, Mexico and Turkey. So there is still room for continued distribution gains across our market position.","As we benefit from an expanding subscriber base, we are also driving viewership with a more robust content offering so we can fully exploit the opportunities our unique market position provides. No better examples than the rollouts of TLC and ID. TLC and our female flagships now reach over 170 countries and territories and are the most widely distributed female lifestyle brands in the world. We just celebrated TLC's first anniversary in the U.K., and ratings in the quarter were up 130% versus the same period a year ago. ID's content is also resonating globally. It has now been rolled out to over 150 markets. And just last month, we launched ID Extra across parts of Central and Eastern Europe to further leverage the demand for crime and forensic content.","The strength and local feel of the brands we have built, along with the subscriber growth we delivered this past quarter, resulted in overall viewership growth of 8% across our international portfolio. And this expansion is broad based. We are not overly reliant on any one region or country, with increases across every region, led by Brazil and Argentina in Latin America, Italy and the U.K. in Western Europe, India in Asia Pacific and Russia and South Africa in our CEEMEA region. The biggest upside internationally resides on the advertising front, and with more viewers watching our content than ever before, both from subscriber growth and a more robust programming offering, we are uniquely positioned to capture a greater share of a rapidly growing pay-TV ad market.","As we focus on increasing share and maximizing the full organic growth potential inherent in our asset portfolio, we are also beginning to see some of the revenue upside from our SBS Nordic acquisition. We are still in the early days, but the Discovery suite of networks is certainly benefiting from the increased reach we have in the Nordic region, as the diversity and depth of our content offering is quite compelling to advertisers.","At the same time, we expect to close shortly on a majority ownership position in Eurosport, and we can begin to combine the power of Eurosport's brands and audience reach with Discovery's network portfolio, local infrastructure and country-specific expertise. With networks in 54 countries and a diversified content portfolio of sports programming, Eurosport will complement our existing stable of assets and deliver new opportunities with advertising and affiliate partners. As I mentioned earlier, these assets only enhance the long-term growth we already are cultivating, and they further bolster our long-term outlook for deepening our geographic footprint, broadening our portfolio with new networks and brands and enhancing our creative pipeline with new talent, personalities and formats.","Overall, Discovery is off to another strong start in 2014. Our primary focus remains strengthening our diverse brand portfolio so we can capture additional market share around the globe and take advantage of a generally stable worldwide operating environment. Given the operating momentum we are generating across the company and the opportunities our infrastructure provides, we fully expect to deliver sustained organic growth, even as we invest in building additional long-term shareholder value.","And now let me turn the call over to Andy.","Andrew C. Warren","Thanks, David, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. As David mentioned, Discovery is off to a very solid start to 2014, delivering strong organic growth as our content attracts more and more viewers around the globe and we leverage the many opportunities across our worldwide distribution platform.","On a reported basis, total company revenue in the first quarter increased 22%, led by 51% international and 3% domestic growth. Excluding SBS Nordic, which was acquired in April 2013, as well as the impact of foreign currency and licensing revenue from our existing Netflix agreement, total company revenue growth was 8%, with double-digit global advertising growth despite the Olympics and high single-digit global distribution growth. Total operating expense on a reported basis increased 34% in the first quarter, primarily due to the inclusion of the SBS Nordic business. Excluding this acquisition and the impact from foreign currency movements, total company expenses increased 9% versus the first quarter a year ago, primarily due to anticipated higher marketing costs, while content expense growth returned to normalized levels, up 8%.","On a reported basis, adjusted OIBDA in the first quarter increased 5%. Excluding SBS Nordic, as well as the impact of foreign currency and licensing revenue, adjusted OIBDA grew 6%. Net income available to Discovery Communications of $230 million was in line with the first quarter a year ago, which included $31 million of other income, due in large part to a $92 million gain associated with the step-up value from raising our ownership interest in Discovery Japan 80%. Excluding other income, net income was up 21%, primarily driven by the strong operating performance in the current year, a lower tax rate and a $43 million decline in mark-to-market equity-based compensation, partially offset by $51 million of increased amortization expense, primarily due to purchase accounting associated with the SBS Nordic acquisition.","Earnings per diluted share for the first quarter was $0.66, 5% above the first quarter a year ago. Adjusted earnings per share, a more relevant metric from a comparability perspective as it excludes the impact from noncash acquisition amortization expense of intangible assets, was $0.75, a 19% improvement versus Q1 2013.","Free cash flow in the first quarter of $213 million more than doubled versus a year ago, as the strong operating performance and lower tax payments were partially offset by higher content investment and stock-based compensation costs. It is important to note that content spend excluding SBS Nordic increased only mid single digits, even as we continue to drive market share growth across the globe.","Before moving on to the divisional results, I do want to highlight that while not part of our reported free cash flow, OWN repaid Discovery $16 million in the first quarter versus receiving $14 million of funding in the same period a year ago, therefore a $30 million year-over-year improvement.","Turning now to the operating units. The U.S. Networks continued to perform well during the first quarter, with total domestic revenues of 3% as advertising and distribution growth were partially offset by a $6 million decline in other revenues due to a decrease in content licensing sales as we increase the programming being shared with our International Networks rather than selling to third parties. We anticipate a similar negative trend in other revenues for the remainder of the year. Advertising revenues increased 5% in the quarter as a strong pricing environment and higher delivery across the majority of our networks more than offset softness at the Discovery Channel during the Olympics.","Looking ahead to the second quarter, given the relatively stable current ad market trends with scatter pricing up high single to low double digits from last year's upfront negotiations, and with the ratings I mentioned that David mentioned, we anticipate ad sales growth will once again be in the mid single-digit range despite headwinds from the cancellation of our Everest Live events and the sale of HowStuffWorks platform. Excluding these items, we would have anticipated acceleration in ad sales during the second quarter.","Distribution revenue growth domestically was 4% on a reported basis and 6% excluding licensing revenue as we recognized the higher rates we were able to secure during the latest round of affiliate negotiations. Please note that while the organic growth rate for fleet revenue will continue to be in the same improving range for the remainder of the year, the reported affiliate growth will be negatively impacted by the additional licensing revenue that we recognized in the second and third quarters of 2013 but offset by any new licensing deals that we may complete during the remainder of the current year.","Looking at the cost side. Domestic operating expenses were up 5% from the first quarter of 2013, primarily due to anticipated higher marketing spend, most notably on the Discovery Channel for our scripted series Klondike. Domestic adjusted OIBDA increased 2% on a reported basis versus last year's first quarter and 3% excluding the impact of license agreements as the increased marketing costs partially offset the realized revenue growth.","Turning to our international operations. Reported results include the impact of SBS Nordic, but for comparability purposes, my following international comments refer to the results excluding this acquisition. The international segment continued to deliver strong momentum across our global operations this past quarter with revenues expanding 11%, led by 24% ad and 6% affiliate growth. Excluding the impact of exchange rates, total revenue growth was 13%, with advertising revenue increasing 23% and affiliate revenue up 10%. The advertising growth is broad based, with double-digit increases across nearly every region, led by Western Europe, primarily from the continued success of our free-to-air initiatives in Italy, Spain and the U.K., and by Latin America from increased volumes across the region.","Our Discovery suite of networks also benefited in the Nordic region from the greater reach we now have in the market following the SBS transaction. On the affiliate front, the 10% affiliate revenue increase in the quarter excluding currency was driven primarily by subscriber growth, especially in Latin America from the continued expansion of pay television in Brazil and Argentina and in Central and Eastern Europe from additional subs in Russia and new launches in Turkey and the Middle East. Please note that moving forward, as we include the SBS Nordic affiliate growth in our organic results, we anticipate organic international affiliate growth to be in the high single digits for the remainder of the year.","Turning to the cost side. Operating expenses internationally were up 10% in the first quarter excluding currency, primarily driven by higher content amortization and increased personnel costs as we further expand our global footprint. The International segment delivered 18% adjusted OIBDA growth in the first quarter excluding foreign currency as the international team continued to significantly grow revenues by thoughtfully investing in key long-term growth initiatives.","Taking a look at our financial position, with a strong balance sheet and sustained financial and operating momentum and given our gross leverage targets and long-range free cash flow per share growth assumptions, we have the opportunity to continue to return capital to shareholders as we invest in our global businesses.","Discovery was precluded from buying back shares until our February earnings call, but we have repurchased over $450 million of stock thus far this year. And given our current expectations for uses of capital, we anticipate that we will continue to be aggressive with share repurchases for the remainder of the year. In total, since we began buying back shares towards the end of 2010, we've spent over $4.6 billion buying back shares, reducing our outstanding share count by 23%.","Turning to the full year. Note that current guidance still assumes that the Eurosport transaction closes very soon, and while we have included the projected results and purchase accounting adjustments associated with the transaction in our full year expectations, these items are preliminary estimates, which we will update if the close timing shifts or other items change materially.","We remain encouraged by the momentum across our asset portfolio and the continued strong pricing and demand environment in many of our key markets. Therefore, we are leaving our guidance unchanged despite meaningful foreign currency headwinds since we last reported as well as higher corporate costs associated with accelerated stock compensation and professional fees.","For the full year 2014, we still expect total revenues to be between $6.45 billion and $6.625 billion, adjusted OIBDA to be between $2.6 billion and $2.725 billion and net income to be between $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion.","Again, thanks for your time this morning. And now Dave and I will be happy to answer any questions you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Doug Mitchelson, Deutsche Bank.","Douglas D.

I mean, to be up 10% in Prime and 5% in Total Day while the rest of the industry was down 5% in Prime and down 4% in Total Day really reaffirms our core mission of growing market share. And all that content, or most of it, we own and get to take around the world. The fact that our content has been more successful is a helpful factor for us in terms of how much we need to invest. The more returning series we have, the more quality content we have on brand that's resonating, we can temper down our content investment. So whereas 2 and 3 years ago, we were in the mid teens in investment as we were really trying to find our voice on a lot of the channels, we then went to high single. We're now at mid single. So I would say between mid single and high single. And we're feeling quite good about our creative team domestically and internationally, which is really key for us, growing market share domestically and around the world.","Andrew C. Warren","And Doug, regarding the question on Eurosport. At this point, we have received all of our regulatory approvals. So we're going through kind of standard closing procedures and processes, which is why we anticipate closing soon.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne, Morgan Stanley.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I just wanted to clarify, you said, for the rest of the year, domestic affiliate growth excluding licensing in the same improving range. I just wanted to understand if that means continued sort of sequential acceleration. I just wanted to clarify that. And then my question, David, you talked about the biggest upside for our company, or at least internationally, is in ad sales. And Andy said that the growth was led this quarter by Western Europe, Italy, Spain, U.K., free-to-air. I think for a lot of people, those are just sort of tough markets to understand the dynamics internally, particularly because they are free-to-air networks driving your growth. So if you can, maybe spend a minute just telling us why the growth has been so strong, how sustainable it is, what the opportunity is in those markets as the free-to-air operators are coming in from the U.S. position that you've had. I know you have cable assets, cable network assets in those markets, but it's sort of a different approach that you've taken. And it seems to be working, so maybe spend a minute on the opportunity in those countries that seem to be driving a lot of your growth. That would be helpful.","David M. Zaslav","Sure. First, on the affiliate side, we were able to find some meaningful success with our new deals at the end of last year. So our affiliate rate has gone from 5 to 6. You'll see that go up throughout the rest of the year. So that locked-in affiliate subscriber fee growth rate will rise. It's a function of higher increases we were able to get, plus additional distribution, with fees, for a number of our channels. So we feel very good about that, and you'll see that coming through on a quarter-to-quarter basis and growing. On the ad sales side, we're really seeing -- we're seeing double-digit growth everywhere. And so the first piece is that Latin America has been very strong. So we have seen Western Europe, but Latin America continues to be very strong for us, Brazil and Mexico in particular, where we have 5 of the top 15 channels in Brazil, including the #1 channel in Brazil with Discovery Kids; and in Mexico as well, where we have 5 of the top 20 channels. So we're very well positioned there. In Western Europe, the idea of free-to-air is a little bit of a misnomer. We're getting our growth both from our pay-TV business, but the free-to-air channels are really -- it's a different model for us. We're not doing news, we're not doing sports and we're not doing a lot of original content. It's that we have a huge library of content in language that we can -- where we can launch a channel in Spain and have a very low cost base. And because Spain and Italy and Germany are very low-penetrated on pay-TV, we really have kind of a hybrid asset. We have a very low-cost, free-to-air channel that allows us to take advantage of a very strong advertising market, and we already have an ad sales team in place because we've been in those markets for 10, 15 years. In the case of Spain, we are newer to that market. But we're taking advantage of infrastructure, but I think it's fair to say that the growth has been very broad also in Asia and India, and Russia continues to be strong in Eastern Europe. So I think the free-to-air is helping us, but it's all been lapped. And we'll see it now as pure growth. And the fact that our market share in this past quarter grew an additional 8%, and the quarter before, we grew mid teens to almost 20%, we're seeing continued growth, and we think it's very sustainable because it's broad based.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Anthony DiClemente of Nomura.","Anthony J. DiClemente - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","I just have a couple for Andy. Andy, you mentioned the Mount Everest events that were canceled and then the sale of HowStuffWorks. I'm wondering if you could size for us in terms of revenue and OIBDA what those couple of items had previously been expected to contribute to your 2014 guidance outlook. And then also, Andy, just wanted to ask about the free cash flow generation. I think if I take the midpoint of your OIBDA guidance and I take, historically, what your EBITDA to free cash flow conversion has been, I get to pretty close to $1.3 billion of free cash flow in 2014. Is that in the range? Can you -- I know you don't give free cash flow guidance, but can you speak to that thought process on free cash flow?","Andrew C. Warren","Sure. And on the first piece, we clearly would have had more acceleration in the second quarter ad sales with Everest. We do expect to still see some acceleration in the second quarter relative to the first, but as I said, we'll expect, overall, to be in the kind of mid single-digit range. With regard to free cash flow, look, we're definitely seeing some nice flow-through, as you say, and a big driver of that is tax. Even though 181 was a huge benefit last year, on an apples-to-apples basis, our focus on tax and deferred taxes and reducing our effective tax rate is really allowing us to see more and more flow-through. But for this conversation, we're still going to focus on the $1.2 billion plus of free cash flow for the year as we continue to invest in content and take a look at how do we strengthen our international portfolio.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Bank, RBC Capital.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","So you walked through some pretty robust ratings trends at ID, Destination America, Velocity, American Heroes. You talked about the strength in the domestic portfolio, particularly at TLC on the more developed networks side, and you kind of went through the overhang of Everest and HowStuffWorks. I guess, given these ratings trends, do you think it's realistic to expect to be able to return to kind of high single-digit ad growth in the back half as you can monetize these ratings and some of the comps change on the basis of Everest and stuff? Are we looking to potentially get back to high single-digit ad growth?","David M. Zaslav","Well -- Dave, so first, this quarter, we were up 5%. The last time we went against the Olympics, we were up 3%. And we're up 5% against a quarter last year where we were up 8%. And part of that had to do with the fact that Discovery got hit pretty hard by the Olympics. The rest of our networks fared better, but Discovery, which is a significant piece, Discovery and TLC together, in terms of higher pricing and volume, got hit. It did -- we did rally, and we're up about 12% in Prime in April, so that's a good sign. For us, the good news is we're really in this for the long term, so when you look at ID and you look at Velocity and you look at TLC, we're kind of in a -- we view these things differently. We're generating content that we take all over the world. So when you see a show on ID, it's now in over 150 countries. It does take time to get pricing. Even though ID is the #4 network in America for women, we still don't get the pricing that we think we deserve on that. The good news is, we're doing much better this quarter than we did last, and we're doing much better than we did a year ago. And as we went into this upfront, ID had much more strength and credibility. It had the longest view on cable in terms of time people spend with it. So the good news here is our overall mission of investing more in content, more in brands and growing our market share is really a long-term play. You're going to see sustainable growth in our pricing on ID for the next 2 years, at least, before we get to where it should be. And so that'll continue to bear fruit. Velocity and Heroes Channel, they're -- and Destination America, they're kind of lower on the ladder, which is a goodie and a baddie. The baddie is we can't fully take advantage of the fact that these channels are doing really well and gaining significant share. The goodie is that every quarter, we're able to gain on price and it becomes more of a sustainable play. People still only watch 6 to 8 channels, and they're spending a lot more time watching ID, Velocity, TLC, Animal Planet. They're watching our channels. 8 years ago, we were about 4.5% of the share of viewership on cable. Today, we're almost 13% of the viewership on cable. And so to us, that is the characteristic. That is the piece of data that's most important. The advertising market can go up and down, but share is something that's pretty steady if you can get people spending time with your brand. So we look at these channels and we think they're real growth opportunities for us. And the same is true outside the U.S. We've launched ID in 150 countries and TLC in 170, and we're doing -- our pricing is getting better this year than it was last year, and it'll continue to bear fruit for us. So when you do see our numbers being high, and a lot of those might be that TLC and Discovery are up a little bit and these other are up a lot, you can do the math and see that we won't be able to get the full value of those right away, but we will be getting those values over the next few years.","Andrew C. Warren","And just to add, Dave, a little more color into that, look, the good news is, as David said, our audience share is up year-over-year and continues to grow. We still see some good scatter volume in the marketplace, and we still see scatter pricing up high single digits and low double digits relative to the last broadcaster front. On the challenging side, cancellations are up a little bit. Options are being taken a little bit more than prior year. So it's really going to depend on the scatter market and the ratings in the flagships, as Dave said, and, of course, how we do in the upfront in the next several weeks.","David M. Zaslav","The other thing that we've done is we could bring more money in if we went for value. But our view is that ID is now in 85 million homes. It will be in almost 90 million homes over the next 18 months. It's a top-5 channel in America, and rather than concede price, we're holding price. Destination America is doing really well for us, as is Velocity. And so in many cases, we're deciding not to take extra money in order to hold price, and we think that also will provide more sustainable growth and more value for us in the long term.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jessica Reif Cohen of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jessica Reif Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I have a question on international and a couple on domestic. David, I totally appreciate that you don't want to get into any specifics of what's been in the press, but maybe just a comment on your kind of medium-term strategy outside the U.S. How much opportunity do you think there is to build new channels? And where do you think you'll need to buy or what kinds of things would you -- do you think you need to buy to strengthen the portfolio? And then domestically, I guess, just a couple of small ones. Do the newer deals include TV Everywhere rights? And if not, why not? Can you comment on any interest you have in doing some OTT deals \u00e0 la what Disney did with Dish? And probably, DIRECTV, as we understand, is reaching out. And then finally just to follow-up on that SVOD comment that you guys made earlier. The you not selling at all -- it sounds like there won't be SVOD revenue until the fourth quarter. I think -- well, I just wasn't sure. Did you say it's because you want to keep your content for your own use? Can you clarify that?","David M. Zaslav","Sure. Thanks, Jessica. First, on the international side, the good news is we are the largest platform media company in the world. We have, on average, 8 channels in 230 countries. So in most of those countries, of those 8 channels, we've done a really good job of getting 5 or 6 of those to be quite good, and we've been growing market share. We still have some work to do. We're in like the fourth inning in terms of our overall growth strategy internationally. We have the real estate, we have the sub fees and we're making the channels better. So we don't need to buy anything. Our market share is growing. We have a good reputation around the world. Our brand is well known. In most countries, Discovery is the #1 brand for men. TLC is doing extremely well and profitable. ID is doing very well, as is Animal Planet. What we're really trying to do is be opportunistic. We've spent a lot of money and a lot of time over the last 8 years getting local. So we now have local teams in virtually every country. We have creative teams, we have strategic teams, we have sales teams and distribution teams. And so the opportunity to evaluate an asset, to have synergy and to be -- for the right asset, to put it together with ours, is a -- we're very uniquely positioned. And so we've been looking, but we are -- because we don't feel like we need to make any acquisitions, we've been quite careful. So we have -- there's been a lot in the press about some of the things we've been looking at, and the truth is, we look at everything. But we only want to buy assets that are going to really help us strategically and get us to grow faster or as fast in the long term. And so we've passed on a lot of stuff. And sometimes, when we look at assets, we look at assets with a distribution partner, often because that partner could provide additional value to us. So when we evaluate a deal, we look at the synergy of the transaction, whether we think there's upside for -- to build in that market and how strong the asset is. But also, we have very good relationships with distributors and the ability to do a tag-along, where we can do deals to get additional carriage, maybe better carriage, maybe better economics from a distributor when we, on occasion, look at joint bidding. Those are the kind of things that we think about. We don't need to do anything. This quarter, we grew 23% with double-digit affiliates. Our international business is really in full stride. So that's kind of how we see that. On the domestic side, our deals -- we were able to get better economics with roll-downs. And we did do TV Everywhere, and we were able to get -- the aggregate basket of value we got was quite good, and we're very happy with it. And you'll continue to see that flow through. And it represents the fact that we now have over 12% of the viewership on cable and very strong affinity brands. On the OTT side, I've said it before, and it continues. It's just probably the best time to be in the content business when you own your own content, at least for the near term, for the next 3 to 4 years because there's more and more buyers and more windows for our content. And in the U.S. now, to have an OTT buyer is just somebody else that wants to pay significant dollars to have access to some or all of our channels and access to some or all of our programming. We are platform-agnostic here in the U.S. and around the world. And when we have an opportunity to bring in extra dollars in ways that we think provide long-term value, we will. In other cases, there -- we've only done 2 SVOD deals outside the U.S. We could do a number of SVOD deals and just bring in more dollars, but we've decided strategically that we're better off really driving our cable channels right now and aligning with our distributors because in some of those markets where, like Brazil, where only 26% of the market has pay-TV, we don't want to mix up our brand yet until that market and other markets are more penetrated. Finally, SVOD is a real opportunity for us. We didn't do a deal with Amazon, but we still may. We have a good relationship with them. We have a good relationship with Netflix. We have a good relationship with Hulu. The fact that our market share is growing means we have more shows. Tyler Perry has a show on OWN that's the #1 show for all of women on cable on Tuesday nights with Haves and Have Nots. Naked and Afraid is doing great for us, Gold Rush. So we have a lot of good shows, and they're getting better, but we think that our content has real value. And when you put on any of those platforms, you need a bulk of content and you need quality content, and we think we have both. And so we think you'll see some SVOD deals from us. You may see them soon, you may see them later. But right now, the only issue for us is there's a gap in the value that we think all of our content is worth with all of our brands and the value that some of the distributors think. But I think that we'll find a way to true-up that gap.","Andrew C. Warren","And just to add 2 points, Jessica, on the international front. As we talked about, a strategic imperative for us is to grow our base organic margins. And if you look at the first quarter, take out SBS and excluding foreign exchange, which was a negative year-over-year impact, we grew our base international margins 100 to 200 basis points. And as we look forward, second quarter, third quarter, fourth quarter, which includes SBS, we still expect to have, in that base, including SBS, margin growth and accretion year-over-year. So margin expansion is a key part of our strategy and a big piece of our operating imperative. And just to add to David's comments on SVOD, nothing about our current thinking that says it's going to be fourth quarter. As Dave said, it really depends on when the right deal and the right economics get done. That could be any time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Todd Juenger of Sanford Bernstein.","Todd Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","At this point, I'll try and keep just a couple of quick ones. On OWN, you mentioned multiple operating metric strengths and the return of some cash, but then the equity income line, which I know includes more than OWN, actually showed a sequential deceleration. So I just wondered if you could walk us through any of the impact in there and then what we should think about that going forward. The other quick one is just you mentioned the Olympics' impact in Q1 on some Discovery ratings. Just as we look forward in the summer, don't want to get surprised on this, anything we should think about in terms of World Cup and what that does for global advertising, both here in the States and then around the world?","Andrew C. Warren","Look, on time -- on OWN, Todd, it was -- we couldn't be happier with how the asset's performing. The $30 million swing year-over-year on cash flow is just tremendous for us, and that's the metric that we most look at and most follow year-over-year. With regard to the other income, fourth quarter is particularly strong based on the recognition of some of the Time Warner deal that we got done. But the performance of OWN right now is ahead of our expectations, both from an earnings perspective, in particular, and a cash flow perspective. So right now, it's really all positive signs from the key metrics that we look at and the imperative, if it's delivering value for us.","David M. Zaslav","And we're taking Oprah's content outside the U.S. We've launched a lot of the OWN content in South Africa, in Australia, where it's doing extremely well. And overall, the channel is -- it's outperforming. The advertisers are all with us. We now have all the distributors. And Oprah is really in full stride with a great brand that is really resonating with both men and women here in the U.S. and starting to resonate around the world as we roll it out.","Todd Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Yes, so the second question was just, as we think about advertising over the summer, you had mentioned Olympics as a small factor in Q1. Just want to make sure, World Cup, if there was anything we should think about that in terms of what it means for you guys in terms of global advertising, both here, Europe, Latin America.","Andrew C. Warren","Yes, Todd, it should be a relatively small impact. I mean, some markets will be more meaningful, but overall, it will be a small impact.","Operator","Your next question, that comes from the line of Michael Nathanson of MoffettNathanson.","Michael Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC","I just have 2, I guess, housekeeping for Andy or if Dave wants to jump on this. SBS posted 11% EBITDA margin this quarter. Is that typical for the first quarter for that asset and kind of in line with what you thought it'd be? So just an update on that margin this quarter.","Andrew C. Warren","Yes, Michael, it's in line with expectation. It is their lowest-margin quarter of the year. Obviously, we didn't have the business consolidated with our results in 2013, but it's in line with expectations. And right now, SBS is performing in a kind of at or slightly better than we would've thought. The costs and synergies are better. The one thing that was arguably a little worse than we would've thought in the first quarter was the Olympic impact, particularly in Norway and Sweden. Given the performance of those athletes in those markets, there's a lot of ratings and viewership that went to those broadcast networks. But net-net-net, the asset's performing at or better than we had expected, and the first quarter is clearly their low point on an overall margin based on advertising flow and timing.","Michael Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC","Okay. And then just let me ask one on amortization. You've been calling out the stepped-up amort from SBS. When Eurosport closes, any sense of what the equivalent amort will be from Eurosport on top of the SBS? So any sense of that at this point?","Andrew C. Warren","Yes, Michael, for this year, given the timing of when we close Eurosport, it should be about $20 million. And on an annualized basis going forward, think about roughly $35 million of intangible amort.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Richard Greenfield of BTIG.","Richard Greenfield - BTIG, LLC, Research Division","I really wanted to just follow up on Michael's question. When you look at SBS, you've now owned it for a year. And while you didn't report Q1 last year, I was just wondering, could you give us a sense of what the growth profile of SBS looks like, revenue, EBITDA, anything? And I realize you had some impact of Olympics in Q1, but just anything to give us a sense of what the organic growth of that asset would've looked like on a year-over-year basis? And then essentially a similar question. Now that you're going to own more than 50% of Eurosport, could you give us a sense of what the growth profile now looks like of that asset in Q1 year-over-year?","Andrew C. Warren","Sure. On SBS, Richard, the growth, again, is in line with expectations. It was basically in-line flat to last year. Again, the Olympics impact was significant. For us, we expect to see some dilution of our overall top line growth just given the fact that it is a slower-growth asset. But again, we do think we're going to have meaningful margin accretion based on the performance of our synergies, both from the top line and cost. So the growth for that business should be slightly better than our expectation of deal case, which really speaks to the value and the multiple that we paid on a relative basis based on actuals is actually quite good and better than our due diligence and deal scenario. With regard to Eurosport, we're actually not going to highlight that specifically now. We will certainly, as we go forward, start highlighting the year-over-year variances. We'll speak more specifically to Eurosport and its performance, but right now, it's not something that we're going to highlight in any granular way.","David M. Zaslav","From a narrative perspective, Rich, Eurosport has been sold on a pan-European basis in 54 countries. And so the first thing we're going to do is sort of what we did 7 years ago, 8 years ago, when we attacked our international business. Because our international -- when we were making $100 million a year, we were selling only pan-European. We already have local sales teams in every country. We have very good relationships with the distributors. We have infrastructure in every country. So the first thing we're going to do is get the -- take advantage of all of the infrastructure we have in place already, which we think will be very efficient and effective in driving the overall performance of Eurosport, both in terms of deals that we're able to get with distributors, because we package their between 1 and 4 channels in each of those countries with our 8 to 10 channels. Also, it will be very easy for us, at little or no cost, to be selling locally because we already have teams in place. And so we'll apply a localized attack, which will help both in terms of cost and revenue synergy. And then we'll take a look at the overall asset. The good news for us is, for the next couple of years, the cost of the content is quite stable at this point because they've locked in tennis, which is U.S. Open, the French Open, the Australian open. They've locked in cycling, which is Tour de France and the key cycling events, and Winter Sports. Those are kind of the 3 big pillars of Eurosport, and those are locked in, in terms of cost structure for the next couple of years. So the question then is, as we drive this asset on a cost and revenue synergy side, is there -- is that all we do and just build the brand and build the asset that way? Or are there opportunities in local markets, with distributors or other players, to enhance the business by getting more aggressive? But we're going to take our time. We love the asset. We think it complements our existing infrastructure. It also gives us more scale in every market. And one of the hidden assets of Eurosport is we own all of the IP of all of those sports in Eastern and Western Europe on every platform. And as you look at where the world is going, for the next 3 years, the world is probably not going to change that much, and we just got more people wanting to spend more money and more windows for our content, and that's the good news. But if the world does change, the more IP you actually own, the better strategically positioned you are. And so we own all of our content on our 20-year library. And now to be in a position where we have meaningful live sports that are very popular with key affinity groups that we own all of the rights to, and all that IP becomes a nice hedge asset for us and may be an important one in the years ahead as you look to offer some of those sports that are real affinity sports maybe directly to customers.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Michael Morris of Guggenheim Securities.","Michael C. Morris - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","A couple on advertising. Andy, you mentioned cancellations being up a little bit. Could you provide a little more color on that? Is that coming from some place in particular? Any more details there would help. And also, David, can you talk about just the advertising environment in general? It seems to be slowing a bit for TV. How much do you think is sort of the macro environment, and\/or are you seeing competition and increasing competition from new digital competitors? And then just one other. Andy, in the past, you've mentioned high single to low double-digit EBITDA growth or OIBDA growth this year, excluding some of the nonrecurring or new items. I think that compares to the 6% in the quarter. Can you just highlight if that does compare to the 6% and what the swing factors are for your acceleration, if it's still the case this year?","David M. Zaslav","I'll just start with the advertising market. It feels pretty steady. I wouldn't read into the slightly up on the cancellation. It's pretty steady as she goes. We feel like the market remains strong. Pricing is good. We're heading into an upfront with real strength across our channels. So we're feeling good about it. It's too early to tell where the upfront is going to go. This quarter is pretty steady, looking good. The advertising market remains pretty strong, and pricing remains quite good.","Andrew C. Warren","Yes, Michael, on the cancellation front, like I -- it's up slightly. I would say a year ago was probably below normal levels, and now we're kind of at normal levels, so it's a small uptick. Again, to David's point, it's certainly not a cause for big concern. On the overall organic OIBDA growth story, we're still very much in line with that high single, low double-digit growth for the year. 6% for the first quarter was depressed a little bit for a few reasons. One, if you look at our corporate costs, they were actually, on an apples-to-apples basis, flat year-over-year. We continued to focus on cost productivity and driving down our SG&A structures, and we've done that. But there were 2 items in the first quarter that did meaningfully impact our overall growth rate. First was around professional fees. We have spent a fair amount of money on our tax restructuring efforts, with great payback. You saw, in the first quarter, our effective tax rate was down to 34%. So we're definitely seeing traction on the effective and cash tax line. But it does cost some money to make those kind of organizational and structural changes happen. And so some of the cost is in the first quarter. The other piece was our founder, John Hendricks, an amazing man, retired in the first quarter. And so there was some cost associated with his retirement and some acceleration of compensation and equity that also impacted our results. So net-net-net, we're still very much in line with and believe strongly in our high single-digit to low double-digit overall organic profit growth story.","Craig Felenstein","Thank you, everybody, for joining us.

We will then open the call up for your questions.","Before we start, I would like to remind you that comments today regarding the company's future business plans, prospects and financial performance are forward-looking statements that we make pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Today, we are excited to announce that Discovery Communications has reached an agreement to acquire 100% of Scripps Networks Interactive for $90 per share, comprised of 70% cash and 30% Discovery Class C or DISCK shares.","This transaction will bring Scripps' world class portfolio of high-quality, deeply loved brands, including the Food Network, HGTV, Travel Channel, the Cooking Channel, DIY and Great American Country together with Discovery's portfolio of world class brands, including the Discovery Channel, TLC, ID, Animal Planet, OWN, Velocity and Eurosport, to create a new global leader in real life entertainment. This transaction supports and accelerates Discovery's pivot from a linear TV-only company to a leading content provider across all screens and services around the world.","We know the Scripps assets and management team well. And we believe this transaction checks all the boxes that we look for in driving growth and creating long-term shareholder value. By coming together with Scripps and combining two world class organizations, creative teams and quality brand portfolios, we are building a global content engine, spanning multiple categories, including sports, like the upcoming Olympics in Europe; entertainment; lifestyle; factual; Kids in Latin America; and free-to-air in major markets like Nordics, Germany, Italy, Spain, UK and Poland as well as our superfan brands here in the US.","I'd like to touch upon the key strategic rationale for why we are so excited about this transaction and how it will benefit our viewers, deliver value to advertisers, distribution partners and create meaningful value for investors. I will then turn the call over to Ken Lowe, my close friend for almost 30 years, for some of his thoughts on the deal, followed by Gunnar, to provide the key financial highlights of the transaction. Following this, Gunnar and I will return to provide commentary on Discovery's second quarter results. Let me quickly summarize the reasons why this acquisition is great for Discovery and its shareholders.","First, we will become a premier portfolio of owned and controlled IP across a broad range of genres. This positions us very well as our industry continues to evolve. Second, we expect this combination to unlock global strategic synergies, driving significant value. Third, there will be significant upside to extend Scripps brand and content internationally. Fourth, together we can accelerate the innovation and rollout of digital and mobile content on new platforms. And finally, we expect to produce robust free cash flow, allowing us to maintain our investment grade rating and quickly leading to further balance sheet flexibility. I'll speak to each of these in more detail.","For both Discovery and Scripps, content has always been our North Star. Scripps has a wonderful heritage of storytelling and creating quality brands, formats and content. And together, we will produce approximately 8,000 hours of original programming annually. We'll be home to approximately 300,000 hours of content, and will generate a combined 7 billion short-form video streams monthly, demonstrating our commitment to delivering content as a top short-form provider.","Combined, Discovery and Scripps will capture about 20% share of ad-supported cable audiences in the United States. The combined company will be home to two of the top cable networks for women with over 20% share of women watching ad-supported prime time cable in the US. During the last few years, Scripps has grown outside the US, now reaching over 175 countries with 60 unique feeds. We feel one of the most exciting aspects of this transaction is our ability to take the Scripps brands, programming and talent around the world to the next level.","Over the last 30 plus years, we have built a best-in-class international distribution, sales and languaging [ph] infrastructure that gives Discovery an efficient and flexible foundation to maximize quality content across multiple markets around the world. This is what we do, and we are excited to do it with the world class Scripps brands.","We are excited by the opportunity to program our existing global female brands like TLC, Real Time and Fatafeat in the Middle East, with content from Food Network and HGTV. We can also take those strong brands and formats like Food and HGTV and launch them in new territories and capitalize on our combined talent, formats and IP to introduce new brands and products from our portfolio to help our distribution and advertising partners.","As part of its global strategy, Scripps also acquired a larger footprint in two of our top growth markets, the UK and Poland. In Poland, Scripps acquired TVN, a leading Polish broadcaster with part ownership in nc+, one of the leading distributors with nearly 2.5 million subscribers in Poland. Both businesses will highlight our collective presence in Poland.","Similarly, in the UK, Scripps owns 50% of UKTV in partnership with the BBC, one of the leading portfolios of entertainment channels with nearly 10% audience share. We believe having this larger presence and ratings share will help grow our combined business in our number one international market. Another strategic opportunity of this deal is to use Scripps lifestyle content to fortify our pipeline for Home & Health in Latin America. Home & Health has been a growing brand and business for many years and has successfully licensed some of Scripps content in the past. With full access to the Scripps brands and lifestyle pipeline, we expect to more fully optimize and monetize this content across all of Latin America.","The combination of our collective brands and IP enhances our optionality to create and participate in new mobile and OTT products and platforms, and simultaneously strengthens our expertise in short-form content creation, data driven marketing, endemic advertising and branded entertainment. Notably, between Scripps' strength, 2 billion plus views per month and leadership in the important food category and our stake in Group Nine Media, we will together, account for 7 billion mobile first short-form streams and be a leading Snapchat provider.","Our industry is evolving quickly, but I can't be more excited about the opportunities this combination will bring to our company, for our viewers, for our advertisers and distribution partners and for our shareholders. Scripps is a great company, and one of the big reasons I'm so optimistic is that our companies, our cultures and our workforces share a lot of the values that make these kinds of integrations a lot smoother and more successful.","Ken just finished his 37th year at the Scripps Company, which he helped build into one of the finest, most successful media companies in the world. In fact, Home and Garden itself was Ken Lowe's idea. He is a great leader, a great entrepreneur and a great friend. And I'm thrilled to also announce that Ken will be joining our board.","I'll now turn the call to Ken, and then Gunnar will walk through the financial highlights of the transaction.","Ken Lowe","Thank you, David, for those very kind words. You're much too generous. I'm very pleased to be sitting here today with David, Gunnar, Bruce and the Discovery team to talk about this exciting combination. Bringing Scripps together with Discovery creates an industry leader that will open up new opportunities in the United States and around the world to serve our advertisers, our distribution partners and our superfans.","At Scripps, we have successfully transitioned from a US focused TV network company to a comprehensive and global lifestyle content business. Just like Discovery, we're delivering our content on a multitude of platforms, building deeper connections with consumers everywhere regardless of device or geography. This agreement presents an unmatched opportunity to grow Scripps leading lifestyle brands like HGTV, Food Network and Travel Channel across the world and on new and emerging social and mobile platforms.","Discovery has a terrific set of brands, a great management team and it's built the best and broadest international platform in the world. They know how to take entertainment brands, take things global, make them better than anybody else. And Discovery has already extended Scripps programming into international regions such as Latin America, and this has demonstrated the significant upside potential to extend our brands around the world. Each of our companies has made strong progress driving innovation in mobile, over-the-top and direct-to-consumer platforms. Together, no doubt, we'll be a more innovative enterprise in short-form video as well as branded content, endemic advertising and data driven marketing.","We can quickly accelerate our progress with best practice sharing, greater scale and a deeper portfolio of brands, ensuring we continue to grow our relationship with our passionate fans worldwide. I'm really delighted to be joining the board of the combined company, and I look forward to working closely with David and the entire Discovery board and team to drive growth and create long-term value for our shareholders.","I'd also like to make sure that you saw our 8-K that we filed this morning with our earnings pre-announcement. In light of the agreement with Discovery, we wanted to provide you with an early look at our second quarter results and our updated full year guidance. As our 8-K indicates, due to continued ratings and impression softness in the US market, as evident in our second quarter ad results, we now expect 2017 total company revenue growth to be approximately 4% versus our prior guidance of 6%. And due to the lower revenue outlook combined with higher expected programming and SG&A expense, we now expect full year total company adjusted segment profit to be approximately flat for the year versus our prior guidance of up 3%.","I will not be taking questions about Scripps financial update on this conference call, but you can follow up with our team with additional questions on our results.","With that, let me turn it back over to Gunnar.","Gunnar Wiedenfels","Good morning, everyone. I will now provide more details on the terms and financial expectations for this transaction. Let me start with a recap of some key parameters. The purchase price values Scripps equity at $11.9 billion plus approximately $2.7 billion of rolled net debt. This implies a total transaction value of $14.6 billion. Scripps shareholders will receive a 70-30 mix of cash and Discovery C Class or DISCK stock. The cash portion will be funded from cash on hand and new debt to be raised and is backstopped by a fully committed bridge facility from Goldman Sachs. The reference stock price for Discovery C Class shares is $25.51, which is as of the close on Friday, July 21. We have also provided Scripps shareholders a symmetrical collar around this reference DISCK share price. Within a band from $22.32 to $28.70, the value of the stock consideration is fixed to an adjustment of the exchange ratio. Outside of that band, the value is variable. The transaction includes a customary breakup fee of 3% of total equity.","Post closing, Discovery shareholders will own 80% of the economics of the combined company and Scripps shareholders will own 20% on a fully diluted basis. The deal is expected to be accretive to free cash flow and adjusted earnings per share in the first year after closing and is anticipated to generate run rate cost synergies of approximately $350 million by 2019. We plan to realize half of the synergies in the first year after closing, and we will budget a one time cost to achieve of around $300 million to $350 million in the first year after closing. The cost savings will predominantly come from shared corporate technology and operational efficiency. To put this into perspective, savings of approximately $350 million represent less than 10% of the combined company's expense base, excluding content, marketing and advertising expenses.","And as David discussed, we also see the opportunity for significant growth in both linear and digital advertising and affiliate sales globally as well as the generally improved vantage point on our journey to a more direct-to-consumer and digital future, none of which has been included in our deal model.","Pro forma for the approximately $350 million in cost synergies alone and baking in no revenue upside, the acquisition AOIBDA multiple on 2017 estimated AOIBDA is 8.7 times and is, as such, relatively in line with Discovery's current trading AOIBDA multiple. While leverage on the combined company will initially rise to approximately 4.8 times gross debt to AOIBDA, we are committed and confident in our ability to delever quickly and maintain a strong balance sheet and our investment-grade rating.","Let me give you a bit more background. First of all, please note that all of our analyses fully take into account Scripps new lower full year 2017 revenue and EBITDA forecast that Ken mentioned earlier. And of course, their updated expectations have been fully accounted for in our models and valuation work. We intend to develop substantially all of our free cash flows toward paying down debt until we are back within our new target gross leverage ratio of 3 to 3.5 times, which is expected to occur by the end of 2019 at the latest. To be clear, that means we will be suspending share repurchases until we are compliant with our new target leverage metrics.","Please note that the transaction is subject to approval by Discovery and Scripps shareholders, regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. John Malone, Advance\/Newhouse Programming Partnership and Scripps family shareholders representing an overwhelming majority of common voting shares of Scripps have entered into voting agreements to vote in favor of the transaction and take certain other actions in each case subject to the terms and conditions of their respective agreement.","And with this, I will turn the call back to David to give an update on Discovery's second quarter results.","David Zaslav","Thanks, Gunnar. Now I wanted to touch on a few highlights from Discovery's second quarter. The second quarter was another important chapter in our strategic pivot to reach viewers across every screen, platform and service around the world, which we expect will accelerate with the Scripps transaction. We continue to make real progress in maximizing our linear business while making significant progress in growing our digital, mobile and direct-to-consumer channels around the world. I'll begin with a few details on the strong performance of our global content portfolio where our superfan strategy continued to engage viewers and drive growth.","Discovery was again the number one non-sports network for men in the US in the second quarter, with Street Outlaws ranking as cable's number one unscripted series among men, ID earned its best second quarter in network history in the US, ranking number one across all ad-supported cable for women, and ID's audience was up 17%. TLC's resurgence has continued in the US, with hits like 90 Day Fianc\u00e9, Happily Ever After, Little People, Big World, 7 Little Johnstons, My 600 lb Life and Skin Tight, together driving 10% growth among women in prime.","OWN was again a top network for African-American women and the number one network for African-American women on Tuesday nights. And Velocity earned its 19th consecutive quarter of growth. Outside the US, Eurosport grew its ratings by 17% as a record number of fans tuned in for Giro d'Italia, the French Open and Wimbledon. Third quarter has kicked off with continued momentum, highlighted by record breaking ratings for the 2017 Tour de France, which were up 10%.","We remain focused on driving digital growth across three complementary tracks: ad-supported online video, subscription based OTT and mobile-first short-form video. First, on the ad-supported front. In the US, our TV Everywhere GO apps continued to see impressive growth with a 72% increase in streams since the fourth quarter 2016, and we continue to attract a much younger demo with half of GO viewers ages 18 to 34. Looking into the current quarter, Shark Week made a huge splash on GO and helped us record our highest live and on-demand streaming to-date on GO, delivering over 4 million on-demand and live streams through Saturday, with over 60% of the audience ages 18 to 34.","On our second digital track, we continued to expand our subscription based OTT business through the Eurosport Player, our sports streaming product. I'd like to highlight four key linchpins supporting the continued rollout of this product. The first is an improved technology capability as we transition to the BAMTech platform. Second is our updated product and pricing strategy, namely our recent strategic pivot to a season pass model and a more tailored country-by-country approach. Third, our new and differentiated distribution deals. In the second quarter, we announced two major telco distribution partnerships for the Eurosport Player. One with Telecom Italia and another with Swisscom, the mobile leaders in Italy and Switzerland, respectively. The partnerships commit these two mobile and broadband leaders to market the Eurosport Player to their millions of subscribers, providing a very efficient and exciting customer acquisition pipeline for us. Because they bill for the service, we expect it will be a real helper in acquisition as well as reducing churn because we'll be part of their billing process.","Furthermore, Telecom Italia was the first partner to sign up to being the official mobile broadcaster for the Olympics. The partnership grants Telecom Italia access to the rings and brings exclusive and differentiated Olympic Games content to their users. Fourth is leveraging our deep rights packages, notably Eliteserien in Norway, MotoGP and Tennis have been large drivers of the recent sub growth as subs have nearly doubled over the past six months.","In summary, we continue to learn a lot about our direct-to-consumer product. The way consumers are interfacing with it, the data we are able to access, and we're very pleased with the continued momentum in our subscriber growth. In this vein, as we continue to focus on driving growth for the Eurosport Player, instead of the old model of simply licensing our channels to a third-party with no customer information, we have made the strategic decision to exploit our Bundesliga soccer rights through the Eurosport Player in Germany for the season, starting in two weeks. This is a big decision, reflecting an important trade-off. We are building asset value at the expense of lower short-term revenues compared with a traditional distribution deal. We're confident these rights will help significantly accelerate growth for our Eurosport Player platform. And we also expect to elevate the Eurosport brand to a new level in Germany, a key market for us.","We also continue to see other opportunities to monetize the Bundesliga rights as highlighted by our recent deals to bring the games to Switzerland's Swisscom and Teleclub subscribers. By the time of the first Bundesliga match of the season, we are confident the Eurosport Player will have additional distribution partners in Germany who are recognized household brands in that market.","As Gunnar will discuss in more detail, in light of our decision around Bundesliga, we now expect full year international organic distribution growth of approximately 10%. We are still very comfortable with our official constant currency guidance of low to mid-teen adjusted EPS growth and low double-digit free cash flow growth for 2017. During the second quarter, we also announced a deal with Amazon UK to stream Discovery Channel, Eurosport and Olympics content to UK Prime subscribers, extending our reach with the help of Amazon's marketing prowess and data around customer behavior and habits.","Finally, we continue to fortify our leadership in short-form, thanks in large part due to Group Nine. Discovery and Snap teamed up last week to bring Snapchatters a mix of highly informative and entertaining Shark Week content on Snapchat Discover. Shark Week on Snapchat was a great success. The Shark Week premier falls within the top three Snapchat show premieres to date in terms of audience size, and over the course of last week, over 12 million unique Snapchatters tuned in to the show.","We also have put concepts into development for MythBusters and ID snap series. Since our investment, Group Nine has grown an astonishing 40% to nearly 5 billion monthly streams. The Group Nine relationship and the scale of streams on Facebook has opened doors for us to work with Facebook to greenlight a number of mid-form content series that we recently announced on their Spotlight platform.","I'll now turn it over to Gunnar for more details on the quarter.","Gunnar Wiedenfels","Now I will share the highlights of our second quarter financials. Our second quarter results were driven by continued global distribution growth combined with a strict focus on cost management. Our total company reported revenues and adjusted OIBDA were both up 2%, while our constant currency revenues and adjusted OIBDA were up 3% and 2%, respectively, as currency impacts on our revenues and profits continue to improve this year.","Net income available to Discovery Communications of $374 million decreased versus the second quarter a year ago due to below the line items. On the positive side, we had improved operating performance and a lower effective tax rate of 20%. However, these positive effects were more than offset by a large non-cash $67 million swing in below the line FX expense due to revaluing our cash and other balance sheet items held in foreign currencies as well as higher equity earnings losses, primarily due to the timing of our solar investments. These losses depend on the number of installations going live in the quarter, and we are currently ahead of plan, which led to the losses totaling $42 million in the second quarter versus our expectation of $30 million while the full tax benefit will still come over the balance of the year.","Looking forward to the full year. We are now quite confident to achieve a full year tax rate of a couple of hundred basis points below 20% as we continue to benefit from our international asset base as well as our solar investments. The full year book loss from solar is expected to total approximately $200 million with the current expectation that the remaining impact will be split evenly between the third and fourth quarters. Note that net-net, we still anticipate that our solar investments will have a positive impact on the full year net income as the benefits from our tax credits as well as the tax shield on the book losses will more than outweigh around $200 million of book losses.","Now let us turn to EPS. Earnings per diluted share for the second quarter was $0.64, and adjusted earnings per diluted share, which excludes the impact of acquisition related non-cash amortization of intangible assets, was $0.68. Keeping in mind the large below the line FX swings mentioned earlier, excluding currency impacts, adjusted EPS was up 9% for the quarter. Second quarter free cash flow was $157 million. The decline versus prior year period was almost completely driven by the timing of working capital. Our full year outlook for free cash flow, excluding FX, has not changed.","Turning to the operating units. Let me start with our US Networks. Our US Networks total revenues were up 2%, led by 4% distribution growth and flat reported advertising growth. And adjusted AOIBDA was up 4% given lower SG&A and cost of revenue. Our flat advertising growth or up 1% on an underlying basis, excluding the impact of December's Group Nine transaction and the deconsolidation of Seeker and SourceFed, was primarily due to strong pricing and improved monetization of our GO platform, which again added a point of growth in the quarter, partially offset by lower delivery due to continued Universe declines and the timing of Shark Week, which aired partially in the second and partially in the third quarter last year, but aired 100% in the third quarter this year. As we look ahead to the third quarter of 2017, we currently expect reported US ad growth to accelerate versus the flat growth this quarter and be up low single digits.","In more detail, as just mentioned, we will benefit from the timing of Shark Week as well as easier comps versus the Olympics last year. And otherwise, we are seeing similar trends in the second quarter. We expect to continue to maximize yield on our linear networks as pricing remains healthy, which will likely be offset by overall [indiscernible] declines. Additionally included in our outlook is, again, 1 point of growth from our GO platform, which will again be offset by 100 basis points impact from the Group Nine transaction.","Now let us look at affiliate revenues. Our second quarter domestic distribution revenues were up 4% with growth drivers similar to the first quarter, higher contracted affiliate rates, partially offset by a decline in subscribers. To a lesser extent, growth was also driven by contributions from other distribution revenues, i.e., content deliveries under licensing agreements. Total portfolio subs in the second quarter declined by just over 4% year-over-year, an acceleration versus the first quarter when subs declined just over 3%.","As we stated on our year end call, we still expect 2017 full year distribution revenue growth to be in the mid-single-digit range, assuming subscriber trends remain relatively consistent. We will continue to benefit from higher pricing in our existing affiliate deals and we will also continue to aggressively pursue additional ways to increase our digital distribution revenue and monetize our content across all platforms. With existing and new distribution partners as the media landscape continues to change.","Turning to the cost side. Operating expenses in the quarter were down 2%, leading to adjusted OIBDA growth of 4% with margins expanding by 200 basis points to 64%. As we look ahead to the rest of the year, we will continue to focus on managing and limiting US cost growth with year-over-year total cost growth still expected to peak in the low single digits range in the third quarter, partially due to Shark Week and our scripted drama, Manhunt: Unabomber.","I will now turn to our international operations. Reported revenues were up 3% and adjusted OIBDA was down 4%, while excluding currency, revenues increased 4%, and adjusted OIBDA was down 5%. For comparability purposes, my following international comments will refer to our organic results only, so will exclude the impact of currency. The 4% second quarter revenue growth was comprised of 7% distribution growth and 1% advertising growth. Our 7% distribution growth was driven by higher affiliate rates throughout Europe, where we have already been successful in monetizing our expanded content portfolio that now includes sports to secure higher contracted pricing increases and higher rates throughout Latin America, partially offset by a onetime favorable contractual adjustment in Europe in the second quarter of last year.","Looking forward, as David mentioned, we are revising our full year distribution outlook given our strategic pivot on Bundesliga in Germany, and we now expect growth of approximately 10% for the full year. Let me explain this decision in more detail. Clearly, Bundesliga will not be profitable this year based on the player alone, but as we have stated before, we are optimizing the total value of our sports IP portfolio over the long contract terms. We always want to balance exploitation across linear, digital and sublicensing and, given the early successes we have seen pivoting to the season pass model and leveraging premium rights for the player as well as the high value of these rights, we believe that at this point, this is the best way to maximize monetization.","I will reiterate what David said; we will now expect real acceleration of the player and expect to elevate the brand to a new level in the key German market. We're convinced we will be able to build real asset value here, which is clearly a top priority at the expense of short-term revenue growth. As you have seen over the past quarters, we have been successful in limiting our cost growth to create profit headroom that allows us to make such value-oriented exploitative decisions without having to take a hit on AOIBDA.","Turning to advertising. Our 1% growth was mostly driven by growth throughout most of Europe, excluding the Nordics, due to improved ratings and volume, offset by declines in the Nordics due to put and share challenges and declines in our smallest region, Asia-Pac. As we look ahead to the third quarter, we expect ad sales to be up low to mid-single digits, helped by easier year-over-year comps with the Olympics and the European Football Championships. We expect to see growth in most Europe and Latin America, again offset by weaknesses in our smallest region, Asia-Pac.","Turning to the cost side. Operating expenses internationally grew 8%, primarily due to higher sports content and production costs. Given the tough AOIBDA comp as this quarter saw lower revenue growth from distribution and advertising in the quarter versus higher sports cost this year, AOIBDA growth was down 5%. Looking ahead, we expect total cost growth to peak next quarter at high single to low double digits and then come down in the fourth quarter.","As indicated on our last call, we also want to provide an initial framework on how to think about the financial impact of the Olympics for 2018 and beyond. Let me start with some thoughts on the value of these games, please. Summer Games generally have more hours, are more popular and bring in higher revenues than Winter Games. Location matters as well, given the impact of time zones on value in individual markets. As you know, the first three games are in Asia with our current expectation being that the 2024 Games will be in Paris.","On this basis, our current working hypothesis, which represents our best expectation at this time, is that we will recognize 10% of the total $1.4 billion rights cost in the first quarter of 2018 with 30% then recognized in 2020, 15% in 2022 and 45% in 2024. Other financial implications for next year's Olympics are: we expect an additional $100 million of production and other costs to also be recognized in the first quarter, and we do not expect the Olympics to have a material impact on our full year profit. As we have discussed before, the majority of revenues will come from sublicensing, which will be recognized in the other international revenue line. And additional revenues from ad sales, digital, as well as some attribution of affiliate revenues in Europe due to the halo effect of having these rights.","Now taking a look at our financial overall picture. In the second quarter, we spent a total of $301 million repurchasing our shares after investing $15 million gross in solar. We have now spent over $8.5 billion buying back shares since we began our buyback program in 2010. And we have reduced our outstanding share count by over 38%. During our first quarter call, we talked about a review of our capital structure and allocation approach. Having completed this review, I am happy to largely reiterate our financial policies. Looking forward, as stated, we remain absolutely committed to our investment-grade rating with the new goal of ultimately having our gross leverage between three and 3.5 times. Once we are comfortably in that range, our capital allocation philosophy will remain the same. First, investing in the company and strategic accretive M&A with remaining capital allocated towards buying back stock.","Finally, regarding our full year guidance, as mentioned, we are reiterating our expectation that full year 2017 constant currency free cash flow growth will be at least low double digits. I am also pleased to reiterate that constant currency adjusted EPS growth will be at least low to mid-teens. While our net international affiliate outlook is lower, on the positive side, we continue to manage our constant currency total company cost of revenues to be in the high single-digit range versus the previous guidance of high single to low double-digit range.","Our budgets had always left us with headroom and, following our success in managing these costs in the first half of the year, we are now comfortable going to the low end of that range. We still expect total company constant currency SG&A growth to be flat to up low single digits. Finally, these metrics exclude any impact from the Scripps deal. Clearly, we do expect additional interest and transaction costs, and we will update you on these items later in the year.","I also want to update you on the expected year-over-year foreign exchange impact on our full year reported results, which has again improved versus our prior guidance, given the recent weakening of the dollar as well as our hedging program. Assuming rates stay constant for the rest of the year; the year-over-year FX impact on revenues is now expected to be around flat with a slightly negative impact on advertising revenues and a slightly positive impact on affiliate revenues, canceling each other out.","On AOIBDA, currency remains a slight tailwind and is still expected to have a positive impact of $10 million to $20 million. Finally, currency is now expected to have a negative $0.13 to $0.16 impact on adjusted EPS, primarily due to last year's below the line FX gains.","In closing, let me come back to the Scripps transaction. This is a very exciting time for us, and we're extremely optimistic about the opportunities this accretive combination creates for our company, for our viewers and for our shareholders. We will become a global content leader in a strong position to drive sustainable growth. The combined company will innovate and leverage our effective brands and expertise across existing and new platforms around the world to drive growth, innovation and long-term value creation for shareholders.","Thank you again for your time this morning. And now David, Ken, Bruce and I will be happy to answer your questions. Please note we would like to keep the questions on the transaction and Discovery's second quarter results.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of John Janedis of Jefferies.","John Janedis","David, when we look at your focus on the international business and sports over the past three years, I guess, this is a bit of a pivot, so can you talk about why now? Is it simply the rapid change in the US? And looking ahead a couple of years, do you think you have the global portfolio you need across all platforms?","David Zaslav","Thanks, John. A great day for us. And it's a good question. There's such alignment in terms of how we see the future with Ken and Scripps. We own almost all of our IP and we take it around the world and can take it on to any platform. And Scripps, similarly, owns its IP. We moved into this structure of thinking about our content more about what will people watch when they can watch anything, and what do we have that people will pay for before they pay for dinner. That's why we got into Eurosport. That's why we did the Olympics and we bought so much sports IP. It's one of the reasons why we've pushed very hard with Kids in Latin America, where we're the leader, and it's one of the reasons why we've really tightened up our brands, whether it's Oprah, Discovery about curiosity, ID with crime, and we believe the ability to take that IP around the world and direct-to-consumer is the future of Discovery. And nobody has done that better in terms of passionate superfan brands than Scripps.","A few years ago, when we were looking at Scripps, we were 75% to 80% male around the world with our 10 channels. But over the last four years, we've launched TLC around the world. We have Home & Health. We've launched free-to-air female channels in Europe. And so we think that their content, as we sprinkle it in 55 languages around the world, together with their formats, together with the ability to convert underperforming channels that we have, like we did with ID and with TLC, we could do that with Food and HGTV. So we think that this gives us a huge content engine, and it also allows us to pivot that content onto any platform, whether it'd be skinny bundles, direct-to-consumer or the 7 billion screens out there in mobile.","So I think this gives us much more optionality, much more strength and the idea of our company being filled with passionate content that delivers to superfans around the world, Travel, Home and Garden, Food, Cooking, all I think make us much stronger, and it fits right on top of us. We have this huge infrastructure and this just fits right in on top of our existing infrastructure.","John Janedis","Okay. And maybe on the cost front. You guys spoke of the $350 million in the cost synergies. From an affiliate fee perspective, can you speak to any potential in the benefits of scale on future negotiations? And can you help us with any timeline for potential revenue synergy upside?","David Zaslav","Just speaking to the affiliate side, the brands that Ken has developed and the great team that he has at Scripps are some of the most loved brands on cable. When you put them together with us, our mission has been quality brands. Scripps' mission has been quality brands, and so we now have some of the most important quality brand with superfans here in the US Whether, though any entertainment bundle, we would be right in the sweet spot of delivering passionate viewers, people that are spending time watching television or spending time with these brands and we'd be a critical element of that. As I've said many times, as you look around the world, we're on every skinny bundle in a meaningful way around the world because almost every skinny bundle is entertainment.","Here, it's a bundle that has sports, and we're the only market with retrans [ph]. We think this helps us with our ability to get on to all bundles, but as there's a transition to skinnier bundles and entertainment bundles, over-the-top, direct-to-consumer, this gives us terrific IP, that helps us, and Ken has been so effective in getting his content on all platforms. Ken, you may want to speak to that?","Ken Lowe","Well, yes, John. I just echo a lot of what David has said. When you look at the future of bringing Scripps into Discovery, it really future proofs our brands, I think, on a global basis. First, let me just say how proud I am today of all our employees and the brands they built, the digital businesses they've built. And now to be able to think about this on a global basis, combining with Discovery, is really exciting. And to echo what David said, the content that we have so successfully, both companies, created developed on linear, now has this huge opportunity on digital basis, on a social basis, on short-form video.","And John, you've heard us talk about this for several years now. How we pivoted the company and how we've successfully started moving into these areas. So it's just a historic day for Scripps, for the Scripps family, for the employees of Scripps Networks Interactive, and we couldn't be more excited about the future together and the possibilities that are out there.","David Zaslav","One point on distribution which we think is meaningful. Discovery provides about, today, 12% of the viewership on cable and we get about 6% of the economics. And Scripps provides 8% or 8 plus percent of viewership and also a much - a smaller amount of economics. When you put us together, we're about 20% of the viewership on cable, but we're less than 10% of the economics. And so we're very low priced, which I think gives us some opportunity and headroom to move that up, but more importantly, as people are choosing content to put on a platform, our content, together, way over delivers in a way that's - not just over delivering in terms of the passionate audience or the ratings, but in terms of the economics that it's being paid for it in the marketplace today.","Gunnar Wiedenfels","And John, maybe on the synergies, clearly we do see a lot of strategic synergy on the top line as well. As I said earlier, the $350 million number that we have put into our model is purely cost synergies, and we haven't baked in any upsides on the top line.","David Zaslav","So as you look at our international business, all those female channels, generally, our ad revenue over a period of time of like a year would track pretty close to our market share growth, particularly because GDP is about zero around the world. So as our international business was growing double-digit or mid-teens, our market share was growing. And so we look - this isn't built into the model, but we look at their model, at their content, which is basically unencumbered, largely, around the world and being able to convert that into 55 languages, we already have been buying their content in Latin America for Home & Health and seeing a very significant lift, and we'll be able to deploy that content around the world. And if we see market share gain, that'll translate very quickly to real advertising value for us around the world.","John Janedis","Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alexia Quadrani of JP Morgan. Your line is now open.","Alexia Quadrani","Actually my question is sort of a follow-up on that, if you don't mind. On the revenue side, if you could maybe prioritize, it sounds like there's a tremendous opportunity on the revenue side for this combined company. But I'd love it if, in the intermediate term, you could sort of prioritize where you see those kind of lie? Is international sort of at the top of the list? Is it US distribution? I know that a lot of the distribution agreements have recently been signed at Scripps and as well as at Discovery. Does that limit your ability to kind of relook at those until they expire? Or is it maybe in the over-the-top where - I know Scripps is on some over-the-top distributions that Discovery is not. Is there an opportunity to kind of go back and revisit those discussions? If you could sort of give us more color on sort of the - what are the priorities in the immediate term, that would be great?","David Zaslav","Thanks, Alexia. I think it's all of the above. As we look at our company and we put our - we look at our company in baskets. You look at US distribution. I think this helps us with direct - with the skinny bundle. It helps us with the entertainment bundle. It helps us over-the-top and gives us a lot of flexibility to provide more and more content to distributors also on mobile. In addition to the distribution side, on the advertising side, we now have five of the top channels for women and we have an even stronger portfolio to go to the advertising market with. And one of the things that Scripps and Ken and the team have done very effectively that we can learn from is bringing in endemic advertisers. Nobody has done a better job than they have. In short-form - the short-form basket, we think this helps us a lot. We've already invested in Group Nine, where we have over 5 billion streams a month, and we're a leader on Facebook. They are the leader with Food and they have over 2 billion. So together we're now one, two or three in terms of short-form content and that content goes around the world.","Domestically and internationally, we think that being able to take our content and use it across all of these channels should help us as we - in many markets where there is some secular decline, the ability to move the talent, the content, the IP around our linear channels, on other platforms gives us I think a real strategic advantage. Ken?","Ken Lowe","Yes. And Alexia, I totally agree with your scenario about top line growth. Just give you one example, and we've talked about it recently. In January, we launched HGTV in Poland, as you know. It immediately, just overnight, has become the second lifestyle network, second only to our other lifestyle network there, Style. But what's been interesting is we've already seen the same pattern with HGTV in Poland that we've seen domestically. And that is the ancillary revenue opportunities, as David said, endemic advertising, the social media that's already sparking up around this. So just imagine launching our brands globally, as David has said, and having the same attributes on a global basis that we've seen domestically. So we think we can bring a lot of firepower to the top line growth with these brands as we accelerate their launch around the world.","David Zaslav","As we look at this combined company, we may have more IP than any other media company. We're certainly up there, and if our strategy is correct that the consolidation by the distributors so that, over the next couple of years, there'll be one distributor providing mobile, broadband, multichannel and hard phone, which we're already seeing in Europe. More and more you see these distributors wanting to decommoditize [ph] that pipe. We did a terrific deal with Bollor\u00e9 in France. We've done a terrific deal with Drahi. We've done a deal with Telecom Italia. In each case, saying, what IP do you have that could either be exclusive or interesting for us to give to our users or to uniquely nourish our subscribers or users? And we just have now a bigger menu of affinity brands, lots of content we can put together for - down in Europe, in Latin America and here in the US, and we have a lot more data.","One of the things that Scripps has done better than anybody is to lean in, not just to the superfan affinity group, but to get data and to have real interaction with them. I mean, Ken talk about that because that's the practice that we think we can really learn from and bring to our company.","Ken Lowe","Well, as we've talked about on our earnings calls over the past several years, these brands bring along an affinity group, a passionate group of folks that we like to say do, what they view. And as we have been able to dig deeper into data, for example, let's take the HGTV Dream Home, where we had over 130 million entries in this year's home. Those are opportunities to get direct communication with consumers where we can bore deeper on data, find out viewing patterns, find out behavior patterns and most importantly buying patterns, and that's why we've been able to over-index on advertising. And if you really look at the future, we've talked about this many times, again, it's taking what we - both companies have done an outstanding job on linear television and now, thinking about how we take that globally to bring in additional revenue streams. So based on everything we have to date and looking at each other, this is just the perfect marriage as far as two companies and two incredible management teams and employee groups coming together.","David Zaslav","One important point about that is that we look at the management team at Scripps and we see that as one of the most important assets that we're acquiring: their ability to program Home and Garden and Food and take it to different platforms and to build a real relationship with the users and to figure out how to nourish them on all platforms. It's a hugely talented team across the board, marketing, programming, sales, and so I think, as we look at it, we get a chance to take our team, which we think is best of class and Ken's team that's best of class and build a company for the future.","Ken Lowe","Yes.","Alexia Quadrani","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Cahall of RBC. Your line is now open.","Steven Cahall","Just two for me. First, I was just wondering if you might be able to give us a range of EPS accretion that you expect in the first year based on where your current models are today. I know you've got a lot of moving parts today between Olympics and the change to the SNI outlook, etc. And then secondly, I was just wondering if you could give us a little more detail on what you saw in the quarter in terms of the slowing or - sorry, the accelerating subscriber declines at the portfolio level that you mentioned. Do you think this is a seasonal thing? Do you think this has to do with maybe the introduction of some of the VMVPDs? Or do you think that this may start to be a trend that you see in future quarters? Thank you and congratulations.","David Zaslav","I'll hit the universe decline piece. It's about 3% is what we're seeing for our larger channels. Some of the smaller channels that we have are seeing a decline a little bit larger than that. It's pretty hard to tell based on the quarter. You look at what each of the distributors are reporting, and it feels like maybe that's about right, maybe it's a little bit better for us than that, but we'll just have to see whether it levels off at that, gets a little better or gets a little worse. It's very hard to tell but, right now, it's around 3% for our bigger networks.","Ken Lowe","Right, and even on the accretion, I think we kind of hit a sweet spot with a 70-30 cash versus equity mix, making use of the balance sheet without jeopardizing investment-grade rating. So we clearly look at a deal which is going to be accretive in the first year already. I will also say that the $350 million synergy number, I'm very, very confident with our ability to achieve that. To remind you, we're planning to achieve 100% of that by 2019 and about 50% in 2018. And as I said earlier, I'm very, very confident that we will not only achieve but likely overachieve this number.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Benjamin Swinburne","David, could you talk a little bit about how you're thinking about direct-to-consumer in the US? I know it's something you've been working on in Europe and have deployed. Sounds like you're having some success there. The US market is trickier given the earnings you generate from the bundle. Does this deal change sort of your calculus on going to market here? And do you have the capabilities and the rights you need to do it here if you so choose? And then, I just have a couple of quick ones for Gunnar. Gunnar, any tax synergies or tax comments you can give us about the pro forma entity? You guys have a, I think, a 500, 600 basis point lower tax rate than Scripps does with some nice cash tax characteristics as well. Can you help us think about the tax impact on the deal?","And on Bundesliga, I assume those rights fees grow for you every year that you pay the Bundesliga. What is the strategic decision you've made with the Eurosport mean as you move through the rest of the life of this contract? Do those losses sort of increase in the first part of the contract? Wondering if you can help us think about the impact of this decision on sort of the life of the contract, would be great?","David Zaslav","Thanks, Ben. This new company is going to have tremendous optionality, but the ecosystem in the US remains extremely healthy for us. Our US business, as Discovery is continuing to grow, together we think we can grow in a meaningful way for a lot of the reasons that we've already explained. Working with the distributors will be a very effective way to take all these quality brands and skinnier bundles and have them reach more consumers and more demos. Going over-the-top with some of our existing distributors or some of the new players will be a way to add incremental opportunity. I think we're going to be extremely attractive. We should be the core of any skinny bundle. Discovery was the number one most valued brand for over-the-top and for women, Home and Garden and Food are in the top three or four most selected brands. You add to that OWN and TLC and ID, which is the number one channel for women in America, we have quite a compelling offering that we could bring to any distributor or we can come together with a few others and do it ourselves. And so I think we have a lot of optionality.","Let me just hit the Bundesliga point because I think it's very important strategically. The direct-to-consumer business, we think, is a huge part of the future of our company. It's one of the reasons why we have been investing in Eurosport. We did the BAM deal. We have our sports Netflix product, which we're finding some real traction on now. We're learning a lot about - it's been two years, and in two years, we learned that our platform wasn't good enough, so we did the BAM deal. We now have that platform, which will be fully rolled out within the next six months. We've been talking to consumers for two years about what they like about our player, what they don't, how they'd like to have our content. We've changed the idea. Before we thought it was effectively like an ESPN all-you-can-eat for $8 and now, we're finding it's really more like a magazine rack. People that love tennis are willing to pay a lot more, but all they want is tennis. And some people who want cycling, all they want is cycling.","We had to talk to the users because they would come in for the French Open and then the churn would be huge, and we'd say, but wait a minute, MotoGP is on and cycling is on, and they said, No, no, I love the tennis, that's what I want. And so we're changing our pricing, we're changing our approach, our churn is coming down. We've almost doubled our subscriber base in the last few months. And so, we see the ability to take the Bundesliga in Germany direct-to-consumer now that we have a strong platform, a really good team that we built out of London that's just in the direct-to-consumer business. It's a direct marketing business. It's a team that deals with churn that deals with credit cards. And it took us two years to build that team and we're ready to go now. And the idea of building a direct-to-consumer sports business across Europe, 740 million people. If we could get that to scale, the kind of multiple that you guys are giving to Netflix, and we look at that and we say, we have a very profitable existing business and if we can build this direct-to-consumer business in Europe, and we're doing it with our other IP and we think we can do it with some of these affinity brands around the world, that we could come out of this terminal value tunnel as one of the big winners in media.","Gunnar Wiedenfels","And Ben, maybe to add to that. I mean, as you say, it's a long-term deal, it's four years. There are no meaningful increases in terms of the license fee over that deal term. And the way we look at it is we optimize the value of that contract over the full lifetime. The landscape is going to evolve over those four years. As a matter of fact, we're in the process of talking to a number of other partners. Matter of fact, we're confident that we will be announcing additional partnerships before the first match is going on air. So there's a lot of moving parts in that whole deal, and we continue to see a lot of value that we're optimizing out of that contract.","David Zaslav","The final point, which I think is important that we learned is we could be in the direct marketing business for our IP, but it's much more powerful if you can get existing distributors to market it and bill for it. So when we send a bill, whether it's $8 or $18 or $29 for a season's pass to a particular product, we're billing and the customer is now getting that every month. The deal that we did with Telecom Italia and Swisscom, they're now billing for us and they're marketing for us. And I think that, we believe, as we take that across Europe is going to be a huge helper for us. The idea that someone is now getting a bill for $116 and $8 or $10 or $12 of that is us, we believe that that's going to reduce churn. It's reduced churn significantly for Netflix. As John Malone would call it, it's check the box. It gives you an incremental heft in your marketer, and it puts you in a billing system that's much more sustainable. And that's a key part of our strategy, and we've proven that out in early stage by getting two of the bigger players in Europe to sign on with us. And we're going to look to take that across Europe.","Gunnar Wiedenfels","Right. So on your tax question, Ben, so we haven't factored any tax synergies into our model. That being said, of course, we will continue to be very, very focused on optimizing our tax rate. So let's wait until the deal closes, and I'm sure taxes will remain a key factor in all our decisions.","Benjamin Swinburne","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Mitchelson of UBS. Your line is now open.","Douglas Mitchelson","A few quick ones for Gunnar, and then one for David. Gunnar, any asset sales being considered at all to accelerate the deleveraging process?","Gunnar Wiedenfels","We're not planning any asset sales, but clearly let's wait until the deal closes and then we'll take a look at the broader portfolio and see how we can extract the best value out of the combined business. We're not planning any sales and we haven't baked anything into the numbers.","David Zaslav","One of the great things about this transaction is it's one-over-one. You look at TVN in Poland for instance. That's a very big market for us. We pick up a huge amount of EBITDA and a lot of market share in Poland. UKTV, our number one market is the UK, and we think that was a very smart investment. We like the BBC very much. Tony Hall has been a great partner to us and being able to step into those shoes, we're looking forward to that and seeing what we can do together. But you look at their overall assets, we're in the same business, and so we don't look at it and say, they've got a radio business here or they're in a different business there that we should get out of. They're in the core business that we are, and we think those core assets make us, together, stronger.","Douglas Mitchelson","That's helpful, and then I just wanted to confirm the commentary around EPS accretion. Is that for GAAP EPS or adjusted EPS, excluding purchase price accounting or both?","Gunnar Wiedenfels","Well, that would be, in the first year, clearly for adjusted EPS because we'll have some transaction costs but, going forward, it's going to be for both.","Douglas Mitchelson","For both? And then I noticed in the press release and commentary on the Advance\/Newhouse share class change. Is there anything meaningful in terms of the new class of stock versus the old class of stock?","Gunnar Wiedenfels","No. In terms of the economics and ratios, etc., nothing has changed. There's no real value transfer. It's really just a flexibility increase. But Bruce, do you want to?","Bruce Campbell","Yes, it's Bruce. That's exactly right. The transaction, which was negotiated actually by a special committee of our board, from an Advance\/Newhouse perspective, just gives them more flexibility and liquidity in the C shares that they hold. But in exchange for that and the reason the company went along with the agreement, Advance\/Newhouse have a consent right over the Scripps deal, so as part of this exchange, they gave their consent. In addition, they agreed to give the company a 7.5 year right of first offer should Advance\/Newhouse decide to sell their Series A preferred shares, which have special voting rights attached to them. And then lastly, for the C common shares, which now have increased liquidity for Advance\/Newhouse, they did, however, agree to a three-year lockup on those shares that kind of plays out over the next three years. So it was a good exchange for both parties.","Douglas Mitchelson","David, given the strategy change on Bundesliga games in Germany and the commentary you gave earlier on the Eurosport Player progress, can you give us sort of the [technical difficulty] about the Olympics and the sublicensing progress so far? I think there might be some news out for licensing in Germany?","David Zaslav","Sure. Thanks. We had said earlier that we were going to do the Olympics ourselves in Germany with the buzz and it's not final, but the buzz around Paris being a possibility for 2024 and with the momentum that we were able to build across Europe, we ended up back in discussions with ARD ZDF, the public broadcaster in Germany. It's one of our biggest markets. And we're very close to deal with them where we would give them rights to broadcast the Olympics, but it will be quite creative and the Olympics in Germany will be, like in other markets, much more robust than it's ever been. It'll follow the model that I worked on at NBC with Dick Ebersol and Jack Welch and Bob Wright, and that was - you put a significant amount on broadcast, but our deal would provide a significant amount that would go on our Eurosport channels. We also have a free-to-air channel of Eurosport in Germany along with the full bouquet of content for digital that would be available to us to make available throughout Germany. And we think that this provides not just a good economic package, but it'll also give us an opportunity to really put on a terrific show in Germany together.","Gunnar Wiedenfels","Right, and Doug, just one follow-up on the EPS. To be very clear, obviously, the reported EPS accretion will depend on the amount of purchase price amortization - allocation amortization that we need to book. That's obviously still being worked out, but we should focus on adjusted EPS.","David Zaslav","A last point on the Olympics. If it turns out to be Paris, it will be a very big deal for us as we have the Olympics across all of Europe in 2024 and the buildup to it. There's a tremendous amount of excitement all across Europe at the prospect of it. And it really enhances that IP. We have so many Olympic rights that will be leading up to that, and as we put our bouquet of IP together across Europe, the crescendo, if it were to happen, would be very good for us.","Douglas Mitchelson","David, do you have a sense of when that would be announced?","David Zaslav","Probably within the next few weeks, I think, yes.","Douglas Mitchelson","Thank you. Thank you all.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Rich Greenfield of BTIG. Your line is now open.","Brandon Ross","John - it's Brandon Ross for Rich. John Malone has talked openly about the move for the so-called free radicals to combine. Is this step one of several? Or you now have sufficient stuff [ph] as you see the media industry rapidly changing? And then just one more, do you see any of the brands that you have in the combined portfolio that may not make sense in the combined company?","David Zaslav","Thanks so much, Brandon. First, John loves this deal as does the Newhouse family. And I would say it's a very big step 1 because there is no final step for any media company today. But one of the most attractive things about this deal is not only is it accretive for us but within 18 to 24 months of this acquisition, we'll be below 3.5 times levered. We'll have a very flexible balance sheet with a lot of artillery. We're not out of bullets. Over the next two years, we still have enough room to do some selective purchases that are smaller, if we need to. But what's more important is that within two years, we'll be, in today's numbers, almost a $40 billion company enterprise value with a very strong balance sheet that will be levered below 3.5 times, and the optionality at that point to look at what else do we need to have sustainable high growth to come out of this terminal value tunnel as one of the big winners. What else do we need to add? Whether we need to add by investing in ourselves, in the brands that Scripps has developed, in more talent or more acquisitions to assure the fact that we continue to be the leader, the number one international media company, the leader in sports, the leader in kids and drive our content to all platforms. And so we love the idea that we're stronger with more optionality with - in less than two years after closing. Gunnar, anything to add to that? No?","Gunnar Wiedenfels","No.","David Zaslav","Okay.","Brandon Ross","Anything on the specific brands?","David Zaslav","On the brands. I think we'll evaluate all of them. At least for us, we had started to move toward looking at our 12 channels here in the US and seeing that a strong eight may be the direction that the industry is going. It's one of the reasons why when we restructured our deals, did all of our new deals, we were able to do it so that 85% of the revenue came from six of our channels. And the overwhelming majority of ad revenue comes from six or seven of our channels. Ken and Scripps have developed a lot of very strong brands. We haven't really gotten into it with Ken and the team to try and get their best sense of which - of whether all of them are going to be survivors and winners or whether some of them need to be invested in more or maybe some of them could be taken in a different way to mobile or to consumer. So Ken, your thought on your brands?","Ken Lowe","Well, Rich, as a now former free radical, no longer floating around out there. Look, I think you bring up a great question, but what we're finding, and I think that you could say the same for Discovery, is some of these brands have a very passionate base that may not necessarily, for the future, be a linear platform or a platform that we necessarily have thought about in the past. So when we think about these brands and especially on a global basis and beyond the deals that David and I have been doing for, as he said, 30 years, I believe we've been together that long, but I think we have to think in terms of might some of these reside in direct-to-consumer type brands, which would have a different financial model. But it's way too early, at least, I'm just speaking for the Scripps side, to start thinking about which brands \u201cgo away\u201d as opposed to which brands are better positioned in a different format and a different delivery, and we're already working on some of those.","You've heard us talk about it. If you take, for example, Food and Cooking, maybe you're only interested just in Italian cooking, maybe you're only interested in French cooking, comfort cooking. Those are passionate consumer bases that may or may not support a video or social model or short-form model. So I think the great thing about putting these two combined companies together, and I just have to go back through some of the headline numbers, 8,000 hours we're creating collectively each year. We have ownership of 300,000 hours. So let's think more about the opportunities ahead of us, less about what goes away as businesses. What other businesses can we enhance and develop? And to me, that's the real excitement of the announcement today, Rich.","Brandon Ross","We'll be waiting to hear. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kannan Venkat of Barclays. Your line is now open.","Kannan Venkat","Just a couple from me. First on the Olympics, Gunnar. So you mentioned the cost recognition schedule over the next few years, which was very helpful. Thanks for that. But on the cash flow front, should we assume a similar schedule? Or does the cash flow vary compared to the cost recognition on the income statement?","Gunnar Wiedenfels","No, you can assume pretty much the same flow there.","Kannan Venkat","Okay, and secondly, David, on the skinny bundles, it looks like there was a little bit of an acceleration this quarter on the pace of sub losses. The acquisition of Scripps, is this one of the ways - is there an ability, at least from your end, to use Scripps deals with, say, Hulu or YouTube in order to try and negotiate terms to get into some of these skinny bundles? Is that one of the objectives of this deal? And is that possible given how the deals are structured?","David Zaslav","Thank you. We've been in discussions with all of those providers. We are on the Sony platform, the DIRECTV NOW platform. I think it probably helps with those discussions to have more channels, to be in business with them already. I think they're all going to be learning. They're launching, and they're going to be hearing from customers what they like, what's missing. So I think it's all a work in progress, but we do think we have the makings ourselves for a very - the very compelling core of a skinny bundle. And there's all kinds of optionality, whether we go with existing players, new players, we go with other players in the marketplace, we go over-the-top with other players in the marketplace. There's a lot of different ways to play it, and we'll be really listening to the consumers. There's no question that there will be an evolution. It exists everywhere else in the world.","And more importantly, right now, distributors are starting to offer Netflix. And so it's just kind of logical to look in the US and see these large distributors that have millions of customers that are broadband only, and the only product that they're offering them is Netflix. And so they should be offering them a product that - we grew up in business together. We have great content that's nourishing. And so I think you'll be seeing existing distributors putting together over-the-top packages. One, because they'll make money on it; and two, because consumers that are buying Netflix want other products. They want great quality television. They want other choices. And so I think that will happen. It's just a question of how quickly, and we'll try and accelerate those discussions because we think it's good for the ecosystem.","Kannan Venkat","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Bazinet of Citi. Your line is now open.","Jason Bazinet","I just had one backward-looking question and one forward-looking. Gunnar, the 8.7 times you said you paid for this asset, I guess that confuses me because in the release it says $14.4 billion EV and I think Scripps did about $1.4 billion of EBITDA with new guidance for sort of flat as you move into - from '16 to '17. And then they don't control 100% or they consolidate the EBITDA, but they don't own all of Food. So can you just explain how you got to the 8.7 times?","And then my second question is for Ken, actually. The UK and Poland notwithstanding, what was the main impediment that prevented you from going internationally more aggressively? Was it an on the ground sales force? Or is it more a function of the content being sort of readily applicable to international markets? And the reason I ask is that might give us some window into how quickly Discovery could pivot and accelerate top line growth. Thanks.","Gunnar Wiedenfels","All right. So Jason, so the math is as follows: If you take the $90 per share that takes you to 11.9 times for the equity. Then there is about $2.7 billion in net debt and then, clearly, we have taken into account minorities and unconsolidated profits. And then the big step back is the $350 million synergy potential that we see, and that takes you back down to that 8.7 times range.","Jason Bazinet","So it puts in 100% of the multiyear synergies in the 2017 numbers?","Gunnar Wiedenfels","Right.","Jason Bazinet","Got it, okay. Thank you.","Ken Lowe","And Jason, it's Ken. A great question and one that, as you heard earlier, I'm very excited about because if you look at our opportunities on a global basis, this acquisition by Discovery just accelerates it in light years. If you go back and look at the history of these two companies, Discovery very smartly, early on, thought globally where we really have only moved globally in the last five years. So if you take the infrastructure, the distribution, and quite frankly, the time that Discovery has been developing this global footprint, global distribution network, if you will, they can almost immediately accelerate a lot of our brands that, in my opinion, would have taken several years to really fill out. And some of this is nothing more than just the time, energy and effort it takes to get there. Each country has its own culture, its own challenges. And what we found, and I'll go back to HGTV in Poland, when we can get our brands into a country, when we can localize them, in the case of HGTV Poland, a lot of Polish content, just not exporting our American continent, but creating content in these categories, food a great example, travel a great example. And you have two of the best storytelling, creative content teams in the industry between Discovery and Scripps. And now you take the Discovery infrastructure and you put our brands into it, and it's just very, very exciting. And I would expect to see our brands accelerate immensely as far as distribution, popularity and connecting with consumers once the marriage comes together. Hope that answers your question, Jason?","Jason Bazinet","So it's essentially both, on the ground sales plus you need to tailor the content?","Ken Lowe","Yes. I mean it's there. They're there. It takes a while - it takes - David will tell you, it takes a while to build these organizations out, to get them structured, to get on the ground, and we have found that. So this really just accelerates everything for Scripps.","David Zaslav","I guess the only thing that I would add is that the great thing about the dual revenue stream cable model, as we all know, is it's somewhat of a gated community. And so we're sitting, in a lot of these markets, where there's 50 channels and we have 10 or 12. And so when we decided we wanted to roll out ID or TLC, we could just flip those channels. And not only do we have infrastructure but we have channels that are on basic cable with subscriber fees in decent channel position. And so we can choose to take the content and make our female channels better or we can just flip an existing channel that's in good position and very quickly have it accelerating in. And as Ken said, you don't win by just bringing the US content. We would do local, but local tends to be less extensive, significantly less expensive.","Ken Lowe","Totally, yes.","Jason Bazinet","Understood. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of Barton Crockett of FBR Capital Markets. Sir, your line is now open.","Barton Crockett","Okay. I guess, a couple of things. First, Ken, I was wondering if you could talk about why you're taking monthly cash in this transaction as opposed to getting more equity participation in the combination? And as part of that, is - the trust that's been there since the beginning, the strong [ph] TV assets that you created, so they might have had a step up in cost basis, but are there tax concerns that make them relatively agnostic to the stock versus the cash? That's the first question.","Ken Lowe","Sure. Well, first off, I think, from day one, this was all about value. It was all about the right place, as far as the Scripps family was concerned, for the company, the brands and the employees. So you looked at total value overall, but - and I can't speak specifically for the family, obviously, but I think the tax issue part of it became less important over time than did what was the right partnership and the right place for SNI, for Scripps networks. So they're very excited of reuniting, if you will, with the Newhouse family. The Scripps and Newhouse family goes back for a number of years, joint newspaper operations. The Scripps family and John Malone owned cable systems together back in the '80s and '90s. So the opportunity to team once again with great partners, great stakeholders, and evaluation that the family felt for all shareholders is the best possible outcome, I think, is really what drove the family's approval of this deal. So taxes are always a consideration, but on top of value is very much about what was right for this company going forward and what was right for the employees. So that's probably the best way to answer that part.","David Zaslav","I would just sign off by saying how excited we are to welcome all the Scripps employees. It's going to be several months before the deal closes, but the idea of having them become part of our family, having Ken become part of our family, have all the incredible brands and creativity and energy. And we have so many great people here at Discovery that are chomping at the bit to try and - to get to meet all of you and to work together. And I think it's going to be a fantastic ride for us. The whole leadership team couldn't be more excited, and we're off to the races. So thank you all very much.","Ken Lowe","And let me just add one thing because David was so generous with his comments up front. For a company that I helped create, to be able to bring it to this level and now see the opportunities that Discovery brings to Scripps, that's exciting. But to turn the keys over to a person who I've known, as David said, for over 30 years and have nothing but the utmost respect for on a personal and professional basis, to know that David is going to be leading these two companies forward as they come together, for me, is personally exciting. And I can't wait to see what the future holds because it's going to be a great run and a great ride, and I'm so pleased and happy for my friend, David.","David Zaslav","Thank you, Ken, and we're going to take that ride together.","Barton Crockett","Okay. Thank you, everyone.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program. You may all disconnect.

Please proceed, sir.","Craig Felenstein","Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for Discovery Communications' 2013 Fourth Quarter and Full Year Earnings Call. Joining me today is David Zaslav, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Andy Warren, our Chief Financial Officer.","You should've received our earnings release, but if not, feel free to access it on our website at www.discoverycommunications.com. On today's call, we will begin with some opening comments from David and Andy. Afterwards, we will open the call up for your questions. [Operator Instructions]","Before we start, I would like to remind you that comments today regarding the company's future business plans, prospects and financial performance are forward-looking statements that we make pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Zaslav","Thanks, Craig. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. 2013 was another very successful year for Discovery, as the company delivered strong financial results while further developing our global content portfolio and investing in a diverse set of new and existing strategic growth initiatives. Discovery's ability to grow consistently year in and year out, even as global economies expand and contract, technologies rapidly evolve and competition increases across new and existing distribution models, speaks to the universal appeal of our content, as well as the sturdiness of our business model and the opportunities prevalent throughout our unmatched global distribution platform, now an average of 8 channels in over 225 countries.","The breadth and depth of the asset base we have built continues to offer a number of unique growth prospects. And while we have augmented this existing potential with several strategic acquisitions that we expect will deliver additional long-term value, our primary focus remains maximizing the organic opportunities that our unique global infrastructure and an evolving media landscape provide.","Demand for high-quality content with great storytelling and compelling characters has never been higher, and our unparalleled reach, combined with a sustained investment in building stronger global brands, enabled us to once again grow our market share significantly this past year.","Domestically, this was our fifth consecutive year of audience growth, with viewership across our portfolio up 4% in 2013. This consistency speaks to the ability of our creative teams to evolve and adapt as audience tastes change and choices proliferate. It also highlights the success we have had in further strengthening the existing brands like Discovery Channel, Animal Planet and ID, all of which had their most watched years ever in their key demos; and the success we have had growing emerging brands such as OWN, Destination America and Velocity.","Since 2008, we have launched 7 new brands domestically, more than almost all media companies here in the U.S. combined. And we fully believe that if we invest wisely and deliver content that is unique and engaging, you can still attract new audiences and deliver real value to advertising and affiliate partners, we believe.","Last month, we announced our newest brand, the American Heroes Channel, which will debut in March and expand on the Military Channel's promise to honor the great defenders of our freedom while providing a rare glimpse into major events and historical figures that have shaped our world.","The larger audiences we generated in 2013 once again translated into significant advertising gains, with 8% ad growth this past year as our best-in-class ad sales team maximized the solid pricing and demand environment while capturing additional dollars through customized ad integrations. I do want to note that ad growth did slow in the fourth quarter, as viewership decreased slightly across the portfolio. Several hit series on Discovery and TLC returned during the quarter, and although they delivered a large audience and won their respective nights, their viewership declined versus a year ago, when the portfolio grew over 14%.","The good news is 2014 is off to a great start, with January ratings up 11% versus the same period a year ago, and we have clearly regained our momentum.","TLC delivered 16% viewership growth in its key demo this past month, led by the success of several returning series and the strong debuts of several new series, including 90 Day Fiance and Gypsy Sisters.","Investigation Discovery, ID, drove viewership up 35% and is now the #2-ranked network for women in the United States in the 25 to 54 demo in total day, despite only being in 85 million homes. That is a wow. The #2 network for women, second only to USA Network. And ID as a network didn't exist 6 years ago. In addition, we still have a ways to go to fully maximize the CPM value of ID.","Discovery Channel generated the most-watched month in its history on the back of several returning series and the audience we generated from our first critically acclaimed scripted miniseries, Klondike.","And Destination America and Velocity were both up over 38%, as they continue to attract new audiences with their unique brands and compelling program offering.","January was another very strong month for OWN, led by the return of Tyler Perry's hit series, The Haves and the Have Nots, which is the #1 show for women in America on Tuesday at 9:00. Oprah and Tyler are really impressive.","OWN also has Love Thy Neighbor, along with the second season premiere of OWN original series, Raising Whitley. January ratings were up over 30%, building upon the 25% growth OWN produced in 2013. Most importantly, OWN is now delivering both cash flow and positive equity earnings to Discovery, and these returns should only grow, given the value it is generating for advertisers and affiliates.","With ratings strength across-the-board in January, we are off to a great start to the year. It's still early, but with the regained momentum across our portfolio, a strong upfront under our belts, steady scatter pricing and cancellations in line with a year ago, we're confident that we will deliver significant advertising growth domestically in 2014.","Advertising, however, is not the only area where we're leveraging the success of the content we've invested in over the last several years. Towards the end of 2013, we completed our latest round of affiliate negotiations, and we're very pleased with the very positive outcome, as our distribution partners continue to recognize the strong value of the brands we have built and the audiences we deliver. I've said this before, but it still holds true: there has never been a better time to be in the content business. People are watching more TV over multiple platforms, and because we own the majority of our programming, Discovery is particularly well positioned to take advantage of any opportunities, whether with our existing affiliate partners or new entrants to the marketplace.","While our investment domestically is certainly paying off in terms of new avenues of growth, market share gains and sustained financial momentum, the faster expansion and greater opportunity remains, without question, across our unmatched international portfolio, both from further development of our organic asset base, as well as from the integration of our recent SBS Nordic and Eurosport acquisitions.","Organically, the distribution pipeline we have built over the last 2 decades now averages 8 networks in over 225 countries, and we continue to capitalize on the further evolution of pay-TV, as well as the burgeoning demand for cable content.","Pay-TV penetration across the entire international portfolio increased double digit in 2013, led by 17% growth across Latin America and nearly 20% growth in Asia. And with pay-TV penetration still below 50% in countries like Brazil, Mexico and Turkey, there's still plenty of room for continued distribution gains, given our market position.","The global distribution we have secured has given us a significant head start internationally and continues to pay dividends. However, it is the targeted content and infrastructure investments we have made over the last several years that are allowing us to fully exploit the opportunities our unique market position provides and which will continue to enable us to grow as pay-TV penetration eventually subsides.","This past year alone, we launched over 17 new international feeds, offering more localized content, scheduling and languages that provide customized programming, which makes our networks more attractive for viewers, advertisers and affiliates. The strength and local feel of the brands we have built, together with the significant subscriber gains we are experiencing, resulted in viewership growth of 22% across our international portfolio in 2013.","Importantly, we are not overly reliant on any one region or country, as our audience gains have been very much broad based, with double-digit increases across nearly every region, led by Italy and Spain in Western Europe; Mexico and Brazil in Latin America; and Russia and South Africa in our CEEMEA region.","More and more viewers across the globe are connecting with our suite of networks as we leverage the success of our domestic programming, invest in compelling local content across pay and free networks and expand the reach of successful brands like TLC, ID, Science and Animal Planet.","As we have further invested in content and as markets have further developed, we have also made targeted investments to ensure we have the appropriate infrastructure in place to maximize the returns on the larger audiences we're delivering.","In the last 2 years, we have opened new offices in countries where local expertise and involvement will drive more value, and we've formed sales alliances in markets such as Italy, Colombia and the Netherlands, where additional scale helps unlock additional revenue opportunities, the result of marrying the market share growth we are delivering with the more efficient ad capabilities we have developed, a total of 23% ad sales growth this past year, excluding acquisitions, building on the 19% growth we delivered in 2012.","We fully expect to continue delivering strong organic ad growth moving forward, given the strength of our brands, the stability in the ad market and the trajectory of pay-television. At the same time, we have created additional value and further strengthened our long-term growth portfolio with the acquisition of SBS Nordic and our recently announced agreement to acquire majority control of Eurosport.","As we have demonstrated over the past several years, we are highly selective when pursuing external assets, but both of these businesses expand our portfolio and deepen our footprint across some of the most well-penetrated and stable pay-TV markets in the world. They complement our nonfiction networks in terms of genre appeal and demographic reach, while providing synergies that strengthen our relationships with existing advertising and affiliate partners.","Already, we have made significant progress in integrating the SBS Nordic assets, taking out millions of dollars in costs across the combined platforms. While most of the expense synergies have been recognized, we are still in the very early days of maximizing the revenue opportunities. We have, however, seen a marked increase in the number of new advertisers on our existing networks, with 75 new ad clients on Discovery and TLC in Sweden and 102 in Denmark since we established a joint ad sales team. So while early, there's plenty of indication that the diversity and depth of our content offering is quite compelling to advertisers across the Nordic region.","On the Eurosport front, we anticipate closing on the acquisition of a majority ownership position in the next few months, and we look forward to further combining the power of Eurosport's brands and audience reach with Discovery's network portfolio, local infrastructure and country-specific expertise to create an unrivaled and powerful offering for viewers, advertisers and affiliates.","2013 was another great year for Discovery, as we once again generated strong financial results while further executing operationally and strategically to better position the company for sustained long-term success.","As we move into 2014, our priorities remain unchanged. And with operating momentum throughout our domestic and international portfolio, a current favorable operating environment and growth opportunities across our organic and acquired asset base, we remain committed to further building shareholder value in the year ahead.","Now let me turn the call over to Andy, who will provide additional context for our expectations for 2014.","Andrew C. Warren","Thanks, David. And thank you, everyone, for joining us today. As David highlighted, Discovery delivered another very strong year in 2013 as we leveraged the audience and market share gains we're capturing around the globe into double-digit ad sales growth and realized double-digit international affiliate revenue growth from our increasing global subscriber base.","On a reported basis, total company revenue for the year increased 23%, and adjusted OIBDA increased 16%. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, licensing revenues primarily related to our existing Netflix agreement and the newly acquired businesses, most notably SBS Nordic, total company revenue growth for the year was 10% and adjusted OIBDA growth was 9%, demonstrating our sustained ability to deliver consistent financial results even as we invest in further building our networks and operations worldwide.","Focusing on the fourth quarter, on a reported basis, total company revenue increased 28%, led by 64% international growth and 5% domestic growth. Excluding newly acquired businesses, as well as the impact of foreign currency, total company revenue grew 10%. Total operating expenses on a reported basis increased 33% [ph] in the fourth quarter, primarily due to the inclusion of recent acquisitions. Excluding these newly acquired businesses and the impact from foreign currency movements, total company expenses increased 8% versus the fourth quarter a year ago, predominantly due to the anticipated higher content amortization we incurred throughout 2013, as well as some of the additional content write-offs we highlighted on our last earnings call.","On a reported basis, adjusted OIBDA in the fourth quarter increased 21%. Excluding newly acquired businesses and foreign exchange, Discovery's continued ability to generate revenue growth in excess of expenses translated into a 12% increase in adjusted OIBDA.","Net income increased to $289 million in the fourth quarter, up 29%, driven by the strong operating performance in the current year and by $37 million in improved equity earnings, highlighted by OWN's first quarter of positive equity contributions, a significant milestone. These items were partially offset by $56 million of increased amortization, primarily due to the purchase accounting associated with the SBS Nordic acquisition; $19 million of higher mark-to-market equity-based compensation due to the increase in stock price; and $14 million of additional interest expense.","Earnings per diluted share for the fourth quarter was $0.81, 33% above the fourth quarter a year ago. Adjusted earnings per diluted share, a more relevant metric from a comparability perspective that excludes the impact from noncash acquisition amortization of intangible assets, was $0.92, a 51% improvement versus 4Q 2012.","For the full year 2013, earnings per diluted share from continuing operations was $2.97, up 18%. And adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations was $3.25, an increase of 29% compared to 2012.","Free cash flow increased 4% in the fourth quarter to $316 million, as the strong operating performance was partially offset by continued content investment and increased cash tax and interest payments.","For the full year, free cash flow increased 14% to $1.2 billion, driven by the strong operating performance, partially offset by higher content investments as well as increased interest payments and working capital needs. Importantly, content spend for the full year, excluding newly acquired businesses, increased by only mid-single digits. And as David discussed, this increased programming spend is delivering global market share growth and higher advertising revenue.","Before moving on to the divisional results, I do want to highlight that, while not part of our free cash flow, OWN repaid Discovery $34 million in 2013, including $23 million in the fourth quarter alone. We anticipate that in 2014, OWN's cash contributions will increase significantly, given its ratings and advertising revenue momentum.","Now turning to the operating units, the U.S. Networks continued to perform well during the fourth quarter, with total domestic revenues up 5% led by 7% distribution revenue growth. Excluding additional licensing revenue, total domestic revenue increased 4%, with distribution revenue up 5%, predominantly from higher rates and, to a lesser extent, additional digital subscribers.","Advertising revenue increased 4% in the quarter as a stable pricing and demand environment was partially offset by delivery declines at Discovery Channel and TLC.","For the full year, our U.S. ad sales team delivered another year of strong growth, translating the 4% viewership gains across our portfolio, most notably from Discovery Channel, Animal Planet, ID, Destination America and Velocity, into 8% total domestic ad sales growth, which is on top of the 9% ad increase the U.S. Networks delivered in 2012.","Current ad market trends continue to be stable, with scatter pricing up double digits from the mid- to high single-digit gains we garnered during the upfront negotiations. With the regained ratings momentum in January that David mentioned and with the healthy macro environment continuing, we anticipate ad sales growth will accelerate in the first quarter 2014, despite competition from the Olympics.","For the full year 2013, our distribution team also delivered solid results, delivering 5% growth, excluding the impact of licensing agreements. They also completed several new affiliate deals with existing operators that secured higher rates across the portfolio, locked in additional distribution for a number of our emerging networks and obtained real value for granting authenticated content rights.","Turning to the content -- to the cost side. Domestic operating expenses were up 6% from the fourth quarter of 2012, primarily due to the anticipated higher content amortization associated with cash programming spend over the past few years, as well as from the onetime content expenses that we highlighted on the last call related to the termination of the BBC programming agreement and the content impairments associated with the TLC management change. Excluding these onetime costs, operating expenses at our U.S. Networks increased 3% compared to a year ago.","Domestic adjusted OIBDA increased 5% on both a reported basis versus last year's fourth quarter, as well as excluding the impact of licensing agreements and content write-offs. For the full year, domestic adjusted OIBDA also grew 5% on a reported basis, while increasing 4% excluding the impact of licensing agreements.","Turning now to our international operations. Reported results include the impact of newly acquired businesses SBS Nordic, Switchover Media and Fatafeat.","For comparability purposes, my following international comments will refer to the results excluding these acquisitions. The International segment continued to deliver a very strong momentum across our global operations this past quarter, with revenues expanding 15%, led by 25% ad and 13% affiliate growth.","Excluding the impact of exchange rates, total revenue growth was 18%, with advertising and affiliate revenues increasing 26% and 16%, respectively. The advertising growth was broad-based, with double-digit increases across nearly every region, led by Western Europe, primarily from the continued success of our free-to-air initiatives, most notably Real Time in Italy; and by Latin America, from higher pricing and delivery across the regions.","The fourth quarter was a culmination of a very strong year for our international ad sales team, which translated the viewership gains we're capturing around the globe into 23% ad growth, excluding the impact of foreign currency.","On the affiliate front, the 16% affiliate revenue increase in the fourth quarter, excluding currency, was driven by subscriber growth, especially in Latin America, from the continued expansion of pay television in Brazil and Argentina, as well as by the consolidation of Discovery Japan. Excluding Japan, affiliate revenue growth would have been up about 10% for the quarter and high single digits for the full year.","Operating costs in International were up 14% in the fourth quarter, excluding the currency impact, primarily driven by higher content amortization, increased personnel cost as we further expand our global footprint and by the consolidation of Discovery Japan.","The International segment delivered 21% adjusted OIBDA growth in the fourth quarter, excluding foreign currency, as our international team continued to significantly grow revenues while investing in smart, long-term growth initiatives. The fourth quarter wed up another year of exceptional financial and operational execution by our international team, with 2013 revenues and adjusted OIBDA both up 16%, excluding foreign currency. These results followed the 18% revenue and adjusted OIBDA growth, excluding currency, that they delivered in 2012.","Taking a look at our financial position. With a strong balance sheet and sustained financial and operational momentum, we continue to return capital to shareholders through execution of our share repurchase program. As we discussed, our first priority remains investing in our core businesses to drive sustained long-term growth, be it through investment in existing networks and platforms or through exploring external initiatives such as Eurosport. While that remains our focus, given the free cash flow we are generating, our gross leverage targets and long-range free cash flow per share growth assumptions, we have the opportunity to continue returning capital to shareholders, as well as invest in our global businesses.","During 2013, Discovery repurchased over $1.3 billion of stock. Since we began buying back shares towards the end of 2010, we have spent over $4 billion buying back shares, reducing our outstanding share count by more than 90 million shares, or 21%.","As we look ahead to 2014, we are encouraged by the momentum across our asset portfolio and the continued strong pricing and demand environment in many of our key markets. Important to note that current year guidance assumes that the Eurosport transaction closes during the middle of the second quarter, and while we have included the expected purchase accounting adjustments associated with the transaction in our guidance, these items are preliminary estimates. Therefore, we will update you if these assumptions materially change.","Additionally, while we do anticipate generating SVOD revenue during the year, given how these distribution revenues are recognized in the P&L, we have not included significant SVOD contributions in our expectations. As new SVOD deals are executed, we'll update our future guidance expectations.","With that as a backdrop, for the full year 2014, we expect total revenues to be between $6.45 billion and $6.625 billion and adjusted OIBDA to be between $2.6 billion and $2.725 billion.","For comparison purposes, excluding from these full year expectations any Eurosport contributions, the extra quarter of SBS results, the impact of SVOD and negative foreign currency headwinds of approximately $50 million of current exchange rates, we expect high single- to low double-digit total company revenue and adjusted OIBDA growth in 2014.","Net income is expected to be between $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion, led by the anticipated strong operating performance, improved equity earnings from continued progress at OWN and a lower effective tax rate. This growth is expected to be partially offset, however, by approximately $60 million of higher interest expense, as we anticipate issuing additional debt this year to maintain our target leverage, and by approximately $50 million of additional depreciation and amortization due to purchase price remuneration associated with the Eurosport transaction.","We also assume mark-to-market stock compensation expense of approximately $130 million, which is in line with 2013 actuals due to additional shares granted, as well as expected appreciation of the stock price.","Lastly, we anticipate free cash flow to exceed $1.2 billion in 2014, with significant growth in cash flow from operations being partially offset by higher cash taxes of approximately $150 million associated with the potential expiration of the Section 181 domestic content production deduction benefit.","Thank you, again, for your time this morning. And now David and I will be happy to answer any questions you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from John Janedis, UBS.","John Janedis - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Two questions. Maybe, David, I'll start with the first one. It seems like there's a lot of rumbling with Eurosport. And I think you've been pretty transparent about the opportunities you see with sports generally. And so looking ahead, there's been press about Premier League rights and maybe Formula 1, you've always had a longer-term view on investment, so can you update us on your appetite for sports-related assets going forward?","David M. Zaslav","Sure. Look, Eurosport, we think, is a fantastic asset. It's in 55 countries between 1 and 4 channels, and it has a lot of rights. And locked up for the long term on Eurosport is the Grand Slams for tennis, Tour de France, the Bundesliga and the Winter Sports. So it's very stable, and the economics against those sports are very favorable. So we're going to apply, really, 2 levers to it. One is, in every one of those countries, we have a local team that's doing sales and that's meeting with distributors to drive better distribution deals. So we can go very local. And if you remember, Eurosport only sells Pan-European right now. So what we did with our international business, when we took it from 120 million to over 1 billion, was we went local. So one, we think we have some real revenue opportunity by piggybacking on our existing infrastructure. And then, we will look opportunistically. There is no platform like Eurosport. In many ways, it's the ESPN of Europe. It's in 55 countries. And so as we look at what we can do with it, the question is, is there opportunities to get longer-term growth by stepping up in certain markets for more sports? If we do, do it, there's a good chance we'll be doing it in a joint bidding with a distributor or a player in the market. We'll be disciplined about it, but we're going to look at all options because, as we look at our portfolio, across most of Western and Eastern Europe, we already have 10 channels. We have Discovery as the #1 network in almost every one of those markets. We have TLC, we have Animal Planet, we have some broadcast networks. And so we have some real optionality in order to take advantage of this very unique asset. But we will be disciplined, and we won't do any deals unless we think there will be significant long-term growth or, as in the case of when we rolled out TLC and ID around the world, that we could pick up -- that it could be accretive immediately. So we'll be disciplined, but we do believe Eurosport, together with our assets, where we're already the #1 cable TV player outside the U.S. by a lot; and in Western Europe, we've made a big play; and we're finding a lot of success where we're growing over 20% in a market that's relatively flat, that Eurosport will be a very big helper to us over time.","John Janedis - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And maybe quickly, you've been asked in the past about hypothetical M&A among the MVPDs. With today's deal, is there any reason for us to rethink, I guess, maybe your long-term aspirational distribution growth rate in the U.S.? And does the deal change the terms of the recently signed Time Warner Cable deal?","David M. Zaslav","Thanks, John. Well, look, we're going to stick to our knitting. This is a great time to be in the content business because people are spending more time on TV and on other platforms consuming content. In the last 7 years, we've grown from about 5% market share; in January, we were over 12%. We have 14 channels that have niche viewers, whether it's OWN that's a top 20 network now and a top network for African-Americans, Discovery having its best month, TLC back and strong, Animal Planet now a top 20 network when it was #40. For us, if we have strong content with great characters and great stories, we are convinced that we will do very well. We did very well at the end of last year. And Comcast is a great company, and if they're successful in bringing this deal to the finish line, I'm sure that they'll do a great job in offering a lot of different products to consumers to consume content, including TV Everywhere, where they're a leader, and that will be advantageous for us. So I think that our scale in the U.S. is very strong. Our brands have never been stronger, and we like our position.","Operator","The next question comes from Doug Mitchelson, Deutsche Bank.","Meghan Durkin","This is actually Meghan Durkin standing in for Doug. I think Andy mentioned that he expects the U.S. ad growth to accelerate in 1Q despite the Olympics. So what more can you tell us about that? How much acceleration should we expect? And how big of a negative impact is the Olympics in the quarter? What exactly happens? Did you hold back content around the 2 weeks, or is it just an impact from advertising being sucked up over at NBC?","David M. Zaslav","Thanks, Meghan. Look, we faced some headwinds in the fourth quarter because Discovery and TLC were both down between 13% and 16%. And so that definitely had some impact, but our focus was to really dig in and start the year strong. And both Discovery and TLC are up. Our portfolio is up over 10%. The advertising market is very healthy and strong. Pricing is good. And so we're off to a very good start. NBC is doing a great -- Universal is doing a great job on the Olympics. That certainly will have an impact. But when we factor that in, we think the out-of-the-box strength that we've seen and the strength of the advertising market will allow us to perform quite well in the first quarter. We can't really say where we'll be for the year in terms of how strong advertising market stays, but right now, the market is good, and Joe Abruzzese and the team has been able to be quite effective. So we still have to see how we do with the Olympics. Andy?","Andrew C. Warren","Yes, just to put a little more color on that, Meghan, is the -- look, as we know, Olympics is really only 2 weeks. Right now, as David said, the market is cooperating and strong. Cancellations are low. So it really depends on the scatter market and ratings. But right now, we definitely see some acceleration from where the final results were for the fourth quarter.","David M. Zaslav","There's no question the Olympics is having an effect on our ratings, but our strategy has worked. We came out very strong in January with a lot of momentum, viewers spending a lot more time with all of our brands. And now we expect that a lot of people in America are going to be spending time with the Olympics. We see our ratings are down on a few of our networks in a meaningful way, but we expected that. And when the Olympics end, we're going to push hard to have those viewers come back.","Operator","The next question comes from Todd Juenger, Sanford Bernstein.","Todd Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","A question and a follow-up, if I may. Just start with, you guys have been in most markets around the world for a long time. So I would love if you just could reflect on, every so once in a while, things flare up in emerging markets and people get scared, and then things tend to come back and do well, and it goes up and down. How does the underlying growth of pay-television in those markets respond to those ups and downs? How correlated would you say, especially recently, in the environment we're in now, is the growth of pay-television in emerging markets to the bigger macro ups and downs of those markets? Then I have a follow-up.","David M. Zaslav","Thanks, Todd. Look, it has some impact. Having said that, we've been able to grow our viewership over the last year over 22% and get corresponding ad revenue of 23%. Our brands are strong. Our content travels well. There's no question that, when you see the economy struggling, that subscriber growth slows down a little bit, and we've seen that. And we view this as upside. In Western Europe, with the strength we're seeing; in Mexico, where pay-TV is only 42% penetrated; or Brazil, 27% penetrated; if those markets pick up, then I think you'll see the C class opting on to more pay-TV, which we'll be an upside for us. But I think if you look at the past 2 years or 3 years around our 225 countries, it hasn't been -- with the exception of Brazil, Mexico, Russia and India, you haven't seen huge growth. And so I think that there -- it's more upside for us, and we've really focused on being disciplined in how we spend our dollars, getting our content driven around the world and being better at ad sales so that we're growing over 20% internationally over the last several years in economies and subscriber growth that's somewhat modest in terms of what the potential would be in a lot of those markets.","Andrew C. Warren","And Todd, just to add to that, one metric that we look at is the Discovery Channel and how much that sub-base is growing internationally. And in 2013, it was up 8%. So that's a good proxy for -- that's the most widely distributed channel out there. So that 8% growth is indicative of kind of how the market is still growing at a nice clip.","Todd Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","That's actually very helpful, Andy. Then a quick follow-up. Not to spend the whole morning talking about the Olympics, but I just wanted to follow up with Meghan, because if you look back at the last Summer Olympic Games, one thing that took us, at least personally, a little bit by surprise was actually the impact on international advertising. So I guess the question would be, both with the Winter Olympics now and then also with the World Cup coming up, is there anything we should think about more in the international advertising markets in terms of any displacement?","David M. Zaslav","Sure. Well, look, the Olympics is a moment where families come together around the world, and it most certainly has an impact. It's probably biggest in the Nordics for us, where we don't have the Olympics. We have market share in those -- in Norway, Denmark, Sweden and Finland of between 25% and 42%, and we don't have the Olympics. And so in some of those markets, we're seeing more viewership decline. But it also depends of the brand. For instance, Discovery has historically had much bigger impact in terms of people moving away from Discovery to go to the Olympics. So I would say it's all consistent with what we've expected so far.","Todd Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","And World Cup, any different?","David M. Zaslav","I think the same, but probably a little bit more modest across-the-board for us because of the number of hours. It doesn't take people away for 3 straight weeks, or 2.5 -- almost 3 straight weeks like the Olympics do.","Operator","The next question comes from Anthony DiClemente, Nomura.","Anthony J. DiClemente - Nomura Holdings, Inc.","Just 2 questions, I suppose both for David. The first one was, in terms of your ratings resurgence in January, I'd just be interested to hear, was there anything that -- any string that you pulled, any levers that you pulled in terms of getting ratings to turn around? How should we think about that? And then I have a follow-up.","David M. Zaslav","Okay. Well, we did make a change on TLC about 5 months ago. We focused very hard on what is TLC when it's at its best. The good news is we now have TLC as the most distributed female brand in the world. So we looked at where we were successful outside the U.S. and what the audiences were getting nourished by, and the new creative team there, I think, has taken it up a level. And so we're very happy with TLC, which was up almost 20% in January and is faring well so far in February. On Discovery, I think it's really more about we have a lot of very good shows that are coming back. March, I think, will be a very good month for us in terms of when our premieres are coming of our stronger series. You'll probably see more of an acceleration in March and April, but the brand is strong and the content is strong.","Anthony J. DiClemente - Nomura Holdings, Inc.","Okay, great. And then just once again, quickly, David, on Comcast, Time Warner Cable. Is it the kind of thing where, if Comcast is at a modestly higher rate card per subscriber, perhaps because they have a little bit less scale as it is than Comcast, that if Comcast were to acquire Time Warner Cable, that the per-subscriber fee would modestly adjust downward to the Comcast rate card? Is that the way that we should be thinking about it in terms of your or content companies' affiliate fees post-closing?","David M. Zaslav","I can't speak to any specific agreements, but it really depends. It depends on what the contract says, and that's really all I can say.","Operator","The next question comes from Michael Nathanson, MoffettNathanson. [Operator Instructions]","David M. Zaslav","Next question, operator.","Operator","The next question comes from Alexia Quadrani, JPMorgan.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just a couple of questions. First, if you could give us a bit more color on the nature of your distribution agreements in general, not naming any specific names. But if I remember correctly, I think there's more of a steady increase over the life of the contract, not so much of a step-up initially. Is that the case? Is that what you're experiencing? And what's the average life of these contracts?","David M. Zaslav","Sure. The answer is yes, although we're open to -- when we look at the economics of a deal, we look at it over the full term, which tends to be somewhere between 4 and 6 years. Our deals come up about 20% a year, which we've talked about. This past year, we did very well. We were able to get significant increases. We were also able to get significant increases in distribution of some of our more strategic channels. So ID, for instance, which is now the #2 network in America for women in its all-day rating, is now in 85 million homes. And within the next 12 months, it will be in 90 million homes. And so that's a key strategic initiative for us. It gives us significant economic value, but it also gives us additional advertising value. So that's a channel that was in 50 million homes 4 years ago, will be in 90 million homes by the end of the year. And at least in January, USA Network was the only network that delivered more women for the month in -- so those are the kind of things that we look at. But we did focus primarily on getting meaningful increases in the sub fees. And then we look at some of the other things that are of strategic value. Outside the U.S., the deals tend to be shorter. Usually, about 3 years.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And just to follow up on your comments earlier about the SVOD, the licensing revenues. I think that you said the guidance does not any include any additional new deals. But we should still see some further licensing revenues, I believe, for the next couple of quarters, is that correct? And that would be in your guidance, from contracts already signed?","Andrew C. Warren","That's right, Alexia. What we've included in the guidance right now -- we haven't assumed any larger deals being done. There's a little bit of runoff for the current deals that would impact 2014, but it's a very small amount.","David M. Zaslav","And as we look at SVOD, we look at where we were when we did those deals, which was about 9% of viewership on cable. In January, we were over 12%. We have been focused on our content, both to make our channels better, but how do we create content that we could take effectively around the world and also are more valuable in all of these windows? So things like The Haves and the Have Nots, which is a scripted series, which is #1 for women on Tuesday nights on OWN, is an example of a product that's great on cable, repeats well but could be very attractive on SVOD. Klondike, as well. We found that the viewership was up 30% in C7. So we did very well on it, it was very strong for the brand, but those 6-hour scripted series are things that I think will help us with that window domestically and around the world. And so we haven't built that in, but we think that our 14 channels, the brands and the bulk of what we offer to players in that window, whether it be domestically or outside the U.S., are valuable. And so we'll be looking at that. We haven't been aggressive about participating in that window outside the U.S. because, in many of the markets, we've been more driven by pushing pay-TV. But as the markets mature, we have some good optionality there.","Operator","The next question is from Michael Nathanson, MoffettNathanson.","Michael Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC","Let me ask one for David and Andy, you guys, both together. You mentioned Klondike, and I think the series did really well for you. Is there a shift, you think, for Discovery to add more scripted content? And if so, how does that impact your programming cost assumptions in the next couple of years and operating margins domestically? So if you can just answer kind of maybe the need to change the programming mix for Discovery, and how does that impact margins and expense growth?","David M. Zaslav","Thanks, Michael. Klondike delivered over a 3 billion rating for us. It was very good for the brand, got a good response from advertisers. But that's not the core of what we do. The same way we do Planet Earth and we do Life as a big series, to talk about the strength of Discovery, it's reinforcing the fact that Discovery's the #1 most valuable -- most valued brand in the U.S. by cable operator studies and by viewer studies. And so as part of that, we need to do big natural history programming. And we think, every once in a while, we need to do something scripted that really reflects the DNA of what Discovery is. We think Klondike did that. We like the nonfiction business. We like the economics of the nonfiction business. We also like the way that content moves around the world and repeats. And so I think, from time to time, you'll see us playing in the scripted space, but you will not see us accelerate or lean into that.","Andrew C. Warren","And Michael, from a financial perspective, look, as David said, while these tent-pole events, whether it be scripted or live events, are important, it does not change our view that high single digits is the right kind of content growth profile that we're going to have going forward. So to me, it's more of a reallocation. And still, the importance of just singular tent-pole events is kind of what this is all about.","Michael Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC","Okay. We had assumed, I think, that there would be slower programming growth this year versus last year because last year, you did spend more. Is that still a right assumption, though, there's a deceleration domestically in the expense growth around cost of revenues?","Andrew C. Warren","Yes, so let's split it between cash and cost. On the cash side, as we said at the beginning of '13, we're going to be in the mid-single-digit growth on content spend, we did that. We think, on the cash side for '14, it will be kind of mid- to high single digit. On the expense side, while we had the bigger amort expense piece in '13, we definitely see that abating in '14. So very much in line of what we said before as far as mid-single-digit expense in cash content spend in '13 and lower expense in '14.","David M. Zaslav","Despite the mid-single-digit increase, we're becoming much more efficient in moving our content around the world. And with TLC distributed, we have ID now in over 150 countries. That will be in close to 200 countries over the next year, and the fact that we're much more effective at sharing our content around the world, we think we're getting a bigger bite at the apple. So as we see our market share growing over the last few years outside of the U.S. at 20-plus percent, we think we have a very good shot of maintaining that. And we're very strong coming up this year. So we are accelerating in terms of how we see investment in content to grow our market share. We just think we could do it much more efficiently than we have been because our brands are stronger, we have a lot more that's working but, more importantly, we're sharing content across Discovery, TLC, Animal Planet, Science more effectively.","Operator","The next question comes from Ben Swinburne, Morgan Stanley.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","David, you've been around this business for a very long time. I know you talked a little bit about how the Comcast-Time Warner Cable deal may or may not impact you. I'm just wondering if you think, over the longer term, this drives a greater consolidation on the media side. It sort of seems like, over the years, distribution consolidates, media then responds, or vice versa. So I'm just wondering if you think the argument around consolidation in content makes more sense now, particularly in the U.S. And then, on a separate topic, for Andy or Dave, when you look at your international affiliate revenue growth outlook, which I think was kind of mid-teens last year on an organic basis, we've got Europe getting better, maybe some of the EMs getting worse. Do you think that meaningfully changes in '14 and beyond? Do you expect that to accelerate or decelerate when you look at the international affiliate outlook?","David M. Zaslav","On the consolidation side, I'll leave that to the distributors, but it does -- we've seen some consolidation in Europe. I think our expectation, in terms of how we see the company, is that we've been in a race. One of the reasons why we've launched 7 new channels over the last 5 years while we've invested in content is both because of consolidation and because content is moving onto other platforms. If you have strong brands and great shows, we think that could be more growth and more opportunity. But if your content isn't strong enough, that consolidation in Europe, consolidation around the world could be a challenge. And so when we say we think this is the best time to be in the content business, that's based on the idea that we own all of our content, our brands are fresh and growing, and people are spending a lot of time with our shows. And so whether there's a lot more consolidation or a little bit, our expectation is that there'll be some. And the way that we'll be more effective in that environment is to have our content strong and to own it so that, as new windows open up, we have the ability to sell, as we have been across those windows.","Andrew C. Warren","And Ben, from a financial perspective, remember the consolidation of Discovery Japan skewed the 2013 numbers to be that mid-teen. It actually was high single digit, excluding Japan, and we expect that to continue in '14.","Operator","The next question comes from Jim Goss, Barrington Research.","James C. Goss - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division","A couple. The -- first, I wonder if you could comment on the pace of integration of SBS in terms of the margin potential you think it can eventually achieve, like will it match the rest of the international businesses and over what time period? And then, secondly, you talked about an average of something like 8 networks in many international markets under which you could sell ads. I know Discovery, Animal Planet, TLC and ID are ones you've highlighted. What are the other 4 that might typically comprise the channel lineup in your international markups -- markets?","David M. Zaslav","Let me take the second one, and then Andy will talk about the first. If you go to Latin America, we have a channel called Home & Health, which is one of the -- which is a top 5 network in Latin America for women. It's the equivalent of like a Home and Garden, but we got down there many years ago and have built that channel, which is quite strong for us as a female brand. We also have Discovery Kids in Latin America. In Brazil, Discovery Kids is actually the #1 network in Brazil. It's the equivalent of the USA Network of Brazil, there's a ton of co-viewing. And for 6-and-unders, we also beat all the other kids networks by a fair amount. We also have the Science channel. We've been -- as you said, we have ID, Animal Planet, Discovery. In a number of markets, we've launched channels called Turbo, which is similar to what we have with Velocity, which is a very efficient product for us. We take content like Wheeler Dealers, which is very big in Europe. We bring it over here, we put it on Velocity. And so that whole auto category, men, Turbo, is something that we're finding as a very efficient push to push around the world. And then, we have some broadcast networks, which, as we've talked about in the past, we really see as a hybrid. Even though we don't have sub fees on those, we launch those in markets with low pay-TV penetration. And those, we tend to take our 14 channels here in the U.S. and our average of 10 channels around the world, take that content and figure out a fun mix of male, female content at a very, very low cost to reach a bigger audience.","Andrew C. Warren","Jim, on the SBS side, clearly, the cost synergies are largely behind us and are definitely higher than our deal scenario and deal expectations, the cost synergies around facilities and people costs, et cetera. So that's actually pacing ahead of where we thought. The revenue synergies are still in process, and our view today relative to a year ago is those are also going to be higher. So net-net, SBS is performing better than our deal case, and the IRRs look stronger than we even thought going in. As far as all-in margins, while we're definitely going to grow the SBS margins, and we have already from where they were before, they won't get to where the total D&I is only because of the general entertainment nature of that business, and that's a different cost model. But to be clear, we're definitely growing the margin profile of SBS, and it is performing better than we had expected when we did the deal.","James C. Goss - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Actually, one more quick thing. Can you go the other way around, too, with Eurosport, bringing that into the U.S.A., given there might be some interest in -- given the melting pot nature of the country?","David M. Zaslav","Sure. Well, we have a significant platform advantage in -- throughout all of Europe. It's beachfront real estate. Having between 1 and 4 channels that are -- where we can do sports gives leagues the choice of either going country-by-country or doing a broad deal with us. It also -- in a competitive environment where you have 1 or 2 players competing -- or 3 players competing for sports rights, the ability for us to come and co-bid with a big broadcast player, where they pay a significant amount of the freight and we pay a little bit and together, we have a compelling offer, is attractive. We don't have that platform advantage here in the U.S. And in fact, it's pretty late to the party. ESPN does a great job. Fox is doing a great job. Brian and Steve are doing a very good job with NBC Universal, and Time Warner is in the game. And so we have a very good channel in Velocity that we like very much. It's very profitable for us, the cost of content is very low. And the way that we'll use sports is that we'll take some content from Eurosport that we have the rights to -- we've taken some of the race content that Eurosport has rights to, and we put it on, on weekend mornings on Velocity for very low cost as an experiment with Eurosport. But we see -- outside the U.S., Eastern Europe, Western Europe, we've launched Eurosport in Asia and in Australia as being markets where it's not very competitive, we have scalability in terms of our access to content, and in many cases, we have rights. The other thing that Eurosport has, which has some accessibility, is we have online rights to all the sports that we have. And they have a very nice business related to that, but there's some nice optionality. If you look at what David Stern has done with the NBA by going direct-to-consumer, there's some very nice optionality on all the sports rights that Eurosport has that we could look at. But the U.S. market is pretty flooded, pretty aggressive and very expensive. And so I think we'll bow out of that for now.","Operator","The last question comes from Barton Crockett, FBR.","Barton E. Crockett - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","I wanted to ask a little bit more about the international outlook. I noticed you had the great growth in 2013, but a lot of that was kind of audience growth and some of that tied from new initiatives like your free-to-air launches. How do you see -- how sustainable do you see the audience trajectory into 2014, and how does that factor into your guidance? And then, kind of on a similar topic, Viacom, coming out of their earnings call for the December quarter, was saying that they saw green shoots in the TV ad market in Europe. And I think last quarter, you guys were feeling pretty good about the possibility of the macro feeling better there. Could you update us on your current feeling about the TV ad environment in Europe?","David M. Zaslav","We see it, really, as stable. There are markets, like Spain, that are getting a little better. Maybe the U.K., a little bit better. France and Italy, maybe flat to worse. So I would say, in the aggregate, we're seeing the market pretty stable from where it's been over the last 2 years. Again, if the market does pick up, and I hope that Philippe is correct that it starts to blossom, if it does, with the market share gains that we're seeing, with the local teams we have on the ground and the brand strength, we'll be able to take advantage of that. And that's part of our strategy. We've seen Western Europe as the new emerging market. We picked up assets. We've been very disciplined about growing share, about building our brands and about investing, and we've gotten some good return. Our assumption is it's going to stay like this for the next 2 to 3 years. If it gets better, then it will be reflected in a better performance. Andy?","Andrew C. Warren","Our base assumption for International is still double-digit revenue and OIBDA growth in 2014. So we still see a sustained, solid double-digit performance out of the base business internationally.","Craig Felenstein","Thanks for your time this morning, everybody, and please give us a call with any follow-up questions you may have.","Operator","Thank you for joining in today's conference.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, the call is being recorded for replay purposes.","I'd like to turn the call over to Craig Felenstein who's the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Craig Felenstein","Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for Discovery Communications' Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Call. Hopefully the timing of our release did not interfere too much with your election day plans.","Joining me today is David Zaslav, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Andy Warren, our Chief Financial Officer.","You should have received our earnings release. But if not, feel free to access it on our website at www.discoverycommunications.com.","On today's call, we will begin with some opening comments from David and Andy. After which, we will open the call up to your questions. [Operator Instructions]","Before we start, I would like to remind you that comments today regarding the company's future business plans, prospects and financial performance are forward-looking statements that we make pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are made based on management's current knowledge and assumptions about future events, and they involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations.","In providing projections and other forward-looking statements, the company disclaims any intent or obligation to update them.

Zaslav","Thanks, Craig. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us. And before we begin the call, on behalf of myself and the entire team at Discovery, I wanted to extend our thoughts and best wishes to everyone who has been impacted by Hurricane Sandy. It's been quite a week.","Discovery's financial momentum continued during the third quarter as our sustained investment in developing high-quality content and building bigger brands of global appeal allowed us to capitalize on the relatively healthy worldwide ad environment and the further penetration of pay-television around the world. Investing in great series and specials in those geographic areas that provide the greatest advertising and affiliate opportunities has been a consistent strategic priority for Discovery and a key factor in our strong and dependable growth over the last few years.","Our third quarter results were skewed by several one-off items, which Andy will discuss when he covers our financial performance, but the sustainable organic growth story remains robust.","International expansion continues at a rapid pace as we broaden our global content offerings and capitalize on our unparalleled distribution platform, while domestically, targeted programming initiatives are delivering audience growth at several of our emerging networks and we continue to see market share gains across the portfolio. Though investing in bigger, stronger brands remains paramount, we remain committed to our success-based investment style. We do not just throw dollars against the wall and see what sticks. But rather, by incrementally spending on those brands that have demonstrated meaningful upside, we can maximize the best possible return on our programming dollars.","There's no better example of this than Investigation Discovery. ID was launched back in January 2008 with the view that mystery and forensic content was compelling enough and had a sufficient audience base to be the linchpin for an entire network. But before investing significantly in the concept, we wanted to test whether this type of programming would resonate with viewers, so we seeded it with a little bit of money and launched ID off the distribution of Discovery Times.","In the first year, our cash spend only increased marginally, but the reception from viewers was immediate. We then went out and hired cable veteran Henry Schleiff, spent a little bit on marketing, attracted top storytellers to the genre and continued to incrementally invest in content. Since 2008, we have more than doubled the number of original hours on ID and the return has been significant.","ID's audience has more than tripled during that period, and critically, we have been able to monetize that audience, with advertising up more than 6-fold over the same time period. Our investment continues to pay off, with viewership on ID up nearly 30% this past quarter in Total Day among its key women 25 to 54 demo. It is now a top 6 network in America during the day for women. And thus far in 2012, it is one of our largest drivers of advertising growth domestically. We still have significant room to grow before we achieve pricing and volume parity with the ratings ID is delivering. However, ID has clearly become one of Discovery's flagships, and we will continue to incrementally invest in the brand both in the U.S., as well as around the world. In just the last year, we have taken ID into over 130 countries.","Animal Planet is another network that has really broken out. Since 2008, we have increased its original content by nearly 30%, and the audience is up a healthy 46%. When the growth took a breather in 2011, we deliberately held back on further increasing its content budget to see if the Animal Planet brand would regain its momentum and continue to grow. The answer was a resounding yes, with viewership up nearly 20% year-to-date, including its best-ever third quarter led by returning favorites Call of the Wildman, Tanked and My Cat from Hell. Given their momentum, we will continue investing additional programming dollars in Animal Planet as the audience growth is translating into significant advertising revenue gains.","In addition to Animal Planet and ID, we are also seeing growth in several other emerging networks that we're investing incrementally in during 2012, including viewership gains this past quarter of over 20% at the recently re-branded Destination America, 55% viewership gains at Velocity and over 15% gains at the Science Channel.","There's been lots of talk about cable channel ratings declines, but when you look at the success across our younger networks, it is clear that our strategy is working. By investing wisely and delivering high-quality content that is unique and engaging, we can grow audience, increase market share and deliver additional value to advertising and affiliate partners.","Similarly, as we invest in our emerging networks, we continue to support our 2 established flagship brands, Discovery and TLC. We mentioned on our last call that the third quarter presented some hurdles, with the Olympics and soft ratings early in the quarter. But we captured some real momentum with the most successful Shark Week ever, starting in mid-August on Discovery, and followed that up with the successful return of Sons of Guns and new hits Bering Sea Gold: Under the Ice and Yukon Men, which helped Discovery deliver viewership gains of 8% post Olympics.","The fourth quarter is also off to a great start, with October viewership up 13% in primetime, led by the premiere of Gold Rush, which was the #1 show in all of television among adults 25 to 54, beating all the cable and broadcast networks on Friday night.","TLC also captured some significant ratings momentum after the Olympics led by the breakout phenomenon, Here Comes Honey Boo Boo, which tapped into cultural zeitgeist and averaged nearly 2.5 million viewers across its season.","Honey Boo Boo was not the only success on TLC during the quarter. Long Island Medium returned as the #1 ranked program in its time slot, with viewership more than doubling its first season. Equally as important, we were able to use that success to launch Breaking Amish, which averaged over 3 million viewers and was TLC's highest rated new series in nearly a decade.","TLC was up 17% in primetime during September, and that momentum continued into the fourth quarter, with October also delivering 17% growth year-on-year.","With Discovery and TLC gaining real programming strength from great original content and with the emerging nets growing their audiences nearly across the board, we were able to deliver our best October ever. Viewership for the overall portfolio was up 17% in primetime, and this increased market share, along with a strong upfront and a scatter market that looks to be relatively healthy, gives us confidence that we can deliver sustained advertising gains moving forward.","We're also seeing some impressive growth at our joint ventures. The Hub delivered 62% viewership growth this past quarter in Total Day among kids 2 to 11, its best quarter ever. Lastly, we continue to see big ratings momentum at OWN. Building upon the 18% increase it delivered in the first half the year, OWN grew nearly 60% in the third quarter among women 25 to 54, led by record ratings for its flagship series Oprah's Next Chapter, as well as strong premieres from Iyanla: Fix My Life and Welcome to Sweetie Pie's.","In addition, last month, OWN announced a partnership with Tyler Perry, award-winning actor, director, screenwriter, playwright and producer, to become Tyler's exclusive home for all-new television series and projects, demonstrating the power of the Oprah brand to attract some of the biggest names in entertainment. Two of Tyler's series will debut next year and will give the network another strong night to build audience share and launch new franchises.","Executing on our investment strategy domestically has allowed us to deliver sustained growth over the last several years in what is obviously a more mature and competitive U.S. market. The more robust opportunity continues to be International, where we are launching new channels, growing audiences and building stronger brands globally as we exploit our unparalleled market position in over 200 countries.","Similar to the U.S., we are focusing our investments in areas that represent the biggest opportunities from an audience, advertising and affiliate perspective. A good example over the last few years has been our emphasis on broadening the female demographics across our International platform. The first step was establishing a female flagship brand across the globe, much like we have here in the U.S. Given the vast distribution network already in place, we were confident we could take predominantly existing shelf space, utilize a fair amount of library content and strategically increase our programming commitment to create the #1 most distributed female brand in the world. And we've done just that. Over the last 2 years, our female flagship has been rolled out to over 150 countries, now reaches nearly 300 million subscribers and is delivering real viewership growth, with audience up 51% versus a year ago.","As we mentioned on the last call, our most recent initiative, given the success of crime and investigation genre across our existing platforms, is driving the ID brand in markets where we think it will have broad appeal. Last quarter, we launched ID in 38 countries throughout Latin America, and ID is now in over 130 countries globally, reaching more than 60 million subscribers. And we think our investment in this genre will be another growth driver for our International business over the next several years.","The investments in TLC and ID, along with further investment in Discovery Kids and targeted local content, has dramatically increased female viewership and, in turn, has enabled us to significantly grow Discovery's share of female-targeted advertising dollars.","Another driver of ad growth for us continues to be our targeted investments across Western Europe. While the market is certainly slowing in some of these countries, we continue to deliver double-digit ad growth across Western Europe, led by Real Time and DMAX in Italy, Quest in the U.K. and Discovery MAX in Spain.","Our primary investment focus remains strengthening the pay-tv channels across our International footprint, but the free-to-air networks we have launched are an excellent example of our ability to identify market opportunities and exploit them with our globally relevant content. As we look for ways to take additional viewership and advertising share around the world, we continue to exploit the further penetration of pay-tv worldwide.","The subscriber base across our International business expanded over 17% versus a year ago led by Brazil and Mexico and Latin America and Russia and Poland in Central and Eastern Europe. With subscribers growing across the globe, we are delivering broad-based affiliate revenue growth with every region this quarter, delivering double-digit gains versus a year ago.","Given the relatively low penetration levels worldwide, we fully expect continued pay-tv growth moving forward. But with boots on the ground across the globe as these platforms further proliferate, we are ideally situated to maximize the opportunity they provide. Building new brands and strengthening our global content pipeline to capitalize on our core growth opportunities is still our first strategic priority.","However, given the sustained financial momentum, the free cash flow we are generating, the strength of our balance sheet and the growth profile of our company as we invest in our underlying assets, we have also been buying back shares aggressively. Returning capital to shareholders remains a focus, and we will continue to do so if it is the best use of our balance sheet and we will further build shareholder value.","Discovery has delivered sustained financial momentum throughout the first 3 quarters of 2012, further demonstrating our ability to capitalize on the opportunities across our global distribution platform and the strength of our current operating environment. At the same time, we are investing further in building out our diverse set of brands and platforms around the world in order to expand our market share and deliver additional value to our shareholders over the long term.","And now let me turn the call over to Andy.","Craig Felenstein","Thanks, David. As David touched upon his comments, Discovery's underlying financial momentum continued during the third quarter as we further executed upon our strategic initiatives in a relatively favorable operating environment. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, Discovery delivered another quarter of revenue and OIBDA growth, despite the upside a year ago from the Netflix licensing agreement.","On a reported basis, total company revenue was slightly below prior year, but organic revenue growth, which excludes the impact of licensing agreements and currency movements, was up over 8%, led by 15% international growth and complemented by 5% higher domestic revenues.","Total operating expenses in the quarter were down 5% compared to the prior year as increased personnel costs were more than offset by our lower impairment charges, the impact of currency and the absence of expenses related to the Netflix agreement a year ago. Excluding the impairment charges, expenses associated with the licensing agreement and the impact of foreign exchange, total company operating expenses increased 3% versus third quarter a year ago.","Discovery's continued ability to generate revenue growth in excess of expenses translated into a 4% increase in adjusted OIBDA during the third quarter on a reported basis as margins expanded by almost 200 basis points. Excluding the impact of licensing agreements, impairment charges and foreign currency, adjusted OIBDA grew 14%.","Net income from continuing operations decreased to $214  million as the strong operating performance in the current year was more than offset by the net impact of prior year one-time items. Additionally, the current quarter included increased losses at our equity investments, higher mark-to-market share-based compensation, expense due to the appreciation in our share price and increased interest and tax expense.","The higher-than-normal tax rate in the quarter was primarily due to a restructuring at our international operations, which will ultimately lower our effective tax rate but which will also marginally raise our tax rate for the next several quarters. Please note that total net income in the current quarter also included a $9 million net of tax loss from discontinued operations through the sale of our Creative Sound Services business.","Free cash flow increased 12% to $353 million in the third quarter as the improved operating performance was partially offset by higher content investment and increased cash taxes. As David mentioned, the increased programming spend in the current quarter is certainly paying off in terms of ratings momentum and higher advertising revenue.","Important to note, there will be a $50 million to $60 million increase in content expense next year as content amortization catches up with the cash spend in 2012. But we do anticipate programming spending growth will slow considerably in 2013.","Now turning to the operating units. The U.S. networks continued to perform well during the third quarter. On a reported basis, total domestic revenues decreased 4% as advertising growth of 7% was more than offset by a decline in distribution revenue due to the execution of the Netflix agreement a year ago.","Excluding licensing agreements, total domestic revenue growth and distribution revenue growth were both 5%.","As we mentioned on our last earnings call, advertising this quarter was negatively impacted by the Olympics as well as our soft July ratings, but reported ad revenue growth slightly exceeded our mid-single-digit growth guidance primarily due to sustained pricing strength and viewership gains across our portfolio after the Olympics.","Current ad market trends continue to be encouraging, with sustained double-digit scatter pricing on top of the gains we garnered during this year's upfront negotiations. We have seen some pockets of softness with regard to volume, but the overall environment remains relatively healthy via some nice rate ratings momentum across many of our networks. As such, excluding a one-time revenue item we recognized in the fourth quarter a year ago, we anticipate ad sales growth in the high single digits this fourth quarter, building upon the impressive 17% organic growth we delivered a year ago.","Domestic operating expenses were down 13% from the third quarter of 2011, which included $22 million in higher content impairment charges and $11 million in costs associated with extending and expanding digital licensing agreements.","Excluding content impairment charges and costs associated with the digital licensing agreements, operating expenses actually declined 4% compared to a year ago due to lower content amortization and a decrease in marketing spend.","On a reported basis, domestic adjusted OIBDA increased 2%. Excluding the impact of licensing agreements and content impairment charges, domestic adjusted OIBDA increased 12% over the prior year.","Turning to our international operations. We continue to deliver strong results across our global operations, with reported revenue expanding 7%, led by 8% affiliate and 3% ad growth. Excluding the impact of exchange rates, total revenue growth was 15%, with distribution revenue increasing 16% and advertising revenue up 10%.","The affiliate revenue growth, which included 5 percentage points, had benefited from lower launch support amortization, was driven further strong subscriber additions worldwide led by Latin America, with sustained progress in Brazil and Mexico, and by Central and Eastern Europe, with further development in areas such as Russia and Poland.","Overall, the Discovery Channel, our most widely distributed network, expanded its subscribers 8% internationally versus a year ago.","On the advertising front, despite some meaningful slowdown during the Olympics, Discovery delivered growth across nearly all regions, led by double-digit gains in Western Europe, mainly from their free-to-air initiatives David mentioned. We also saw a nice growth in the quarter in Latin America. It is expected that advertising growth will accelerate into the mid-teens in Q4 as these one-time items abate.","Operating costs at national were up 1% on a reported basis and 9% excluding the impact of foreign currency, primarily driven by higher content amortization, as well as increased personnel and infrastructure costs due to additional investment in growth initiatives and the build-out of our global platform to support our long-term growth expectations.","Our International segment delivered 16% adjusted OIBDA growth, excluding the currency impact as our International team continued to generate strong revenue increases by thoughtfully investing in key growth initiatives.","Turning to our full year forecast. We are adjusting our revenue expectations to reflect the disposal of the Creative Sound Services business as we now expect full year revenues to be between $4.475 billion and $4.525 billion. As we mentioned on our last call, we anticipated adjusted OIBDA growth to return to double digits in the fourth quarter, with full year guidance between $2.125 billion and $2.15 billion. While we are leaving the bottom end of the OIBDA range unchanged, as always, our overall OIBDA guidance is subject to meaningful changes in foreign exchange rates, ratings delivery and the advertising environment.","In addition to revenue, we are also adjusting net income expectations to reflect the higher stock compensation expense as a result of the increased stock price as well as the higher tax rate I mentioned earlier. Net income from continuing operations is now expected to be between $975 million and $1.025 billion.","With a strong balance sheet that includes almost $1.6 billion in cash and with our sustained positive financial and operating performance, we continue to return capital to shareholders through execution of our share repurchase program. Our first priority remains investing in our core business to drive sustained long-term growth, be it through investment in existing networks and platforms or through exploring external initiatives.","Given that we have not yet found sufficient opportunities with attractive financial returns, we accelerated utilizing the cash from the balance sheet, as well as cash generated from operations, to repurchase shares in the quarter.","Discovery repurchased over $450 million of stock during the third quarter, including $383 million of Class C shares and $71 million of Class A shares. We still prefer buying them for economical security but given SEC volume limitations and the attractiveness in our securities, we will continue to repurchase both classes of stock as need be.","We have bought back over $1.1 billion under our share repurchase program through the end of the third quarter 2012. And since November of 2010, we have repurchased almost 70 million shares in total, reducing the outstanding share count by over 16%.","That's it. Thanks again for your time this morning. And now David and I will be happy to answer any questions you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Please stand by for your first question, which comes from the line of John Janedis from UBS.","John Janedis - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","It's John Janedis. David, the free-to-air networks have been a great driver in Europe. Is there any way you can help us size the growth for you versus maybe the growth in the markets where you operate them? And in what inning do you think we're in on the growth curve there?","David M. Zaslav","The free-to-air has really helped us in a slow market in Western Europe, no doubt. And it's because our model is quite good. We own all the content in those markets. And in particular, those markets have small pay-tv. So we're able to take content that only a small amount of the population has seen. And we'll pick up a stick or a broadcast network at a very low price, and then we could put content that cost us very little. For instance in Spain, we have very little original content; it's almost all library. And we've seen a lot of growth with Discovery MAX in Spain, and it's continuing to accelerate. Real Time in Italy is continuing to grow. It's now the #7 network in all of Italy. We also launched a men's network in Italy and our German free-to-air. It's a small piece of our overall strategy, but it's been very healthy for us because our costs are very low. And we have teams on the ground. They're already setting across multiple channels. And so it's given us a more heft and it's given us a more scale in those markets. It's not -- it really only works in markets were that pay-tv market is quite small. But we're starting to -- we are continuing to see growth, and I think that will help us over the next year or 2 in Western Europe. And when the market actually starts to pick up, you'll see an acceleration because of the number of channels that we have in that market.","John Janedis - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And maybe a separate question. You talked about increasing the number of hours in some of the emerging nets. Are we at a point now where there's more room to ad hours there? And has there been maybe much of a change in your cost per hour given the success of the programming?","David M. Zaslav","One of the things that we do is, first, we have a different strategy than a number of other media companies. We're real believers that you could still build channels, and with good stories and good creative people and great characters, you can attract real audiences to these new channels. We've had real success by investing in Animal Planet, in Science, ID, which is now the #6 network in America for women. And so we have been investing in about 7 channels, but we have 13. And so what we're trying to do is in the channels that we haven't figured out yet exactly how to grow, we're reducing our spend. And on the channels that we think we have the right recipe, we're increasing it. One of the advantages we have with the channels that we've been leaning into, which is ID and Animal Planet and Science, is that all 3 of them play very well around the world. We have Science now in over 150 countries. We've launched ID in the last year to over 130 countries. And we have Animal Planet in almost 200. And so when we invest, we view it as a worldwide investment because we could take it all over the world. But we are very careful, and in some of the channels that aren't generating significant value, where we don't feel like we have the right brand or the right recipe, we're holding back.","Operator","The next question we have comes from the line of David Bank from RBC Capital Markets.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","The first question is on your guidance or your discussion of ad trends in the fourth quarter, you've kind of called out mid-single digits x a one-timer -- or I think high single digits x a one-timer in the fourth quarter. Could you just remind us of what that -- order of magnitude and what it was? The second question is, it's tough to get specific about one network, but I'm going to try and take another pass at it. Can you give us a sense of what percent of the growth of the overall business over the last couple of years that ID has driven and what is the likelihood that once that starts to kind of slow down, you see Destination America and you see Velocity, basically that you see catching lightning in a bottle and not worrying about anniversary-ing the lightning in a bottle of ID?","David M. Zaslav","I'll take the second question. And then, Andy, you.","Andrew C. Warren","Sure.","David M. Zaslav","On ID, I think we really have a very strong horse here that's going to deliver sustainable growth for a long period of time even if the ratings don't grow and they grew 30% in the last quarter, and we expect they will grow aggressively because we have a strong niche and we've seen growth every week and every month for the past 4 years. But the reason is that the CPM that we're able to get for that, for ID, is still quite low. And because of the way that the marketplace works domestically and internationally, it takes a few years before you can earn up the full value of your CPM. And so we started ID, when we flipped it from Discovery Times, it was probably getting 1\/3 of the CPM that a successful cable network gets. And so little by little, we've been pushing it. And we've had some success, but a lot of the upside over the next 2 to 3 years -- I mean, right now the kind of ratings that we're delivering in daytime in women is just very valuable and the spread between what other cable networks are getting and what we're getting is really very, very significant. And so that'll take a couple of years. We also think we'll get the growth of that. And in terms of the amount of growth that it's provided for us in the last few years, it's small. In fact, there's been margin compression over the last few years because we've been investing in ID. And so the next 2, 3 and 4 years is when you're going to see the big benefit of that because we have successful series that are returning, but more importantly, the CPM is growing and it continues to grow every month and we're going to be patient with it. But that's going to be a sustainable grower for us. But behind that, we do have a number of networks that are continuing to grow. We have Science Channel that's growing very effectively for us. Animal Planet was the #30 or 32 network in America for men. It's broken now; it's now the #18 network for men in September. And so we're seeing a lot of growth because we're believers in investing in our content and the creative teams that we have here at the company. And if you take a look at where we are, we've said that we're trying -- over the last several years we're going to drive Discovery. We felt we were the best platform media company in the world, but what we really needed to do is build the right creative culture. And we think we're well on our way to doing that. And our strategy was to lay low in the Olympics and then come out strong with our creative content and build from there. We were strong out of the Olympics. We had a great September. And October was the best October Discovery has ever had. We were up 17% across the board in an industry, a cable industry, that was down a few percentage points and broadcast down. And so I think we're going to continue to push on that. But if we can continue to grow our market share like that over the next several months, in 1 year or 2 ahead, you're going to see very big sustainable growth, particularly as we take a lot of that content around the world. So Andy, on the...","Andrew C. Warren","Yes, David, regarding your question of the one-time item a year ago, in the fourth quarter we announced or disclosed that we had about $5 million one-time pickup from ADU [ph] recognition kind of in the fourth quarter. That's non-recurring on the fourth quarter this year.","Operator","Your next question we have comes from the line of Jessica Reif Cohen from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jessica Reif Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I have one for each of you. David, could you just give us your thought process on M&A in general? And along the lines of what you've discussed on this call, on the free-to-air, how do you think about the free-to-air acquisitions versus pay-tv when you think about stuff outside the U.S.?","David M. Zaslav","Okay. Well, we've been very careful because we're looking -- we only want to buy assets if we think they can help us grow faster because we have so much sustainable growth we think in the 13 channels we have here in the U.S. and maybe more importantly, in terms of our strategy, our international advantage. But the key to our company is dual revenue stream. That's the key to our domestic and international business. The reason why we're so profitable with free-to-air is because we have 8, 10, 11 dual revenue stream channels in a lot of these markets that we've been in for 5 or 10 years and we have a ton of content that's all paid for in those markets. And so free-to-air is really a very different model than when you think about free-to-air. We're not buying a free-to-air channel and then creating original content and buying content. So for us, free-to-air there is sort of an accessory, and I think long term it will stay that way. And free-to-air is not the core of how we see ourselves as a company. So -- and as we look at M&A, I would say -- as I've said over the last few years, our #1 target is international. We've grown our International business from 2007, we were making $250 million. This year, we'll make significantly more than $700 million. Our margins are expanding. The subscribers are growing. We're well positioned. But most importantly, we've got great teams on the ground in most markets now selling for us, and I'm spending over 40% of my time outside the U.S. because I think that's a lot of where the future and the differentiator of our company is. So to the extent that we could find assets outside the U.S. that'll help us grow faster, that we can evaluate quickly, that we have real synergy with, that would be our first priority. Having said that, we haven't been -- we don't want to overpay and we haven't been able to find those assets yet, but we're hopeful.","Jessica Reif Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And then the second question is, actually I just want to follow up on a comment that Andy made earlier about advertising. You said something about volume being softer. On the other hand, it sounds like given your ratings, your upfront performance, you guys are doing okay. I just wanted you to clarify what you meant by that.","Andrew C. Warren","Yes, Jessica, we've had a few weeks of softness in early October. It's stronger now and the volume has picked up. But there were a couple of weeks in the early parts of October that were a little soft.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Doug Mitchelson from Deutsche Bank.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","A couple of questions. One for David or one topic for David. I think you're probably starting to get deeper in the negotiations with distributors on renewals. I think you've noted about 20% distribution up at year-end 2012. So I'd be interested in any characterization you would share of how those negotiations -- discussions are going. I mean, do they understand the value that Discovery has created since the renewals? Are they looking at value the same way you're looking at value? Anything you could share would be helpful.","David M. Zaslav","Okay, great. We have a little bit less than 20% of our deals coming up and they come up over the next 5 years. But we feel very good about where we are. Our ratings across the board on our channels have never been this strong. Discovery is very solid. TLC has broken out. We have Animal Planet, strong. Maybe more importantly, as you look at all the additional channels we have, we have Discovery Espa\u00f1ol, the #1 channel to the Hispanic audience for men. We have Science with a great affinity audience. We have Velocity with an affinity male audience, so we have ID with middle-aged and older women. So we have a great diversity. We have great affinity groups. But more importantly, it's a far cry from where we were when we did our deals, where we had a strong Discovery, when TLC was the #20 or 25 network in America and then we had 11 more channels. And so all of our channels come up at once. Our market share was about 4%. Now it's over 9% and growing. And we have a great equitable argument, where we have reduced the overall cost of how we spend our money everywhere but content and brand. And we're spending a lot more money on our channels. And it's delivering for the operators. And so we feel that this is a good moment for us. It's been our strategy to make our channel stronger than grow our market share. And I think it's happening at a very good time. And we expect that it will be recognized with meaningful value from the distributors because they're meaningful value from us.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And I know I'm sort of chasing the question that you're not in a position that you necessarily want to answer for investors at this point in time. But I mean, can you point us to the right direction as to how we should think about value? If we use your ratings, as you said, your market share has more than doubled, but I imagine the expectation isn't that you're going to double your rates. I mean, is there I think you can point us to that we can use for the math behind what we should think the rate increases would be?","David M. Zaslav","We don't like to talk about negotiations. What I would say is that we think that we should be getting significantly more value from the operators for our channels. That value will come primarily in terms of increased sub fees. But there are other ways that the distributors can give us value, either with -- for instance ID was in 48 million homes 4 years ago; today it's in 80 million homes, Science was in 45 million homes; today it's in 72 million homes. So more carriage for our channels as well. But we're in some of those negotiations. We're looking forward to them. In addition, there are a number of operators that are interested in TV Everywhere. We haven't done TV Everywhere deals with anybody. The good news for us is we own all of our content. We created a new window for Netflix, which is working quite well for us, primarily 1.5 years to 2 years and older. The TV Everywhere window is tighter than that. And that, if we do reach deals, that will provide additional value and that could potentially accelerate when we do our deals. And one of the things that you see in the performance of the company is a little lumpiness in the way that the Netflix deal comes through. It's a very favorable deal for us. That deal -- we haven't seen any degradation in audience. In fact, for some of the series that we've provided that are much older, we're seeing some lift. And as you know, we have a right next year in the beginning of the year to opt in to another year of the Netflix deal on very attractive terms, which if we elect would then be again lumpy with a very big lump next year for that additional year that we opt in to.","Andrew C. Warren","Just to add one comment to David's notion on Netflix. While that not only gives us great opportunity to monetize some of our library, it is very lumpy from a P&L perspective. But from a cash flow perspective, it's extraordinary. And those cash flows are more steady throughout the period of time. So it allows us to really maximize the value of our cash flow. And if you look at the third quarter, our free cash flow was up 12%. That's very much driven by that. And so the cash flows of Netflix really is -- and Amazon, both really have a great cash profile.","Operator","The next question we have comes from the line of Benjamin Swinburne from Morgan Stanley.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I just had a clarification question for Andy and then a bigger picture one for David. Andy, just on the programming cost for next year, can you just repeat what you said? I just -- I think I missed it. I know you said it was up 15% next year?","Andrew C. Warren","No, Ben, what we said was programming expense to be up $50 million to $60 million next year as we amortize the increased investment we made this year. So as I've said, I think on this call and prior calls, we have invested in content this year, obviously getting a great payback on that, given our international growth and given the ratings we're seeing across our platforms. But we will have an amort pickup next year as we expense the cash we spent this year. But very importantly, we expect next year's cash spend to be reduced significantly from this year. A lot of that is driven by the fact we've increased the number of original hours on our core programs, so therefore, we don't have as much of that next year year-over-year, so we should have a much more levelized [ph] low level of cash increase on CapEx.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And I don't know if you have it in front of you, but do you have what the content expense and cash growth will be in '12, so we have the base?","Andrew C. Warren","Well, it's double digit on both. And so the expectation is double-digit increase on amort next year, but low-single digit on cash next year.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Got it. Okay. And then, David, one of the things that everyone's focused on beyond the macro is just what's happening with ratings trend. And I was wondering if you could chime in on that. It's obviously focused on the broadcasters. But is it something that you think is benefiting your business currently in the fourth quarter? And do you see the ratings erosion as a sign of a measurement issue or maybe something larger that is impacting the business? We'd love to get your thoughts.","David M. Zaslav","It's hard to tell. I think that our strategy clearly is different. We have invested significantly in about 7 channels. Primarily 6.5 years ago, when I got here, this company was primarily Discovery. And so we've invested in TLC, which is now a top 5 network for women. We've invested in Animal Planet. We've invested in ID, a top 10 network in America. We've invested in Velocity, Destination America, OWN. So we're believers. We believe that viewers are not -- that if our strategy was just to make sure that we held or would grow 1 network or 2 networks, that, that -- that a better bet is to try and grow those 2 networks, but also invest in a number of other brands that people get comfortable with and spend time with. And it's been working for us domestically and internationally. I think it helps that as you look at the way people watch television, on Friday night, we're the #1 network for women on TLC, we're the #1 network for women on Sunday nights, that often when you ask women what shows they watch, they can name one show. But they know that TLC gets them and that's the place to go. The same thing for Discovery on several nights. People love ID and they can't name the shows, but they just want to hang out there. And so I think that the fact that people are spending more time with brands on television, and as you see broadcast coming down, we're seeing real growth. And so we believe that, that's probably going to continue. I can't speak to what's going to happen to broadcast, but we certainly see a trend that our brands are growing. And a better job we do with the characters and the stories and understanding who our audience is on each of these channels, we're able to grow. I mean, 17% growth in October is really significant, but if you look at the last 3 years, our market share has grown virtually -- has grown literally every quarter over the last 3 years, and we're starting to accelerate now. We did have a soft patch, which we talked about, at Discovery and TLC, which it showed itself in this quarter. In July, TLC and Discovery were soft, and we made a very determined strategy that we were not going to use our best content during the Olympics, particularly after the first day or 2 where the Olympics came out strong. So we -- domestically and internationally, we said we would stand down. But our strategy was as soon as the Olympics ended, we were going to come back strong and we believed because the audience was disenfranchised in terms of what they watch and how they watch it for 3 weeks, because everyone was watching the Olympics, that we would be able to pick up market share. And it has really worked for us and it's accelerating. And so we're going to continue with that strategy because I think that's how we're going to grow domestically and around the world.","Operator","The next question we have comes from the line of Todd Juenger from Sanford Bernstein.","Todd Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","One quick one on OWN again. I just wondered if you could maybe reconcile for us or help us understand. The ratings are just so high. I guess I'm somewhat surprised to see the increase in the loss line of the Other. I don't know if there's other stuff in there or something about the timing. But just given how strong the ratings are, that big sequential increase in the loss, anything you could help us with what's going on there would be number one. And then second, just a quick one. On the tax stuff, Andy, we knew you're working on that. I guess some of us forgot that sometimes to make progress you've got to take a step backwards. Do you have an idea, just -- I'm not asking for a long term forecast, but just how big if you could bound sort of the magnitude of where you think the tax rate could come down to you over the long term, just some indication of how the size of an opportunity you think that is?","Andrew C. Warren","Sure. Todd, on the first question regarding OWN, the losses were higher but they were noncash losses. The first part of the loss we knew about. We talked it in the last call about higher marketing and we're getting a payback, now if you look at the 60% increase in ratings. The second part there, the losses that flowed through Other income line, were content write-offs at OWN. As the new content is performing so well, we're just writing off some old library products. And so that's flowing through that. But again it's important to note that's noncash. The real key emphasis on OWN right now is the progress we're making on the funding piece. In the first half of OWN, we funded $84 million; in the third quarter, only $29 million; and in the fourth quarter we look for less than that. So we're clearly in line with our 2012 funding being less than '11. And so the progress we're making there both from an operating and ratings perspective is tremendous. But really from a cash flow perspective we're really right on, if not better than, what we highlighted 6 months ago.","David M. Zaslav","And when you think about OWN, not only is the overall performance, economic performance, stronger, but the ratings are stronger and there is this moment where you're fighting to get people -- people only watch 6 or 8 channels, you're fighting to get people to spend time with your channel. And OWN has begun to really find a rhythm. The length of view is the second highest in our portfolio, so when people find it, they hang with it and they like it. Oprah has been very -- working very hard. She's on the air much more often. But more importantly, we're getting a lot of our rating points right now from Ilanya and from Sweetie Pie's and from a lot of the other original hours that we have on OWN. And we're -- our hit rate is dramatically higher. We were trying to figure out what OWN is and with a lot of time by the leadership there, Sheri Salata and Erik Logan and Oprah herself, and talking to the audience through oprah.com. We have a good sense of what they want. Now we're giving it to them. And so let's get the stuff out that's wrong. Let's do more of what's right. And then when you add to that, as a topping, Tyler Perry, maybe one of the great talents in Hollywood because he writes, he produces, he stars in. We went down to visit his facility in Atlanta. He does it all himself. We writes it all himself and he has a great relationship with Oprah. This is something that Oprah really wanted. We really wanted it. Tyler wanted it. I think it's going to create more balance, more humor, more diversity on the network. And if you think about it, Tyler Perry and Oprah Winfrey together on OWN. And so we're feeling quite good about that and next year will be a good year.","Andrew C. Warren","And, Todd, regarding your tax comment. It's well said. You often take a step back to move forward on tax. We did transfer intangible assets from the U.S. to the U.K. Those transfers had some temporary increases in the effective tax rate based on how we recognized that transfer, if there's a gain associated with that. But long term the effective tax rate goes down from that and there's other things we're pursuing as well given our global structures. So what I can say is this: today we're about a 36% effective tax rate both cash and effective. My goal is really to get that down 700 basis points and the goal being kind of the low 30s.","Operator","The next question we have comes from the line of Michael Nathanson from Nomura.","Michael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","I have one housekeeping for Andy and then one for David, thematically. Andy, if you could just give us a help on the adjustments you made for your outlook. How big was Creative Sound Services in terms of the change and how big was the mark-to-market in terms of your updates? So when you guys adjusted your view for net income this year, can you help us with those moving pieces?","Andrew C. Warren","Sure. Well, the Creative Sound Services was about $75 million of revenue and so that's fully eliminated. The mark-to-market is about $20 million given the increase in our stock price. And so those are kind of the 2 higher. And then tax, the tax is slightly higher based on the adjustments I just talked about. The transfer of some of the intangibles creates a short-term effective tax rate increase.","Michael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Because I certainly know the revenues, and we assume like mid -- your double-digit margin is basically 15%, 20% for your sound solutions -- sorry, Sound Services?","Andrew C. Warren","Oh, no. That was basically a profit-neutral business.","Michael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. So that doesn't really hit net income? Okay. And then, David, a question for you. You guys have been so successful in investment in programming. Look at the growth you have globally in ratings. Why would you want to slow down cash spending next year? Why not keep going at the level you've spent. And is there a chance that you'll revisit that if things change for programming next year?","David M. Zaslav","Yes, first, we've been finding a lot of success, Michael with -- we have 3 series on TLC that are getting almost a 3 rating, some of -- 2 of them getting actually over a 3 rating. We have a lot of returning series. And for us unlike a lot of the other models, when we get returning series, the additional cost on return is not that high. And we won't have to go out and look for a lot more content on a number of these brands because we have a lot more returning, and so that's pretty efficient. And we're not going to be reducing. We just -- the increase is going to be -- we're not going to  need to increase in a meaningful way. If we feel that we do because there's a big opportunity, we will. But we're getting -- we're much more efficient. We've also worked very hard over the last several years to get really good creative teams in place. We've made lots of mistakes. We've learned from those mistakes. And so -- and we have a really good sense of the brands at this point, probably much better than we ever have. It's still a hit or miss business, but we're feeling much better about where we are. And with more returning, we have much more confidence in the sustainability. When you look at Discovery, 4 years ago, it was Dirty Jobs, it was Man vs. Wild and it was MythBusters. Today, we have 5 series now that -- some of those are gone, and we have 5 series that are bigger than all 3 of those put together. Gold Rush is bigger than 3 of those series all put together. And so our series are fresher. And that's true across the board with ID. Henry's got a great formula. So we just think we could be more efficient and effective and less waste.","Operator","The next question we have comes from the line of Richard Greenfield from BTIG.","Richard Greenfield - BTIG, LLC, Research Division","A couple of questions. One, when you look at Hub, curious how your agreement with Hasbro works. If Hasbro was in any event acquired by a third party, how does that impact The Hub and in its access to content and characters related to Hasbro? And then just two, David, you spoke about your excitement surrounding Tyler Perry and what that's going to do to OWN ratings. Just curious in terms of -- it seems like there's a change relative to kind of the original kind of lead-your-best-life aspirational side. And I was wondering as you look at OWN and how you're positioning it with advertisers, is this now going to be more of a general entertainment network, like a TBS where this programming has been before. Just wondering kind of how you're going to position it from an ad rate and sub rate card perspective.","David M. Zaslav","Okay. The Hub is doing great, by the way. It's up over 60% in the last quarter, and Margaret Loesch is doing a terrific job. Quickly, we have great optionality if the company was to be acquired. We have kind of one-way optionality in terms into what we do, which gives us some good flexibility. But the business is doing very well, and we're happy with it. On Tyler Perry, it's really consistent with their vision. If anything, we were much too teachy [ph] and preachy and earnest when we started. And the mission for Oprah and I now is that we have a lot of great stuff like Super Soul Sunday and Life Class and Master Class. But we also -- we're having a lot of fun with Sweetie Pie's and with Tyler's type of stuff and with lot of content that's on there. And the audience said to us, \"We want to have fun, we want to laugh, we want to see families. We want to see families struggle and we want to see families have fun. And we want some comedy.\" And so Tyler I think fits squarely within. And we're also getting a very large African-American audience on OWN, dramatic African-American audience. There was -- when Oprah interviewed Rihanna, we had more African-American women watching OWN than ABC, NBC, CBS and FOX put together. And so Tyler appeals to everyone, but that appeal to the African-American audience will be another helper.","Operator","The next question we have comes from the line of Anthony DiClemente from Barclays.","Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I just have one quick one left for Andy, which is, did you guys -- and I'm sorry if you did this -- did you update your 2012 free cash flow guidance number, Andy? And then as you look into 2013, I guess, is there anything changing as you -- as I compare net income to free cash flow in the model, is there anything that would sort of change that general ratio in terms of working capital or cash versus noncash as we look into 2013? Just trying to get free cash flow in the model accurate.","Andrew C. Warren","Okay. We did not actually update the free cash flow, Anthony. But it's still looking at about $1 billion for 2012. With regard to '13, we'll provide more perspective on '13 on the year-end call. But the only thing I'll highlight as far as a different thought as you model year-over-year, think in terms of less, well, a slight increase in content spend, certainly less of an increase than we had in 2012. So it will be slightly up but up a whole lot less than we had this year. But again, we'll provide much more perspective and granularity on that on the year-end call.","Operator","The next question we have comes from Alexia Quadrani's line from JPMorgan.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I'm just following up on your comments really about the advertising market. I think you mentioned it slowed a bit in early October and then strengthened a bit. I guess, sort of just going back, would you say that the fourth quarter advertising market, the health of it scatter-over-scatter is still a little bit stronger than it was in Q3 or not necessarily given the slow start?","David M. Zaslav","Yes, the domestic advertising market, it feels quite strong now. There was a period for about 2 weeks where the volume, the pricing was there, but the volume wasn't there. We did hold price. But the volume has come back and the price is still more than double-digit over high double-digit over upfront. And so we're feeling good about that domestically. Internationally this quarter, we had 10% ad growth, which for us was a drop. But we have good visibility into next quarter. And we expect that it will be mid-teen -- well in the mid-teens or better. The market feels quite strong for us. As you look at last quarter, we faced a couple of issues. One was the Olympics. We clearly made the strategy that we weren't going to do original programming domestically or around the world, and so that hurt us. It hurt us I think in a good way because we've come back strong, but there's no question that those 3 weeks did have an impact. And the fact that the Olympics went across most of Europe in real time probably had more of an impact than maybe something like Brazil will have, which was a different time zone and the Winter Olympics is always much smaller. In addition, interestingly, we found strength in most markets with the exception of Asia. So really what it was, was the Olympics in Asia. And Asia was 2 or 3 campaigns that moved out of the third quarter. And so we saw a significant movement. Asia now looks good, and we feel good about next quarter, when we expect that we'll be returning to mid-teens or better. And you'll see the growth trajectory continue as you would expect.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And I would assume foreign exchange is probably a bit less of a hit in the fourth quarter, is that fair?","Andrew C. Warren","Well, that's only an expectation. Right now, we don't have a preview on where rates are going. FX has been a real bad guy for us this year. I mean, a multi-tens of millions of impact on OIBDA. And we have so many different moving currencies that affect us. So today, that's been certainly negative impact, but right now we're not looking at or forecasting any big change between now and year end.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Michael Morris from Davenport & Company.","Michael C. Morris - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","I'll try to be quick here. One on International, one on Oprah. Your subscriber base growth was 17% internationally but your affiliates and ads are both below that, I assume because you're growing more in lower-priced markets. What's the outlook for that turning into a tailwind at some point? Is it simply a question of the health of the macro economy in those markets or is that something that you can see, say, within the next year or 2, where you're growing faster than the subscriber growth? And then I have one quick follow-up.","David M. Zaslav","Yes, Michael, that is what we're seeing, so for instance, Brazil and Mexico are growing aggressively, but they're going after the C Class. And so where we might have in Brazil, we have 11 channels. And we have 5 of the top 20 channels in Brazil. And all of those channels were carried, but we made the decision that in order to kind of opt in to the C Class, where they're only offering 25 channels, that we would allow for 4 or 5 of our channels to be carried out of 20 or 25 or 30 rather than trying to push 11, because we didn't think we'd get them all in. Others have decided not to participate and we think that was a mistake because we're seeding our brands all around the world and we're putting our best brands forward in those smaller tiers. And what's happening is not so much in Brazil, but more in Mexico and more in Russia, that those little by little, there's a kind of a grow-up where you start with your 30 channels and then they're trying to get you to come up to the 50 or the 60. And so we'll get the advantage of that. And we'll also continue to get the advantage of the growth, but a lot of the growth is in C Class in some of these emerging markets. And so we may be getting less, but the growth is really substantial and it's important that we're a part of it and it builds our relationship with the distributors in all those markets because we have actually more market share among the C Class because of the strategy of pushing down into it.","Michael C. Morris - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","Great, that's helpful. And over on OWN, I know you guys have targeted breakeven next year. When you look at the difference between now and then and what's going to drive that, can you give a little insight on how much is coming from, let's say, distribution growth versus ad growth versus cost control as you get from where you are now to getting to that breakeven point?","Andrew C. Warren","Well, Michael, I mean clearly the business is performing at or better than we had hoped it would and when we provided that perspective 6 months ago, we're right in line with again if not better than we had thought. But we're not going to really get into 2013 right now. Just to clarify, we really talked about a breakeven in the second half of '13. And we'll update some of that perspective and guidance on the year-end call. But the business is clearly performing and performing at or better than we had hoped.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of with Vasily Karasyov from Susquehanna Financial Gr.","Vasily Karasyov - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","It's Vasily Karasyov from Susquehanna. Andy, what should we expect in terms of pace of buyback. Will it change depending on the stock price? Some of your peers made comments recently that it does impact them. And then, David, you mentioned when you were discussing how you re-purposed a lot of successful networks that you made some mistakes. A little bit -- just curious to hear some of those lessons learned over the past several years?","Andrew C. Warren","Sure. Well, Vasily, on the stock repurchase, like what you saw, we did over $450 million in the third quarter. Now as we look at how we allocate capital, first and foremost is to drive organic growth. Secondly, it's about finding perhaps the right acquisition and the right allocation of capital preferably internationally. And then thirdly, if we maximize the first 2, we'll continue to look at returning capital to shareholders through share repurchase program. So look, I've had a bullish view on this. I use free cash flow per share as the model we use internally to determine kind of the IRR. And to date, that's been a good return for us and we continue to be an active buyer of our stock. If you look at the -- in the October timeframe, we had a predetermined grid going into October because that's a close window for us. And as the stock performed nicely and went up, we're buying fewer shares as you would expect from a grid like that. But look, for us it's all about forward-looking free cash flow per share and buying off that to expectation, with again that being the third allocation of capital relative to organic growth and acquisitions.","David M. Zaslav","I think some of the best things that we've done at Discovery is create a culture where you raise your hand and you say that what you felt was your best idea is not the best idea. Ultimately, the best idea's what audience likes and what nourishes them in our business. So when I got here, TLC was the #23 or 24 in American. And we hired a whole team to go out to LA, and it was my strategy that if we made TLC sexier and cooler and hipper that we'd go from the #24 channel to a top 10 channel. We did that, and 6 months later, TLC was the #30 or 32 network in America. We lost 1\/3 of our audience and the people that loved TLC left. And we took a hard look at what the TLC brand was and what we did wrong, and it led us to a great recipe. What we did wrong was that TLC is about middle America, it's about real values, it's about heart, it's about great storytelling, about families that live a life that's different than the way they live in New York and LA. And I had to go back to the board and say, I made a mistake. This isn't the right team. We got to make a change. We hired Eileen O'Neill. We drilled down for another 3 months on what the brand was. And we found a very unique strategy in TLC, which is forget New York and LA. TLC is about middle America and it's about heart. And here we are now. We had one point last month where 3 nights a week we were the #1 cable network in America for women with Honey Boo Boo, with wedding programming on Friday and on Sunday night with Long Island Medium and Breaking Amish. Sunday night's still the most competitive night on TV. We're averaging over a 3. So that was one. Two was Planet Green, which I really thought that I looked at FOX News, I looked at the fact that it was a new idea of having an affinity group that was built-in, that was had a certain way of looking at the world and that we could do the same thing by creating a channel called Planet Green that was about the environment. And we spent a fair amount of money and we had to raise our hand and say it's not working. And so we shut it down and we relaunched it as Destination America and we spoke to the audience about what they want, we spoke to advertisers and distributors and we came up with Destination America and it's up dramatically and we're making more money. And so that's the way the culture works here. And I think we've gotten better at it. It even works on a micro basis. We waste a lot of money by continuing to do shows that we think are good ideas but halfway through we figure out are not so good. But we continue to do them. And so we now have a creative culture that's more about raising their hands and say, \"Let's shoot this, it isn't going to work and let's do something that the audience is going to like better.\"","Craig Felenstein","Thank you, everyone, for joining us.

As a reminder this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Andrew Slabin, Executive Vice President, Investor Strategy.","Andrew T. Slabin - Discovery Communications, Inc.","Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for Discovery Communications' third quarter 2017 earnings call. Joining me today are David Zaslav, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Gunnar Wiedenfels, our Chief Financial Officer. You should have received our earnings release, but if not, feel free to access it on our website at www.discoverycommunications.com.","On today's call, we will begin with some opening comments from David and Gunnar and then we will open the call up for your questions. Please keep to one question if possible so we can accommodate as many people as possible.","Before we start I would like to remind you that comments today regarding the company's future business plans, prospects and financial performance are forward-looking statements that we make pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are made based on management's current knowledge and assumptions about future events and they involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and providing projections and other forward-looking statements, the company disclaims any intent or obligation to update them.","For additional information on important factors that could affect these expectations, please see our annual report for the year ended December 31, 2016 and our subsequent filings made with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.","And with that, I will turn the call over to David.","David M. Zaslav - Discovery Communications, Inc.","Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. This was another pivotal quarter for Discovery. We reported a solid set of operating results driven by gains in global advertising and distribution revenue with steady performance from our linear channels, enhanced by our growing suite of digital products.","As we continue the transaction process around Scripps, we remain laser-focused on the two tracks designed to drive long-term growth and value for Discovery. Maximizing our linear business where our dual revenue stream continues to provide a stable, cash generating base and pivoting to become a leader in digital and mobile first content. As subscriber declines continue across the pay television landscape, we continue to pursue our strategic pivot, to take our content to consumers across every screen and service.","We are a leading global IP company, and we will only get stronger with the addition of the Scripps content and brands. We will continue to capitalize on our deep global and flexible IP portfolio of strong niche, superfan brands and moreover, as distributors consolidate and mobile and other platform operators look to differentiate their products, owning IP globally, on all platforms like we do, in almost 50 languages, makes us truly unique. And we are convinced will lead the strong monetization opportunities in the year ahead. We are a long IP.","With global platform companies serving millions of users looking to offer content, we are one of very few media companies that can offer a global package of content with recognizable brands and IP to all of the world.","I'll begin this morning with a few details about our linear TV portfolio, where we are enjoying healthy momentum across our top channels. TLC continues its impressive audience growth, as the network enjoyed growth of 15% in delivery in the third quarter, highlighted by the popularity of the 90 DAY FIANC\u00c9 franchise.","TLC also has tied with ID as the fastest growing primetime female network in cable year-to-date, and has an impressive development pipeline for 2018. ID remained the number one ad supported net cable network in total day delivery for persons 25 to 54 and women 25 to 54 for the quarter, and hit a new milestone in September, breaking into the top 10 ad supported cable networks in prime among persons 25 to 54. ID is just a terrific story, and it just keeps getting better.","Discovery Channel maintained its position as the number one non-sports network for men this year through the third quarter, led by Deadliest Catch and Alaskan Bush People, the number one and number two unscripted cable series among men and persons respectively.","We are now beginning to achieve measurable results on the three pillars we have identified as the foundation of our digital forward strategy. Ad supported digital, including GO TV Everywhere apps, paid direct-to-consumer subscription video, and mobile-first short and mid-form content.","On each of these, we are leveraging our IP portfolio beyond core pay TV, ensuring we remain relevant across every screen and every platform. In just one year since launching GO nationally in the U.S., is has contributed over a point of incremental ad sales revenue growth to our base, and we expect GO to deliver another meaningful increase in revenue in 2018.","Importantly, we see no signs that our U.S. GO TV Everywhere platform is cannibalizing our linear business, with nearly half of GO users age 18 to 34.","TLC and ID are leading the way on GO, with digital original content and exclusive efforts around existing franchises, helping to drive new screening records, as total weekly GO streams increased 50% from the first quarter to the third quarter.","Looking ahead, and offering good example of how we are programming and marketing our content across all platforms, is the return of TLC's highly anticipated series, Trading Spaces, which will also be accompanied by the digital original series, Training Spaces, available exclusively on TLC GO.","GO is an exciting story within our company, while not only helping to augment our linear business, but delivering valuable first-hand insights about our audience and reinforcing the fact that our content resonates with younger digital-first viewers.","Internationally, we recently launched our joint premium entertainment streaming, AVOD service with ProSieben in Germany, bringing together nine of the most popular channels in Germany, including our own free to air channels and is structured to support additional content and joint venture partners in the future.","If successful, we could look to expand this offering and create a template for future deals in key markets. For those of you not familiar with this product, it is like a German Hulu, and we are very excited about the level of interest and prospects we have seen so far.","The second pillar, direct-to-consumer paid subscription video, continues to gain traction led in large part by the Eurosport Player. As we discussed this summer, we made a strategic decision to keep our Bundesliga rights, exclusively for the Eurosport Player, while at the same time pivoting the Player to a season pass model, where we focus on one sport to a user.","We are starting to gain real traction. We've learned a lot, and we have seen solid subscriber growth throughout the season. As well, overall brand awareness of the Player throughout Europe continues to build.","Further, we're particularly excited about Eurosport's momentum going into 2018 Winter Olympic Games, and our plan to deliver every minute of the events to viewers across linear TV and digital.","We are now less than 100 days away from the start of the games in Pyeongchang, and remain on track with our internal estimates for third party distribution sales. We're confident about delivering the most digitally expensive and differentiated Olympic Games yet in Europe, for both our viewers and advertisers.","Our direct-to-consumer strategy was further highlighted in Europe with the recent announcements of streaming partnerships with Amazon in the UK, Germany and Austria for Discovery and Eurosport.","The deals with Amazon bring Discovery programming, the Olympic Games, as well as top-tier sporting events and other library content to the Amazon channels, offering to Prime subscribers across these markets.","Also, we recently closed our transaction to form a new car superfan joint venture with The Enthusiast Network, comprised of leading consumer online brands, including Motor Trend, Hotrod and Automobile, as well as a wealth of editorial and video content.","Indeed, Motor Trend OnDemand already has nearly 100,000 subscribers, making it a vibrant direct-to-consumer product offering in the U.S. serving this niche. We see a significant growth opportunity for the Motor Trend OnDemand service as we layer in our huge library of long form content from Velocity, as well as live auto auctions and live events. While still early days, we believe the Motor Trend joint venture can serve as a roadmap for other high-value niche content offerings.","Lastly, within our mobile-first content segment, Group Nine has proven to be a terrific asset, executing against a smart and aggressive strategic plan. In just one year since launch, Group Nine has become one of the leading digital-first media companies with over 5 billion monthly streams, superfan brands, strong traffic, tech and data.","Our investment in Group Nine has allowed us to grow our short and mid-form capabilities and open doors to other digital-first content relationships. For example, with Snap, we recently have greenlit a show concept for MythBusters. And last month, we announced a partnership to create exclusive Eurosport content around the 2018 Winter Olympics for Snapchat's Discover platform.","Lastly, a word about Scripps. Our recent integration planning work has reinforced what we knew to be true. This is the right transaction at the right time for Discovery. We're even more excited today than we were three months ago, when we announced plans to join our two companies and brands, and we see even broader opportunities to enhance and grow our content, distribution and advertising globally.","We continue to anticipate closing in early 2018 and look forward to updating you in the months ahead as our vision to create the global leader in real-life entertainment. As the media ecosystem continues to evolve, and as new opportunities emerge, whether due to new technology or changes in consumer behavior, Discovery is increasingly well positioned to adapt.","We remain committed to establishing the basis for enhanced terminal value for our company, particularly as we invest in new products, content and methods of delivery to meet both the challenges and the opportunities that we envision will unfold in the coming years. We are fully engaged in leveraging our core assets and our broad and deep portfolio of global IP, to drive a future-forward model of superfan content, engagement and monetization.","I'll now turn it over to Gunnar to go through the details of our third quarter results.","Gunnar Wiedenfels - Discovery Communications, Inc.","Thanks, David, and good morning, everyone. Our third quarter results were again driven by continued strong global distribution growth and the nice uptick in both U.S. and international ad growth, combined with our continued strict focus on cost management. While constant currency revenues were up 4%, and constant currency adjusted OIBDA was up 3%, our total company reported revenues were up 6% and adjusted OIBDA was up 3% in another quarter with positive impact on our financial result from FX changes.","Third quarter reported net income available to Discovery Communications of $218 million was consistent with a year ago. On the positive side, we had improved operating results and a net positive impact of our solar deals. We realized a much higher tax benefit due to deal timing, and we also continued to see positive impacts on tax rate associated with our more global asset base.","However, these positive effects were offset by $142 million or $0.25 per share of after-tax costs related to the Scripps acquisition including transaction costs, the unwinding of interest rate hedges in conjunction with the Scripps debt rate and additional interest expense and below the line currency-related losses versus a gain last year.","On taxes, based on these trends, we still expect our full year tax rate to be a couple hundred basis points below 20% and net-net, the positive impact of our solar investments on full year net income.","Now let us turn to adjusted EPS and free cash flow. Third quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share, which excludes the impact of acquisition-related non-cash amortization of intangible assets, increased 8% to $0.43.","For the last 12 months, adjusted EPS, excluding currency, FX and Scripps transaction costs increased 22%. Third quarter free cash flow was up 67% to $699 million, due to lower cash taxes resulting from solar investments as well as the timing of content spent on working capital, as discussed on our second quarter earnings call.","For the last 12 months, reported free cash flow was up 16%, and excluding currency and Scripps transaction costs, free cash flow was up 17%. And as I will discuss more later, we are reiterating both guidance metrics for the full year.","Turning to the operating units. Let me start with our U. S. Networks. Our U.S. Networks total revenues were up 4%, led by distribution growth of 6% and 3% advertising growth. Advertising grew 3% or 4% excluding the impact of Group Nine, primarily due to strength of TLC and ID, higher overall pricing and improved monetization of our GO platform, which this quarter added more than one point of growth, partially offset by overall lower delivery due to continued universe declines.","As we looked ahead to the fourth quarter of 2017, we currently expect organic U.S. ad growth to be up in the low single digit range.","Now let us look at affiliate revenues. Our third quarter domestic distribution revenues were up 6%. Our growth was driven by increases in affiliate rates as well as increases in content licensing revenues, partially offset by a decline in subscribers.","We had higher content licensing revenue this quarter versus the last two quarters due to the timing of revenue recognition upon delivering more SVOD content and expect much lower licensing contributions in the fourth quarter. Finally, we're still confident in our full-year U.S. Distribution guidance of mid-single digit growth.","Delving further into the drivers of U.S. affiliate subscriber trends, our top nets like Discovery and TLC, which are driving the lion's share of our economics, were consistent with the second quarter, with subs again down around 3%. Driven by steeper declines at our smaller nets, total portfolio subs in the third quarter declined by 5% year-over-year.","Turning to the cost side. Operating expenses in the quarter were up 2%, leading to adjusted OIBDA growth of 5%.","I will now turn to our International operations. Excluding currency, revenues increased 7% and adjusted OIBDA increased 1%. FX changes, again, had a positive impact on our revenue this quarter, so reported revenues were up 11% and adjusted OIBDA was flat.","For comparability purposes, my following International comments will refer to our organic results only, so we'll exclude the impact of currency. The 7% third quarter revenue growth was comprised of 9% distribution growth and 5% advertising growth.","Our 9% distribution revenue growth was driven by strong double-digit growth in Europe, where we continue to realize higher affiliate rates on the back of our extended content portfolio that includes sports, and where we are seeing nice traction on the Eurosport Player.","We have been pleased with our progress in signing up subsequent Player after our strategic pivot to our Bundesliga gains in Germany, solely on this platform. And we remain ahead of our plan.","Outside of Europe, growth was also driven by higher rate throughout Latin America. However, this growth was partially offset by first, continued overall subscriber declines in Latin America, particularly in Brazil and Mexico due to the current macroeconomic conditions, and second, pricing declines in Asia, our smallest affiliate market and the market where we lack strong sports or kids content due to lower contracted rates as recently some deals have come up for renewal. And third, a small impact from natural disasters including those hurricanes in Puerto Rico and the Caribbean at the end of the third quarter.","Assuming a continuation of these current trends as well as a full quarter of expected impact from continued power outages in Puerto Rico, the Caribbean and Mexico, we now expect our full year 2017 constant currency affiliate growth to be 100 to 150 basis points below our prior goal of approximately 10%.","And as we look ahead to growth into 2018, assuming a continuation of our Bundesliga strategy, current sub trends in Latin America and pricing trends in Asia, we think next year's constant currency affiliate growth is more likely to come in below double digits as well.","Turning to Advertising, our 5% increase was driven by growth across all regions. In particular, we had higher ratings in Southern Europe, Latin America and CEEMEA and higher pricing in CEEMEA and Latin America. As we look head to the fourth quarter, we expect ad sales growth to be around flat. We expect growth in Latin America and Southern and Eastern Europe to be offset primarily by expected declines in the Nordics which continue to be impacted by part level decline.","Turning to the cost side, operating expenses internationally grew 9%, primarily due to higher sports content and production costs and adjusted OIBDA was up 1%.","Now let us look at our overall financial picture. In the third quarter, we spent a total of only $102 million repurchasing our shares as we suspended our buyback program. As we have stated, until our gross leverage ratio is back within our new target range of 3 to 3.5 times, we will continue to allocate virtually all of our capital towards paying down debt.","We have also decided not to make additional solar investments after the end of this year, when we will have fulfilled our current commitment, given our desire to preserve capital for debt reduction.","Consequently, we continue to be very confident in our ability to be able to bring back leverage to within our target range within two years from closing the deal at the latest.","Turning to our full year guidance, as mentioned, I'm pleased to reiterate both our adjusted EPS and free cash flow guidance metrics. With nine months of the year under our belt, we're tracking well with adjusted EPS, excluding currency and the impact of the Scripps-related transaction costs, up 22% and free cash flow, excluding currency and the impact of the Scripps-related transaction costs, up 43% year-to-date.","As noted, we still expect 2017 free cash flow growth, excluding currency, and of course, the impacts from the Scripps transaction to be at least low double digits. And we also still expect adjusted EPS growth, excluding currency and the impact from the Scripps transaction to be at least low to mid teens. Please note though, that we expect an additional $100 million to $150 million of pre-tax Scripps-related costs in the fourth quarter, including interest and other expenses.","Let me also provide some color around the financial impact of the TEN transactions, our new autofocus joint venture that includes the Motor Trend SVOD services that we started consolidating at the end of the third quarter. Contributions from the TEN businesses, and note this does not include contributions from Velocity which is already in our financial, are expect to initially be around $25 million to $30 million of revenue per quarter, with the majority coming from other revenues, which includes live events, content production and licensing brands for third parties and is expected to have a minimal impact on adjusted OIBDA.","Finally, I want to update you on the expected year-over-year foreign exchange impact on our full year reported results. Given the weakening of the dollar versus the European currencies, at the current rates, currency movements are expected to be a nice tailwind of both revenues and adjusted OIBDA for the full year now. So assuming rates stay constant for the rest of the year, the year-over-year FX impact on revenues is now expected to be a positive $40 million to $50 million, and on AOIBDA, the impact is expected to be positive $10 million to $20 million. Finally, the combined currency and Scripps-related transaction cost's year-over-year impact on full year adjusted EPS is expected to be negative $0.52 to $0.58.","In closing, as David mentioned, we remain on track to close the Scripps transaction by early 2018 and remain extremely optimistic about the potential combination. I see multiple areas of cost and revenue upside, both domestically and internationally, which will drive the significant long-term value for our shareholders.","Thank you again for your time this morning. And now David and I will be happy to answer your question. Please note we cannot discuss Scripps results, and will therefore ask you to please keep your questions specific to Discovery.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. The first question is from Jessica Reif of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Jessica Jean Reif Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Oh, thank you. I guess, first question on International. On the cost side, which seems to be elevated due to sports, can you just talk about like the next three to five year outlook? You've known costs for sports. How do you think about overall expenses? And can you talk about monetizing? It seems like you're making some progress with the Player. And then on the domestic affiliate fees, you did say that it's stepping down a bit. Can you talk about some of the swing factors you're seeing there, both pricing, and what do you see in the universe overall over the next year or two?","David M. Zaslav - Discovery Communications, Inc.","Thanks, Jessica. Why don't I start out with domestic affiliate. We've said that we're done with our deals for a period of time. We got through a cycle very effectively with high single digit increases over the term of those deals. What we're seeing is we're getting hit by the 3% decline. We are on Sony and DIRECTV. And we're not on those other skinny bundles, meaning Hulu and YouTube. And so we're continuing to talk to them and work on that. And we're focused very hard on the fact that the U.S. is the only market that doesn't have a bundle without sport. And we're having some constructive discussions with distributors and some constructive discussions with other programmers. And over-the-top provides a significant opportunity to attack that.","We see a meaningful market for that everywhere else in the world. And there is a macro argument that most markets around the world are fairly stable; some are growing. But having the U.S. be the only market with very expensive all sports and re-trans packaging is what's causing this 3% decline. And without that, we might be looking like most of the other markets, where younger people or entry-level have a chance to get into the market, and we might be seeing flat to even up 1%. I think eventually we'll get there. We're at the front of the pack driving that. And when we get the Scripps deal done, I think we'll have most of the really high-quality, superfan channels. And in fact, if you look at the surveys, Discovery, HGTV, ID, Food, are four of the top services that people want for over-the-top. And in many cases, they're ahead of broadcast networks. So we think we're well-positioned on our content and IP. And we're being a little disadvantaged, I think, in the marketplace by not being on those platforms. We've heard it from you, and we're continuing to drive that.","Gunnar Wiedenfels - Discovery Communications, Inc.","Okay. And Jessica, on the International content expenses and sports specifically. As you know, we haven't given any specific long-term guidance. I think a couple of points are safe to say. Number one, we will continue to be focused on making investments into IP; that's the core of our business, and will continue to be a priority for our capital allocation.","On sports, specifically, as you know, we have made some significant investments, and we feel that we're in a very good position now with the Olympics deal and several other premium sports rights that we have secured for Europe. So we're in a very, very good position there.","For the financial outlook, clearly, 2018 is going to be the first year with an impact from the Olympics deal. And I've said before that there's going to be an impact both on top line and on the expense line, about $140 million from rights plus additional production cost. And you can assume sort of a very marginal impact on profits for 2018.","And I mean, all that being said, if you look at the developments of our cost of sales line internationally, then the majority of the increase is driven by those sports rights and we've been managing content expenses outside of sports pretty much at a very low single digit increase.","David M. Zaslav - Discovery Communications, Inc.","Yeah. So you'll see the sports IP relatively steady. And it'll be a little bit bumpy because of the Olympics coming in and out. But Gunnar has made an important point. We are investing for the long-term. And we're very IP long. I mean, if you look back at that moment when John Malone was running Stars, he made the decision to not just buy movie rights for Stars, but he bought it for all platforms.","And at the time he said to me, he thinks those other platforms, at some point, will be worth more in value then Stars itself. And he turned out to be right. The other premium providers bought rights just for those channels. That is our core strategy as a company. We own almost all of our IP everywhere in the world on all platforms.","In sport, we own all of our sports in Europe on all platforms. So we haven't, at this point, fully monetized that IP. But if gets sold to Deutsche Telekom or Vodafone or BT, if some of it gets sold exclusively to some distributors as we've done with Bollor\u00e9 and Drahi in France, all of that is upside, because we own all that IP.","We have the optionality of doing deals with Amazon or Apple or Facebook or Google. And so that's why we love Scripps so much, because we own all that IP, it hasn't been used globally, and it fits along with our superfan IP global strategy. And so we feel good about it, but we also recognize that we could be dropping a lot more money to EBITDA if we weren't investing in IP or if we were just buying linear rights.","So when you hear other companies announce that they're going to go direct-to-consumer, if you hear us announce it, we have the right to do anything we want with any of our content. And I think that we believe that that can be really compelling and will create long-term value and addresses the terminal value issue because we believe that our content long-term is going to work on mobile, it's going to work for Apple, it's going to work for Facebook, and it's going to work for the mobile guys and it'll de-commoditize all of them as they're looking for IP.","Gunnar Wiedenfels - Discovery Communications, Inc.","And Jessica, on the Player, as David said in his speech, we're seeing some very encouraging progress on the subscriber base. Clearly the theme is the Bundesliga exploitation. The season launched in back end of August, and we're seeing a very healthy uptake. We've also switched our technical platform to the BAMTech platform across the whole footprint, more than 60 markets, and that went very well, with some small hiccups that are usual in these type of launches. So we're very happy there.","In terms of the monetization, keep in mind that we're ramping up the subscriber base. So we will see more of an impact going forward. And there's two aspects to this. Number one is I really do think that with this premium right, we have really repositioned the Eurosport brand, especially in the German market, but across Europe. There's a positive pollination effect between the Player and the linear feeds. We're seeing ratings up on the linear Eurosport network as well. So that is all working very well.","And then finally, it's a very good learning for us, because we now have some premium rights with a lot of demand on the platform. And we're expecting a lot of very valuable learnings as we come up on the Olympics next year. So I think that's all going very well.","David M. Zaslav - Discovery Communications, Inc.","And as Gunnar said on Eurosport, which I think is an important point, is right now it looks like we could find value in two baskets. Last year was a record year for Eurosport with ratings. And Eurosport ratings right now are up 20% over that, at the same time that we're taking that IP direct-to-consumer. And we have a right to take any of that IP. So if we talk to someone who wants a certain kind of IP, more on the Player, we can just make the decision to take it off Eurosport, deliver it to the player and then promote on Eurosport that you can get that match or that game on the player.","Jessica Jean Reif Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question is from Steven Cahall of Royal Bank of Canada. Your line is open.","Steven Cahall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yeah. Thank you, good morning. Maybe just first to follow up on the strategic pivot that you mentioned, and you just threw out Apple, Facebook and Amazon as potential partners. So I guess, number one, can you talk about any burgeoning relationships you might have on that side for content partnerships? But then also, how you're thinking about the sale of content into licensing and how that may exacerbate some of the pressures that you're seeing on the linear side and how you're thinking about managing that pivot.","And then separately, maybe regard to the Olympics. I think there's been some press reports about Eurosport taking a more holistic approach to measurement across all the platforms. I was just wondering if you could give us a little more detail on what sort of traction you're getting with that currency, and how you might be able to adopt that as you become a more multiplatform-centric company over time.","David M. Zaslav - Discovery Communications, Inc.","Thanks, Steven. At this point, what we're trying to do is figure out where the soccer ball is going to go. And so we're trying to both build our core company, which is very stable and still providing real growth with the global footprints that we have, more channels in more countries, with core niche content that people love. But then we're really starting to get some momentum in this idea of, at least our strategy of where we think that ball is going to be. And that is owning IP, and being in a position that you can sell that IP in different windows to different distributors.","In the case of the big four, we've never seen, in my 30 years in this business, distribution platforms like Facebook has with 2 billion, like Amazon and Google and Apple. So we're talking to all of them. We have deals already with Amazon in the UK, Germany and Austria. They're quite creative. In those markets we're going direct-to-consumer with Discovery for 4.99.","We're selling Eurosport on Amazon. Amazon is selling our Player in Germany. We think the ball's going to go to the place that if you look back three years ago, those were platforms. Today, they're all in the game for IP. And so, AT&T can go out and buy Time Warner. That makes a lot of sense in a market like the U.S. that's 350 million people. And that's probably going to be a very effective transaction for Randall. But as you go across Europe and you go across Latin America or Asia, and you're a distributor, if you're Polsat in Poland or if you're Canal+ in France, at that point, it really is not going to make sense to go out and buy a big media company. So you're going to go to media companies and say, what IP do you have?","And so we think that if Apple wanted to do a deal with one person and offer a family pack everywhere in the world, or if Facebook wanted to do that or Amazon, or if the mobile players wanted to do it in Europe, who could they go to? There's very few companies. It's maybe less than three. And we have brands that we've been working on in those countries for 20 to 30 years and we have massive amount of content and we think that Scripps will add to that and renew that and rejuvenate it.","And as we've said, we see Scripps as a beginning. Within two years we'll be less than 3.5 times levered, and then we'll be looking for what other IP do we have. How to we accelerate direct-to-consumer? How do we accelerate our overall market share? And so we think we're trying to be where the ball is and we see those big distributors looking more and more for the ball. And the ball for them is content.","Gunnar Wiedenfels - Discovery Communications, Inc.","Okay. On the Eurosport question, I mean, as we have said multiple times, we're going to make sure that these games are the most digitally accessible games ever. We will be making available every event on a wide range of platforms. And obviously, that does put us in a position to also deliver an audience across these multiple platforms.","And one of the big benefits is that we will have people signing up for the Player so we will have the personal identifiable information which, especially in Europe, is a very big advantage because there's a lot more strict data protection rules over there. So we really see this Olympics event as a sort of kickstarter or a booster for our ability to deliver targeted advertising and data-driven products into the audience. Clearly, for any specific numbers, of course it's too early right now.","David M. Zaslav - Discovery Communications, Inc.","And doing a deal with Snap across Europe, we think will bring in a younger demo. And with Facebook, we already have a very extensive partnership. With Group Nine, we're one of the leading providers of short-form, and when they launched mid-form, we were one of the leading providers of mid-form.","And so I think staying close to those companies, figuring out what they need and catering our superfan baskets, both in terms of type of content and mid-form, short-form, long-form. We've come a long way from two years ago. We have a full menu now.","Steven Cahall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Jason Bazinet of Citi. Your line is open.","Jason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Yeah. Maybe for Mr. Zaslav, you mentioned the U.S. is the only country that doesn't have a non-sports package. I assume that's on linear. I was just wondering if you could give us a little bit of a history lesson in terms of why that is. And then how easy do you think it is to change? I presume it has something to do with some of the bigger sports channels out there and the distributors' minimum guarantees that they have. But any color that you could share would be helpful. Thanks.","David M. Zaslav - Discovery Communications, Inc.","Sure. Well, the U.S. is the only market that has retransmission consent. So we'll start out that broadcasting is truly free in every other market. Here now, the broadcasters are charging $2 or $3 a month, which is quite good for them, but it's not so good for the consumers, and it's not so good for the distributors who have to eat that additional cost, and it becomes a level of entry. It's also the only market where, because the sports channels grew up in this market and use their leverage to require full carriage of all of their sports channels, together with the fact that most sports channels are owned by the re-trans broadcast companies, you have a combustible combination. And so if you want to get the broadcast network, if you want to get the regional sports \u2013 and this is the only country that really has an extensive regional sports network structure.","So between regional sports networks, big sports networks and re-trans, which is driven mostly by sports, sports has been effectively hyperextended here to the point of are you serious. And so that's the marketplace that the consumers are dealing with. And it's one of the reasons why we believe that the market is down 3%, because the cost of entry, 65% of the entry level market in Mexico is the skinny bundle and you're in for $15.","In Brazil, 90% of the growth in the last four years has been the skinny bundle. And then, in every other market, you could then get your sports to your ticket. And so I think it's that combination. Look, one of the reasons we went to Eurosport was because it's very early stage in Europe, it hasn't been done before, and we said that's a pretty compelling concept of being able to use sports to drive subscriber costs and get subscriber fees going. And it has done that for us. It's obviously on a scale that's much lower. But I don't think it's sustainable.","I don't think it's sustainable really because the ecosystem is getting much creakier here, not because the ecosystem is creaky around the world. It's strong enough with people wanting to buy content and get packages of content, to be more in the stable environment, which is what we see everywhere else. Here, there's just not an entry level package. The good news is in almost every case, what consumers want eventually collapses against what larger companies leverage into the market. And what you're starting to see now is distributors saying, well, wait a minute. We're losing subscribers. Maybe we should do a skinny bundle. And we're lucky to have over-the-top at this point because most of those providers that are packaging in all of that extra stuff have agreements that require all that stuff to be carried, but those agreements do not extend to over-the-top.","And so you're likely to see the breakup in over-the-top and then it'll accelerate back as consumers start to buy broadband and an over-the-top service without sport. And then the distributors will be forced to take the hit, the big sports guys, we will be forced to take the hit in the next round.","And so I think it's not likely to change on linear, except marginally. There's requirements for carriage and some of the sport services have lower requirements so you might see some skinny bundles on linear, but they'll be more limited. The bigger attack, I think, for consumers that'll be quite effective for consumers and \u2013 right now if you have broadband, the only real choice in America is Netflix. And then you can get your Amazon. And that's really silly. If there's 40 million broadband-only subscribers and they go to college and they want to buy something, they buy Netflix. Why do they buy Netflix? Because they don't have anything \u2013 there's not anything meaningful that we're offering them in the market. And so I think that we're working to remediate that and so are some others and I think it will happen. It's going to take some time.","Jason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Very helpful. Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Todd Juenger of Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open.","Todd Michael Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Oh, hi. Good morning. Thanks. I got a couple just housekeeping for Gunnar and then David, boy, I'd love to just pick up on that great discussion you just had with Jason. Gunnar, just super quickly, two on affiliate fees. So on domestic affiliate fees, I'm sorry if I missed this. Just wonder if you'd give us a number without the content licensing, so just sort of a clean distribution affiliate fee number for the quarter. And any comments on the ins and outs of licensing sort of next quarter or forward would be great. And also where did that licensing go I wonder? Because I don't know \u2013 in the states, I know you're not licensing I think to the SVOD player, so if you're willing to say that, that'd be great.","The other quick one, sorry, I promise it's quick. On International, I think you guys had indicated double-digit constant currency International affiliate fees for the year. I just wonder if you still feel that way. Okay.","And then David, just sort of picking up, I can't help. It's such an important topic and you're sharing some thoughts on it. On this sort of skinny non-sports bundle, you did mention that your traditional distribution agreements, you're sort of through the cycle there. What are the implications, if any, if you were to team up and launch some sort of over-the-top non-sports package on your existing distribution agreements with your NVBDs as they exist and maybe even if you think about the next cycle, how can you go ask for pricing increases from the cable companies if you have a low priced over-the-top option for consumers? Thanks for bearing with that guys. Appreciate it.","David M. Zaslav - Discovery Communications, Inc.","I'll just answer the last one. We have no restrictions so we can do. And it's already being done. I mean, YouTube is an offering that's in the marketplace. Hulu has an offering that's in the marketplace. Philo has an offering that's going to be in the marketplace. DIRECTTV NOW is an offering that's in the marketplace. So I think you're starting to see some additional offers in the marketplace. And we're agnostic. We would do an over-the-top direct with a bunch of others in a package. We would do an over-the-top with the existing cable operators. We would do an over-the-top with existing mobile or satellite providers. And you're going to see, as there's subscriber decline, a lot of them are trying to figure out what could we do to serve customers? They're looking at that decline and saying, hey, I don't like that. Why is Netflix gaining and why are we losing? Is there a product that we can offer?","And in the end, as we face customers, we had this discussion last time. I don't think anything has changed. Our channels are stronger now than they were a year ago. We think one of the things that helps us with Scripps is we getting even more strength with a lot more channels that are very important. We then have five channels that people would rate as either their most important or their second most important channel that they watch and care about in terms of length of view, including the broadcasters.","And when you put us together with Scripps, we might be 20% of the view, but we're only about 7.5% or 8% of the money. And so that's not something to brag about, but it does mean that we're not getting paid a lot of money. And there's an opportunity to pay us more, and is it really worth having an argument over so many good channels when the price increase is a fraction of what you're paying to one regional sports network as an increase for 20 channels?","Gunnar Wiedenfels - Discovery Communications, Inc.","Okay, on domestic affiliate revenue, let me give you some more color. So the Q3 numbers, as you see, are very well in line with the guidance that we've given for the full year of mid single digit. And as you heard, I also reiterated that guidance for the full year. So that's still the best estimate that we have.","In terms of those content licensing revenues, you know that we do not single out individual contributions to the distribution line. As we have said previously, those content licensing deals are small in the greater scheme of things, but as I said, we have seen a bit more often impact in the third quarter. That's why we pointed it out specifically.","In terms of who we're selling to, you will find some of ours stuff on Hulu. And we also do very selective deals with Netflix. So for example in the case of a miniseries where we might get a lot of value from Netflix, we're fine to engage in a deal like that. But again, that's always going to be a very careful decision that we're making.","And as the landscape evolves, this type of deal is just going to be a more common part of our distribution strategy of monetization. So as we said previously, we will see more of these SVOD revenues come through. And by nature, they are slightly more lumpy than the very simple subscriber number times ARPU kind of business and the very traditional linear distribution. But again, I mean it's a small component and the way to think about it from a sort of linear perspective, again, as we have said previously, in the last cycle we were able to secure high single-digit CAGRs on the pricing side for our deals. And that's still valid and then obviously, our subscriber loss numbers work against this.","David M. Zaslav - Discovery Communications, Inc.","The other side of our strategy of investing more in IP and owning more windows is we are quite strategically selective about how we monetize it. We could be doing a broad package to some of those SVOD providers, and you could see a very different result this year and next year. But we've opted not to do that, and we're holding onto it. We think it could be much more compelling in our own offering or much more compelling to do something with an existing player and us in an offering. And we view it as building terminal value.","Gunnar Wiedenfels - Discovery Communications, Inc.","And then on D&I affiliate, as I said during my speech, so we've seen a 9% underlying growth in the third quarter. And we also guide for slightly below 10% for the full year. If you look at the individual contributions to that growth, we continue to see healthy double digit growth in Europe with a lot of success on the sports side. What has not come through as we had hoped it would is recovery in Latin America. We had planned for a bit of positive support there in the second half, which just hasn't happened yet and we're not anticipating that anymore in our planning. And we've also had a slight negative headwind in Asia with a few renewals recently. So now the outlook is just below that 10% guidance that we had given previously. And then there's also been a bit of an impact from the natural disasters that we've seen and that's why we just wanted to be slightly more conservative as we look forward now.","Todd Michael Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thanks. Yes, great.","Operator","Thank you. Okay. And the next question is from Alexia Quadrani of JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Thank you. I might switch gears to the advertising side. You've seen some good ratings momentum, some improvement at some of your key networks, which I think you highlighted like TLC and Discovery and ID. And I was wondering if you have good inventory still available to monetize that in the scatter market? Are you somewhat constrained by make-goods? And just any color in general about the health of the scatter market, what you're currently seeing in the market.","David M. Zaslav - Discovery Communications, Inc.","Great, thanks. The scatter market, the volume is good. The pricing is above upfront, but slightly below what pricing was on scatter last year. So we could use a little bit more of a push on pricing. We don't have a make-good issue in any meaningful way. And in fact, the fact that TLC is up, I mean, it was the number 12 network for women. It's now the number six network; it's up 15%, has helped us. ID continues to grow and Discovery has really stabilized.","The upfront was quite good for us. We did well and we sold a little deeper than we normally would. We got a little bit of a strategic sense that there might be some of the scatter market money moving to the upfront, and so we took a little bit more of what we thought was good money to hedge our risk that if \u2013 at this point, volume is up, but if volume next year drops a little bit, we thought it made sense to take a little more dollars. So it was quite good for us.","Gunnar Wiedenfels - Discovery Communications, Inc.","And Alexia, as I said, going into the fourth quarter, we see similar low single digit growth for the U.S. ad number for us.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And then just a quick follow-up on your networks here, you talked about how you're seeing obviously much better subscriber trends in your core networks, in terms of the rate of decline and the fact that there are a little bit higher declines in some of your non-core networks and your smaller networks. Does that influence the way you think about your investment spending ahead? I mean, are you likely to just sort of reallocate a bit more of your investment spending to some of your bigger networks?","Gunnar Wiedenfels - Discovery Communications, Inc.","I think generically yes, and we've already been doing that. We did it in our deals where the overwhelming majority of economics in our deals are to our big six networks. There's some exceptions. We have Velocity, and Velocity is a very compelling superfan network. We did something quite creative. We put the channel together with the direct-to-consumer business, together with the 30 titles of magazine titles. We didn't actually buy the magazine business, but all the editorial, the pictures, all the short-form content that was being generated around cars, and all the IP that we have on Velocity, the library, the car content as well as the live auctions is all in this new basket that we call Motor Trend OnDemand. And so you'd see that at the top and below would be Velocity, this cable channel that's in 60 million homes that's quite profitable that has real superfans. And we can move that IP now between that and Motor Trend OnDemand.","And then we have all of these great writers, and we have all of this short-form video and these terrific 30 brands that we get to use as well as lists that go along with the magazines to drive this direct-to-consumer business that we start with about 100,000, little less than 100,000 subscribers paying $5 a month. So it's an experiment. What happens when you take a huge auto library together with a dominant position in auto, live auto auctions together with 30 titles of auto enthusiast material, together with editorial in short-form?","We were enthusiastic about the fact they have almost 100,000 subscribers without any long-form content and any real promotion and any live auctions. And so this is part of our strategy of building a direct-to-consumer business as a side-by-side. On the other hand, we have some smaller channels that don't have as big of an audience, and we already started that cascade of investing less and focusing more on our core brands that we think are sustainable on linear and sustainable on mobile and sustainable globally.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And the last question will come from Michael Nathanson of MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.","Michael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC","Thanks. I have two for David. Can I go back to the non-core versus big six change in distribution? Is the fall of the non-core channels a function of maybe those platforms falling? Or the fact that perhaps you guys had maybe loosened up some of the minimums and traded that loosening for better pricing? So you talk a bit about, was this a self-planned type of erosion of the non-core sites?","David M. Zaslav - Discovery Communications, Inc.","No. It's actually, I think you could just say it's shaving. It's basically somebody that would be paying $130 for cable. It's saying for those extra 30 channels, I'll save the extra $14. It's not being tiered. It's just somebody looking at the very high price of that and broadband being expensive and saying, do I absolutely need that.","Michael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC","Okay. Okay, that makes sense. And then, you haven't talked about Sling at all, which seems like a pretty good fit given their pricing and given their tiering. Is Sling a function of you having to get a dish deal done or can Sling be done outside of a normal linear deal being done?","David M. Zaslav - Discovery Communications, Inc.","I don't want to speak to this specific. I think Sling is an effective platform. I think Charlie's attacking the very issue that I talked about earlier. And I think he's one of the people that's being innovative along with almost every other distributor that's looking at an industry in secular decline and asking themself the question, have I agreed to do two agreements that are restricting my ability to serve customers, and am I driving customers to Netflix or driving customers away from my platform?","And for us, I think, eventually, we'll probably be on those platforms, because as I've said that, if you look at all the recent studies, at the very top of the list, we have six channels that are either equal to broadcast or just behind it or ahead. And the cost of all of our content is significantly less than one retrans channel.","And so I think we have a great value to consumer argument. I think getting more aggregation, when we close Scripps, gives us even more quality viewers and more versatility and optionality. And over time, we would like to be on every platform. And I think we got a good shot at it if we keep doing a good job programming our channels.","Michael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC","Okay. Thanks, David.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes the program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day."],"7029":["Discovery Communications (NASDAQ:DISCA) Q1 2013 Earnings Call May  7, 2013  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Craig Felenstein","David M.

My name is Allison, and I'll be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded for replay purposes. I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Craig Felenstein, Executive Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.","Craig Felenstein","Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for Discovery Communications' 2013 First Quarter Earnings Call.","Joining me today is David Zaslav, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Andy Warren, our Chief Financial Officer. You should have received our earnings release. But if not, feel free to access it on our website at www.discoverycommunications.com.","On today's call, we will begin with some opening comments from David and Andy, after which, we will open the call up for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Before we start, I would like to remind you that comments today regarding the company's future business plans, prospects and financial performance are forward-looking statements that we make pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are made based on management's current knowledge and assumptions about future events, and they involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations.","In providing projections and other forward-looking statements, the company disclaims any intent or obligation to update them. For additional information on important factors that could affect these expectations, please see our annual report for the year ended December 31, 2012 and our subsequent filings made with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.","And with that, I would like to turn the call over to David.","David M. Zaslav","Thank you, Craig. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Discovery is off to another great start in 2013, building on the sustained operating momentum we generated across our balanced portfolio throughout 2012.","Our unwavering belief that investing in high-quality content with real stakes, superior storytelling and compelling characters is paramount to long-term value creation continues to pay off. The larger audiences we are delivering around the world are translating into significant advertising gains, while at the same time, the appeal of our content is providing additional opportunities to capitalize on our diverse distribution platform and the further evolution of the global pay television market.","As we focus on capturing market share and maximizing the full organic growth potential inherent in our asset portfolio, we're also beginning to dig into the operations of our recent acquisitions, so we can create additional value and further strengthen our long-term sustainable growth profile.","With our strong market share growth and the recent acquisitions, we now reach more than 2 billion subscribers, up from 1.8 billion last year.","Before I turn the call over to Andy, so he can take you through our financial results, let me take a few minutes to discuss a few of the initiatives driving our strong organic growth, as well as some of the opportunities we expect to focus on as we integrate our newly acquired businesses.","I mentioned on our year-end call that we have delivered 4 consecutive years of viewership growth across our domestic portfolio, and that momentum has certainly continued into 2013 as we delivered the best first quarter in the company's history. Viewership across our U.S. Networks was up 3% this past quarter among key adult 25 to 54 demo, led by the growth at our flagship network, the Discovery Channel.","Discovery built upon its record fourth quarter with 10% growth in Q1, led by Gold Rush, Bering Sea Gold and Yukon Men, all of which contributed to  Discovery's #1 ranking on Friday nights in the quarter, outpacing even the broadcast networks.","Several of our other networks also delivered meaningful growth this past quarter, including Animal Planet, which increased its audience another 6%, building upon the 17% growth it generated in 2012 and making it a top 20 network for men in the U.S. In fact, Animal Planet has now delivered 16 consecutive months of growth. Among its key demo and with returning hits like River Monsters capturing more viewers than it did a year ago, the network is poised for continued success.","Two of our recently re-branded networks are also continuing to show real audience gains. Destination America is quickly becoming a lifestyle destination for viewers, with double-digit growth this past quarter, following its 35% growth in 2012. And Velocity, while in only 45 million homes, grew its viewership by over 50% year-on-year, delivering a highly coveted upscale audience to our advertisers.","Driving the potential of our valuable distribution real estate by investing in new brands and breaking new ground that ignites viewers' curiosity remains a priority, and we will continue to invest incrementally in these new networks if they demonstrate the ability to attract larger audiences and deliver real value to our advertisers.","Similarly, our domestic joint ventures are also continuing to develop their audiences. The Hub was up over 50% this past quarter among kids 2 to 11 for total day. Separately, OWN viewership was up 3% in its key women 25 to 54 demo despite the difficult comparisons to a year ago, which included the highest viewed program in the network's history, Oprah's interview with Whitney Houston's daughter.","OWN's viewership momentum ratcheted up again in April as viewership grew 9%, led by returning favorite, Iyanla: Fix My Life, and new hits such us Life with La Toya and Raising Whitley. In fact, these 3 series helped propel OWN to a top 10 ranking among all cable networks for the month on Saturday nights in its key women 25 to 54 demo, and #1 in African-American women, including the broadcasters. And that is without Oprah on Saturday. It's a great achievement. Looking forward, OWN has a great slate of new content scheduled for the remainder of the year, including 2 new series from our partner, Tyler Perry, set to launch at the end of May, and they both look strong. Tyler has been working very hard down in Atlanta to bring us 2 great new series.","We are very confident we will reach our previously stated goal of cash flow breakeven during the second half of this year. The ratings momentum we are generating across our portfolio and the sustained health of the ad market have not only give us a terrific start to 2013, but it also puts us in a great position heading into what we hope will be a robust upfront.","We recently completed our upfront presentations to advertisers. And while it is too early to predict where we ultimately will end up, with strong scatter volumes, scatter pricing well above last year's upfront, sustained ratings momentum across our networks, from what I think is unquestionably the best ad sales team in the business, we expect to see significant increases in this year's upfront.","The market share and sustained financial growth we are seeing domestically is playing out even more dramatically internationally, where we have made targeted content investments to capitalize on our unparalleled distribution platform and the further penetration of pay television.","We are certainly benefiting from our expanding subscriber base, with overall subs up 12% versus a year ago, led by Latin America as well as India and Russia. But we are also driving viewership with a more robust content offering due to the global investment we have made over the last several years.","We've worked hard to capitalize on opportunities that our broad distribution provides, whether it is expanding the reach of our female flagship, TLC, now in 160 countries, including the U.K. as of April 30, and 300 million homes, making TLC the most distributed women's TV brand in the world; or capitalizing on the global demand for investigative and forensic content by broadening ID's reach to over 150 countries in just the last 12 months; or by recognizing the opportunity for kids programming across Asia and leveraging our top-rated channel in Brazil, Discovery Kids.","The combination of a stronger programming portfolio, along with double-digit subscriber growth, resulted in overall viewership growth of 16% across our international portfolio. And this expansion is not confined to one geographic area. We generated double-digit increases across nearly every region, led by Italy and Spain in Western Europe, Mexico and Brazil in Latin America, and Russia and South Africa in our CEEMEA region.","The success we have had in growing our audiences speaks to the local market experience we have gained from operating in many of these markets for nearly 25 years. And we are now utilizing that knowledge base to help drive real synergies from our recent transactions.","Having launched our first international network in the Nordic region over 2 decades ago, we have deep-rooted experience in these countries. Aside from having built a broad distribution base, we have fostered brand loyalty and developed the critical relationships that come from working in local markets for many, many years.","The networks we acquired from SBS are also extremely well positioned and provide an excellent complement to our nonfiction channels in terms of genre appeal and demographic reach. Combined, the newly created SBS Discovery Media business in the Nordics has significant market power. The acquisition closed last month, and I was in Norway, Denmark, Sweden and Finland last week. And we are already exploring ways to expand our content portfolio and take significant advantage of the attractive consumer demographics these networks deliver.","On the revenue side, we have met with advertisers throughout the region, and it is readily apparent that the depth and quality of our content portfolio will enable us to drive ad revenues across these platforms over time. And on the core side, we are already seeing the benefit of promoting Discovery's wide range of programming across the reach of our newly acquired content assets. We have also begun to deliver on the opportunities associated with owning a 20% interest in Eurosport Group, including the creation of a joint affiliate sales organization to capitalize on the local distribution relationships Discovery has established over the last 20 years.","Similarly, in a number of markets, we are starting to explore how Discovery's local ad sales knowledge can provide a rich complement to Eurosport's almost solely pan-European sales capability. The good news is, we are just beginning to scratch the surface of the benefits associated with these new assets. And we're confident that we will further strengthen the tremendous platform Discovery has built over the last 2 decades.","It's important to note that our international organic growth story remains totally intact. And these transactions further bolster our long-term outlook by deepening our geographic footprint, broadening our portfolio with new networks and brands and enhancing our creative pipeline with new talent, personalities and formats.","Overall, Discovery is off to another strong start in 2013. And given the market share we are capturing worldwide, the organic growth opportunities across our global distribution platform and the synergies we expect to exploit due to our recent acquisitions, we fully expect to build on our momentum for the foreseeable future.","And now, let me turn the call over to Andy.","Andrew C. Warren","Thanks, David, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. As David mentioned, Discovery is off to a great start to the year, building upon the strong results we delivered throughout 2012 as we leverage both the large audiences that we're generating around the globe, as well as our increasing international subscriber base.","On a reported basis, total company revenue in the first quarter increased 7%, led by 17% international growth and 1% domestic growth. Note that domestically, the prior year included $45 million of additional licensing revenue primarily related to our licensing deal with Amazon. Excluding licensing revenue and the impact of foreign currency, the total company revenue growth was 12%, with double-digit gains in both advertising and affiliate revenue.","Total operating expenses on a reported basis increased 14%, primarily due to higher content amortization that we have previously discussed. The current quarter also included a onetime compensation expense, as well as additional duty-related costs associated with our acquisition of the SBS Nordic business. Eliminating $8 million of licensing costs in the prior year and the impact from foreign currency movements, total company expenses increased 13% versus the first quarter last year.","Importantly, given the higher content amortization and the timing of anticipated marketing spend, it is expected that operating expense growth excluding the impact of wholly-owned acquisitions will remain in the mid-teen range for the next 2 quarters before meaningfully abating in Q4.","On a reported basis, adjusted OIBDA in the first quarter declined slightly. But excluding the licensing agreements and the impact of foreign exchange, Discovery's continued ability to generate revenue growth in excess of expenses translated into an 8% increase in adjusted OIBDA for the quarter.","Net income from continuing operations increased to $231 million in the first quarter, driven by the strong operating performance, as well as the $92 million gain associated with raising our ownership interest in Discovery Japan to 80%.","The quarter also included $46 million of higher equity earnings, primarily due to significantly improved results at OWN. These items were partially offset by $59 million of losses associated with foreign exchange contracts implemented to hedge the purchase of SBS Nordic, $21 million of higher mark-to-market equity-based compensation due to the increase in the stock price and $26 million of higher tax expense.","As I mentioned last quarter, we are in the process of restructuring our international operations to ultimately lower our effective tax rate over time. But the current year, we still anticipate an ETR of around 38%.","Free cash flow decreased to $105 million in the first quarter, primarily due to higher content investment, as well as increased equity compensation payments and the timing of cash taxes. The programming spend continues to pay off in terms of ratings momentum and higher advertising revenue, but we still anticipate content spend growth to slow down considerably for the full year, which should contribute to significant free cash flow growth for 2013.","Turning now to the operating units. The U.S. Networks continued to perform well during the first quarter. On a reported basis, total domestic revenue increased only 1%, as 8% advertising revenue growth from viewership gains across our portfolio and a favorable ad sales pricing and demand environment were partially offset by 9% lower affiliate revenue due to the additional $45 million of licensing revenue in last year's first quarter that I spoke about earlier.","Excluding licensing revenue, total domestic revenue improved 8% versus a year ago, with affiliate revenue increasing 6% due to higher rates and to a lesser extent, additional digital subscribers.","It is important to note, though our licensing revenues were down in the first quarter, we do anticipate a meaningful increase in either the second or third quarters due to the third year of the Netflix agreement.","Current ad market trends continue to be encouraging, with double-digit scatter pricing, above the gains that we garnered during last year's upfront negotiations. We have some nice ratings momentum across many of our networks. With the healthy macro environment continuing, we anticipate continued high single-digit ad growth in the second quarter of 2013.","Turning to the cost side. Domestic operating expenses were up 8% from the first quarter 2012, which included $8 million of additional costs associated with digital licensing agreements. Excluding these costs, operating expenses increased 11% compared to a year ago, primarily due to the expected higher content amortization associated with the increased programming cash spend over the past 2 years.","On a reported basis, domestic adjusted OIBDA declined 5% versus last year's first quarter. But excluding the impact of licensing agreements, adjusted OIBDA increased 6% year-on-year.","Turning now to our international operations. We continue to deliver strong momentum across our global operations, with reported revenues expanding 17%, led by 23% ad and 15% affiliate growth. Excluding the impact of exchange rates as well as additional advertising sales from the acquisitions of wholly-owned businesses, total revenue growth was 16%, with advertising and affiliate revenues increasing 17% and 15%, respectively.","The advertising revenue growth was broad-based, with double-digit growth across nearly every region, led by Western Europe, mainly from the continued success of several of our free-to-air initiatives, particularly in Italy and Spain.","On the affiliate front, the revenue increase was driven by subscriber growth, especially in Latin America, from the continued growth in Brazil and Mexico, as well as from the consolidation of Discovery Japan.","Operating costs internationally were up 24% on a reported basis. Excluding costs in the acquisitions of wholly-owned businesses and the impact of foreign exchange, operating expense growth was up 17%, primarily driven by the anticipated increase in content amortization, as well as from the consolidation of Discovery Japan.","Our international segment delivered 13% adjusted OIBDA growth in the first quarter excluding foreign currency and the impact of acquiring wholly-owned businesses, as our international team continued to generate strong revenue increases while thoughtfully investing in key growth initiatives.","Before we look forward to the remainder of 2013, I do want to mention that the first quarter also included a couple onetime corporate costs related to compensation and the SBS transaction, which we closed at the beginning of April this year.","Turning to the full year, we are encouraged by the sustained momentum across the portfolio and the continued strong ad sales pricing and demand environment in many of our key markets. As a result, we were leaving our guidance unchanged despite the SBS transaction closing over 1 month later than originally planned.","For the full year 2013, we still expect total revenues to be between $5.575 billion and $5.7 billion, adjusted OIBDA between $2.425 billion and $2.525 billion and an income between $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion. Given the delayed timing of the SBS close, it is now less likely that we will be towards the top end of these ranges, but given the momentum across our businesses, these ranges remain possible outcomes. We do anticipate narrowing these guidance ranges on our second quarter earnings call.","Turning to our financial position. With a strong balance sheet and continued financial and operating momentum, we remain committed to further building our core businesses so that we can drive additional long-term growth and enhance shareholder returns, be it through investing in existing networks and platforms or through exploring external initiatives.","While that is our first priority, given the strong free cash flow that we are generating, our gross leverage targets and our long-range free cash flow per share growth assumptions, we have the unique opportunity to both continue returning capital to shareholders and also investing in our businesses.","As previously discussed, given the capital needs associated with the timing and closing of the SBS transaction, we did not begin buying back shares this year until the second quarter. But we still anticipate returning similar amounts of capital to shareholders through buybacks in 2013 that we did in 2012.","Our buyback activity during the second quarter includes $256 million of preferred stock associated with the advanced Newhouse transaction that we announced last quarter, which is part of the total anticipated share repurchases this year but was not done under the existing $4 billion authorized share repurchase plan.","Since we began buying back shares towards the end of 2010, we have spent over $3 billion buying back shares, reducing the outstanding share count by over 78 million shares or 18%.","Thanks again for your time this morning. Now David and I will be happy to answer any questions that you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of David Bank of RBC Capital Markets.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Two questions, I guess the first is under the category of no good deed goes unpunished. 8% ad revenue growth is obviously really strong, but when you think about the pricing you achieved in the upfront, the pricing in the scatter market, the ratings momentum you've achieved, I'm kind of curious, like, what are the other factors that are sort of arguably maybe holding back that ad revenue from being a little bit stronger given all those factors? And the second question is, I guess more for Andy, can you just clarify the impact of the Japan consolidation on both the revenue and expenses in the international division?","David M. Zaslav","Great. Thanks, David. Well, we delivered a little over 8% this quarter, which we felt very good about. We had market share growth of 3%. The market was strong, it was up about 20% from the upfront. But we also began seeding a number of our new networks with advertisers, and we still have a ways to go in terms of bringing up the CPM on some channels like Animal Planet, that's now a top 20 channel for men; ID, that's the #9 channel in America and continues to grow. So it's going to -- we'll continue to get some additional growth out of that. This quarter continues to look strong, maybe even a little bit stronger than last quarter in terms of pricing. So if we continue to grow our market share, I think you'll see us in the high single, low double in domestic.","Andrew C. Warren","Okay. And David, just to add to that, just remember, last year, U.S. ad sales was up 13%. So on a 2-year basis, it's tremendous year-over-year growth. And to answer your question about Japan, we're not actually separating or splitting it out separately or quantifying it because it is a business we were in before with 50% investment, and we only increased that to 80%. So on a very bottom line basis, it's a fairly de minimis impact. But broadly speaking, as far as the impact on revenue and expenses, for the whole company, it's less than 1 point. So I'd just give you a sense of its size, it's relatively insignificant on a total company basis.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So you wouldn't say it really impacted international operations then, is that...","Andrew C. Warren","Well, it is consolidated within those numbers, but the impact is fairly small. As I said, it's really less than 1 point for the total company on both revenue, expense and profit.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Todd Juenger of Sanford Bernstein.","Todd Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","If I could follow up just a little bit back to domestic ad growth. I know you don't -- and I'm not expecting that you would disclose anything sort of at a network level, but I wondered if you just would share any comments about sort of the difference between what I'd call the flagship networks versus your digital tier networks. A lot of the ratings growth, as you pointed out, is coming from the digital tier networks. We know they have lower CPMs. I just wonder, when you think about the whole growth of 8%, would you be willing to characterize sort of was the mid-tier networks growing sort of faster than that and the flagship networks growing slower, or any way you can help us decompose how we think about the growth rates of those different life cycles of networks?","David M. Zaslav","Sure, thanks, Todd. First, Discovery had a good quarter. It was up about 10%, which was very strong, with a lot of new series. And Discovery's mostly male, and we were able to take advantage of that. TLC was down about 1% or essentially flat. The industry itself was down 2%, so TLC did a little bit better than the industry, but we had less premieres in the first quarter. We're coming back with Long Island Medium, we're coming back with Breaking Amish in the summer, Honey Boo Boo will come in. So I think that we expect that we'll see a little bit more momentum on the women's side with TLC. I think that would have helped us. The broadcasters were down significantly in prime and in daytime, and that put a little bit of a squeeze on the women's side. And so we were able to take advantage of that with TLC, but not as much as we would have liked to, and we're hoping to in this next quarter. ID continued to grow because of that. And when you say digital networks, we have TLC and Discovery that are fully distributed. But we also have Animal Planet that's fully distributed. And Animal Planet now is a top 20 network. It's going to take us some time in order to get our CPM up, but we're getting double growth there. It's growing significantly, but also our CPM is growing. So that is a fully distributed network. And when you say digital, we now have ID in over 80 million homes. So 80 million homes, the #9 network in America, #6 network in daytime, #5 in late night, yet we're still not getting the full premium for that. So those would be what I would call kind of our big networks, with Animal Planet and ID providing some meaningful growth no matter what over the next couple of years. And then the smaller networks, one -- we call them emerging because they're continuing to be very fast-growing, but Destination America, Velocity, those do have lower CPMs. And when I said we're seeding, we're trying to get advertisers into them, so they could feel the value of being on those platforms. They could see that we can put up some very strong ratings when we have original content. And once we get them hooked into those channels, we'll be able to drive the CPM on that. So I can't really break it out except to say that I think if we can drive a little bit more of our female demo in the next 6 months, given where a lot of the viewership and advertisers are looking for female, we could maybe over-index more.","Todd Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","That's very helpful. A quick follow-up, if you don't mind. Back to the -- on the emerging networks, in terms of distribution growth, and there's been a lot of focus on affiliate fees and reset of your negotiations, all that, what is the opportunity there? You've got ratings up strongly at a lot of these emerging networks. You've invested a lot to re-brand a few of them. How real is the opportunity to grow the distribution further, some of those that are in 40 million, 50 million, 60 million homes?","David M. Zaslav","Well, we redid only a few of our deals this year. We've talked about the fact that they feather in over the next 5 years. This year was less than 20%, a little bit more than 10%. So it was a lesser percentage, but we were able to get higher increases in those deals. We were able to get more distribution for Science, more distribution for Destination America, more distribution for Military. So when we can pick up higher fees and get more distribution, that's a formula that works very well for us because we get the guaranteed revenue on that extra distribution. But also, we had 2 of the -- 3 of the fastest-growing cable networks in America over the last 3 years has been ID, which has gone from 50 to over 80; Science, which went from 45 to over 72; and Velocity continues to grow aggressively. So if we can get the per sub fees on that, then not only do we get the guaranteed economics, we get the asset value and the ability to get advertising. So we will be looking for that in addition to the very simple what is our actual CAGR on our total sub fee base.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Doug Mitchelson of Deutsche Bank.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I was trying to get to that CAGR on your total sub base. So I wanted to make sure I had the math correct around the domestic affiliate renewals. In the fourth quarter, you had $288 million of domestic affiliate revenue and in the first quarter, you had $308 million, so that's $20 million of growth in 1Q versus 4Q, so that's 6.9%. And in theory, your sub base is, between the 2 quarters, should have been relatively similar and that should have been mostly price. So am I thinking about that right? Did your renewals drive that kind of price acceleration, or is there something unusual on either one of those quarters that hampers the comparison?","David M. Zaslav","Well, our renewals, as I've said, it's -- we did very well. But in terms of the percentage, it would bring it up. It wouldn't bring it up dramatically because in terms of the scale of deals that we did, the number of subs that were under it were not that significant. There would also be in there, Doug, some additional digital. We have deals where every time a digital box is deployed, every operator has to carry every one of our channels and has to pay us on those channels, but that's been true every quarter. And we -- to your point, we really haven't seen any better sub growth this quarter than we've seen last. In fact, it's pretty flat. So kind of agree with you.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And then on the -- there's a little bit of a lag, right, when you cut a new deal with your distributors and you improve the distribution of some of your digital channels by moving them to more broadly distributed tiers. And maybe the Nielsen data lags, but we sort of show some of that take up happening in April versus the year-end deal timing. Is that right or is the Nielsen data just lag in the take up to immediate?","David M. Zaslav","I think there's a little lag, but the deals don't necessarily mean that we closed the deal at the end of December and they have to launch January 1. In fact, they can't. There's a 60-day requirement. That's pretty standard under the franchise rules where they have to notify customers of what's coming. So the actual launch of more subscribers for our channels would have happened, at the very earliest, 60 days afterward. And sometimes it's really just a commitment to launch the channels during the year for a longer -- when deals are 4 or 5 years long. So that -- you'll see it coming in.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So there could be a little bit of tail to it, because I know relative to international growth you're seeing, we're sort of parsing basis points, but we're still curious.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne of Morgan Stanley.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I just have one sort of housekeeping for Andy, then a question for David. Andy, the net income guidance, that includes all of the below-the-line stuff this quarter, all the good and the bad guys, right?","Andrew C. Warren","Correct.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, great. David, just picking up on this advertising theme, you've been in the broadcast replacement game for a long time, taking share from the networks. And I'd imagine you think that there's a lot left to do there. So I'd be curious on that first topic. But then when you think about online video, do you see any analogy in online video, whether it's YouTube or some of the assets you've acquired, and television to what the cable business was facing 20 years ago looking at broadcast? How real of a threat or an opportunity do you view online video as an advertising business over the next, say, 3 to 5 years?","David M. Zaslav","Thanks, Ben. Okay, on the CPM, the CPM differential between broadcast and cable remains a little over 30%. And that's really good news for us. In the U.S. market, where subscribers are flat and viewership on cable is flat, that provides real wind at our back, and that applies to all of us, and particularly, if we can grow market share and continue to push on CPM. And the story on compressing that CPM, I think, is getting stronger, because the amount of rate -- the rating points that we're able to deliver, not just us, like on a Friday night where we're the #1 network, beating the broadcasters, on OWN when Oprah can put on content, and she's the #1 network for African-American women, beating all the broadcasters, those stories are -- we have a huge number of those stories where 5 or 6 years ago that didn't exist. The scale of viewership on cable is higher. The demo of viewership on cable is stronger. And so I think it's going to take time, probably 3 or 4 years. It'll never be even, but we'll get that pick up and that, I think, will continue to be a benefit for the U.S. business. On the online side, the CPMs that we're getting on stream video, on the Web, are quite high. And we've actually been shifting aggressively away from the page view and the unique approach that many of us in this business took. So we had aggregated over 60 million uniques with a gazillion page views, but with Google and Facebook out there, it kind of really commoditized in some ways the ability to sell on those pages. And we still do it, but the prices are not rising. If anything, they're going down. And so we have really pivoted aggressively towards streaming. We bought a company called Revision3. It's the #1 nonfiction streaming company in the world. They were doing about 150 million streams a month when we bought them. They're now 300 million streams. JB Perrette, who runs our business, has been pushing our streaming business across every one of our brands. We launched 12 live streaming channels of live puppy cams and young animals across -- on Animal Planet about 6 weeks ago, and they're doing very well. And so our #1 focus in terms of the digital business right now is on the streaming side because the CPMs are quite strong. Having said that, it's not clear where it's going to go. So we're playing in this space. We want to learn everything about it. We want to continue to look at consumer behavior. But it's confusing right now. People are still watching more TV than they ever have. We're able to grow market share in the U.S. pretty significantly over the last couple of years, including this past quarter where we're up 3%. Last year, where we were up 8%. Outside the U.S., we're growing market share dramatically. And so we're really playing both ends. Let's do a great job at telling stories and building characters and building our brands, and let's assume nothing is going on. And then let's have an aggressive team, taking our content and our characters on the Web and also through Rev3, doing content a different way, and I think it's going to be a couple of years before we really see what happens.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Michael Nathanson of Nomura.","Michael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","I have one for David and one for Andy. David, let me ask a question. When you look at what Netflix is done with their agreement with A&E, kind of they couldn't come to an agreement with A&E a little while ago. And Viacom, they kind of changed their mind and tried to buy shows rather than an output deal. I wonder how are you thinking about your relationship with Netflix and how should we think about what's going to happen when it expires? So just your view on that.","David M. Zaslav","Okay, thanks, Michael. When you step back, and I've said this before, but as we look at all the people that are knocking on our door now for content, for the next couple of years, I think there's never been a better time to be in this business than right now. We own all of our content, which makes us somewhat unique. Our content works around the world, which makes us unique. And there's more people that want it for more windows. So in the window you're talking about, we got Amazon and we got Netflix, we're stronger now I think because 5 years ago, we had 4% of the viewership on cable, today, we have 10%. We have brands that are stronger. We have a lot of good content. We're going to take our third year option on Netflix because we've seen no degradation in audience. And that's, I think, significant incremental margin for us with Amazon and with Netflix because they're buying content that's mostly 18 months and older, some of it, 2, 3, 4 years old. Our relationship is good. They like our content. We like this window. Our deal doesn't come up for almost another 1.5 years. When it does come up with Amazon and with Netflix, we think we'll do well as long as we have a lot of really good content that people like. And we also have a big bulk of it. In the end, they still need to nourish people. The idea that Rita said to me a number of times is, they don't have everything, but when people go there, they'll find something good. And we have a lot of good stuff, so I think we'll do well, Michael. In addition, we now have a lot of the cable operators here in the U.S. And BSkyB just launched their SVOD platform, and that's good for us. So you have LOVEFiLM, you have Netflix, and now you have Jeremy Darroch launching his own SVOD platform in the U.K. There's a good chance that's going to happen here. We're talking with a lot of operators, so that's a positive. And then we have TV Everywhere, which is a tighter window, which we haven't done deals yet, but we think we can get significant incremental value for that.","Michael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. And let me turn to Andy for 1 second. You mentioned success in Spain and Italy on the broadcast side, which is pretty amazing given how tough those markets are going on in broadcast advertising. So could you talk a little bit about what's the sales pitch, how you gained those dollars? Is it pricing-led strategy, is it just a low base you're growing from? So anything more on Spain and Italy will be helpful.","David M. Zaslav","Okay. Well, our model when we say free-to-air is really different than a traditional broadcast model because we own all of our content. When we went into Spain, our cost of content is almost 0. We have the content. We have it in language. So we essentially buy a stick and we can put programming on there, and we're able to gain market share. In Italy -- and by the way, Michael, we've now reached a point where we've lapped almost all of our free-to-air channels, so the growth that you're seeing is pretty pure. In addition, in Italy, we're just finding that our content is working fantastic. And the experience we're having there, that's the reason that we went into Spain, where it's very strong. It's the reason that we're finding additional growth in Germany. This model of taking male content and putting it on a male channel, taking female content and putting it on a female channel, and the amount of content that we have to put into those 2 baskets. In Italy, our market share was up 70% on -- with our 2 channels, and that's without Switchover. And with Switchover now, we're the #3 player in Italy, so -- second only to RAI and Mediaset. So we're also getting scale, which will help us with our pricing.","Operator","And your next question comes from Jessica Reif Cohen, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jessica Reif Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I have a couple of questions on the international side. First, on the businesses outside the U.S., what is your channel share versus the audience share? Is there a way for us to think about how your current portfolio is positioned, whether you're over-indexed or under-indexed? And how much room is there to add channels? So that's the first question.","David M. Zaslav","Okay. Well, first, I think that we're sort of -- we're in the beginning stages of trying to take advantage of the fact that we have between 6 and 14 channels in 220 countries. So we're clearly the #1 platform media company in the world. And our challenge, domestically and internationally, was to take advantage of that. We've done a good job here in the U.S., but we have a long way to go. I think you'll see a lot of growth from us here in the U.S. because we still -- we have 14 channels and we only have about 10% share. Outside the U.S., the story is even stronger. We were able to light up TLC around the world, reaching over 300 million homes in 1.5 years. And the growth that we're seeing on TLC around the world continues to be significant. ID, we're rolling out. So we're beginning to take advantage of our channels, Jessica. And I think you're going to see meaningful market share growth. We had 25% market share growth in the fourth quarter. We had 16% market share growth in the first quarter. But I guess to step back, when I look at our international business, it's probably the biggest growth engine and the most compelling story that we have. And right now, we're hitting on all cylinders in a real sustainable fashion. So looking at this past quarter, subs were up 12%; market share, up 16%; ad sales, up 25%; and affiliate revenue, up 15%. So those -- you got all those arrows up. At the same time, when you look at the 220 countries that we're serving locally, more than 2\/3 of those countries are either in recession or flat. And on top of that, we have invested in TLC, ID, taking Kids into Asia, launching new broadcast channels. And when you digest all that investment and the fact that more than 2\/3 of the countries are in recession, we're showing 17% growth and 25% advertising growth, and we're growing share. And so what's most striking to me is we have a sustainable model where we can grow between 15% and 20% in -- when we're dealing in markets that are mostly flat or down. And that's the market condition we're expecting. And with our local teams, one of the things that you've seen is the cost increase. It's because we're putting -- we put local ad sales teams into Colombia, we put a local ad sales team into Italy, that's more investment that we think will pay off with more sustainable growth. The kicker here is, if over the next couple of years things stay exactly the way they are or even if they get a little worse, we think we could show double-digit or certainly sustainable growth the way that you've seen the last 2 quarters for us. The wildcard is, which we're not expecting, is if the marketplace turns, if Western Europe starts to pick up, if a lot of these countries that are flat or in recession turn, and we had been growing 15%, 17%, 18%, that's going to be the real fuel for extraordinary growth for us because we're gaining market share, we got more channels, we got local teams on the ground, and we're growing aggressively in markets that are not good. So to me, that is really -- that's our game.","Jessica Reif Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then I actually have a follow-up to one of your comments, David, on SBS. Can you give us any more color on costs and revenue synergies? Where do you think these margins for the SBS properties can go over time relative to your core international businesses?","David M. Zaslav","Well, specifically, we certainly have cost synergy because we've been in business there for 20 years. We were over there last week. We have different sets of offices. We have -- we're looking at people, we're looking at deliveries, so there will be some meaningful cost synergy. But also, we now have over 40% market share in Norway, with significant broadcast asset, cable assets. So the power ratio of SBS in terms of advertising was a lot higher than our power ratio. So there'll be some revenue synergy in terms of advertising. And we expect that when we go to market together, that there should be real opportunity on the affiliate side. And we're already seeing that there may -- that there's going to be, in addition to that, when you take Eurosport and you lay Eurosport on top of our opportunity universe in those 4 markets, we even have more, whether it's how we sell, whether it's how we bid on content. So we feel like there will be a step back in margins this year as we digest this. But we're very happy with what we saw. It's a great management team. The business is performing very well. It didn't close as quickly as we would have liked, but we're off and running and we're running hard.","Andrew C. Warren","Yes, and just to add to that, Jessica. Even though we only closed SBS 1 month ago and Eurosport now 4 months ago, in both cases in the early stages here, we're very happy with what we see the opportunities for, both revenue and cost synergies. I mean, both are at least at or above our deal expectations. So the early signs are very positive.","Operator","And your next question comes from Richard Greenfield of BTIG.","Richard Greenfield - BTIG, LLC, Research Division","I really wanted to follow up on Jessica's question in terms of kind of not specifically SBS margins, but just the overall international margin. I mean, you were at 45% last year, and if it wasn't for Discovery Japan, I assume you would've been down in the 40% range versus the 41% you reported. Just trying to understand as you look out over the next, call it, several years, if you took a 3- to 4-year view, that 40-ish percent margin is 1,500 basis points behind where your U.S. margin is currently. How do you think about where international margins should be as you get to the scale that you're going to have following this acquisition? I mean, is this 40% to 50% over a 4- or 5-year time frame? Like how do you think about the overall opportunity relative to where your U.S. business runs?","Andrew C. Warren","Yes, Richard, it's Andy. It's a good question. The -- we knew going into this year that SBS, and we stated this, would be about a 500-basis-point dilution to the overall international margin, that plus the content amortization catch up as well. But now that we have a new baseline that we're going to work off of, given the conversation around synergies, given the conversation around infrastructures largely in place international. As David mentioned, we have feet on the ground now in over 50 countries, adding to the sales teams in Colombia and Italy, et cetera. So we now think we can get a lot higher percent of profit flow-through for every incremental dollar, especially as the percent of ad sales becomes higher and higher. So we feel very confident that from this now lower base we've established with the content amort and with SBS, we can meaningful grow margin in 2014 and beyond. It's a huge focus of the international team.","David M. Zaslav","The other thing that you'll see is the situation that we're having with Animal Planet and with ID and that we had with TLC a few years ago, as the channels start to grow, you have to get on the media planners' budget. And you don't get on at a very high rate, you have to build yourself up. And so we've launched a lot of new channels and we've grown a lot of market share outside the U.S. We now have local teams on the ground. And we're seeing meaningful growth. You saw 25% ad growth. But it's even going to get higher because a lot of the channels that we're selling, they're early stage. We're getting good market share, but our ability to drive price will be something that'll take over the next 3 to 4 years for us to get full value for.","Richard Greenfield - BTIG, LLC, Research Division","And in terms of the programming spend overseas to get there, in terms of how that impacts the margin?","David M. Zaslav","Well, the programming spend that we have right now, it's pretty steady. The good news for us is, when it comes to Science and Animal Planet and ID, ID in particular is working really well. We didn't know that it would work the way Animal Planet and Science has worked in terms of taking almost very little local content and just using existing content that we have with sort of a global approach. TLC does have a meaningful amount of local, but you see it in the numbers, it is less than we thought. We thought it was going to be about 40% share, and it's more at about 60% share, and it'll probably stay about where it is right now. So overall, I think you'll see -- we don't expect that we're going to have to invest significantly more. It's about where it is now.","Operator","And your next question comes from John Janedis of UBS.","John Janedis - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","David, historically, you've talked about Discovery being synonymous with nonfiction programming. And I'm just wondering, with the introduction of some scripted fare at the upfront, what was the driver? Does that give you an incremental opportunity to monetize the audience? And should we expect more if you get the ratings?","Andrew C. Warren","Well, look, our ratings are up at Discovery, and we're having a lot of momentum. It's important for us to be open to what do the viewers want and how do we continue to nourish them. That's what this business is all about. People only watch 8 to 10 channels. The fact that our share was up 8% last year and 3%, means they're spending more time with our channels, and you have to earn that. Fiction, we've seen in the marketplace that viewers have really related to fiction on occasion on nonfiction channels. We've been very successful with Alaska and with Gold on Discovery. We have the #1 show with Gold Rush. The Bering Sea Gold has been very successful for us, Last Frontier in Alaska. So for us to do Klondike on Discovery, we thought was a good first swing into fiction, which is a lot more expensive, to see if we do something in our wheelhouse and we get behind it, will the Discovery audience, will they love it? Will they lean into it? Will they feel like that makes them feel closer to Discovery? And we're going to have to see. It's an experiment. I think it's going to do very well. But it's a very small piece of our overall strategy. It's much more expensive. It doesn't repeat as well. And so for us, it's a big tent-pole. You might see us using scripted if this works as a tent-pole strategy, sort of the way we use Frozen Planet or North America as part of that overall approach to -- in aggrandizing the brand. But it's not going to change who we are, we're nonfiction with those brands. You'll see us playing more in the fiction area with things like SBS, where we have broad entertainment sports networks, where that's the foundation of what we do in those 4 markets where we have between 30% and 40% market share.","Operator","And your next question comes from Anthony DiClemente of Barclays.","Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just a question for Andy. David mentioned taking the third year option on your Netflix deal. I think that, that comes up later this year, but I was wondering if you guys could clarify exactly when that would be, like what quarter would that option kick in? And then also I'm assuming that, that's contemplated in your full year guidance. Is it included -- or the expectation for taking the third year option is included in your full year guidance, is that correct?","Andrew C. Warren","Yes, Anthony, it's both in our full year guidance and will be either in the second or third quarter. It really all depends on when we take the option. So we're not going to say which quarter yet, but it will either be second or third, and it is included in our full year expectation.","Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. Then we go for 1 full year subsequent to that, it would extend?","Andrew C. Warren","Yes, that's correct.","Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And then on that theme, I guess, for either of you, can you talk about are there other online distributors? You said there were plenty of players knocking on your door. Are there others? And what would the structure and type of content look like for other players out there in addition to Amazon and Netflix perhaps?","David M. Zaslav","Sure. Look, the TV Everywhere is a big piece of a windowing strategy. We haven't done any of those deals yet. We are talking to operators. The good thing about TV Everywhere is it's measured on the Web, and it will be measured next year on the Pad. I just was -- met with a bunch of operators in D.C. the other day. There's a real drive to push into that space. We just haven't done deals yet. We all agree there's value, we think there's more value there. We have 10% market share. We have a lot of great content. And so I think there's the question of when that will happen, and it's a fight over value. On the SVOD piece, I wouldn't be surprised if a number of the operators get into that space. And Netflix has been very effective. Amazon has been effective. So I think it will be good for us. The more people that want to pay for our content, the better. And then there's over-the-top. There continues to be discussion of over-the-top. Eventually, it'll happen. I don't know if it's going to be this year, next year, or in 4 years. But the idea of more people wanting to pay more money to get access to content that we own is a good thing. Now it's a good thing over the next couple of years. The bigger question is, 4, 5, 6 years from now, how good of a job do we do as an industry getting the right economics for each of those windows, and any those windows get much bigger because people spend a lot more time, and does that mean that we end up doing better or worse. There's no question we're going to be better in the next couple of years.","Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Well, I just want to follow-up on that. That's a good point, in terms of if over the next few years, SVOD sort of takes share from ad supported as the form of monetization online of choice, you've taken a strategy, David, in terms of really windowing out the SVOD deals you've done in terms of longer-tail library content. Could you ever -- could you see that changing if the SVOD business really becomes, for consumers and viewers, the business model of choice vis-\u00e0-vis ad supported online?","David M. Zaslav","Look, we all have to follow the consumer, what does the consumer do, but we have to do it rationally by figuring out what are the right economics. We don't want to undermine an existing business that is very effective for us. We're about 50% subscriber fee, and we could be doing deals in some markets that are very low penetrated on cable around the world, like Brazil, to make a little bit more money. But Brazil is still only 26% pay penetrated. They grew over 20% in this past quarter. That's the place that we're going to make a lot of money. And when people first get introduced to television, we want them to be introduced to cable TV, which is the core of what we do. We don't want them to be confused by some other offerings. So I think we have to be careful as an industry as to how we approach this. The fact that traditional distributors are getting into this space is a good thing. If we're talking to an existing distributor, a customer of ours that has big scale and is paying us for our content in a traditional manner, then at that point, doing a deal with that distributor for more money to give them more windows, by definition, it'll be more difficult to undermine that relationship because it's with the same person. But we have to make sure we get the right economics. Because you're right, if in 5 years we're not getting the right economics on -- or the business models aren't effective on some of those platforms and they begin to take some scale away from traditional television, then we'll be worse off. On the other hand, today, people are watching more television than they have. And we're getting paid for every one of those platforms. So it feels awfully good. That's good. The bad is that if we get overconfident, then we don't get the right economics on those additional platforms.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Michael Morris of Davenport & Co.","Michael C. Morris - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","A couple quick ones on affiliates and then one on content. Domestic affiliates, I believe last year, your core affiliate rate x digital grew somewhere in the 4.5% to 5% range. So my first question is did your affiliate -- your subscribers who were not under new contracts so far this year, did they continue to grow at a similar pace there?","Andrew C. Warren","Yes, they did.","Michael C. Morris - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then, David, you mentioned the number of subscribers up for renewal this year, you categorized it as a little more than 10%. Can you talk about...","David M. Zaslav","That was last year. Last year was less than 20%. And we've basically said, directionally, that it's about, over the next 5 years, it's basically even. So if you were to model it out and you modeled out 20% a year, you wouldn't be too far off on either side.","Michael C. Morris - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","So when you said that less than 20%, those weren't the sort of January 1, 2013, subscribers? Or is that kind of like at that date. I know it's not always exact, but so to speak.","David M. Zaslav","The deals that we did last year in aggregate represented a number of subs that was less than 20% of our total base in the U.S. That's it.","Michael C. Morris - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And so as we look into the number of new subscribers or updated contracts into 2014 over 2013, you think that 20% is sort of the right number we should be using?","David M. Zaslav","Ballpark, yes. Yes.","Michael C. Morris - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just on the content side, to follow up a bit on the scripted content. You did acquire into both scripted and sports in Europe. Would you consider acquiring into either of those in the U.S.?","David M. Zaslav","We always look opportunistically. I think we're very late to the party on sports, and it's very expensive, and there's a lot of great players playing in that space and fighting that fight. We think it's -- what we have with Eurosport, which we have a right to take a control right in, in about 19 months, is very different. It's in 59 countries. It's the only pan-European sports platform that exists, so it's a very unique platform with unique leverage. So sports is difficult. I don't see us playing in a meaningful way in fiction on our existing platforms in some way that would skew your models. But if there were channels available here in the U.S., we always look. We think we have enough scale here right now. But for the right price, we always look at everything. Our focus is going to be much more outside the U.S., That's where we think we have a real advantage, both in terms of teams on the ground and scale.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Tuna Amobi of S&P Capital IQ.","Tuna N. Amobi - S&P Equity Research","David, you used the word robust in your characterization of your upfront outlook. So I just want to get a sense how robust you think this will be. Clearly, you guys have been taking share for several years now, and it seems to me that your position this year is relatively better than last year in the upfront environment. So I'm wondering how this whole changes your strategy and any kind of color that you can provide would be helpful. And for Andy, so you laid out 3 criteria for your M&A strategy. And I was very curious that you were willing to take a significant margin hit in the SBS, and yet you made a point it was EPS and free cash accretive. And I'm wondering, given that dynamic, is this something that one can expect would -- I mean, it's not common that the kind of margin compression that SBS would result. And the time frame, it sounds like from your comments, would take a few years to normalize. And I'm wondering why you think that's kind of the right approach in terms of how you view assets, and if that's something that's peculiar to the international market or if it's something you will also consider in your U.S. acquisition criteria, if that makes sense.","David M. Zaslav","Okay, let me start. The upfront, to some extent, is outside of our control. We go in with a significant amount of momentum. The market right now is strong, surprisingly strong. But we're more of a follower than a leader with that, and that's just -- that's because we're in the cable business and that's the way it works here in the U.S. So we'll see where CBS or some of the bigger broadcasters go. If they -- depending on where they come in, we'll make the decision depending on how up the pricing is whether -- last year, we did about 55% of our inventory, but we did very, very well with scatter. And the question is, depending on how high we can get an increase on the upfront, that'll determine whether we do 45%, 48%, 50% or 55% and how much we bet on scatter. So I think we have all the right winds at our back going in. We're just going to have to see how the marketplace is. It feels good now, we'll have to see. On SBS, just a couple of points, and then I'll pass it to Andy. That's a dual revenue stream business, so it's very unusual. 30% of it is sub fees, number one. Two, we think we have a lot of synergy and it's not going to take us a very long time, we think we can move those margins pretty quickly. And three, it does play against our model. If we had bought an asset like this in one market that had a unique language where we couldn't use it across other countries, it would have been more difficult. The fact that you have Norway, Denmark, Sweden and Finland and you can produce content and share it across those markets, and we could use their content, they could use ours, we think gives us a real chance to grow our international business and also to reinforce the geographic diversity that we have. Those are very stable markets, and we think that we can grow them, and we can use the synergy to do it.","Andrew C. Warren","Yes. You're right. And we've laid out 3 kind of deal criterion that we look at. One is free cash flow and EPS accretive, day one; two is an unlevered IRR of at least low-teens; and three is by the multiple that's less than ourselves and ideally less than 10. And SBS clearly meets all of those 3 criteria. And so, look, I'll just add to David's point, while it is margin dilutive, day one, we do very much believe in our ability to grow margin, not only with that business but the overall amalgamation of the D&I in total. So we're very, very bullish on what our margin profile's going to look like long term. We think this is the right kind of step back in margin, year 1, with a lot of thoughts around how to gain that through ad sales leverage, top line leverage, infrastructure in place and then synergies.","Craig Felenstein","Thank you very much, everybody, for joining us, and please follow up with any questions that you have.

I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Jackie Burka, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please proceed, ma\u2019am.","Jackie Burka","Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for Discovery Communications 2015 second quarter earnings call. Joining me today are David Zaslav, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Andy Warren, our Chief Financial Officer. You should have received our earnings release, but if not, feel free to access it on our website at www.discoverycommunications.com.","On today's call we will begin with some opening comments from David and Andy, and then we will open up the call for your questions. Please keep to one question so we can accommodate as many people as possible.","Before we start, I would like to remind you that comments today regarding the company's future business plans, prospects and financial performance are forward-looking statements that we make pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.","These statements are made based on management's current knowledge and assumptions about future events and they involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations.","In providing projections and other forward-looking statements, the company disclaims any intent or obligation to update them.

Discovery\u2019s strong start to the year continued in the second quarter, with steady growth across our global portfolio of brands and businesses. Propelled from a strong second quarter into what was a momentous start to the third quarter, I join you extremely confident in Discovery\u2019s future growth prospects.","I believe we will look back on July 2015 as a pivotal month in our company's history as we announced three transformative agreements. The multiplatform rights to the Olympic Games in Europe for the next decade, the deal to acquire 100% control of Eurosport and lastly, a favorable long-term renewal with Comcast for our U.S. Networks portfolio and distribution on the Xfinity Comcast platform.","These deals together stabilized and enhance our U.S. growth profile, continue our diversification internationally and give us more blue chip IP content and more distribution, so we continue to drive audience share across all consumer platforms.","Earlier this month, we announced an exclusive deal in Europe, with the IOC all of the TV and multiplatform media rights to the four Olympic Games from 2018 to 2024. Never before has one media company been granted all rights on all platforms across Europe.","We believe the Olympic Games will be a foundation programming piece for Eurosport and Discovery across the continent. Eurosport already dedicates over 40% of its programming schedule to Olympic Sports and bolstering our rights and offerings with the world's greatest sporting event is a perfect editorial and strategic fit for the linear channel and for eurosport.com, the leading online sports platform in Europe.","Combined with full access to the Olympic programming archive, our use of the Olympic rings immediately following Rio and our existing Sports Federation Agreements, this deal was substantially strengthen the Eurosport platform and bring the Olympic Games to more viewers on more platforms across Europe than ever before. We will maximize our reach to Europe\u2019s 700 million residents across platforms.","Following the June 29th Olympic announcement, we have seen an increase in conversations and feedback from our European distributors, advertising partners, and phone and new media players, who want to work more closely with us.","Soon after the Olympic deal, we struck an agreement to acquire full ownership of Eurosport from the TF1 Group. In 2012, we began our investment with a 20% stake in Eurosport and increase that investment to 51% more than a year ago.","Taking full control of Eurosport allows us to further strengthen the brand and decision-making process, more readily secure important sports rights on a local or pan regional basis, and fully realize the businesses growth potential. Eurosport two or three channels across 130 million homes, eurosport.com and now the Olympics for the next decade, makes us the clear leader in sports in Europe.","Finally, the third transaction was signing a long-term Distribution Agreement with Comcast. Our renewal with Comcast is significant. It demonstrates the distributors continue to place great value on our content and brand, with meaningful increases, and it solidifies our TV Everywhere strategy with deployment on Xfinity, primary TV Everywhere platform in the U.S.","Four years ago we said we would reset our domestic affiliate rate structure with a step up and more meaningful increases to reflect our increased investment in content and the growth of our audience share that our channel brands had earned.","I am proud to say that we've achieved it. Prior to this renewal cycle our deals had price escalators at CPI. But we have now reset all of our affiliate agreements that have come up in the last four years, which is the majority, at a meaningful rate increase that reflects the strength of our brands and our increased market share. Andy will give you more details but today we are positioned for long-term growth in the United States.","Locking up that long cycle money with strong price escalators, allows us to focus on other aspects of the business and gives our U.S. business a steady growth rate for years to come. And there is still real opportunity for value creation even on the affiliate side going forward.","At 13% share reviewing, we were only getting a mid-single-digit share of affiliate fees even with our increases. There is still a gap to close in the future as well, which we see as real opportunity in the years ahead. Even in a marketplace like the U.S., it is relatively flat and challenged.","Combined with our multiple TV Everywhere rights deals signed in the past two years, we are now accelerating the expansion of streaming choices for our content across platforms and diversifying our distribution channels with multiple partners. It\u2019s positive when new entrants come into the market, particularly when you have the number one channel in America for men with Discovery Channel, several top channels for women and the top channel for African-American women with OWN, all at a price point that is a very good value which gives us a real advantage.","Today I'm pleased to announce an agreement with Verizon to bring long and short-form content from Discovery Channel, TLC, Animal Planet, ID and the Science Channel, including full episodes of prior seasons of hit shows to Verizon's U.S. mobile subscribers.","This deal extends our platform reach to Verizon customers beyond our traditional pay-TV customer base and adds yet another source to our distribution revenue stream. While we drive to extend the delivery of our content to new platforms, we also are working to maximize and exploit our traditional business in the U.S.","Headwinds notwithstanding the U.S. pay-TV marketplace remains one of the world\u2019s most important programming and advertising markets. Long-term we are evolving our approach to integrate advertising more deeply into our content, adding more branded integrations, pushing programmatic buying and driving higher CPMs from the scatter marketplace.","In the second quarter in the U.S. revenue growth, yet again outpaced cost increases and adjusted OIBDA reached an all-time high. Hitting these metrics illustrates the strong command-and-control we have over our business. We have seen advertising market momentum pick up across all of our channels, so far in Q3, as we continue to benefit from ratings outperformance driven by the flagship Discovery Channel.","Led by new President, Rich Ross, the Discovery Channel team has done a fantastic job of creating and building programming that nourishes discoveries core male viewers while attracting more diverse audiences including women, Millennials, Hispanic viewers and family co-viewing.","For the quarter, Discovery\u2019s prime time delivery with persons 25 to 54 rose 12% and 9% with men 25 to 54 and 16% with women 25 to 54. The network ranked as the number four channel and ad supported cable for persons 25 to 54, up two spots from a year ago and with women 25 to 54 rose seven spots to number nine.","Discovery held all of cable's top five unscripted series for men, Deadliest Catch, Naked and Afraid, Alaskan Bush People, Fast N\u2019 Loud and Street Outlaws. More recently, Shark Week, which aired a month earlier this year continues to be a pop-culture juggernaut. For the science-based slate of programming that reinforce Discovery Channel's heritage, Shark Week 2015 became our highest-rated ever among persons 25 to 54 and women 25 to 54 and Discovery Channel's performance in July outside of Shark Week was strong as prime time delivery jumped 34% for persons 25 to 54 and 26% for men and 50% for women in the same age bracket, all making Discovery Channel the number one channel for men for the month of July.","Internationally Discovery Channel again reaches a record audience as many of our tent-pole shows replicated their success globally. Discovery Channel showed particular strength in India, Brazil and Mexico where our share of audience rose more than 20%.","ID also posted strong viewership gains in the U.S. and abroad in the second quarter. IDs U.S. delivery rose 7%, and it was a top three ad supported cable network with women 25 to 54 in total day, top three. IDs average international audience rose a record 23% for the quarter fueled by new market launches in organic viewership growth, including the June launch of ID in Sweden.","On TLC, we have moved forward with new series that speak to what the TLC brand is best at, holding a mirror to the culture and telling stories in a thoughtful and sensitive way. There are no better examples than I Am Jazz, a heartwarming new series about a transgendered teen, her loving family. In its premiere, the series posted 1.8 million viewers and My Giant Life, a new series that chronicles the remarkable stories of the world's tallest women and has averaged nearly 2 million total viewers.","These shows will soon be joined by returning series, Our Little Family and The Little Couple. Meanwhile, TLC\u2019s viewership overseas continues to grow. TLC\u2019s average international audience rose 15% in the second quarter, led by strong viewership in South Africa, the Netherlands, the U.K. and Russia.","Just as our global networks and programming are performing well, it is also important to note our IP content investments are similarly making real strides. All three, which we own through a joint venture with Liberty Global International was nominated for 11 primetime Emmys this year, including the hit series Undercover Boss and Penny Dreadful.","Overall, we again achieved new record reach in market share gains internationally. With 6% audience share growth across our entire global portfolio in the quarter, our audience and share gains were led by our pay-TV channels in India, Brazil and Mexico, with the Discovery Kids, TLC and Animal Planet brands driving our gains.","We also saw strong delivery in the U.K., Germany and Italy as we have many pay-TV and free to air channels in those markets and a strong and growing share presence. Latin America once again delivered a stellar quarter with average audience up 13%. We continue to see broad-based gains in viewership across the region.","Led by Discovery Kids, Brazil's portfolio was up 23% and Mexico jumped 16%. Our CEEMEA region posted 5% growth in average audience in the second quarter. Last week in the region, we officially announced an expanded partnership in Turkey with the Do\u011fu\u015f Media Group, one of the leading media companies in the country.","Do\u011fu\u015f is an important distribution partner for our 12 pay-TV channels in Turkey and with this new strategic partnership, we were able to extend our portfolio with positive economics and agreed to purchase our first free-to-air channel in this emerging growth market that expands and diversifies our platforms and windows for our content in Turkey, a key market for us.","We will also partner with Do\u011fu\u015f to be our new exclusive representative for our advertising sales. We are also deploying a free-to-air partnership strategy in the growing Middle East and North African market. In June, we announced plans to launch Quest Arabiya in the region in the fourth quarter through an agreement with Image Nation, one of leading content creators in the Middle East. This free-to-air Arabic language channel will reach 45 million homes, with the best locally produced male-oriented factual programming, mix with program from Discovery's vast global content engine.","Quest Arabiya will expand Discovery\u2019s seven network portfolio in the market, which already includes six pay-TV Discovery brands and the free-to-air channel Fatafeat. Across Europe and Asia, our investment in Eurosport continues to demonstrate progress, with the business posting a 6% increase in average audience this quarter alone. As we approach the 2018 Olympic Winter Games, we will continue to build Eurosport\u2019s offering and brand for the long-term across Europe and Asia.","Since taking control of Eurosport a little more than a year ago, we've added 7,500 hours of coverage per year, with more than 3,300 of that life through more than 50 sports rights deals to drive viewership and strength of the offering and Eurosport remains meaningfully profitable.","Recent rights include the exclusive television and digital rights for eight major international cycle races from 2017 to 2021 in Asia-Pacific, Wimbledon in Belgium, the PGA Tour Golf in Norway and the Europa league in the Nordics. Beyond linear, we are bullish about the impact of the Olympics and all the local and niche sports content, we are requiring will have on driving adoption of our over-the-top products in Europe.","With the Eurosport Player in 52 countries and DPlay, which recently launched in Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Italy, we are continuing to drive toward our stated goal, march to a million subscribers across those platforms in the next two years. And we now have over 300,000 subscribers as of the end of last month.","We are making real progress in our goal to maximize the linear platform while aggressively attacking digital distribution around the world. Our strategy centers on investing in premium content to grow market share such as the Olympics, maximizing audience reach on pay-TV platforms by locking down long cycle agreements like Comcast, while aggressively pushing our content to new distribution platforms like Verizon in the U.S. And finding new ways to monetize our content like with Dogas in Turkey and evolving our approach to advertising through the use of data to drive addressability, dynamic ad insertion and secondary guarantees using set-top box data.","All of these efforts are designed to enhance growth in the U.S., while driving the expansion aggressively of our international footprint. Based on a 30-year track record of success, the transformative partnerships we've signed in just the past month alone and our continued global growth horizon, I believe Discovery is well-positioned to grow across our 220 markets around the world for the years to come.","With that, I will turn the call over to Andy to detail our second quarter financial results. ","Andy Warren","Thanks, David and thank you, everyone for joining us today. Discovery\u2019s ability to execute on key strategic global growth initiatives, while focusing on trailing controlling costs led to another quarter of solid results. On a reported basis, total company second quarter revenues increased 3% and adjusted OIBDA was down 2%.","As expected, given our increasingly international business mix, the stronger dollar remained a headwind and changes in currency rates reduced both our reported revenues and adjusted OIBDA growth rates by 8%. Therefore, excluding currency, revenues and adjusted OIBDA were up an impressive 11% and 6% respectively.","On an organic basis, so excluding the impact of foreign currency as well as the inclusion of Eurosport and Discovery Family, total company revenues grew 4% and adjusted OIBDA grew 3%. Our organic margins were flat year-over-year at 44%. Our strong cost and content spend allocation, discipline and management continues. But note that we do expect to see a significant uptick in costs domestically and internationally in the third quarter, given the timing of certain content marketing investments.","This 3Q cost uptick is embedded in our full year guidance. Note also that because of the difficulties in separating Eurosport France from the rest of Eurosport results, we will continue to breakout the impact of both transactions to the end of this year. It\u2019s important to remind people, however, that when we breakout and report the combined Eurosport results for another few quarters, the benefits of our owning Eurosport extend far beyond the standalone Eurosport results to the rest of the Discovery portfolio in Europe and Asia to the combined distribution and ad sales leverage in these country.","Net income available to Discovery Communications of $286 million was down versus last year second quarter net income of $379 million, primarily due to unusually large amounts related to higher foreign currency losses of $54 million from the revaluation of both our euro-denominated debt, and monetary assets in Venezuela, $28 million of lower gains related to selling SBS radio this year versus gains related to HowStuffWorks and Eurosport last year and higher restructuring and other charges this year of $19 million, primarily due to content impairments charges from canceling TLC's 19 Kids & Counting.","This all was partially offset by lower income tax expense as our effective tax rate decreased another 300 basis points year-over-year to 32%. As we remain extremely focused on lowering both our effective and cash tax rates, we expect our effective tax rate to be 33% for 2015 and still expect it to be at or below 30% for fiscal 2017, which will continue to drive sustained income growth as well as accelerate our free cash flow.","Earnings per diluted share for the first quarter was $0.44 and adjusted earnings per diluted share from a relevant metric, from a comparability perspective that excludes the impact from acquisition-related non-cash amortization of intangible assets was $0.49. Excluding negative currency impacts, adjusted EPS was up 4% for the quarter and up 11% for the last 12 months.","Free cash flow in the second quarter increased an impressive 55% to $313 million, due to lower cash taxes, working capital improvements, lower cash interest payments and lower capital expenditures. We still expect our full year free cash flow to be up low-single digits versus 2014 and accelerate nicely in 2016.","Turning now to the operating units. The U.S. Networks grew revenue 5%, as it benefited from another quarter of strong distribution growth, up 12% versus last year second quarter and a small increase in ad sales. Our advertising revenues were up slightly versus last year second quarter, as higher pricing and the consolidation of Discovery Family offset lower delivery.","Total U.S. delivery did improve from the first quarter, led once again by the flagship Discovery Network, but it was still down low-single digits versus second quarter of last year. As David mentioned, this quarter marked our highest-ad sales quarter in the company's history, as we benefited from the overall market shift from an advanced upfront ad buying to higher price scatter volumes, as we also sold a record amount of scatter ad volume.","Looking ahead, we are bullish on our third quarter ad trends as our improved delivery, especially at Discovery, is allowing us to continue to take advantage of a healthier scatter market in respect to our third quarter U.S. advertising revenue growth to modestly accelerate to low single-digit. It is still too early to have a solid read on Q4.","Distribution revenues, excluding the impact from consolidated Discovery Family results, were up 6% this quarter as we again benefited from the higher rates we garnered from our new deals with NCTC, Cablevision, Sony and others at the end of 2014, as well as from contributions from our new Hulu deal, which started January 1st of this year.","Organic growth decelerated from the first quarter due to tougher year-over-year SVOD comps and a decline of approximately 1% in the pay subscription universe. Given the one-time nature of the SVOD comp, we expect organic affiliate growth to accelerate slightly into the second half of the year, assuming that the rate of subscriber losses does not pick up.","I also want to address the financial impact of our recently announced Comcast renewal. We are extremely pleased with the rate structure of our new comprehensive long-term agreement that again recognizes the value of Discovery\u2019s Networks.","Pricing for the new deal goes into effect, January 1st of next year and includes a healthy initial step-up, followed by continued rate escalators over the life of the deal. This deal along with our other recently uncompleted deals help stabilize and accelerate our U.S. affiliate growth trajectory to high-single digits in 2016 and significantly enhances our domestic affiliate revenue and cash flow growth expectations.","Turning to the cost side, domestic operating expenses in the quarter were up 1% on a reported basis, but were down 3%, excluding the Discovery family consolidation. Excluding family, cost revenue were up 2%, while SG&A declined 11%.","Our laser focus on controlling cost with the domestic adjusted EBITDA growth of 7% on a reported basis versus last year\u2019s second quarter and up 4% excluding family. While margins on a reported basis and excluding family, both expanded by 100 basis points year-over-year to our all-time high margin rate of 61%.","Moving onto international operations, our international division drove another solid quarter of organic distribution growth, but did experience a near-term slowdown in organic advertising that is already reversing in the third quarter.","On a reported basis, revenues grew 1% and reported adjusted EBITDA declined 11%. Excluding currency, revenues increased 19% and adjusted EBITDA increased 7%, as changes in FX rates reduced both revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth rates by 18%, as a stronger dollar versus last year remained a major headwind.","And on organic basis, so excluding currency impacts, as well as Eurosport, revenues and adjusted EBITDA both increased 7%. For comparability purposes by following international comments, we refer to our organic results only, so exclude the impact of Eurosport and FX.","The 7% second quarter revenue growth was led by 7% advertising growth and 7% distribution growth. Ad growth was led by another quarter of 20% plus growth in Latin America, led by strong volume, pricing and delivery in Brazil, as well as strength in Argentina and Mexico. Asia PAC has also recovered nicely and grew advertising over 10%.","The majority of the reasons our advertising growth rate decelerated from the first quarter or one-time in nature, namely tough comps related to the World Cup last year, as well as a slowdown in the U.K. due to elections in May, but we are now seeing a nice acceleration into the third quarter.","We were also hurt in 2Q, our audience share in Norway. Looking forward, we still forecast full year organic advertising growth to be in the low-double-digit range, so it will depend upon no further share losses in Norway.","Distribution revenues grew 7%, driven by another quarter of double-digit growth in Latin America, due to higher rates and the continued expansion of pay television in key markets like Brazil, Mexico, and Argentina. We still expect organic affiliate growth in the back half of this year to be in the mid to high single digit range.","Turning to the cost side, operating expenses internationally grew 7% in the second quarter, primarily due to higher content amortization and increased personnel costs, as we further localize our international businesses. Adjusted OIBDA grew 7% and international organic margins were in line with last year at 38%.","Eurosport\u2019s standalone margin in the second quarter was 11% and we still expect margins to be in the high-single-digit range for the full year. We continue to see significant strategic value of investing in additional sports IP in order to bolster and enhance, both the Eurosport and total Discovery European platforms. And while these investments will drive real long-term portfolio value, the loss will continue to depress margins at standalone Eurosport and will also limit margin expansion going forward for total DNI.","Our Education and Other segment reported small operating loss for the quarter. Given our strategic focus on producing and utilizing more content for our in-house own production studios, which has no margin associated with it, and our continued investment in education's digital textbooks to drive the long-term value of this industry disrupting business, this segment, in total, continue to operate at a small loss for the remainder of the year.","Now, taking a look at our overall financial position, in the second quarter we repurchased a total of $207 million worth of shares. We have now spent over $6.2 billion buying back shares since we began our buyback program at the end of 2010. And we have reduced our outstanding share count by 30%, as we continue to find the return on repurchasing our own shares extremely attractive.","As we previously stated, we remain highly committed to our BBB rating and we will manage our capital planning and allocation with this commitment in mind. The rating agencies have recently taken a more conservative view on the media industry. And given our current debt to EBITDA threshold is at the higher end of target levels for BBB company, we\u2019re now focused on preserving cash for the remainder of this year. Therefore, we now expect to have less total available capital for fiscal 2015 than we previously stated.","Including the $52 million worth of stock that we will soon buy from Advance\/Newhouse under our preexisting buyback agreement with them, we will spend $575 million on total share buyback this year and unlikely that we purchase any additional common stock for the remainder of this year.","Given our capital allocation priorities remain, first and foremost, to invest and drive organic growth, and, second, to invest in strategic M&A platforms and IP, and, third, to buy back our stock. For the remainder of 2015, we need to retain flexibility for additional potential strategic investments, such as our recently announced accretive and growth driving investment with the Do\u011fu\u015f in Turkey while continuing to pay down debt.","As we look towards 2016 however, we forecast for having meaningfully more capital available and expect the amount of capital allocated to share repurchases to increase significantly next year.","Turning to full year guidance; excluding currency impacts, we are pleased to reaffirm that we still expect revenue growth to be in the high-single to low-double digit range and adjusted OIBDA growth to be in the low to mid single digit range.","Given our solid operating performance and lower tax rate trends, we are raising our full year adjusted EPS, excluding currency growth expectation, to be low-double digits. The guidance ranges still include the sale of the non-core SBS radio assets, which closed at the end of the second quarter, as well as the $50 million negative non-FX related impact from Russia.","Before move onto Q&A, I want to update our full year foreign exchange impact on our 2015 results. While the dollar has been less volatile, there are slightly higher currency headwinds versus when we last reported, in large part due to Venezuela. At current spot rates, FX is now expected to reduce our constant currency guided revenues by $440 million, or roughly 7%, and adjusted OIBDA by $160 million, roughly 6%, versus our 2014 reported results.","In addition, we are now disclosing that FX will have a $0.23 to $0.28 impact on adjusted EPS versus last year reported results, assuming no further below the line currency adjustments.","Looking at our International Networks mix of currency exposures, the revenue mix in 2015 remains the same at around 30% euro, 30% Nordic, 20% US dollar, 10% British pound, and 5% Brazilian real. Our International Networks' adjusted OIBDA currency mix is forecasted to be around 25% euro, 25% Nordic, 15% real, 5% Russian ruble, 5% US dollar, and still slightly shorted British pound as our international headquarters are in London.","Lastly, as a reminder, we have successfully hedged a portion of our currency exposures and did realize gains in these hedges in the first half. We only hedged about 60% of our international transactional exposures. We also do not hedge translational exposures, as these derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting.","In conclusion, as I look across our portfolio, I couldn't be happier with how we are currently positioned. Our current exposure to higher growth international markets is 50% and growing. And while we will continue to benefit from the global evolution of pay-TV and continued audience share gains, as we leverage our marquee content across our unmatched global distribution platforms, about half of our global revenues are locked in for the next several years to long-term affiliate agreements, both domestically and internationally.","David and I look forward to discussing our compelling and highly unique portfolio positioning in more depth at our Investor Day on September 29. And now we would like to open the line up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Anthony DiClemente from Nomura. Please proceed.","Anthony DiClemente","Thank you very much. I have one for David and a couple quick ones for Andy. David, congratulations on the Comcast renewal. You mentioned that in your prepared remarks. You also mentioned the importance of data. So I thought I would ask about that. My understanding is that your content as you said will be deployed as part of the XFINITY TV Everywhere app. Do you guys have access to that viewership data? Some your peers have had network apps that are specific to the network.","Just wondering as part of your deal, do you have the rights to launch your own authenticated network app as part of the deal? And if not, why not do that or do you plan to do that? And I'll come back for my questions for Andy. Thanks.","David Zaslav","Thanks, Anthony. The Comcast was one of the final pieces of this overall strategy over the last four years where we grew our viewership from 5% share of viewership on cable to 13% and to try and get more value and bigger increases. And so Comcast together with all of our deals to be in a position where we now can look forward and see high-single-digit affiliate growth in US, with all of our channels being carried with very limited exposure to this issue of skinny bundles, because almost all of our deals require that all of our channels be carried to a very high percentage of subscribers.","It puts us in, I think, a very good position and makes the US for us, as we look forward, a growth market. And when we say high-single, we\u2019re putting in there an expectation that the US, we recognize that it's mature, it's been declining at about 1%, and we think we can get high-single, even if that accelerates a little bit. And so the big piece here is that we really -- we have a very good affiliate revenue stream now. And as I mentioned, we still only represent about 5% or a little bit more than 5% of the economics, even though we\u2019re 13% of viewership, before we\u2019re at 3% or 3.5%. So we are quite a good bargain when someone is looking for content, whether it\u2019d be new over-the-top platforms and so on.","On the data piece, there is a data relationship with Comcast that we established. And I think that's critical because the data inside the box is very important. Comcast platform is probably the -- if not the best, it's certainly up there and the X1 platform is terrific. It's a leader in TV Everywhere, but it also is one of the real leaders in data capture, which could help us I think on the monetization side. So we were all in on TV Everywhere with Comcast and with Neil. We\u2019re glad to have that deal behind us.","The other piece is that we own all of our own content, which is quite unusual. And I think it's going to be a very important element as you look at the future of a mature market, because we own all of our content. We don\u2019t have long-term commitments to sports. We don\u2019t have long-term commitment to off-network and when we put our content on platforms, we get all the money. And so it gives us the chance to move our content on to platforms, but it also to the extent that the marketplace moves in a particular direction, we have real ability to maneuver from a cost perspective. We don't have any long-tail expensive programming cost.","Anthony DiClemente","Got you. Thanks. Thanks, David. And then, for Andy, just on the comment you made about cost -- the cost uptick in 3Q, why don\u2019t if you just clarify, how is that breakdown U.S. versus international and specifically, which cost, I think ,you talked about programming being part of that -- timing of programming? And then the $0.23 to $0.28 of FX impact, could you give us, how that compares to what your prior expectation was as of last quarter? And then, sorry about this, but just had a last one, which was, sound like 3Q is going really well on the ad side, just wondering is it more so a function of ad demand and help of the scatter market or is it more so better audience delivery, given the strength that you guys have seen in terms of ratings in the month of July? Thanks.","Andy Warren","Okay, Anthony. Look, on the first question, I am very happy with our cost trends right now. I really feel like that the point from David\u2019s comments, the fact that we, do we have more content cost flexibility. We definitely demonstrating a lot of coming to control around other non-content cost, particularly in SG&A and we are seeing that benefit over the last several quarters.","To your point though in 3Q, we do expect double-digit increases for both domestic and international, predominantly on the content side, and little bit on the marketing side, as we are going to put some more support and tailwind behind some of our new program launches.","So there definitely be a cost uptick in 3Q, but definitely I want to highlight the fact that that, as I think about our cost structures and I think about going forward, I feel really good about our sustained level of productivity and driving SG&A in particular to be kind of in that low single to mid single-digit range.","The second question about the foreign exchange impact, yeah, it\u2019s the $0.23 to $0.28 is the latest view, that's a few cents higher than we would have thought back on our May conference call. It's really highlighting more the fact that while euro has been relatively stable, given our global reach and global expansion of our platforms, clearly some other currencies in particular Venezuela and Brazil have continue to be some additional headwind. So we definitely do want to going forward continue to highlight for everyone kind of what the impact is on our adjusted EPS.","Anthony DiClemente","Okay. Thanks.","Andy Warren","And the third question ad sales trends? Yeah, look, it\u2019s really the combination of both our performance and the market, we are, look, our deliveries are strong, particularly with Discovery, our sell-out has been strong, some of the overall ad sales trends around cancellations are kind of add normal levels, we are seeing some nice pricing on the scatter market and the fact that a lot of other networks have been more sold out, given some 80 new constraints and given our relative ratings performance, we add more capacity and so we have more impressions to monetize.","David Zaslav","For the first time I would say and we -- it\u2019s too early to make any projections for where fourth quarter will be, but the marketplaces has absolutely picked up and the fact that we have rating points is allowing us to take advantage of that, scatter pricing has been fine for a long time, but the volume wasn't there, fourth quarter was quite weak, we pointed that out and it was a surprise. Second quarter was, okay, but third quarter really seems to be accelerating. It's too early to tell whether that will continue, but it's -- but it feels good right now.","Andy Warren","Yeah. And just to clear off that, six months ago, we all said around, I think, everyone in the industry and said, where is the money going, there is clearly less volume in the broadcast of 20 year ago and what we see today is that a meaningful shift out of broadcast both in the calendar and scatter, and we are seeing the benefit of that scatter today, not only from the standpoint of volume, our highest record ever of scatter volume in the second quarter, but also because we are still seen some good sustained pricing in the scatter market, that's helping us get an uptick in the third quarter, so some overall nice dynamics.","Anthony DiClemente","Thank you very much for taking my questions.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Kannan from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Kannan Venkateshwar","Thank you. So just a question the Olympics, now that the deal is done and as you look forward into your affiliates, the levers, and the whole cycle when it comes to Eurosport going forward? What the end of operating leverage you see from this process, especially when it comes to Eurosport margins? I mean, you guys are still at the single-digits kind of margin profile and once this process is completed, are we looking at a substantial bump over where Eurosport was when you guys acquired this asset? Thanks.","David Zaslav","Well, I think, exactly how the Olympics will play out long-term and the impact, some of it, one of the reasons why we were really keen about getting the Olympics for the next decade and we get the rings and library and access right after Rio, is that we have on all platforms.","And so, the one element here is positioning ourselves for the future, where between Eurosport where we own all the sports IP and we have Olympic sports, many of which are top sports in particular countries plus the Olympics. It positions us where for the long-term -- for the next 10 years we have must have IP and we've seen the response in the market in a meaningful way by a number of different players on all platforms, interested in talking to us about the Olympics.","But also the sports content that leads up to the Olympics, so we can take you from Michael Phelps every event right up to the Gold Medal and so there's real value in that, we will try to figure that out.","On the -- when we look at how the Olympics is done in Europe and I was involved with the Olympics for 15 years in the U.S., NBC was quite effective in evolving Olympics from being just the free to air product to free and air -- to free to air and cable, including getting incremental fees and incremental -- and lifting up the whole bundle of the NBC channels and then moving it on to other platforms.","If you look at Europe, U.S. is about 300 million -- 330 million people. All rights in Europe are over 700 million people, but in almost every one of those markets it sort of where the U.S. was in 1992, basically almost only free to air in each country and they had been sold to free to air players and to the TBS to the public stations in each market, and so we are now the holder of that content, and we will look to monetize it together with all of our assets.","So, I think, it's a little bit of a -- of a force pieces of data that look at just where Eurosport is, you will need to take a look at what is our affiliate revenue in the aggregate doing, what is our advertising revenue in the aggregate doing and what is our sponsorship advertising revenue in the aggregate look like.","And as we mentioned earlier, we are pushing hard in over the top. I think we're the only company in Europe that's going directly to consumer with sports and we have over 300,000 subscribers now that are paying us between $6 and $8 a subscriber in order to get the Eurosport programming.","So for the French Open instead of watching three quarts, if you had three Eurosport channels in your country you could watch 15 quarts, on cycling you can follow 15 cyclists.","And so, this is -- we are really looking to restructure our company for significant growth in the future by better IP, while at the same time growing our linear platforms and I think, the Olympics together with Eurosport allows us to do that.","Andy Warren","And just to elaborate the question about margin, from a purely financial perspective, while Olympics will dilute margins for Eurosport and DNI. It is absolutely going to be both cash flow OIBDA and FTV positive. So when we look at the financials of Olympics standalone, couldn't be more enthused about the deal we did, the rights we have and the impacts it\u2019s going to have on over our portfolio.","Kannan Venkateshwar","So just one follow-up question, I mean, you guys do have affiliate deals coming up much prior to the Olympics. So when should we start seeing some of these fee bumps as a result of the Olympics. I mean, is the 2016 kind of an event or is it further up?","David Zaslav","The cycle for our affiliate deals outside the U.S. are shorter. They tend to be about three years versus in the U.S. where they are five to seven years. And you\u2019ll see it in two forms. You'll see it in an overall bundling. I oversaw the sale of the Olympics when I was at NBC and we were able to get several hundred million dollars for each Olympics.","We\u2019re not saying that that's exactly what we\u2019re going to be able to do in Europe but we do think that we\u2019ll be able to get some -- get meaningful fees for, whether it's by in the way that we carve it up charging for over the air us carrying it on cable, putting it on other platforms. And so some of it will be in the form of affiliate revenue and some of it will be in the form of the rights fees where we'll be giving away some of those rights to carry the Olympics and the Olympic programming that leads up to it.","Andy Warren","I think you'll see a similar kind of cadence that you saw from us in the U.S. As David said earlier, we committed four years ago as we're going into our renewal cycle and as we catch up unsure of wallet, catching up to share a viewership. Even you see an accretion on our U.S. distribution rates and you saw it went from 4% in \u201813 to 5% in \u201814 and 6% in \u201815 and you can see our growth accelerating in \u201816.","As we said, it\u2019s going to be a high single digit. I think the same kind of cadence will exist now for DNI. The combination of Eurosport, the combination of Olympics and that leverage we will have will allow us to continue to accrete on the affiliate line for the next several years at international.","David Zaslav","The other element, that's helpful here is we moved into Eastern and Western Europe, and viewed it four or five years ago was the new emerging market. So we\u2019ve gone local in those markets. We launched free-to-air channels at a very low cost where we use our content to reach some markets that have low pay-TV. And we've done some more local content in markets. And with the largest pay-TV play around the world but internationally -- but in Europe, we are now by far the largest pay-TV media company. And the scale that we've been able to get by the growth of our pay-TV together with free-to-air puts us in a much better position as we sit down with distributors.","And what\u2019s happened, there is a lot of other companies that are local because of the fact that most countries are either in recession or flat and it's been a long haul. A lot of the local companies have spent less on content, which has helped us gain share and a lot of the players from outside have taken cost out and done the opposite rather than go local and spend more on content reduced.","And so our market share is up. So we think that Eurosport in the Olympics together with our market share being up and people spending more time with our channels gives us over the next several years some upside as we pushed for higher pricing and we intend to do that and we've started to.","Kannan Venkateshwar","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Doug Mitchelson, UBS. Please proceed.","Doug Mitchelson","Thanks so much. So David, with the total revenue now in good shape in the U.S., they are playing the model, of course, it\u2019s on the advertising side, you're well aware of concerns that investors have for medias. I\u2019m just curious how you feel non-fiction programming position looking forward versus the secular concerns of humans moving on Mars to general entertainment, OTT platforms like Netflix and then you also mentioned Discovery can close the gap further? And I'm thinking you're suggesting that OTT platforms is a place where you can get better pricing than you have in traditional deals and perhaps that suggest that you\u2019ve got a good chart ingredient to Apple TV Phase1. But am I thinking about that comment right that Discovery can continue to close the gap on affiliate revenue in United States. Thanks.","David Zaslav","Well, first, we pivoted about a year and half ago back, hard back to core brand. I think that's one of the reasons why a lot of our channels are much stronger. In July, they have Discovery be the number one cable channel in America for men. There have been several months in the last eight months where Discovery has been with the core structure that's very different from entertainment and sports channels to be the number one cable channel. And remember 80% of that content, we get to reuse around the world. We don't rent it for just the U.S.","So it's a very effective model. We also have seen that the amount of time that our content is DVR, it\u2019s gone up significantly, which is why much people want our content. And we\u2019re excited about going full into TV Everywhere. We think we'll learn more about that, our deal with Verizon. In Europe, we\u2019re talking to a lot of different players. So I think we\u2019ve the value gap right now, we were able to reach it with Verizon. We think our content is more valuable. We could be on every SVOD platform, if you want it to. But since we own all of our content, we can also go directly to consumer, which is very possible. And we\u2019re doing it throughout -- we're doing it in Europe now with sports across all of Europe.","We\u2019re doing it in with entertainment content and sports content in a number of countries in northern Europe and Italy and so we have all that flexibility. My only point on the upside is that in a declining market where people are choosing channels, the fact that we are 13% or 14 channels or 13% of viewership on cable and we\u2019re only 5% of the money, that\u2019s not something to brag about. We were much lower. The good news is we've got a significant step up in big increases.","But the -- I think the other piece of good news for us is that when people are looking to launch channels, they can get our channels whether they took eight of them or took 13 of them or 14 of them and even if we charge more, it's a lot less expensive than maybe than most of the channels. There are lot of the entertainment and sports channels that are in the inverse. They might have 5% of viewership and be 20% of the money. So I think it makes us quite attractive but also as we continue to make our case over the next several years, we grew share in the last couple of months. A lot of others are losing share.","And so the fact that if we can continue to gain share as our deals come up, we\u2019ll continue to do what we've done over the last four years, which is make the value argument that we\u2019re under indexing on economics and they are trying continue to drive our affiliate line even in a marketplace that has some decline on subscribers.","Doug Mitchelson","I mean, that\u2019s pretty interesting comment, David. If I could just follow-up on a comments around direct to consumer. Based on what you\u2019ve seen in United States, I think you\u2019ve talked about 1%, 1.5%, the core subscriber declines, obviously broadband, only homes are growing. Like what point do you think is optimal to consider launch share direct to consumer offering in United States. Is it now, is it three or is it five plus years?","David Zaslav","We are looking at everything. I think that the marketplace is actually quite stable. I think there's a lot of noise in the marketplace but I was at NBC when viewership on the networks were declining, they are still declining. The fact that that subscribers are going down 1%, 1 maybe close to 1.5, that's not a good thing.","The fact that we have higher fees locked in, we could be in a position where we could say now that even if the advertising market is weakened, it ends up being flat. We still have a mid-single growth U.S. business which is only half of our company. And most of -- a lot of our growth is coming from outside the U.S. where there is still double-digit or better growth and the kind of general growth dynamics that we saw in the U.S. historically.","The idea of going directly to consumer something we have every opportunity to do. We own all of our content. We have super fan groups. So I think we are very well-positioned. We are looking at everything but I think the marketplace at least for the next three years is going to stay relatively stable and we will probably have more people buying our content. And we will be in a position if we want to, at any moment to start picking off some of those super fan groups. That\u2019s what we do in Europe.","Viewership on Eurosport is up, but the people that absolutely love tennis, or love cycling, or love Olympic sports or winter sports, they are signing up for Eurosport and what we are finding is in most cases, they are there watching more Eurosport. But when they're out of their home, they want to be able to watch the sports they like. So for the near-term at least, we are double dipping. And the idea of having more than 300,000 people, we have their credit cards, we have a direct relationship, we could talk to them about what they like about our app, what they don't. We are learning an awful lot. So that if we want to move into any other region, we can.","Doug Mitchelson","Thank so much for all the help, David. ","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne, Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Ben Swinburne","Thank you. Good morning. I have a question for David and then follow-up for Andy. David, on the Olympics, can you just educate us a little bit on the sublicensing and any kind of regulations around keeping Olympic content on broadcast free-to-air? I know you\u2019ve got a lot of markets where you free-to-air and a lot that you don't. And does the sort retrans kick in to this conversation, if you look at the duration of your Olympic deal with your free-to-air networks you started thinking about fighting for retrans fees in some of these markets? Any help would be great.","David Zaslav","Sure. Thanks, Ben. It is complex and I think it's one of our advantages. When you are looking at Europe, you are looking at 55 countries in 20 languages and different regulations in each country. The good news for us is that\u2019s what we do for a living. We are already in all 55 of those countries. We have teams on the ground. We have an infrastructure that converts into every language. And so for us, it is what we do for a living.","On the Olympic side, there are specific restrictions that the IOC has on how much has to be free-to-air for summer and for winter. And in some countries, the requirements that are in addition to the IOC requirements on free-to-air. We own all the rights and so for instance in the U.K., if the BBC has the rights then we would sit down with them historically and we can talk about how much we want to give them. We would look in most cases to preserve all the rights other than free-to-air. So, we could sub distribute the free-to-air rights.","In many markets, we have free-to-air channels that meet the requirements in Italy, in Germany, in Spain, in the U.K., in Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Finland. So there are a lot of markets where we have the free-to-air rights and in that case, we will have to decide are we better off selling it to someone in that market, the free-to-air only? Maybe we sell 60% of the rights, hold back 40% for cable and then hold back all the rights for phone and other devices to go directly.","We have plenty of time to think about it. The good news is it's been just free-to-air. And so when you look back at the early 90s, whenever Saul came up with this idea of you can be your producer. You could watch this on broadcast, swimming, but you could see diving and you could see cycling and you could see judo on cable. We could bring that to Europe and I think it could be quite effective. And we have the ability to make those decisions and we have the ability in many cases in many of the big markets to go all-in ourselves if we want to. And so, I think that gives us very good optionality.","Ben Swinburne","Great. And then Andy, just to clarify on the affiliate revenue growth in the U.S, so make sure I heard you right. So you are saying high single-digit in \u201916. Is there any licensing revenue trends contemplated and are you excluding that? And then it sounded like that was the step-up, so it's sort of -- does it decelerate from there? I just want to make we heard you right because you gave a lot of good information.","Andy Warren","Yeah. That's right, Ben. We are looking at high single-digit next year that does not contemplate any licensing revenues. It's really all about step up. It's all about price escalators and even better than that, we've assumed a slight acceleration of the decline in the sub base.","Ben Swinburne","Okay. And then just on the rating agency comment, you said that they've changed the view of how they're looking at media company, so for us, equity investors. Can you just help us with -- what is your leverage today if you look at it as a rating agency and sort of where does it need to be, just so we can help triangulate all of the moving pieces here?","Andy Warren","The agencies have definitely taken a little more conservative view on the sector in total. When they think about the ad trans and they think about what\u2019s happening with subscriber trends, they\u2019ve taken a little more conservative view. Today, we are at about 3.3 times leverage. They like us to be, kind of in the low three times. So there is definitely little bit of debt paydown here that we want to pursue in the next, kind of six months to get more aligned with where they need to be. The 3.3 by the way is, to your question, the agency define leverage.","Ben Swinburne","Okay. Got it.","David Zaslav","On the subscriber fees, we are not guiding for beyond next year but the high single doesn't reflect a one-time only in terms of where we are. That's not like we're getting a big step-up here in and then there is something coming after that. We are guiding. We are saying that we got -- we are able to get a step-up over the last four years in each deal with significant increases and you'll see that coming through in the years ahead. And we are telling you that next year will be high single.","Andy Warren","Just to elaborate on that, all the deals that we\u2019ve done including the Comcast deal certainly have year-over-year price escalators. So while there is nice step-up in year one beginning in January with Comcast, clearly all of the deals including Comcast have continued escalators beyond \u201916.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Rich Greenfield, BTIG.","Rich Greenfield","Hi. Quick couple of questions. David, I think you mentioned that you didn't have kind of long tail commitments, but as I look at what you're doing now in Europe with the Olympics, it seems like you are actually getting into some of the sports kind of very long-term big number commitment despite the rapidly changing landscape. And then just when you look at your commentary about kind of the ability to hit subscription numbers. ","Clearly, we've gone from a video subscription base that\u2019s been growing to a video subscription base that\u2019s now declining, what gives you confidence that a one percentage decline or even a little bit larger than that is reasonable? Why can it be 4%, 5%? And the same thing with advertising because it seems like both advertising and subscription have gone from growth to kind of flat to negative? What gives you confidence that you can keep them in a moderation on the decline side or even towards flat? Thanks.","David Zaslav","Okay. Why don\u2019t I hit you some quick. First of all, on the advertising side, we saw flat to slightly negative in fourth and first. We are now seeing a rise in advertising. So, I can't opine on where the advertising market is going to go, but I can say that the pricing in scatter has been good and that the market has picked up. I don't know if it will continue to.","On the affiliate side, we\u2019ve been able to get a step-up. So over the last four years, when a new deal comes in, we get a step-up and then we get increases. And even assuming that there's some decline, we see some very good affiliate growth over the next several years and that were okay. And so the way that we look at it is I say, okay, if we got high single affiliate growth, even if there is some decline and if the advertising market is even week, then we still have a mid-single growth business here in the U.S.","And having that with the cost basis that's very manageable and probably lower than most where we get to reuse our content around the world, we then use that mid single growth business to fuel 65% or 70% of the content we need around the world where we are seeing much higher growth.","And most of those countries outside the U.S. are not experiencing what you're talking. They are getting advertising growth. They are getting affiliate growth, our market share is growing. And so I think, we\u2019ve really stabilized the U.S. business. I feel good about it. If you put in a lot of the parade, we still have a nice mid-single growth business.","We\u2019re not assuming that there is a dramatic tilt and tip but I don't see any -- despite all the headlines and discussions, anything that would make me in any way concern that there is a tilt, a meaningful tilt or tip over here. This is a mature market that's showing some decline. And we've stabilized it and we put ourselves in a position for a growth here.","On the Europe side, we've actually done the opposite of what you\u2019ve said. The only big ticket item that we've gotten is the Olympics. We paid a little less than $1.5 billion for four Olympic Games where we have very little cost until 2018. And we begin to get the Olympic library and the rings to use on Eurosport and use on Eurosport.com, which is the leader online beginning right after Rio.","The rest of the sports rights that we've gotten and we've done over 50 deals, our most of the money goes to soccer. Soccer is like the NFL, times two in Europe. And distributors are fighting over who gets to get the soccer. We've opted out of that game. And we think we can get everything else and we can do it on a very reasonable basis and we can monetize it on our European platform and we can monetize it direct to consumer and online.","We carry the clips of soccer on Eurosport.com, which is the equivalent of ESPN.com here in the U.S. it\u2019s the leading online site but we don't need to own soccer. And so we have the Olympics together with a dominant position in everything else, which I think now that we own the Olympics and we have a relationship with the federations, we don\u2019t see that the prices of speed skating is going to go up dramatically.","And in fact in some of the markets where people have bid on soccer, they bid so much money that they\u2019ve come to us and said, would you -- do you want to buy some of our other sports rights because we just had a step up with such increases on soccer. So, we think Eurosport will be EBITDA positive in itself and will lift our overall portfolio.","And when you think of Eurosport as being in a 130 million homes and then another two or three sports channels and you think of where ESPN was years ago, we haven't begun to monetize the subscriber economics. We haven\u2019t begun to aggressively -- we only started selling locally four months ago.","We haven\u2019t begun to monetize the advertising piece. And we have the IP and the Olympics, if we could do a little of what Iger has been able to do over the last 15 years, in gaining significant subscribers, building on the dominant platform that he has, and using it to build the rest of his company, we could have a hell of a business. And he did it with, in a marketplace that has 330 million homes with the leader in sports and have the Olympics in a next decade in a market that has 700 million homes but we\u2019re not going to do the NFL, we\u2019re not going to do soccer.","Rich Greenfield","Very helpful. Thank you for taking the time to answer that in full.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Michael Nathanson, MoffettNathanson. Please proceed.","Michael Nathanson","Thanks. I\u2019ll ask Andy quick one and David, another one. Andy, in terms of the rating agencies, I think some of us assume in the out years, your company, other companies borrow money to buy back stock. Do you know if that is a practice that you think more conservatively the agencies will fed upon in general, just basic to get leverage to buyback equity?","Andy Warren","No. Michael, I think it will. It comes down to an overall growth level of leverage. I think how that capital is deployed is still a very much up to the management teams. And look, for us, when I think about why there is a more nominal constraint for us in \u201815, I see enormous amount of capital growth and accretion in \u201816, based on much higher cash flows and our ability than to put leverage on that growth.","And so to me, I don't see a constraint medium or long term and I see us having full flexibility in how we allocate that capital. This is really more of a short-term nuance just based on where our leverage is today, relative to where we wanted to be at year end.","Michael Nathanson","Okay. And David, something that you\u2019ve not talked about regards to Comcast, is it just for advertising either in VOT or maybe two, otherwise you talk a bit about your view on when do you start monetizing some of those eyeballs that are awful in your feed? And when is that becoming a source of growth for you and for other people?","David Zaslav","Look, I think that what Neil and Brian have built with their platform and X1 is quite compelling and the type of viewership they\u2019re getting and the acceptance of the platform. So, I think the first step for us was to get on it. I think the addressability of advertising, we do have that with some others to the extent that we were able to get that and work with Comcast on that, that will be an upside for us.","Michael Nathanson","Okay.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the presentation over to Mr. Craig Felenstein, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.","Craig Felenstein","Thank you, Anne. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Discovery Communications Fourth Quarter 2011 Earnings Call. Joining me today is David Zaslav, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brad Singer, our Chief Financial Officer.","Hopefully, you have all received our earnings release, but if not, feel free to access it on our website at www.discoverycommunications.com. On today's call, we will begin with some opening comments from David and Brad, after which we will open the call up for your questions. We urge you to please keep to 1 or 2 questions, so we can accommodate as many folks as possible.","Before we start, I'd like to remind you that comments today regarding the company's future business plans, prospects and financial performance are forward-looking statements that we make pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are made based on management's current knowledge and assumptions about future events, and they involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations.","In providing projections and other forward-looking statements, the company disclaims any intent or obligation to update them.

Zaslav","Thanks, Craig. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. 2011 was another fantastic year for Discovery. The company delivered double-digit revenue and OIBDA growth marking our fourth consecutive year of double-digit earnings growth since becoming a public company in 2008.","With the backdrop of global uncertainty, rapid technological advances and increasing competition across platforms, Discovery's ability to grow consistently over that time period underscores the sturdiness of our business model, the opportunity present across our global distribution platform and the universal appeal and long shelf life of our nonfiction content.","Discovery's 2011 results demonstrate our continued focus on creating high-quality programming and then leveraging that content around the globe, as well as across a growing number of digital and consumer platforms. We did benefit from the continued strength of the ad market, both domestically and internationally. But more importantly, the double-digit growth and the sustained operating momentum speaks to our ability to take advantage of the opportunities provided by our unique infrastructure, as well as from an evolving media landscape.","Before we take your questions, let me take a few minutes to highlight some of the initiatives that helped drive our success during this past year and discuss some of the opportunities we expect to leverage in order to sustain this momentum in 2012 and beyond.","Around the world, demand for high-quality content has never been higher. Consumers are watching more television than ever before across traditional and developing distribution channels. Discovery's sustained strategy of building brands and capturing market share by investing on the screen to produce the best creative nonfiction content with great storytelling and compelling characters continues to pay dividends. You've heard me say in the past that while we are a great platform company, with 14 networks domestically and between 2 and 13 channels in over 210 countries globally, we are on a journey to become a great content company as well.","In 2011, we took significant strides toward this goal by strengthening existing networks, extending popular brands around the world, investing in new brands to take advantage of our unique reach and tapping into new opportunities to further monetize our content library.","Discovery Channel is the most widely distributed network in the world and the largest contributor of our overall revenues and cash flow. Approximately 70% of what we create on Discovery in the U.S. gets used in some capacity around the globe, and with that sort of global brand strength, keeping Discovery's domestic content pipeline strong and fresh has been a top priority.","Over the past few years, Discovery's viewership was led primarily by tried and true hits, Dirty Jobs, MythBusters, Man vs. Wild and Deadliest Catch. And while the sustained success of these shows speaks to the durability of our content, we have been extremely focused on developing new tentpoles  to engage audiences and drive viewership growth.","In 2011, we added to our stable of big hits with several returning series delivering significant ratings gains versus a year ago, including Flying Wild Alaska, Sons of Guns and most notably, Gold Rush. Gold Rush grew its viewership 35% versus its first season and is the #1 show in television on Friday nights, beating all other cable networks and broadcast networks. And success begets success as we leverage the larger audiences on these returning series to drive several new series, including Moonshiners. The net result was fourth quarter viewership at Discovery was up 17%, and that momentum has continued into 2012 with viewership in January up versus a year ago.","Helping drive the success last month was another new series launched on the back of Gold Rush, Bering Sea Gold, which delivered the highest-rated premiere of any series in the history of Discovery Channel. So with a bigger stable of returning hits, a great slate of new series and several blue-chip specials, including Frozen Planet, the 7-part documentary series, which is 4-plus years in the making and the successor to Planet Earth. It will debut in March, and it drew a bigger audience than Planet Earth in the U.K. when it ran 2 months ago. Discovery is truly poised to build upon its success this past year.","We also developed additional tentpoles  at other fully distributed networks. TLC delivered its highest viewership among women 25 to 54 in 7 years despite the absence of Sarah Palin's Alaska which aired in the fourth quarter a year ago. TLC has developed several young series to add to its stable of 25 established hits, including first-year  series Long Island Medium, as well as returning series Sister Wives and Next Great Baker, each of which significantly grew their viewership this past season.","Animal Planet, while down in 2011 from its strong performance in 2010, also developed several new hits this past year to complement the continuing success of River Monsters and Whale Wars and has a deeper stable than ever before heading into 2012. Their resurgence is already taking place with the return of Finding Bigfoot, along with the premiere of Gator Boys, helping to drive January viewership up 18%.","Our strongest initiative domestically continues to be the record growth at Investigation Discovery, where we are capitalizing on the opportunity to build this brand and own a popular programming category. ID remains the fastest-growing network in cable. It's hard to keep calling this an emerging network, as it has certainly emerged. ID was a top 10 network for women 25 to 54 in January.","Popular series such as Stolen Voices, Buried Secrets; On the Case with Paula Zahn; and Stalked drove viewership this past year up over 40% in its key demos following over 60% growth in 2010. And its growth is broad based with every night of the week delivering well over 20% growth.","People not only tune into ID but they keep watching. It's the #1 channel in all of television for length of view, making it an even more attractive advertising platform, and we're really capitalizing on its success. ID was the largest driver of our domestic ad growth this past year, and with ratings continuing to rise, we're focused on further driving the CPMs and volume of this network in 2012.","We're also delivering larger audiences at several of our other younger networks including Science and Military, both of which grew viewership this past year. And we took further steps to create additional value for advertisers by rebranding FitTV, Discovery Fit & Health and relaunching HD Theater as Velocity, both of which deliver key advertiser demographics and are attracting larger advertising dollars.","The net result of our content efforts was market share growth in both viewership and advertising dollars. Viewership increased 3% across our portfolio in 2011, and this performance combined with pricing strength as well as increased demand helped us to drive mid-teen ad growth excluding onetime items. This growth, which built upon the 13% growth we delivered in 2010, speaks not only to the strong ad market but to the breadth and depth of the brands we have built, as well as the strategy that our best-in-class ad team formulated to maximize the market and viewership opportunities.","Looking out to 2012 on the domestic ad front, we are off to a great start. And while it's still early, with a strong upfront under our belts, a strong and steady scatter pricing environment, cancellations in line with a year ago and meaningful momentum across our portfolio, we are optimistic that 2012 will be another year of solid ad growth domestically.","Advertising was not the only area where we leveraged the quality and breadth of our content in 2011. We were able to generate significant additional value from tapping into the existing library we built over the last 27 years. As I said last quarter when we announced our Netflix deal, this is a great time to be in the content business. People are watching more TV over multiple platforms, and because we own the majority of our programming, Discovery is particularly well positioned to take advantage of these opportunities. We've said all along that Discovery is platform agnostic with regards to distributing our content, and in 2012, we anticipate additional opportunities to exploit the growing value of our content library.","We also took several steps this year to further build our joint ventures, establishing real building blocks which should help drive viewership in 2012. OWN launched in January, and the network's focus this year was on establishing a foundation for Oprah's arrival on the network. The network learned a great deal about its audience, developing a wide array of new content and formats including several series which will be returning this year, such as Our America with Lisa Ling and Sweetie Pie's. Oprah is now fully engaged with her creative leadership team, and OWN is off to  a nice start in 2012, with her hit show, Oprah's Next Chapter, setting viewing records for the network when it premiered.  Oprah will be featured in additional formats throughout the year, so with sustained support from advertisers and affiliates and with multiple building blocks in place, we're excited to grow this network in 2012.","The Hub also made significant strides during 2011, building its audience every quarter, and in the fourth quarter, our first with apples-to-apples comparisons, The Hub posted 31% gains in total day among kids 2 to 11. With a great slate of both new and returning series set for 2012, it's poised to build its audience in the year ahead.","We are excited about the momentum across our U.S. Network portfolio and the prospects for driving it forward in 2012. But the true differentiator for us is the fact that our International business in 2011 delivered $645 million in OIBDA, up from $250 million 4 years ago, making International more than 1\/3 of our business today.  We have significant opportunities for sustainable growth across our International business given its deep and wide geographic footprint.  We believe we have the best international media business, period. "," There remains strong organic growth in Pay TV globally, which this year helped drive affiliate growth of 11% in local currency terms. And we fully expect Pay TV growth to continue moving forward given that Pay TV penetration is low worldwide including below 40% across Latin America as well as Central and Eastern Europe. However, that is only part of the opportunity. Increased penetration not only drives affiliate revenues but also provides a more attractive platform for advertisers, and we have taken numerous steps to bolster our content and further drive advertising growth.","We said 18 months ago we wanted to build a second global  flagship in the female demo to complement Discovery much like we have here in the United States, and we have done just that with the swift and effective rollout of TLC. Today, TLC is in more than 115 million homes in over 150 markets, making TLC the most distributed female cable brand in the world. And the response from advertisers and viewers alike has exceeded our expectations. In many markets like Poland, Norway, Denmark, Sweden, we have a top network for women already, and the business is making money today.","TLC was not our only new initiative this past year. We also launched 20 new feeds including several free-to-air networks to capitalize on our market position and platform strength. Led by Real Time in Italy, which has become a top 10 network for women in under a year, our free-to-air revenues increased over 65% this year on top of 60% growth a year ago. So we are finding additional avenues of growth even in more competitive markets.","Overall, our new initiatives have already created significant value, contributing nearly half of our 18% ad growth internationally this past year. Our ad sales internationally now exceed $0.5 billion, and we will continue to be opportunistic in taking advantage of the unmatched platform we have built.","It's too early to predict what will happen in 2012, but with penetration of Pay TV continuing, advertising continuing to look stable and growing, and a stronger content position from domestic success and international investment, we're poised to build upon our international growth in the year ahead.","As we look to further exploit the domestic and international potential inherent in our platform, we remain focused on being diligent stewards of our already strong balance sheet. We generated over $1 billion of free cash flow in 2011, and delivering free cash flow remains a priority.","We will only invest additional capital in those opportunities where we see significant upside. We'll continue to invest in content, but we'll do so incrementally, such as we have done with ID and our rollout of TLC globally. At the same time, we'll remain diligent in keeping SG&A cost stable, so we can continue to focus our spending on what goes on the screen.","While investing in our existing content and businesses remains our top priority, we also continue to explore additional ways to deploy capital either through strategic acquisitions or through returning capital to our shareholders.","In 2011, we returned just under $1 billion in capital to our shareholders, and with nearly $900 million still available under our buyback program, we will continue to return capital to shareholders aggressively if it is the best use of our balance sheet.","Before I finish up, I'd be remiss if I did not acknowledge that this is Brad's last earnings call with Discovery. Our new CFO, Andy Warren, will be joining us next month, and I look forward to working with Andy to further drive our business and exploit the growth opportunities that remain ahead for Discovery.","Brad has been a great financial and strategic partner to me and the whole team here at Discovery. Over the last 3 years, he built enormous value for us. He's a brilliant guy. I will miss him personally as well the whole leadership team.","So with that, I'll -- he's going to be with us for another 60 days or so, but I'm going to pass it on to my good friend, Brad Singer.","Bradley E. Singer","Thanks, David. Discovery continued to produce solid operating results during the fourth quarter, as a favorable operating environment enabled us to enjoy double-digit global ad growth and strong international subscriber gains. Total fourth quarter revenues increased 11% compared to the prior year led by 11% domestic revenue growth and 13% international growth excluding the unfavorable foreign exchange impact.","Our total operating expenses were greater than previously anticipated for the quarter. The 12% increase included $20 million of higher content costs from changes in amortization rates at a few networks based on our annual review of airing patterns and increased impairment charges; $7 million of unfavorable FX impact due to significant currency moves in the quarter, which partially reversed in January; and approximately $10 million of accelerating investments in certain future initiatives. Excluding the higher content impairment charges and adverse foreign exchange impact, expenses increased 9%.","As a result of our ability to generate strong global revenue growth, we increased our adjusted OIBDA 8% to $498 million compared to the prior year. Excluding the impact of foreign currency and the de-consolidation of Discovery Health, adjusted OIBDA increased 12%.","Net income increased 71% to $337 million, reflecting our improved operating performance and lower book taxes due to the recognition of $112 million of foreign tax credits offset by $20 million in intangible impairment charges related to our commerce operations.","Our free cash flow increased to $324 million in the fourth quarter, as our solid operating performance was complemented by lower tax payments and favorable working capital.","Looking back on our full year 2011 performance, our ability  to continue to consistently grow revenues, adjusted OIBDA and free cash flow demonstrates the strength and diversity of our operations and our ability to execute in a competitive global environment.","Our team produced 12% revenue and 13% adjusted OIBDA growth. We also generated 21% growth in free cash flow, normalizing for the impact of prior year debt refinancing and timing of tax payments while continuing to invest in our networks and operations worldwide.","Turning to the operating units. Our U.S. operations continued to perform well during the fourth quarter. Domestic revenues grew 11%, with 13% ad revenue growth complemented by 7% domestic affiliate fee growth. Excluding the impact of Discovery Health and positive nonrecurring items, our ad revenue grew 17% and affiliate revenue 8%, robust ad growth due to the performance -- the strong performance of our domestic ad sales team and a favorable pricing and demand environment. For the year, our U.S. sales team again delivered double-digit growth, increasing ad sales 14% excluding the impact of Discovery Health and nonrecurring items, and this was on top of the 13% increase we delivered in 2010.","Our distribution teams equally distinguished themselves with 12% sales growth for the year, including the expanded digital licensing agreement. The attractive current market conditions continue to exist in the first quarter. We anticipate low-double-digit ad growth compared to the prior year, which grew 15% in the first quarter of 2011 adjusted for the impact of Discovery Health.","Our domestic operating expenses increased 10% in the fourth quarter due to higher levels of content investment including $16 million of increased content impairment and accelerated amortization. SG&A expenses grew low-single digits compared to the prior year. For the year, our U.S. domestic team's strong revenue growth was partially offset by the increased investment in content, producing a 10% adjusted OIBDA increase."," ","Turning to our international operations. Revenues increased 13% excluding 1% due to unfavorable exchange rates led by 19% ad and 11% affiliate revenue growth, respectively.","International affiliate revenue was led by strong global subscriber growth, particularly in Latin America, with our most fully distributed network, Discovery Channel, growing subscribers 10% on a global basis. Our 19% international advertising revenue growth was led by Western Europe and benefited typically from the rollout and continued strong performance of Real Time and TLC. We also enjoyed significant growth in CEMEA and Latin America.","Excluding the unfavorable currency impact to our expenses, our operating expenses were up nearly 13%, primarily driven by increased content investment and 3% related to the impairment of certain programming assets along with incremental investment in certain growth initiatives. Excluding the foreign currency impact, our international operations increased adjusted OIBDA 15%.","The fourth quarter capped the international team's terrific performance throughout 2011, with another year of double-digit revenue and adjusted OIBDA growth. For 2011, total revenues grew 13%, and adjusted OIBDA grew 18%, following 22% growth in 2010 excluding the impact of foreign exchange.","As we look forward to 2012, we are encouraged by the fact that the beneficial pricing and ad trends we have experienced in 2011 are continuing in 2012 in the U.S. and for the majority of the markets in our international operations.","For 2012, we are forecasting revenue in the range of $4.45 billion to $4.6 billion. We anticipate adjusted OIBDA of $2.05 billion to $2.15 billion, primarily driven by our revenue growth. Operating expenses are expected to increase low- to mid-single digits in 2012 driven by higher content amortization as well as continued investment in growth initiatives.","Based on the timing of our investment initiatives, we anticipate expense growth to be more weighted in the first half of 2012. For comparative purposes, the midpoint of our guidance excluding the recognition of the large digital distribution agreement in 2011 and 2012 implies revenue growth of 9% and adjusted OIBDA growth of 12%. Our net income is expected to be between $975 million and $1,075,000,000,  as our anticipated strong operating performance will be offset by more normalized tax rate.","Please note that 2011 included a gain of $129 million in the first quarter associated with OWN, as well as a $112 million tax credit recognition in the fourth quarter.","We anticipate generating free cash flow in 2012 at approximately the same levels of 2011, while we expect to significantly improve our cash from operations due to the growth in our revenue. Our increased operating performance is anticipated to be offset by higher cash taxes by approximately $200 million due to the expiration of Section 181 domestic content production deduction. The Section 181 impact is a combination of the elimination of the current year deduction and the 2011 recapture prior year accelerated amortization.","We often incorporate into our free cash flow guidance the beneficial impact to our working capital of the long-term incentive compensation payments that will be -- will likely be at least $75 million less than 2011, as well as the incremental working capital needs due to our growing operations.","With our sturdy financial position and strong operating performance, we invested almost $1.2 billion since the beginning of the year in strategic initiatives and thoughtfully returning capital to our shareholders. We returned almost $1 billion to our shareholders, repurchasing 27 million shares of our Class C shares. Since the initiation of our share repurchase plan in August  2010, we have effectively repurchased 44 million shares, reducing our outstanding share count by 10%.","Our first priority is to invest our capital in our core business to enhance our shareholders' returns. To the extent we have not found opportunities with attractive financial returns, we will likely accelerate utilizing the cash on our balance sheet as well as the cash we generate from operations to repurchase shares.","In closing, we hope everyone tunes in to Discovery for our stunning series Frozen Planet, as well as the return of Long Island Medium on TLC and Tanked on Animal Planet and Deadly Sins on ID.","Before we take your questions, I want to thank all the terrific people at Discovery for making a great company to work in and a special thanks to David and our board for giving me the opportunity to be part of Discovery. Since this is my last earnings call, I also want to thank all of our shareholders and analysts who have helped make being a public company CFO enjoyable.","With that, David and I will happily take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Michael Nathanson with Nomura.","Michael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","So let me ask you guys on advertising because I think it's fair to say that many of your peers so far have come in kind of below refar [ph] on advertising domestically, and it looks like soft scatter was kind of one of the reasons why. So can we just stop and get [ph] some questions on advertising? So one question would be did you sell more of this upfront versus last upfront? And was that one of the reasons why this quarter was better?","David M. Zaslav","Thanks, Michael. Well, we did sell more in the upfront than we have in the past, but we also moved early on scatter, and we found the scatter, really,  the pricing was quite strong throughout the quarter, remains strong, but a lot of the momentum, the fact we were able to -- Joe and his team were able to get 17% growth is our networks were strong. Discovery is really back with a lot of momentum, and we hit all demographics with Discovery male, TLC female, a lot of our other networks working. We also built some of our new networks this year, not just ID but Fit and Health and Velocity and Science kind of having a -- all having a little bit of a stronger profile on the advertising side. And not only do we hit all demos, but ID is enormously strong in daytime. So we tend to really lean on Primetime, but ID provided a great vehicle for us as the top network in America in daytime.  And so it's all of that and together with Joe Abruzzese, I think, being the master of managing inventory and at motivating a great sales team. And so it was a great result for the year and a very strong performance in maximizing our rating points in the quarter.","Michael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. Can I ask you just 2 follow-ups? One was how much did ID contribute as a percentage of growth. In the past it's been about 1\/4 to 30% or so of growth in the quarter. Is that a fair assessment this quarter?","David M. Zaslav","We don't speak to specifics, but we -- with ID now in 80 million homes and having to be a top 10 network, it's going to take a while for us to get the CPMs where we think they should be. But we have a team really focused on that, and it is becoming a bigger contributor, and we expect over the next 2 and 3 years as we get paid commensurate with the value that we're providing that it'll  be an even bigger growth provider.","Bradley E. Singer","And, Michael, to put it numerically, about 2\/3 of the growth was price and volume, so the market, and about 1\/3 was audience.","Michael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. And then  last, what about the NBA strike? I know you guys don\u2019t have any NBA, so was that -- do see money that may have been coming from NBA-targeted  dollars coming to you guys?","David M. Zaslav","Yes, it's hard to tag  any of that as being a benefit. I'm sure generically, it was helpful that, that male demo was available, but we can't draw any direct lines as to whether that was helpful or how much.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Spencer Wang with Credit Suisse.","Spencer Wang - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Since, Brad, it's your last call, I'm focusing my questions for you. I was wondering if, Brad, you could give us some more color on the -- what's prompting the change in the amortization rates. Are you guys effectively shortening the amor life for certain programming? So any color there would be helpful. And then what are you assuming in your revenue guidance for 2012 with respect to FX and any sort of incremental digital deals?","Bradley E. Singer","Sure. With regard to amortization rates, every year, we do once a year a study of our airing patterns to see what's the appropriate rate to amortize. And so for the big fully distributed networks, that generally hasn't changed. We do 50% the first year, 25% the second, 15% the third and 10% the fourth. The younger networks, because they are younger,  generally have some change. So we had about a $10 million dollar adjustment to several of the younger networks that -- and it reflects the full year amortization that you take in that one quarter you do the study. And that's what happened. So usually, it's been de minimis. This year it happened to be about $10 million. With regard to FX, it has almost no impact over the course of 2012. It will have more of an impact in the first half of the year and less in the second half, is kind of how it'll run through based on current rates. And with regard to digital distribution deals, our guidance only incorporates what we have signed today and announced. It doesn't have anything that we are working on or have not announced yet.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Two questions. One, and maybe you mentioned this in prepared remarks, but if you had any guidance for your cash investment in programming in '12, roughly growth rates versus '11 that would be helpful. And then, David, as you look to TV Everywhere, I'm wondering if you think there's an opportunity to potentially open up some contracts earlier than they were normally expiring, given we're seeing such an increased demand from the distributors to put stuff on an authenticated platform. I know your contracts sort of start to renew next year, and it sort of builds over the next couple of years, but do you think there's an opportunity to start doing some deals earlier to help generate incremental revenue and also give distributors access to more programming across more platforms?","Bradley E. Singer","I'll take the first one, Ben, on just on the cash investment. What our guidance would imply is a high-single-digits cash investment in programming for next year.","David M. Zaslav","On the TV Everywhere, Ben, our deals come up beginning at the end of this year and then they're kind of staggered, but we are in agreement with all of our distributors that our existing deals do not provide for them to have any rights to TV Everywhere for any of our content, which is a good thing. We own all of our content and with our networks and our brand stronger, we love TV Everywhere. We think it's a good opportunity for viewers to consume more of our content. We're happy about the fact that the distributors are deploying it. Right now, we're in a discussion of what's the value. We think that there's  substantial value there. And if we can agree on value, then you'll see our content on TV Everywhere, and it might be a TV Everywhere deal. It might be a deal where we give TV Everywhere and we extend early. But it really is going to depend on us coming to an agreement with the distributors on what's fair value for all of our content on TV Everywhere, which today is not just streaming of content on other platforms, but it's the ability to pull down and watch specific shows that you've missed.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Doug Mitchelson with Deutsche Bank.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I assume you're going to the buy side because you want to talk to all of us more often without this Reg FD thing in the way. But we need at least one arcane  accounting question for you, so on Section 181 impact, can you walk us through how that carries forward into 2013? Is that an easy comp in 2013 for free cash flow to the extent there's sort of a catch-up in '12? And then for -- David, I think this is implicit in the comment that you're going to continue to do online deals, but just hoping for an update on what you're seeing in terms of potential for online cannibalizing traditional viewing. You mentioned in the last call you continue to study that data, so any update on what you're seeing there would be helpful.","Bradley E. Singer","Sure, Doug. The way it works for Section 181 is you had an immediate deduction of your domestic content, and now we're going to be deducting it over the 4-year amortization cycle, which would be what  -- kind of what I outlined as 50% the first year, 25% the second, 15% the third and 10% the fourth. And so that'll -- what your previous deductions that you accelerated will reverse over those 4 years, and your current deductions will then build over those 4 years. And so you'll have a lessening effect each of the next 4 years as you move forward. And all of -- anyone who produces domestic content, our peers, too, will all have the same consideration to sweep the bigger threat [ph].","David M. Zaslav","On the new platforms,  as you'd expect, we're in discussions with a number of players that are interested in a window similar to Netflix, which is 18 months plus, and then as we just discussed TV Everywhere, which is a tighter window. It's really too early to tell, Doug. From the data that we've seen so far, it doesn't seem it's -- the viewership is pretty spread across a lot of our different shows, and we have not seen anything that would indicate to us that this is cannibalizing us. We're excited about this window, this 18-month window. It provides meaningful incremental value to us. We like the fact that there are other players in the marketplace, but we're going to watch it. It's one of the reasons we did a -- we restructured our deal with Netflix as a 2-year deal with a right for us to extend for one year because we want to take a hard look at behaviorally how is our content consumed and then what impact, either positive or negative, it has on viewership. So far, we haven't seen any.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of David Bank with RBC Capital Markets.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Brad, I want to say goodbye, and as a goodbye gift, I have 2 questions for you, hopefully, since you can't not take me for the next call. The first question will be  real quick. Can you give us a sense of how Oprah equity income or loss kind of trends in your guidance for next year? And the second is if you look at next year and your sort of content amortization versus cash spend, can you talk about how the delta looks between those 2 items next year versus this year?","Bradley E. Singer","David, what I'd say is we don't comment on any of our individual networks in terms of their profitability, but we incorporate it into our guidance, so that's how -- I think that's a consistent comment whether it's in equity pickup or it comes through above the line. With regard to the delta between amortization and cash, it generally runs -- this year, it ran around $30 million to $40 million. It should be somewhere in that same area because you're always slightly behind when -- in terms of your spending, as the spending is modestly -- is increasing in that kind of the high-single digits.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, so a similar delta.","Bradley E. Singer","Yes, that's right.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Jessica Reif-Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jessica Reif Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I have a question on affiliate renewals. David, you said they start coming up at the end of this year. Can you kind of size what percentage of your subs come up over the next 1, 2 and 3 years? And so upfront's  more about like positioning. A lot of the cable operators have reported, and they talked about or they've given guidance of high-single digits in programming expenses. Is this the right range to think about for you guys? Or given your ratings growth since the last contract, should you be at a completely different level?","David M. Zaslav","We don't break out when our deals come up, but our focus has been over the last couple of years and it's going to continue to be for this year and next year, is to make our channel stronger. All of our channels come up at the same time, which is helpful. And we have seen a building on some of our niche channels. We have Discovery Espa\u00f1ol. It's either the #1 or 2 network in America for men in the Hispanic space; having TLC continue to be #1 or 2 for women 1 or 2 nights a week, hopefully, even maybe 3 as we approach those negotiations; having Discovery back really strong. We're the #1 network in America including the broadcasters on Friday nights, making Science a more compelling niche channel, having ID be a top 10 network for women. All of those I think give us stronger hand, and when we look, we see we're growing our market share and how does our market share trends -- how does that market share align with the amount of value that we're getting from the distributors, and so we expect to go to the distributors, hopefully, with a lot more value and they get to sell our channels. And we'll be looking for more value, and we'll -- we think that we'll do well, and we'll see how it goes.","Jessica Reif Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then I just want to -- in the guidance, is there any, I mean, do you -- implications of rebranding Planet Green or reinvesting or rebranding any another channel?","Bradley E. Singer","Our guidance has a broad enough range that we have a -- certain growth initiatives whether it's rebranding or doing anything along those lines internationally, domestically that incorporates our current plans.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Richard Greenfield with BTIG.","Richard Greenfield - BTIG, LLC, Research Division","A couple of questions. The first one, David, you definitely sounded more upbeat about OWN, but this is a channel that's had pretty constant management upheavals  over the last couple of years, and I think consumers are still struggling to even know the channel that OWN is actually on. I was just wondering from just an agreement standpoint what are your rights actually to terminate the joint venture and actually use that channel position in some other way, meaning could you turn Oprah into a digital channel -- an online network and repurpose the actual channel position? And then secondly, a question that ties onto something Brad mentioned recently in an investor conference, if Discovery was actually offered rate card to distribute its entire suite of networks bundled with some of the other channel groups, somewhat of a new MVPD on kind of a non-facilities-based MVPD, would you do that? And what are the issues surrounding doing it?","David M. Zaslav","Okay, thanks, Rich. Well, first, let me talk about OWN. We took a platform that was in 80 million homes, and we've done a very good job of building the 2 revenue streams. We've done deals with most of the distributors for meaningful subscriber fees, and on the advertiser side, we have good advertising support. We're up for about a year. The mission is to grow an audience. If we grow an -- a meaningful audience that wants to spend time with OWN,  and we think that we will,  this will be a very significant asset. It takes time to do that. We now have Oprah. She was on the air on this past Sunday night. She was on last night with an Oscar special. She's on with a Whitney special tonight. She's very engaged. We have a good team, a team that she has confidence in and I have confidence in now. And over the next year or 2, if we build that audience, this is going to be a very strong asset. So we feel good about that. On the rate card piece of the overbuilder, look at it this way. We're completely platform agnostic. This is a great time to be in the content business because there -- we've got people that want our content in new Windows. We got people -- we got operators that want our content for TV Everywhere. We got our traditional business of cable through the cable and satellite guys, and if there are other players there that come that want to provide us meaningful value to distribute our content, we're going to focus on what we always do: How will that content be distributed? Are we getting fair value for it? In the end, if there are bundles that are provided much like if you go down to Latin America and some of the emerging markets, there are new tiers that are developing that are kind of low start-up tiers to where there's an emerging middle class. And on those tiers, we tend to do very well because instead of being much more robust, there are fewer channels, and we have a lot more of the space. If in fact there are -- the traditional distributors or new distributors offer smaller packages and we have an opportunity to get fair value and have a meaningful amount of the space, then that's likely to be attractive to us. We'll have to see each one as they develop and both the economics and the impact that it might have on the traditional business.","Richard Greenfield - BTIG, LLC, Research Division","Do you think that latter point could actually happen at some point over the course of the next 12 months  we could see some -- one of those players actually emerge with you?","David M. Zaslav","Well, a number of the traditional cable operators are starting to offer, Time Warner has, smaller packages of services, which as long as a lot of our channels are carried, which they have been in some of the early rollouts, in some of the traditional distributors, that's a favorable to us. If we're -- it's sort of like we have 7 HD channels. When -- every time a consumer gets HD, that's good for us. We have a lot of HD channels. It's a very favorable environment. And so if there's only 30, 40, 50 channels and we have 7 of them, that's a good environment for us. If there's another tier that has fewer channels and we have a big piece of it and the economics are strong for us, that's favorable. If it's a new technology that provides meaningful economics to us, that's favorable. But the last one we'll have to look at and make sure that it doesn't undermine the existing infrastructure.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just circling back on your comments on TLC's strength in Europe, I guess, can you give us a bit more color on which of your major countries there -- I guess, how the major countries performed in that region? And then more specifically, any notable change so far in 2012 from the strong Q4 performance you've seen in Europe?","David M. Zaslav","Well, TLC continues -- it's continuing to grow. What we call Real Time in Italy is essentially our female -- we don\u2019t call it TLC in Italy, but it's one of the top -- it's a top network for women, and it's continuing to grow and it's profitable, and we're doing very well with that. In Norway, Denmark, Sweden, very strong and Poland strong. We're seeing growth pretty much across the board. We just launched in Latin America where it's too early. We have a very strong female network already in Latin America called Home & Health, which is a top 20 network. And so we're going to see over the next 6 months whether we get the same kind of traction in Latin America, but throughout Europe, it's been quite strong.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And really no change so far in 2012 in terms of looking if there's any signs of deterioration in those markets?","David M. Zaslav","No, if anything, it's -- we're continuing to grow, so it looks good so far.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Vasily Karasyov with Susquehanna Financial Group.","Vasily Karasyov - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","My question is about International distribution revenue. It looks like it accelerated in local currency terms in 2011, and that was probably not the conventional wisdom a year ago. So should -- and that's probably because of your expansion in Latin America. So my question is do you expect more expansion in Latin America or you're pretty much done at this point? And then as a result of this, should we expect re-acceleration in International advertising revenue growth soon as you monetize the new subscribers?","David M. Zaslav","Let me take the first part of it, and then Brad will get it. I was just -- spent last week in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia, where we have 11 channels. We just opened an office there. We have about 16 people. It's a strong market for us. We were there really to focus on building our advertising business in Bogot\u00e1, but we also announced that we did a joint venture with the Colombian government. We met with President Santos, and together, we announced the first joint programming arrangement between the Colombian government and a programmer. And so we're -- Latin America is a very big market for us. There's more than 20% growth across the board. In some of the markets, more like 30 plus. And so we have 11 channels in Brazil, 10 channels in Mexico, 10 in Argentina. So that's a market we've been in for a very long time, and we're going to continue to invest. We also have, in addition to Discovery Animal Planet, we just launched TLC. We have Home & Health, but we also have Discovery Kids, which is unique. It's only in Latin America. But in many of the markets, for instance in Brazil, Discovery Kids is the #1 network, cable network in all of Brazil. It's like the USA of Brazil, and Discovery Kids does very well particularly with the 6 and under group, and there's a lot of co-viewing with women. And so Latin America is an area that we're continuing to push on.","Bradley E. Singer","Vasily, to answer your question on the acceleration, part of why the growth rate is higher is last -- in the beginning of 2011 and in the latter part of 2010, we had renegotiated one of our contracts where we had a reduction because we took Real Time off of the pay platform in Italy and put it onto  the free to air. And that's why you  -- we traded affiliate feeds for much -- for higher advertising fees. And so that helped our growth rate in advertising but had a detrimental effect on the affiliate rate. Now once you lapped yourself annually, that's when you saw us go back to that double-digit affiliate growth, and that's really driven by the subscriber growth globally. And what we've seen over the last couple of years is we've had a double-digit Discovery sub growth, and that's what drives it. It hasn't really accelerated. It's just maintained a pretty steady robust rate. And in terms of advertising, advertising has been very solid. Part of it is we'd outperformed the market especially in Western Europe, which something like the U.K. is not a robust market, but because if we do things like launch TLC and have Real Time, we grow our market share as well as have new channels. That's what's enabled us to continue to outperform ","market, as well as take advantage of growing markets like Russia or Latin America or India. So hopefully that answers your question.","Vasily Karasyov - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Yes. So Brad, should we expect re-acceleration in 2012?","Bradley E. Singer","We have -- we incorporate into our guidance, is the way we phrase it, which is we think in many parts of the world that you have the same conditions that exist into the future, but it has a range of outcomes within there.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Anthony DiClemente with Barclays.","Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division","One for Brad and one for David. Brad, sorry if you said this, but what were affiliate of -- what was affiliate fee growth excluding digital revenue in the quarter? And then looking forward, I think you said last quarter that you'd  expect the digital revenue to add 200 to 300 basis points of -- to the distribution growth rate. Is that smoothly reported throughout 2012? If you could give us a little bit as we model out affiliate fees in 2012 on a quarterly basis, that would be great. I know you had the tough comp in the third quarter. And then I have a follow-up for David.","Bradley E. Singer","Sure. Anthony, it added 2 -- a couple of hundred basis points to the growth rate, so it's consistent. That's why we had an 8% growth rate and you added  a couple of hundred basis points. It is not smooth next year. It depends on when we deliver titles. So you're going to have some lumpiness in some quarters, but over the course of it, it's that 200 to 300 basis points.","Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And then, David, you've talked a lot about your content strategy. I'd love to hear more about your sales effort and what Joe Abruzzese is doing because if I look at -- if we look at your performance versus the peers and then index that to your ratings, there's really a multi-quarter outperformance story, and so I'm just trying to get behind what's going on with the sales organization. Is it -- have you hired more sales people? Is it how you're motivating the sales force? Like what's the magic that Joe's adding to the mix here?","David M. Zaslav","Well, we do have a very good team. We haven't added to the team. We have a good performance-driven  comp structure, but I think part of it is that the channels are getting better, and a lot of the channels that we had were getting very low CPMs. And we're building those channels, and the brands are getting stronger. And it's not just ID. Whether it's Velocity or Science, we're building stronger channels, Animal Planet. So I think that the overall focus on just building market share, building brand, but we did focus specific teams on each of the channels.  And Joe has been very aggressive about looking at our CPMs because in the long term, the CPMs are going to -- is what's really going to drive us, and I think we have a lot of headroom on that particularly with some of our younger channels, and so we measure that. But also it's a good inventory management by Joe, and he's moved aggressively in scatter early. He did very good job with the upfront, which I think was good for everybody. But overall, I think it's mostly Joe doing a good job and our channels having momentum.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Tuna Amobi with Standard & Poor's.","Tuna N. Amobi - S&P Equity Research","So first for Brad. I wanted to send you off with my own 2 questions as well, both related to the guidance. So on net income, if your guidance is correct, this would be actually the first year that the streak that David talked about, a consecutive growth in net income, will be broken. So as I look deeper, it seems to me that most of that may have to do with the other expense items, granted that interest expense you're looking for an increase. So I'm trying to understand what else is in there that would account for that disparity in net income. And also on the free cash, if you x out the Section 181 issue that you talked about and the incentive compensation on the working capital, is there anything else on the working capital swing that may account for why we're not seeing a major bump-up in free cash? Those clarifications would be helpful. And then I have a follow-up for David.","Bradley E. Singer","Sure. Net income this year in 2011 had onetime items that were positive, so we're not going to have those in 2012. We had over $100 million gain when we contributed the Health Network to form  Oprah Winfrey Network. It was a book gain, not cash. And we also had a tax credit related to our tax reorganization of $112 million. Those 2 things are not going to happen in 2012. So in 2012, you have the nice operating growth performance, but you don't have these special onetime items that were positive in 2011. In terms of free cash flow and working capital, we have the $75 million lower long-term incentive plan payments, but we also -- because we're a growing entity and we're growing our revenue, that takes working capital. So you're going have somewhat, almost an equal amount of increase in whether it's accounts receivable or other parts of working capital to fund your growth, and that goes into when we think of our overall free cash flow.","Tuna N. Amobi - S&P Equity Research","Okay, that's helpful. And for David, as you think about this beta survey that I guess the most recent one showing that you guys also have surpassed ESPN as the most important cable brand, I believe this isn't the first time that you've actually done that. So -- and looking ahead as you enter your affiliate negotiations by the end of the year, is that something that you think that kind of gives you a stronger hand? Is it something that perhaps enhances your leverage as you talk to the cable operators? I'm not saying that you necessarily are shooting for the kind of CPMs that ESPN is getting, but I would imagine that given this study, I would expect that you'd be talking that up more than you appear to be doing. And how should we think about that as you enter the negotiations here?","David M. Zaslav","Well, as I said, all of our channels come up at once. We do think that Discovery, as an overall brand around the world, is premiere and has been.  But the fact that subscribers in a cable operator study came back and said that Discovery was the most valued brand on cable, it -- that's a helpful piece of information. And it says that Eileen O'Neill,  who's been building that channel with the new creative team that we have there, together with having a number of new hits,  has done a good job of connecting with the consumer. So I think it's certainly helpful. Our goal is to get more people spending more time with our channels, and so when we sit down with the -- all of the distributors, that they recognize the value that we're bringing them, and it's certainly helpful that their study shows us as #1.","Operator","And our last question comes from David Miller with Caris & Company.","David W. Miller - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","David, as you may know, Lionsgate  is putting up for sale, or at least they're intimating that they're putting up for sale, their 51% interest in TV Guide. That's a fully distributed piece of analog real estate. I know you can't comment specifically on whether you're interested in TV Guide. But if other sort of fully distributed pieces of real estate like that come up for sale, is that something you're willing to take a look at? Or do you feel like your platform is already pretty much kind of the way you want it just from a profile perspective? And then I have a follow-up for Brad.","David M. Zaslav","Okay. Thanks, David. Well, we look at everything and if we think that there are assets out there that'll  help us grow faster, we have a great business development team and we have the balance sheet to do it. We don't comment on specific assets, but we do look at everything, and we've been spending a lot of time. I've said for a long time that one of our priorities is to continue to build on the fact that we have a very unique international infrastructure with teams on the ground all over the world. So I think our -- for us, our first hope would be if we could find more sustainable growth with strong assets that we could partner with our existing infrastructure outside of the U.S. But we do look here, and we're opportunistic if something presents itself.","David W. Miller - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then, Brad, on the recognition of foreign tax credits as a result of the reorg of certain international operations, could you just expound on that briefly if you don't mind? I'm not sure I'm really understanding what's going on there.","Bradley E. Singer","Sure. In November, we reorganized certain parts of our international operations to just strategically align the structure, as well as defer non-U.S. earnings. So as a result of the reorganization, we were able to utilize these tax credits to offset the transitionary costs as well as some ongoing costs. And so that's -- it's a GAAP entry. What you're going to have is it'll play itself out over the next 3 or 4 years, the utilization of those credits.","Craig Felenstein","Thank you for joining us, everybody, and please give us a call with any follow-up questions.","David M.

We reported record revenues, profit and free cash flow and took a number of important steps to ensure our continued success and growth in today\u2019s rapidly evolving media and technology landscape. I will spend a few minutes detailing some of the year\u2019s most important highlights and how they position us for the future before turning it over to Andy for a detailed review of our financials.","First, let me start with an update on Eurosport and the Olympic Games, which as you know, are a key pillar of our international growth strategy. Starting January 1 and as we ramp up for the 2018 Winter Games in the Pyeongchang, South Korea, Eurosport is now the official home to the Olympics in Europe for the next four games. We will have an opportunity to reach over 740 million people. We will also be the exclusive home for the Olympic Games in Sweden and Norway, where winter sports are hugely important, and in Germany, the continent\u2019s largest market. In all three markets, we will deliver the Olympic Games across all of our owned platforms and services, including free-to-air, pay-TV, digital and OTT.","Many of you have had questions about our investment in the Olympics and other sports rights in Europe. Our strategy has been first, to assure that Eurosport will always be profitable. Second, to selectively increase investments, including around locally important sports rights, leverage these must-have popular sports to drive significant affiliate growth. And as affiliate growth continues to accelerate, ultimately, realize profit expansion. And I am pleased to say our strategy is showing strong progress. And as you look at the aggregate we spend on sports rights, it\u2019s important to note that, over the last few years, we have paid only low to mid single-digit inflation on our sports rights as a whole. We have stayed clear, in most cases, of in-market football, where increases can be between 50% and 100%. In fact, I believe the high price of football across Europe has made all of our other sports rights more affordable for us.","Eurosport helped us grow international affiliate revenues in 2016 by 10%. Our local, premium and exclusive sports rights drove Eurosport viewership up 23% in the fourth quarter and we recently had record ratings across all of Europe during the Australian Open, where we have exclusivity in the majority of our markets. With Eurosport leading the charge for our diversified and differentiated offering of about 10 channels per country, we expect our international affiliate growth to accelerate by at least a couple of 100 basis points in 2017, adding over $215 million in affiliate revenues, ex-FX, building off successful renewals with TDC, Telenor and Liberty Global, and most recently, Sky.","While we never look forward to potential carriage standoff, the negotiation with Sky reaffirmed the strong value of our brand portfolio and the passion and engagement of our super fan communities. Our new agreement with Sky in the key UK and German markets includes new opportunities to launch new channels and services. So, we will be helped with more growth in the two biggest media markets in Europe in the years ahead. We will have more news to share in the coming weeks as we will be launching new services, including a second free-to-air channel in the UK, leveraging our strong existing IP to reach more viewers in the UK market, and the new free-to-air channel will make money for us this year.","Another large potential growth opportunity for us is for Eurosport Player. The team is making great progress on our Sports Netflix strategy, which will use BAMTech\u2019s best-in-class streaming video technology, allowing for enhanced feature functionality, variable pricing and gives us tremendous scale across the European continent. Our new team, under the leadership of Paul Guyardo, who built DirecTV\u2019s NFL Sunday Ticket and Sports Packages business to an over $2 billion business, is currently pivoting the business away from a one-size-fits-all model. The team is building bottoms up, country by country, business plans with custom pricing and packaging, tailored to the rights we have in each market. Early results in testing various consumer packages are promising, including in the UK, where we have seen 150% increase in subscribers in the market. Of course, our world class content is only as good as viewers\u2019 ability to see it. And in 2016, we continued to enhance our distribution reach to reach more viewers across more screens. Following our successful renewal with AT&T in July, we have no deals up in the U.S. in the near-term.","As we look ahead, our strong affiliate deals in the U.S. and abroad, which represent half of our total revenues, provides a valuable growing foundation for our revenue base at a time when global advertising markets remain very difficult to predict. Paul is also leading our pivot to mobile and the drive to monetize our content across all platforms. We have been very pleased with the progress of our recently launched TV Everywhere GO family of apps. Today, GO, is available in more than 80% of U.S. pay-TV households, so to over 150 million people. And we have expanded our content portfolio to now showcase over 5,000 episodes. We are finding that GO is a great vehicle for reaching younger viewers with about 40% of our viewers ages 18 to 34, averaging 1-hour length of tune-in. With GO now super serving super fans and gaining momentum with viewers and younger viewers, we are undoubtedly directly connecting to our viewers and fortifying the pay-TV ecosystem, while achieving premium CPMs. In the first quarter, our GO apps will contribute over 1 point of U.S. advertising growth to the bottom line. And its contribution is trending to increase to 2% by the end of the year. I am very confident in our ability to continue monetizing this important and growing platform.","Second, our original non-linear brands took an important step forward with our recent joint venture and commercial partnership with Group Nine, home to leading short-form and mobile first brands, including Now This, the number one news publisher on Facebook, Thrillist and The Dodo, with over 4 billion monthly streams across Facebook and all platforms in January. While our partnership is still in its early days, we are already working together to sell our Group Nine brands in conjunction with our GO apps and our linear brands to deliver a true 360-degree solution that targets a younger audience to our advertisers. We are excited for the opportunity to further attract and monetize younger audiences across social media and short-form video.","Third, in niche categories where we have a dominant consumer and brand advantage, such as ID and Turbo Velocity, we see huge potential to expand these genres on and off the traditional TV screen, such as through dedicated digital only content verticals, SVOD channels and through partnerships such as our recent agreement with Amazon. In mid-November, we launched our first dedicated Amazon SVOD channel. True crime files by our ID is already seeing strong success. In just 2.5 months, we are already seeing 10,000 new net subscribers per month paying $4 a month. This is just the first of several niche verticals we have planned to introduce as we continue to monetize our library content on a direct-to-consumer basis.","Lastly, we are making real strides internationally with Discovery Kids Play, our TV Everywhere product in Latin America, which is now running with 24 providers in 12 countries. More broadly, our international business showed strong momentum with viewers during 2016. Our international portfolio recorded its highest international delivery yet, with year-over-year audience increase of 3%. ID and Turbo saw a strong double-digit viewership gains in the fourth quarter and Discovery Kids reported its highest audience delivery ever across the Latin America region. Additionally, in the Nordics, where we have noted challenges before due to rapidly changing viewer habits and tastes, we now have a new management team in place that is rethinking the way we operate in that region. They are laser-focused on rightsizing the cost structure and restructuring the content portfolio. In the fourth quarter, we wrote down over $20 million of content that wasn\u2019t working and that the team looks to pivot away from an over-reliance on U.S. studio content to more cost-efficient local programming, a model that has worked well in other international markets where we have big free to air general entertainment services.","I will note that looking beyond SBS\u2019 income statement impact, our initial $1.7 billion investment 4 years ago has already delivered over $0.5 billion in free cash flow, and we expect it to continue to be a strong free cash flow asset for us. Now while we have talked to all of you a lot lately about our international story, we are also able to report strong and steady growth in key areas in the United States and that all starts with our commitment to compelling, quality content. In the U.S., our biggest momentum story right now is TLC. TLC showed a very encouraging return to growth in the U.S. in the fourth quarter that continues into the current quarter. TLC ended January with its highest ratings in 3 years, with ratings up double-digits in the U.S. and also in many key international markets, including Germany, Chile and Mexico. Our growth in market share for women also includes our partnership with Oprah Winfrey, which continues to be a tremendous success with OWN posting its best year ever in 2016. With popular hits like the Haves and Have Nots and Greenleaf, OWN was once again the number one cable network for African-American women.","Our third female flagship, Investigation Discovery, continues to have strong and steady growth. ID is now the number two pay-TV network in all day delivery in the U.S. with a strong and balanced delivery across daytime, prime and late-night. ID also shattered audience records in multiple markets internationally in the fourth quarter, including Brazil, Chile and the Netherlands. The female audience growth at TLC, ID and OWN serves as a great complement to our strong male brands and the packaging we can offer to advertisers and clients looking to find any demo and audience segment. The Discovery Channel finished 2016 as the number one non-sports cable network for men. And while we remain by and large focused on unscripted content and had strong performance across many franchises, we are having initial success around the world with our scripted tentpole strategy.","Rich Ross and the team\u2019s first big scripted project, Harley and the Davidsons, was the number one rated cable miniseries in more than 3.5 years in the U.S. and was a top premiere in many international markets, reaching more than 43 million viewers globally. And we are excited about a new scripted series to debut later this year titled, Manhunt, about the pursuit of Unabomber, Ted Kaczynski that has an all-star cast attached. As we look ahead, supported by brands and IP that truly matter to our super fans, we are simultaneously driving as much value as possible from our linear businesses while making smart digital and mobile investments. From Group Nine, to BAMTech Europe, to Discovery GO, we are excited about expanding our content across numerous platforms around the world.","Lastly, as you well know, this is Andy Warren\u2019s final call as CFO. A public thanks can\u2019t do justice to Andy\u2019s contribution over the last 5 years, but it\u2019s a start. A big thank you to you, Andy, for being an essential part of the Discovery family all these years and for all the success you have helped us to achieve. Our new CFO, Gunnar Wiedenfels will be joining us April 1 from Germany\u2019s ProSieben. Gunnar brings to Discovery expertise across multiple businesses, including digital and direct-to-consumer, where he was able to either build or enhance the ProSieben businesses in both those areas, as well as extensive knowledge of the European and international TV markets. Before joining ProSieben, Gunnar worked at McKinsey and was very instrumental in evaluating all of the European media markets. So we are looking forward to seeing Gunnar. We bid a fond farewell to Andy. The transition has been terrific. And so for the last time, here is Andy with more details on our financials.","Andy Warren","Thanks David and thank you, everyone for joining us today. 2016 marks a great end to my 5-year tenure with Discovery. I am very pleased with our 2016 performance and our continued execution on our stated strategic and financial goals. On our 2015 year end call a year ago, we issued full year 2016 guidance of constant currency adjusted EPS and free cash flow both up low double-digits to low teens. We also said that our 2016 effective tax rate would be below 30% and that we would have full year constant currency margin expansion. Throughout last year, we raised our financial commitments for constant currency adjusted EPS and free cash flow both for 2016 and our 3-year 2015 to 2018 growth CAGR guidance. We also exceeded our effective and cash tax rate forecasts and met our margin growth commitments. I really am extremely pleased that in this constantly evolving and challenging global media and economic landscape, we have been able to deliver upon or exceed all of our financial guidance commitments.","For full year 2016, reported revenues were up 2% and adjusted OIBDA was up 1%. Excluding currency, revenues were up 4% and adjusted OIBDA was up 5% and total company margins expanded to 37%. On an organic basis, so excluding the impact of foreign currency and last year\u2019s SBS Radio sale, total company revenues and adjusted OIBDA both grew 5%. I am proud that we were again able to deliver robust financial results while at the same time continuing to thoughtfully invest and strengthen our global IP platforms and brands.","Full year net income available to Discovery Communications of $1.194 billion was up 15% versus last year driven by the strong operating results, below the line currency effects, gains from dispositions and lower taxes. Our full year effective tax rate was reduced by 600 basis points to 27% as we remain highly focused on maximizing the construct of our portfolio of global businesses to lower both our effective and cash tax rates. We have obviously been very successful in achieving both objectives with additional tax rate reductions expected in 2017.","Full year reported EPS was up 24% to $1.96 and adjusted EPS, which adjusts for the impact from acquisition-related non-cash amortization of intangible assets, was up 21% to $2.13 driven by our solid operating results and a reduction in our effective tax rate. Adjusted EPS, excluding FX, the third quarter Lionsgate write-down and the fourth quarter Group Nine gain, was up 20%. For the full year, free cash flow increased 9% to $1.29 billion, primarily driven by improved operating results and lower cash taxes. Excluding the impact of currency, our full year free cash flow was up fully 21%.","Focusing now on only our fourth quarter results. Reported total company revenues were up 2% and reported adjusted OIBDA was up 1%. Excluding the impact of currency, revenues were up 4% and adjusted OIBDA was up 3%. Looking at our individual operating units, our U.S. Networks had another solid quarter. Fourth quarter U.S. affiliate revenues were up 6% as we continue to benefit from higher contracted affiliate rate partially offset by declining subscribers. Excluding a few small one-time items, 4Q growth would have been 7%. Total portfolio of subs in the fourth quarter declined by just under 3% year-over-year, a slight acceleration from the third quarter, driven by subscriber losses at our smaller networks due to package mix as distribution platforms with these smaller nets under basic tiers lost subs, while platforms without these networks on lower tiers gained subs. Subscriber trends for the Discovery Network and our other fully distributed nets were stable with prior quarters.","As we look ahead at 2017, given our high single-digit pricing CAGR and assuming universe declines stay relatively consistent, we expect our U.S. affiliate revenue to grow at least mid single-digits given we now have lapped the significant year one step-up rate increase at one of our largest distribution partners. Fourth quarter U.S. advertising revenues were up 1%, primarily due to strong pricing as well as proactively managing inventory at certain networks to take advantage of the robust scatter market, partially offset by ratings declines.","As we look ahead to the first quarter of 2017, we are seeing similar positive ad market trends. While delivery is down, pricing is strong and cancellations are low. After a 100 basis point negative impact from deconsolidating Seeker and SourceFed post the December Group Nine transaction, our first quarter domestic ad revenues are expected to be at least flat year-over-year. Fourth quarter adjusted OIBDA was up an impressive 9% as operating expenses were actually down 3% due to our aggressively reducing expenses. For the full year 2016, total U.S. revenues increased 5%, led by 7% distribution growth and 2% advertising growth. Full year costs were flat, leading to an 8% adjusted OIBDA growth. Our relentless focus on controlling costs drove domestic margins to 59%, 200 basis points higher than 2015.","Turning now to the international segment, all of my following comments we refer to are organic results, which exclude the impact of foreign currency as well as the 2015 sale of the SBS Radio business. International ended the year with a solid quarter of double-digit organic distribution growth and improved organic advertising growth, leading to 5% total revenue growth for the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter advertising growth of 3% was driven by growth in all regions, excluding Asia-Pac, our smallest region, which declined partially due to demonetization in India. Northern Europe returned to growth, led by increased demand in the Nordics, while SEMEA and Southern Europe both grew strong double-digits. Our 10% affiliate growth was driven by another quarter of solid price growth in Europe as we continue to benefit from successfully leveraging our expanded content portfolio that now include sports to drive higher contracted pricing step-ups.","Turning to the cost side, operating costs were 12% in the fourth quarter, leading to a 9% decline in adjusted OIBDA. Cost growth was driven by increased sports content and production costs as we continue to add new rights to our sports portfolio as well as a significantly higher content impairment charges in the Nordics that David discussed. Excluding these impairments, adjusted OIBDA would have been down low single-digits. For the full year, revenues were up 6% with 3% advertising growth and 10% distribution growth. Costs were up 9%, with a 12% increase in cost of revenues, primarily due to increased sports content and production costs as well as the higher fourth quarter impairment charges, while SG&A was up 4%, leading to a 3% decline in adjusted OIBDA. Excluding both years\u2019 impairment charges, adjusted OIBDA for the full year was down 1%.","Looking ahead, as David noted, we expect our 2017 distribution revenue growth to grow at least $215 million pre-FX or 12% to 13%, as we continue to benefit from stronger price escalators. While advertising growth is obviously harder to predict, it is dependent upon macro factors as well as company-specific performance, such as audience share and ratings. We currently expect first quarter\u2019s advertising growth to accelerate and be at low to mid single-digits. Net-net, international\u2019s OIBDA in 2017 will definitely grow.","Moving on to our Education and Other segment. As expected, this division operated at a slight loss in the fourth quarter and for the full year as we continued to invest in education\u2019s digital textbook to drive the long-term value of this industry disrupting business. Now, taking a look at our overall company financial position, in the fourth quarter, we repurchased $250 million worth of common and preferred stock after investing, as we highlighted on our 3Q call, $100 million in the Group Nine transaction. During 2016, we bought back a total of $1.37 billion worth of common and preferred shares. Since the inception of our buyback program in 2010, we have now repurchased over $8 billion of our stock, reducing our outstanding share count by 36%.","As we continue to carefully think about how best to allocate our capital and maximize returns on invested capital, in the fourth quarter 2016, we began investing in socially responsible renewable solar energy projects that offer substantial financial and tax benefits to Discovery. As a result of our unique U.S. tax base attributes and position, we realized a mid-teen IRR on these investments, primarily through tax incentives and improved operating cash flow. In the fourth quarter, our initial $63 million solar investment improved our book tax rate by 100 basis points and we also recognized a $24 million book equity loss due to solar asset depreciation.","For 2017, we have already committed to invest an additional $240 million and we will likely invest another $100 million for a total solar investment of $340 million in 2017. Assuming we invest this full $340 million in 2017, we would expect a book equity loss of approximately $200 million, which should be more than offset by the tax incentives received on these investments. Given additional global operating tax rate improvements, as well as the tax benefits from these solar investments, we expect our 2017 effective book tax rate to be at or below 20% and our cash tax rate to be in the high-20% range, so over 700 basis point and 300 basis point improvements from our 2016 tax rates, respectively. These 2017 anticipated rates assume no revisions to current tax legislations.","For 2017, as we continue to invest in new areas of growth and best position our company for the future, our top capital allocation priorities remain the same, investing in driving organic growth as well as strategic M&A and investments, like solar investments, that have a strong IRR in order to enhance shareholder returns. In the first quarter 2017, we have already invested approximately $100 million in additional solar investments. While we do not have a specific target amount for share repurchases, we will continue to allocate excess capital towards repurchasing our stock as we continue to find the return on owning our shares highly attractive. As always, we stand by our unwavering commitment to our investment grade debt rating and keeping our gross leverage below 3.4x.","Now let\u2019s focus on our additional financial expectation for 2017 and beyond. On the cost side, we expect our global organic cost of revenues to be up in the high single to low double-digit range, driven by sports and direct-to-consumer investments. We also expect our global organic SG&A to be flat to up only low single-digits, resulting from predominantly completed 2016 proactive cost reduction actions. Importantly, this year, we expect constant currency adjusted EPS to grow strongly in the low to mid-teen range and constant currency free cash flow to grow at least low double-digits. We are again quantifying the expected foreign exchange impact on our 2017 results. While global currency rates continue to fluctuate, at current spot rates, our year-over-year FX headwinds have really moderated, partially due to our effective foreign exchange hedging strategies. At current spot rates, FX is expected to negatively impact 2017 versus \u201816 revenues by $30 million to $40 million, adjusted OIBDA by only zero to $10 million and adjusted EPS by $0.10 to $0.12, given the below the line FX gains in 2016.","Finally, as you will recall, we raised our 3-year growth guidance last year and are confirming today that we still expect our constant currency adjusted EPS and constant currency free cash flow CAGRs for 2015 through \u201818 to both grow at least low-teens or better. To wrap up, with this being my last earnings call with Discovery, I want to sincerely thank David, the Board and the global executive and finance teams for a tremendous 5 years. I have thoroughly enjoyed my time at the company and extremely proud of what we accomplished together, in particular our achieving the highest free cash flow per share growth of our peer group since 2011. I believe in the strategic direction of Discovery and know it is in exceptionally strong financial position. Yesterday, it was announced that I will be joining STX Entertainment, a high growth, privately held, global media company. It will be a great next chapter in my career. Thanks again for your time this morning.","And now Dave and I will answer any questions you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Ben Swinburne","Thank you. Good morning guys. David, could you just spend a few more minutes talking about, in particular, the Bundesliga contract and strategy around those rights in Germany and particularly, any specifics around Sky or Liberty in that market. And also on the Olympics, give us an update on sort of how far along you are, at least broadly in Europe, in terms of monetizing and positioning distribution of that content across the major markets that you have purchased. And then I just wanted to quickly ask Andy, if it\u2019s okay, the sub-20% book tax rate and high-20s cash tax in \u201817, are those sort of \u2013 the go-forward rates beyond \u201817 or are these investments sort of creating a one-time tax shield and then \u201818 sort of moves back up to a more traditional range? Thank you both.","David Zaslav","Thanks Ben. Well, first, we have a terrific set of IP in Germany and we went after it with some purpose because it\u2019s the largest market in Germany. It\u2019s also a very competitive market with Vodafone, Deutsche Telekom, Liberty Global, The Zygo, Sky. There are a lot of platforms. It\u2019s quite aggressive in terms of offering content on all platforms. And we own all of our IP in Europe on every platform. And so when we bought this IP, if it shows up on mobile, it isn\u2019t because a league sold it. It\u2019s because we sold it. So we did attack Germany specifically, as having, we think a lot of upside. The Olympics in general, is going much better than planned. We said when we bought the Olympics that it would \u2013 that we would make money and we think now we will make more money. We have done a number of deals, many deals. We just did Poland last week. We were able to get in our BBC deal. There were two markets where we didn\u2019t have the Olympics in \u201818 and \u201820. We got back a lot of the Olympic IP and a lot of it digitally in the UK through our BBC deal. Every deal that we have done has been ahead of plan and we haven\u2019t begun to attack some of the other platforms. And in every deal, we have retained all digital rights. So in some cases, we may have given some digital rights, but we still have \u2013 we will be the only place that you can get all of the Olympics on any one platform. And so we feel very good about that. And we have also \u2013 because of how well we have done, we feel confident in certain markets and take the Olympics ourselves. So for instance, in Germany, we will \u2013 we have our free-to-air Eurosport. We have two other free-to-air channels. We also have eight pay-TV channels. We are the leader in sports.com with Eurosport.com and we have our player. And so we are stepping up with the Olympics ourselves, which we are super excited about. We think we can do very well with it. We also think we are going to enhance all of those assets. We played this game before when I was at NBC. We now have the rings on Eurosport and those rings belong to us for almost the next decade. And it was a big helper to NBC to have those rings and in the Olympic Games. And we think we can build some asset value on top of making money. Finally, on LTi and Sky, we like the fact that the market is competitive. We have some very good Bundesliga games. With that, together with MotoGP, together with all the tennis majors and all the cycling and owning most of that, taking it back so that it\u2019s exclusive, we think we can go at that market very aggressively. We already have a strong brand. And finally, that\u2019s going to be a center point for us in terms of our player because our IP is so strong and so \u2013 and the Bundesliga is effectively the NFL or stronger in Germany. And two nights a week, if you want to see the Bundesliga, the only place to see it will be us.","Andy Warren","Yes. Hi Ben, there is no question that these mid-teen IRR solar investments obviously have a meaningful impact \u2013 positive impact on our tax rates. But if you exclude those, you are still looking at about 100 basis point reduction in our effective tax rate and given our deferred tax rate structures, a couple of hundred basis point reduction in our cash tax rate. So as we think about looking forward, very dependent upon what kind of solar investment opportunities we have and some of the regulatory environments there. But think in terms of how the sustainable 26% effective tax rate and a continuing decline in cash tax rate, as again we are really focused on maximizing our deferred tax rate structures.","Ben Swinburne","Thank you.","David Zaslav","The only thing I would add, Ben and we said this publicly is that we did not make \u2013 we purposely did not have the Bundesliga and the Olympics be part of our Sky deal. And so we have that IP, which we are kidding to do with Sky, do together with Sky and all of us in the market do ourselves. We have full optionality and that will be now Bundesliga starts.","Ben Swinburne","Yes, thank you both.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steven Cahall with Royal Bank of Canada. Your line is now open.","Steven Cahall","Yes, thank you. First question on domestic distribution revenue, I think you said that you don\u2019t have any new deals in 2017, but I was wondering if you could give us an update on where you might be with new virtual platforms. And then relatedly, you talked about a bit of an acceleration in subscriber loss, I was wondering if you could maybe give us \u2013 it sounds like there was a bit of a mix shift where you lost some subs on some of your lower affiliate fee networks, but you gained subs on lower tiered packages where you have bigger affiliate fees. So, does that mix shift is that neutral to revenue? Is that a headwind to revenue or was that a positive to revenue? And then I have a quick follow-up on the international side.","David Zaslav","Well, just in terms of the distribution, we are on Sony, we are on \u2013 we have five channels on DirecTV Now. We have \u2013 we got out in front of this idea of kind of really focusing our channels. Our deals provide that about 85% of the economics are against five of our channels and we have really focused on making them stronger. So, ID and TLC and OWN being female, ID being number two in America, OWN number one for African-Americans, TLC right now number one in Middle America and strengthening Discovery and Science and Animal Planet. At the same time, there is a lot of talk now of focusing on just the bigger networks. We, over the last 4 years, have \u2013 we have been way ahead of the curve on that. And our smaller networks, we have been really focused on making them super fan networks. So we have Velocity that it isn\u2019t a large audience, but it\u2019s very compelling audience. Discovery Espa\u00f1ol, number one for men in the Hispanic space. Discovery Familia, a family Hispanic service, really focused on the fact that if in the years ahead there is a move to skinnier bundles and I think the \u2013 that will happen over time, but over the next couple of years, the impact is going to be quite small. But if it does, we have been on every skinny bundle outside the U.S. And so as we did all of our deals, we structured them this way, because as we have taken 5 or 6 channels in Brazil, we had the same model. We got 85% of the money, but then we actually got more ad revenue, because people spent more time with our channels and our brands got stronger. In addition, we are talking to Hulu, we are talking to Google, we are talking to all the players. And I think we have 12% to 13% of viewership. We have top channels for men, for women in different ethnic groups. And we are \u2013 I am not proud of this, but we are 12% or 13% of the viewership and we are about 6% of the money. Most of the money is going to sports and re-trans. And so to carry our channels is quite inexpensive. And so on a practical level, it should happen.","Andy Warren","And from a pure financial perspective, Steven, it\u2019s so important to highlight what Dave said about the 85% and growing share of our 5 tentpole networks. While, yes, there is an acceleration of the digi non-distributed, fully distributed networks, that\u2019s declining more quickly, our economics are not embedded in those networks. The high single pricing CAGRs \u2013 contracted pricing CAGRs are all on the 5 nets. And again, that percent of total U.S. affiliate revenue will accrete even higher and that\u2019s where you are seeing more stability on sub declines there.","Steven Cahall","Great. Thank you. And then just quickly on the international side, I was wondering if you could just shed a little bit more light on the impairment that you took in the quarter? Should we just assume this is snicker or curling or is this something that\u2019s outside the sports network? And relatedly, does all this kind of track back to your plan to drive big increase in OTT subscribership and where are we on those numbers? Thanks.","David Zaslav","Great. Well, I will give you the general and Andy can give you more of the detail. More than 20 was Sweden and we have been working very hard on our Northern European SBS business. It\u2019s about 20 million people, but we were running it as \u2013 it\u2019s run as four different countries Norway, Denmark, Sweden and Finland and that\u2019s the way all media business are run up there. And there has been some meaningful decline in that whole region and part of it has to do with the fact that culturally everybody speaks English. And unlike most of the other countries in Europe, there is a love for U.S. entertainment content. And so when Netflix went into that market and HBO went into that market, it\u2019s a market that they have done very well in. And so there has been about 20% decline over the last 2.5 years in viewership, which hit us. It\u2019s still a very strong free cash flow asset for us and pretty compelling, but it has had an impact on us in terms of subs and viewership. It\u2019s leveling off to some extent, but I expect that it\u2019s probably going to continue to decline on a secular basis. But what we have done is we have begun to attack it from a cost perspective aggressively. We got Mike Lang now running that business, who ran Miramax and a very strong operating guy. And we are now starting to run it as one unit. So instead of four independent countries, we think there is a more cost we can take out of that business and not affect what we are putting on the screen and be more effective. And we are starting to see that a little bit this quarter as fourth quarter was started to \u2013 our ad sales started to grow and they are accelerating in this first quarter for the first time. It\u2019s too early to say that kind of we have hit bottom and now it\u2019s going to get a lot better, but it\u2019s certainly getting better in the first quarter. And finally, we were getting a lot of \u2013 a significant amount of nourishment, maybe 25% of the nourishment on those channels which is coming from U.S. entertainment stuff. So, we were out there buying scripted series, comedies and movies. And because that\u2019s so available now on HBO and on Netflix in particular, the viewership of it was declining. And so we have now written off a lot of that stuff and we are finding that our ratings there is good or better with the stuff that we own and we are getting out of the business of that entertainment stuff, which we were getting quite leveraged on and we are paying a huge amount for. And so I am pretty happy and pretty bullish about the fact that we are off that gravy train of having to compete between \u2013 we are one of two or three of the big broadcasters there and we are fighting in each case with all the big U.S. entertainment companies over who is going to get the movies and the comedy series and the scripted, we are getting out of that and that\u2019s what you saw.","Andy Warren","And just to provide a little bit more kind of financial perspective on that, we have in the last couple of years, Steven, averaged about $10 million to $15 million of content write-downs in some of our international content, purely in a notion of just being extremely clean on the balance sheet as we go into the next year. 2016 was about $20 million higher entirely driven by the one-time cleanup that David just discussed as we really do deemphasize some of the U.S. content and continue to drive more of our...","David Zaslav","The U.S. entertainment content.","Andy Warren","U.S. entertainment content.","David Zaslav","Our stuff is doing fine.","Andy Warren","Correct. And so it is a very much a one-time, I would think in terms of a more consistent run-rate of cleanup in the $10 million to $15 million range going forward.","Steven Cahall","Great. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Kannan Venkateshwar with Barclays. Your line is now open.","Kannan Venkateshwar","Thank you. David, looking at Europe overall, the sports component of it will add more and more fixed cost into your income statement, but it looks like that market is moving more or less the same way the U.S. market is moving, if not faster into more of OTT consumption and so on. So just from an investment perspective, what gives you long-term confidence around locking yourself into more fixed cost when the viewership environment is changing more to OTT? Thanks.","David Zaslav","Okay. Thanks, Kannan. Well, first let me just disagree with the premise of that. And if it turns out that you are right, which we are betting that that\u2019s directionally where it\u2019s going to go, it\u2019s a homerun for us. But viewership on Eurosport was up more than 20% in the fourth quarter, 23%. Viewership so far this year is up significantly. The brand is stronger. We have more live content. We don\u2019t expect that we are going to spend a lot more year to year. We don\u2019t need to spend more. We feel like the IP package that we have right now for Eurosport is about right and it\u2019s actually paying off for us. It\u2019s strong enough that we can package it together with Discovery, which is number one in the market in factual and our female networks and put it all together and get very significant increases, which we talked about, where it\u2019s going to \u2013 you are going to be seeing 12, 13. And a year from now, you will see higher than that as we continue to grow our affiliate fees, which we have been \u2013 which we said we were going to do and we did it. We do own all these \u2013 all of this IP direct-to-consumer. And if in fact there is a transition direct-to-consumer, there is only one player in Europe which is more than twice the size of U.S. that\u2019s playing that game. And that\u2019s us. We have been out in the market now for 1.5 years. We have been talking to consumers. We did our deal with BAM six months ago. We are going to begin to roll that out in three months. It will be fully rolled out in six months. And we are the only pan-European player. We have the cycling. We have all the Olympic sports. We have the Olympics. We have the majors in tennis. And we even have a lot of the affinity sports, whether it\u2019s snooker or we can characterize it \u2013 or squash. And so we are very strong in IP. And right now, we are making money on that IP. It\u2019s not the same margin, but we have always said that we are going to make sure that Eurosport is profitable in itself. If in fact, your point that people are going to start watching more direct-to-consumer, which is our bet, that they are going to continue to watch on linear, but that they will also watch on their phone or their device, they are going to be doing it through the player. And if that happens, if we come back and of the 740 million people in Europe, we have 3 million or 4 million people for our Sports Netflix in 2 years, that\u2019s going to be a massive asset appreciation for us. I mean our multiple is nine. And look at the multiple that you are giving to Netflix. And the difference between us and Netflix is Netflix is spending $6 billion a year on IP and we are spending zero, because our direct-to-consumer product IP is already making money on Eurosport and so when we now go direct-to-consumer, our cost of IP is zero. And so that would be one hell of a business. And that\u2019s why we got Guyardo. That\u2019s why we have a whole team working in London. That\u2019s why we got Peter Hutton focused on this. And unlike Netflix, we have a platform with Eurosport and we have \u2013 we are the leader with 60 million people every month coming to Eurosport.com to be able to let people know that if you want to watch all of the Australian Open or Tour de France or if you want to see the Olympics, there is where you go. So we are head down on Eurosport that it\u2019s going to continue to make money and we are not going to over index on the IP and tip that over. And then we are full out with a \u2013 over the next 24 months, to really drive this Sports Netflix strategy, which no one else has. It would take someone else a long time to build. We own the IP. Anybody else that can play this game can play in a country and mostly they just have football.","Andy Warren","And I think it\u2019s very important to highlight and walk through kind of the economic model that we developed here. And again as David said, just to really highlight that we have done what we said we were going to do. If you look at what we have highlighted a couple of years ago, step one was investing in exclusive content as David said, allowing ourselves to have more must-carry content and have a greater sense of affinity groups. Step two was taking that content and having it drive an accelerating contracted affiliate revenue growth curve. And clearly, you are seeing that not only in \u201816, but are highlighting the 12% to 15% growth and accelerating further in \u201817 and \u201818. So step one and step two are done. Step three then is, as we are now invested in the content that we need, we don\u2019t see a further acceleration of sports content spend really in \u201818 and \u201819 and \u201820. So what you are going to see the step three being is a real acceleration of profits as margin, as you have the contracted affiliate growth, you then have a stable sports rights investment and then now you really get the margin accretion out of that model. So we clearly had this planned out for 3 years and it\u2019s developing and progressing quite frankly exactly as how we had kind of modeled it and expected it.","David Zaslav","Your discussion point about transition to direct-to-consumer, for the last 4 years, we have changed our view of not just how does our content work on linear, but how good is our IP for any device. And that\u2019s why we focused Discovery to be more on brand, even if \u2013 we are not going for ratings. We are going for a core super fan audience, on OWN, on Velocity, on all of our channels. And we have invested significantly in Kids in Latin America, where we beat Disney, because we think owning the Kids IP is going to be over the longer term very important for growth and we are starting to see that now with our Everywhere product in Latin America.","Kannan Venkateshwar","Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Drew Borst with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Drew Borst","Thank you. I have two questions, one for David and one for Andy. David, I wanted to ask about the U.S. networks business and your outlook for the operating expenses there over the next year or so, I think it was an interesting year for you guys in 2016 in the sense that operating expenses were flat, I think your EBITDA margins were either at peak or maybe above peak, but you also had some ratings challenges over the course of the year, so I wanted you to talk a little bit about how you are thinking about reinvesting in programming on the U.S. networks?","David Zaslav","Sure. Well, for the \u2013 I feel pretty good about where we ought to start the year. We got Discovery at number one. And we have for the first time, TLC, ID and OWN all working. We have worked very hard on getting TLC turned around and we spent a lot of time talking to the audience. So I think we have four \u2013 those four networks are very strong. We have Science and Animal Planet, I would say, as our blockers. We have National Geographic out there and we have Science now with ratings that are exceeding Geographic and Animal Planet with ratings exceeding Geographic. And we think that\u2019s important that we keep those brands strong, more niche, but also kind of as a blocker, as Discovery is that number one channel for men. And on the content costs, I would say, focusing more on the bigger networks, but we have been doing that already and the smaller networks, our cost of content is a lot lower. We are doing a lot more content on Velocity for a lot less dollars. Bob Scanlon is a great operator there. He worked at ESPN and Speed and he is doing a great job of building that affinity group. And the overall \u2013 I think non-content costs, we think we can take that down even a little bit. And over the next 2 years, I think you will see flat to slightly down. So I think the U.S. is a good story. We have gotten our affiliate deals done. It would be better if universe decline was less than 2 and having it be in the high-2s, but our deals are pretty good. We are very well protected in terms of how we are versus everybody else, certainly in terms of the limits of how we are packaged and offered. So I think if we can continue to reduce our non-content costs and continue to invest in our channels that are working and building those super fans that we can have a nice growth business \u2013 continue to have a nice sustainable growth business in the U.S.","Drew Borst","Okay. Thanks. And then just a housekeeping question for Andy, with respect to the 2017 adjusted EPS growth guidance, could you just clarify whether the base year of 2016 includes or excludes some of the gains and losses that you ended up booking like the Lionsgate and Group Nine?","David Zaslav","One point that I just wanted add that\u2019s important for why we are different than everybody else is, when we invest in Discovery, Science, Animal Planet, ID, we are investing in channels that create IP that we take everywhere in the world. And so that investment \u2013 and we tend \u2013 we are investing more in channels that work globally. So when we see ID up 15% in most markets and we see Discovery growing around the world, we are \u2013 we have this unique model where we invest in one piece of content, convert it into 52 languages and take it around the world. And I think continuing in that discipline of investing more in the global content, which gives us a much stronger return than investing in content that works only in the U.S. And Velocity falls in that category of global as well.","Andy Warren","And Drew, the question about 2017 guidance, it\u2019s clearly off of simply the reported adjusted EPS of $2.13. We provided that ex-Lionsgate, ex the gain on Group Nine, only to provide some clarity on what would say is more of an organic operating view. But our guidance is clearly off of the very simple reported adjusted EPS actual for 2016.","Drew Borst","Okay, thank you both.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Alexia Quadrani","Hi, thank you. Just one follow-up on some previous comments, I think you were talking about the content costs, the programming costs and I wanted to ask you given that you have always had this big \u2013 one big positive drivers for Discovery has been the lower cost of program, but we have seen a bit more of the switch toward more event programming or scripted shows by you and some of your peers, I guess, does that change the model at all or how we should think about the cost structure going forward?","David Zaslav","Good question. I mean, for us, the answer is no, because we are doing basically one scripted series a year and we are focused on making sure that it\u2019s content that works globally. So, Harley and the Davidsons was very successful for us. It lifted the patina of the brand. It was kind of a special treat for our audience, but it\u2019s expensive content. It worked out for us, because it worked so well. But I think, at least for us that\u2019s not the core of what we do. It\u2019s part of a tentpole. We have also accelerated our content that\u2019s in the natural history in animal extinction, science, more traditional areas, space for Discovery and that content is relatively inexpensive and we don\u2019t do that for ratings. In most cases, it underperforms, but it overperforms on the brand and it overperforms for kind of that super center of people that love Discovery because we satisfy curiosity. And so we have built the whole team, Rich built the whole team with a whole documentary unit that where we are putting more of that content on. So net-net, we don\u2019t see cost being an issue and we are not moving more into scripted, which is more expensive.","Alexia Quadrani","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Anthony DiClemente with Nomura Instinet. Your line is now open.","Anthony DiClemente","Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. David, as you know, FOX has really stepped up its investment in Nat Geo. Seems like they are really stepping to what\u2019s typically been your core genre. You mentioned, I think a minute ago, Science and Animal Planet ratings. Are you concerned? Should we be concerned about increased competition from Nat Geo either as it pertains to ratings share or carriage with the new virtual MVPDs where Nat Geo seems to be included in a lot or most of the skinny bundles? And then Andy, first off, wish you all the best going forward. I wanted to just follow-up on the questions earlier about trajectory of content spend at the U.S. Networks in \u201817. So specifically, what\u2019s in your outlook for programming expense growth for the \u201817 budget? I think you said globally you are expecting high singles to low doubles, but what \u2013 just for the model, what should we expect for U.S. Networks? Thanks, guys.","David Zaslav","Thanks, Anthony. Well, I have a special affection for National Geographic, because I helped create it years ago and worked with Chase and the Murdoch family in partnership, because we owned it when I was at NBC together. And I think it\u2019s a great brand. And it\u2019s one of the reasons why we have invested in Science and Animal Planet and really are very focused on what they are doing. They are spending a lot of money. I think they have a lot of ambition for it. And I think they are really good. At this moment, we have some significant advantages. In 220 countries we are in, we are on basic. We are the most distributed and we are number one in virtually every market against them. And in almost every market, we are number one for factual. We did launch Science and Animal Planet in every market in the world really as a way of kind of creating a flanker against Geo and History, which is also a great channel that does great nonfiction content. And I think they woke us \u2013 both History at least woke us up a few years ago. History was beating Discovery at one point. And Discovery, 6 or 7 years ago, we were cheating a little bit on the brand. And we got \u2013 it forced us to get better. It forced us to get more focused on our audience, what do they love about Discovery, how do we create more content that satisfies curiosity? And I think it made us better. Discovery Now, for 2 years, has been the number one channel by a lot for men and number one around the world and it\u2019s helped us with Science and Animal Planet. So, I think competitive competition is good, but they are both great services and we are going to have to continue to really bring our A game, because both of them have really good teams and they are \u2013 they got us in their sights.","Andy Warren","Yes, I appreciate your comment about the next move. It\u2019s \u2013 I am excited, but look it\u2019s always one of those but we are leaving a company that you truly do love, one thing a lot of you have commented on and I will say which is unique here is a CFO-CEO relationship is so important. And Dave and I are genuinely \u2013 very genuinely, very good friends, very constructive. We\u2019ll continue to be great friends and talk in the future. So look, it\u2019s hard to leave a place you love, but I am excited about the future. So look to get into the U.S. content spend, without giving too much detail, call it roughly mid single, the good news is we definitely see U.S. SG&A being down just given the phenomenal work, we have a CFO there, Simon Robinson, who is doing a tremendous job of driving cost productivity, utilizing technology to really think about means of delivery. And so we have sustained cost controls in our U.S. business that we see for the next several years that gives us a lot of perspective on \u2013 even from these levels, continued margin growth out of our U.S. business.","Anthony DiClemente","Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. And we have time for one final question. Our last question comes from the line of Todd Juenger with Sanford Bernstein. Your line is now open.","Todd Juenger","Wow, pressure is on here. Let me just keep it to one question, if you don\u2019t mind. I guess turning back here, David, I know you like to use the analogy of the sports for Netflix. And so I guess one big difference between Netflix and a company like yours is they aren\u2019t also simultaneously trying to run the linear network services. And I just like you to reconcile maybe how you are thinking about the future distribution sort of strategy and growth, especially in Europe, with the presence in sports. Right now you are getting double-digit increases from your traditional distributors. When you have this realized sort of Netflix-like sports product available as well, is it your expectation that you can both get paid still strongly from linear and also have the direct-to-consumer product and also, by the way, launch and increase the number of free-to-air channels, which I know probably are on sports, but they are still Discovery content. How does that all work together as opposed to eating each other? Thanks.","David Zaslav","Sure. Thanks, Todd. Well, the opportunity that we have is we have a massive amount of IP. So when we are showing \u2013 if you are in Italy and you are looking at the Australian Open and we have three sports channels, we are showing three matches. But if you have the player we have 20 courts. And for showing the Australian Open for the whole weekend, then during that weekend is the World Speedskating Championships and we are not showing that or we are only showing two courts of tennis and one on speedskating. We are not showing the slalom. And so one is, we have a lot more IP. Two is there is a lot of IP we are not showing. We own all the snooker. We are not showing most of it. We own all the squash we are not showing most of it. We own all the speedskating. We are not showing all of it. And so the ability to go to super fan affinity groups and have them like they would go out and buy a magazine, if they love golf or tennis, they can get a seasons pass for their sport, we think is quite interesting. The other piece is there is a lot of people in Europe. It\u2019s only about 50% penetrated on multi-channel television. And so 50% of Europe is \u2013 doesn\u2019t have access to it, but there is a huge portion of that, that has broadband and so the ability to access them as well. And so we will nourish the existing audience with the quality content that we have and we see a sustainable opportunity here. In fact, I think we are just getting started. If you look at what happened in the U.S., it started with double-digit and teen increases for sports and then it just accelerated as they were able to aggregate that sports audience and it became so powerful that it really almost \u2013 it tilted the whole ecosystem here. None of that has happened there yet. And so we think owning this IP, having the ability to go to super fans and \u2013 Todd, the final thing is that we find when people are in their home they want to watch it on TV, but when they leave, they want to see Tour de France or they want to see the hockey game or they want to see the tennis wherever they are and so part of it is portability, which is a real utility to a lot of them and part of it is being able to see all the matches in a particular sport that they love. So we are quite optimistic about that. And in the same regard, we are optimistic about that same formula for kids or for crime or for animals with Animal Planet. We own all of this IP or for science. So we are going to start playing around with our IP direct-to-consumer until we get the right formula. We think we have it with sports and kids. And now as we look at the rest of our portfolio, we think we have an opportunity there as well and we will be informing you over the next 2 to 3 years how successful we are in getting people to either pay for our content or like the Discovery GO platform, to get them to look at it for free. But in that case, we have people watching in the length of view of an hour or length of view of our cable channels is 40 minutes. There, we get length of view of an hour and they watch all the commercials and we get a higher CPM. And by mid to end of year, we think we can get 2 additional points of growth in the U.S. out of that alone. And so that\u2019s where we are driving with our IP and we are learning more and more from the audience about what they like and what they don\u2019t.","Todd Juenger","It will be fascinating to watch it go. Thank you very much, David.","Operator","Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today\u2019s question-and-answer session. Thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference.

Joining me today are David Zaslav, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Andy Warren, our Chief Financial Officer. You should have received our earnings release, but if not, feel free to access it on our website at www.discoverycommunications.com.","On today's call we will begin with some opening comments from David and Andy, and then we will open up the call for your questions.

Zaslav - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'm pleased to report that Discovery is off to a strong start to the year, and despite facing a challenging U.S. marketplace and increasing currency headwinds, we continue to execute our long-term strategy of investing in marquee content, leveraging at across our unmatched distribution platforms around the world, and driving operating momentum and strong financial results.","Discovery was founded 30 years ago with a mission to satisfy curiosity, ignite minds and educate and entertain viewers. Our purpose-driven approach continues to drive our global content engine today. It sets us apart from our peers and propels our sustained ability to produce strong results over the long-term.","Nowhere is that more clear than on our flagship Discovery Channel, which kicked off its 30th year on the air stronger than ever and has been resurgent from the second half of last year. Discovery had its best quarter ever in prime in the target demo, and its total viewers in the U.S. saw a double digit increase over a year ago. Rich Ross took over as President in January and is off to a fantastic start. While much of his creative vision won't hit the air until the third quarter and fourth quarter, Rich has already put forward and delivered results on a plan to diversify Discovery's audience, attracting more women, Millennials and co-viewing while continuing to nourish our core male audience and passionate super fans.","For the quarter, Gold Rush was the number one unscripted show on cable with all male demos and the number seven with women 25 years old to 54 years old, and new hit series, Alaskan Bush People, was the number two unscripted show among men 25 years old to 54 years old on cable and was in the top 10 for women 25 years old to 54 years old. Both series made Discovery number one in all of cable on Friday nights among all demos, total viewers and households and proved there's a real opportunity to expand our audience mix on the network. In addition, for the quarter, Discovery was the number one network on all of cable for men 18 years old to 34 years old, which is a huge accomplishment, and this quarter we continue to lead as the number one network in most weeks.","Discovery's programming success in the quarter wasn't just the U.S. phenomenon. Many of our top U.S. shows are hits around the globe. Discovery Channel's average international audience rose more than 5% last quarter with Gold Rush replicating its U.S. success; it is one of our top international series and Fast N' Loud and Misfit Garage are also off to strong starts overseas so far this quarter. Other wins included TLC's 19 Kids and Counting, which has recently made TLC the number one network for women on Tuesday night. The network's family-oriented characters have become pop culture magnets and continue to resonate and nourish super fans across Middle America and abroad. In international markets TLC's average audience rose 26% due to strong gains in the Netherlands and from successful launches in Germany last year and Hungary this quarter.","In the U.S, our juggernaut, ID, posted its best quarter ever in prime and total day among total viewers and was a top three ad-supported cable network with women 25 years old to 54 years old in total day, fueled by ID super fans who watched the network for much longer than any other channel on cable. ID's launch late last year in India led to another impressive quarter of viewership gains internationally. The network's rapid global ascent is simply stunning. For the first four months of the year, Discovery's domestic portfolio has outperformed the market with particularly strong ratings in the month of April where we were up against an industry that was down mid-single digit.","Turning to the advertising market, we were very pleased with our Upfront presentations over the past couple of months. After talking with clients and agencies last year, we decided to change our Upfront presentation strategy in 2015 through a series of up close and personal in-agency meetings in New York, Los Angeles and Chicago. It was a departure from the traditional stage presentation format and the response has been enthusiastic from top agencies, because we were able to get more senior and more robust attendance and engagement at their offices.","In addition, there's been strong client response in these key sales markets. While it's certainly too early to make predictions on the Upfront, we feel confident that we articulated our content and sales strategy in the right agencies and clients in an effective and efficient manner and with leading growth metrics on our channels and strong on-brand networks, we believe we are well-positioned across our portfolio heading into this year's market.","In the first quarter, we saw a nice acceleration from the fourth quarter with total U.S. ad sales up 400 basis points to 1%. Current trends seem relatively steady to slightly up. Pricing is healthy, but delivery and demand remain a little improved but still the challenge. Overall, in our projections, since we don't have visibility, we continue to expect the advertising market to remain tepid for the remainder of the year in our numbers.","In terms of distribution, the deals we signed late last year in the U.S. all recognize the full value of our content, having grown from 7% of viewership on cable six years ago to more than 12% of viewership on cable today, underscoring the strong affiliate growth we experienced this quarter of 8%.","I would note our Time Warner Cable rates we negotiated at the end of 2013 will be preserved now that they will not be merging with Comcast. However, as has been previously disclosed by Comcast, our renewal with them is upcoming. Like all other deals we negotiated over the past several years, we remain optimistic that Comcast and Discovery will be able to resolve a renewal that is fair and valuable for both companies.","The U.S. market remains a strong cash flow business for us and will manage costs appropriately to maintain our industry-leading margins. Outside the U.S., our international business remains a focused and a growth engine. Beyond our homegrown brands in the U.S., our newest contributor to our international business is Eurosport. At the end of the month we will reach the one-year mark of taking control of Eurosport. We named a new CEO of Eurosport, sports veteran, Peter Hutton, who started in March and has moved quickly pursue new strategic rights to create new value on a local level and strengthen existing rights with additional exclusivities and more comprehensive coverage.","The goal is to build at least two strong sports channels in every market by utilizing the Discovery model of sharing rights across channels and markets to drive investment efficiency and audience engagement. Simply put, we buy rights in three ways; pan-regional, like our deal for U.S. Major League Soccer rights for Europe to put on the broad platform, which reaches about 130 million homes across 55 countries in Europe, and it was the largest deal for the MLS outside the U.S. Two, would be multi-market deals, like MotoGP for Germany and Benelux, and, three, would be just local rights, like National Hockey rights in Sweden and the recently announced Champions League games airing in Singapore, which illustrates our commitment to strengthening our sports offering across Asia Pacific.","In the case of the MotoGP, it is a major driver of our initial localization strategy in Germany, which improved ratings by 22% during the first quarter. We also just acquired exclusive German TV and digital rights for England's prestigious FA Cup Soccer. In the U.K., we won the rights for five more tennis tournaments for British Eurosport, and in France, we successfully bid on key local rugby rights, both of which feed the appetites of passionate local fans. All in all, more than 30 sports rights and IP deals in the last six months and we still expect Eurosport to have high single digit margins this year.","Along with focused investments in key sports rights, we are bolstering Eurosport's production values and on-air talent to give the channels a new personality and build excitement and audiences. We recently announced that global tennis icon, Chris Evert, will provide expert analysis and commentary for the French Open, starring in a new show, Tennis Forever, along with Mats Wilander and Henri Leconte, who will be commentating and providing content in Paris.","Regarding our broader IP investments, we also are very pleased with the progress at all3media, our joint venture with Liberty Global. Just last month, all3media acquired one of the U.K.'s most respected independent scripted production companies, Sam Mendes' Neal Street Productions, creators of the hit BBC series, Call the Midwife and Penny Dreadful for Showtime. The acquisition adds to our growing stable of creative worldwide producers and expands our ownership of valuable global IP. With an average of more than 10 channels in more than 220 countries, nearly 3 billion cumulative worldwide subscribers, we are pushing hard to expand our unmatched network on linear and digital platforms.","Internationally, we again achieved new record reach in market share gains and we had 10% average audience growth across our entire global portfolio in the quarter; 10%. Our audience and share gains were led by our pay-TV channels in India, Brazil and Mexico, each of which just recorded their best quarter ever for Discovery Channel. Our free-to-air strategy is also paying dividends with our portfolio growing to an average audience of nearly 700,000 led by Discovery MAX in Spain, which grew audience by over 21% during the first quarter and we're seeing some real recovery in Spain which is providing real value.","In the U.S. and internationally, we are leveraging our content in brands on new distribution platforms around the world as the ecosystem evolves. This strategy can also be summarized in a new mantra I've recently shared with our leadership team; maximize linear while aggressively attacking digital around the world.","Owning our content has been a key differentiator for Discovery for 30 years. It allows us to be platform-ready and flexible in how we reach consumers as viewing habits change. Our recent affiliate deals have all included TV Everywhere rights. We are eager to work with our distribution partners to maximize the potential of this powerful non-linear platform as it's a win for operators, programmers and consumers. We'll continue to do our part to develop this platform in the months to come.","Ultimately, we remain platform-agnostic as long as we receive the economics our content deserves. We're also aggressively pursuing new distribution platforms as the market evolves. Our content is valuable, and our new deals with Hulu and Sony's new PlayStation Vue recognize that value. In Europe, Discovery's leadership and market share are providing us a unique opportunity to launch new OTT products with the type of diverse must-have content that consumers love.","Outside the U.S, we have two direct-to-consumer products, Dplay in select markets across Europe and the Eurosport Player, now available in 54 countries across Europe. I believe Discovery is holding a great hand as we have for the past 30 years. We're creating big brands, compelling stories and characters, and taking them around the world. We're focused on continuing to grow market share which translates into real economics, launching new channels and extending our reach into new markets and maybe most importantly, new platforms, and we're committed to our long-term strategy of investing in content, formats and IP. This is a strong start to the year, and we're making great progress toward delivering increased value to shareholders in 2015 and the years ahead.","Finally, I'm excited to announce that we will host our first-ever Discovery Investor Day in New York City on September 29. We will send details over the next couple of months and look forward to sharing with you an in-depth look at our global business and strategy. With that, I will turn the call over to Andy to detail our strong first quarter financial results. Thanks so much.","Andrew C. Warren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President","Thanks, David, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. As David mentioned, we're excited that Discovery is off to a very solid start to 2015. On a reported basis, total company first quarter revenues increased 9% and adjusted OIBDA increased 8%. As expected, given our increasingly international business mix, the continued strengthening of the dollar remained a major headwind and changes in currency rates reduced our reported revenue growth by 8% and reduced our adjusted OIBDA growth by 6%.","Excluding currency, revenues and adjusted OIBDA were up an impressive 17% and 14%, respectively. On an organic basis, so excluding the impact of foreign currency as well as contributions from Eurosport and Discovery Family, which have not yet been fully lapped, total company revenues grew 6% and adjusted OIBDA grew 11% as revenue growth outpaced cost growth by 200 basis points.","Our strong and successful cost discipline led to total company margins on an organic basis of 39%, up 200 basis points from the first quarter of 2014. Net income available to Discovery Communications of $250 million was up 9% from the first quarter a year ago, primarily driven by the strong operating performance in the current year and an $11 million year-over-year improvement in mark-to-market equity-based compensation, partially offset by a $12 million decline in equity earnings, $8 million of higher interest expense and $6 million of higher restructuring costs.","As expected, equity earnings declined as positive first quarter earnings at OWN and other non-consolidated investments were partially offset by losses from our 50% stake in all3media, related to below the line items. We also lowered our effective tax rate another 200 basis points from the full year 2014 rate to 33% this quarter as we remain extremely focused on lowering both our effective and cash tax rates. We still expect our effective tax rate to be at or below 30% for fiscal 2017 which will drive net income growth as well as accelerate our free cash flow growth.","Earnings per diluted share for the first quarter was $0.37, 12% above the first quarter a year ago. Adjusted earnings per diluted share, a more relevant metric from a comparability perspective that excludes the impact from acquisition-related non-cash amortization of intangible assets was $0.42, an 11% improvement versus Q1 2014. Excluding currency impacts, adjusted EPS was up 17% for the quarter. For the last 12 months, adjusted EPS was $1.89, up 12% over the prior 12 months.","Free cash flow in the first quarter declined to $29 million as the strong operating performance and lower stock-based compensation were offset by timing of tax payments which increased approximately $180 million versus last year as well as by higher content payments. We still expect our full year free cash flow to be up low single digits versus 2014 but cash tax payments will be heavily weighted towards the first half of the year and will significantly subside in the second half.","Turning now to the operating units; the U.S. Networks grew revenue 6%, led by positive advertising revenue growth of 1% and a very impressive 13% increase in distribution revenues. Our advertising revenue growth was due to higher pricing offsetting lower delivery. Delivery did improve slightly from Q4, led by the flagship Discovery Network, but was still down mid-single digits versus the first quarter of last year. As David mentioned, domestic ad trends have remained relatively steady to slightly better since we last reported and we still have a muted view of full year advertising growth.","Our full year ad sales outcome will ultimately depend upon a variety of factors; the most important being our network ratings performance. Distribution revenues, excluding the impact from consolidating Discovery Family results, were up 8%, a 200 basis points improvement from the 6% organic growth rate in 2014, as we benefited from the higher rates regarded from our new deals with NCTC, Cablevision, Sony and others at the end of 2014, as well as from contributions from our new Hulu deal which started on January 1 of this year.","As a reminder, unlike our prior SVOD deals, the revenue recognition for Hulu will be relatively smooth over the life of the contract and therefore, not a significant in any one quarter. So we will no longer be breaking out our digital licensing revenue separately.","Turning to the cost side, operating expenses in the quarter were up 2% on a reported basis but were down 2%, excluding the Discovery Family consolidation. Excluding Family, cost of revenues were up 5%, while SG&A declined 11% in large part due to higher marketing spend on Klondike last year. Our focus on controlling costs led to domestic adjusted OIBDA growth of 10% on a reported basis versus last year's first quarter, and 6% excluding Family, and margins on a reported basis and excluding Family, both expanded by almost 200 basis points year-over-year to 57%.","Now, reviewing our international operations; our international division delivered another quarter of strong results. On a reported basis, revenues grew 10% and reported adjusted OIBDA declined 2%. Excluding currency, revenues increased 27% and adjusted OIBDA increased 11% as changes in FX rates reduced revenue growth by 17% and adjusted OIBDA growth by 13% as a strengthening dollar remains a major headwind.","On an organic basis, which excludes currency as well as the Eurosport acquisition, revenues and adjusted OIBDA increased 9% and 11%, respectively. For comparability purposes, by following international comments, we refer to organic results only, so they exclude the impacts of Eurosport and foreign exchange. The 9% first quarter revenue growth was led by 12% advertising growth and 6% distribution growth. Our advertising growth was broad-based as our industry-leading global distribution platform and IP enabled us to benefit from the continued growth in global pay-TV subscribers, while simultaneously taking share and increasing pricing at our existing networks while further rolling out our global TLC, ID and Velocity brands to more and more markets around the world.","Excluding Russia, all regions except Asia, saw double digit ad growth increases, led by the continued success of our free-to-air initiatives across Europe and by Latin America, driven by increased volume in Brazil and Mexico. While organic advertising growth is expected to moderate in the second quarter, due to tough comps as well as elections this year in the U.K., we still expect full year organic advertising growth to be in the low double digit range.","On the affiliate front, the 6% affiliate revenue increase in the quarter was driven primarily by another quarter of double digit growth in Latin America, due to higher rates and the continued expansion of pay television in key markets like Brazil, Mexico and Colombia. (25:32) also had solid growth as despite the renegotiation of deals in Russia and some recent contract terminations in the Ukraine, we benefited from continued growth in Germany and across Southeastern Europe. Due to the Ukraine terminations, plus a pivot to a dual pay, free-to-air strategy in certain Eastern European markets similar to the strategy that has been very successful for us in Germany, Italy, Spain and the U.K, we now expect organic affiliate growth each quarter this year to be in the mid-single digit to high single digit range.","Turning to the cost side, operating expenses internationally grew 8% in the first quarter, primarily due to higher content amortization and increased personnel costs as we further localize our international businesses. Adjusted OIBDA grew 11% and international organic margins expanded fully 100 basis points to 34%.","Taking a look at our overall financial position, in the first quarter we repurchased a total of $317 million worth of shares. We have now spent over $6 billion buying back shares since we began our buyback program at the end of 2010, and we've reduced our outstanding share count by 29% as we continue to find the return on repurchasing our shares very attractive.","As we stated in our last year end call, we remain highly committed to our BBB rating, as we still expect to have approximately $1.5 billion of available capital for full year 2015 to fund both share repurchases, as well as to fund any additional M&A strategic investments, including the potential TF1 put for their remaining 49% in Eurosport. As a reminder, the first of their two put windows for TF1 will occur this summer from July through September, with the second window next summer during the same period.","Turning to our full year guidance, excluding currency, we still expect full year 2015 revenues will grow in the high single digit to low double digit range, adjusted OIBDA will grow in the low single digit to mid-single digit range and adjusted EPS will grow in the high single digit to low double digit range. Growth will be driven by solid operating performance and a lower tax rate, partially offset by approximately $10 million of higher interest expense. We are reiterating our guidance despite our new news that we were selling the non-core SBS radio assets, as this will be mostly offset by the positive financial impact from Time Warner Cable not being acquired by Comcast.","Additionally, note that this guidance has always included results from consolidating Eurosport France from the second quarter through year end, as that deal closed as expected and the guidance also still includes the $50 million negative impact from Russia.","I will also highlight again that revenue growth this quarter will outpace adjusted OIBDA growth, mostly due to increased content spend at Eurosport, as we look to further bolster our investments in sport rights in the near-term in order to fully maximize the growth potential of the asset in the medium-term and long-term. Eurosport had no OIBDA margin in the first quarter, due to their first quarter being the seasonally lowest advertising quarter as there are far fewer sporting events aired in the first three months of the year. We still expect, though, that full year Eurosport margins will be in the high single digit range.","As David highlighted, we remain extremely bullish on the prospects for Eurosport and expect our increased investments in sports rights to pay off both at Eurosport as well as across our entire international portfolio. In addition, our first quarter total company growth rates, excluding currency, were above the rates we guided to for the full year. We remind investors that top line growth, excluding currency, was always expected to peak in Q1, primarily due to the timing of the Eurosport transaction last year, which will begin to be lapped at the end of May. Also, cost comparisons get tougher as the year progresses.","Before we move on to Q&A, I do want to update the expected foreign currency impact on our 2015 results, given that the dollar has further strengthened since we gave guidance on our year end call this past February. While we had successfully hedged a portion of our currency exposures and did realize gains on these hedges in the first quarter, we only hedged about 60% of our transactional exposures. We also do not hedge translational exposures, as these derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting. Therefore, net of our hedging strategy at current spot rates, FX is now expected to reduce our constant currency guided revenue by $425 million, or roughly 6%, and adjusted OIBDA still by $150 million, also roughly 6% versus our 2014 reported results.","Looking at our International Networks mix of currency exposures, the revenue mix in 2015 is expected to be around 30% euro, 30% Nordic, 20% U.S. dollar, 10% British pound and 5% Brazilian real. Our International Networks OIBDA currency mix is forecasted to be around 25% euro, 25% Nordic, 15% real, 5% Russian ruble, 5% U.S. dollar, and still slightly short to British pound as our international headquarters are in London.","Lastly, as previously stated, we reiterate our guidance of reported free cash flow growth of low single digits in 2015, as we still expect significant growth in operating cash flow to be partially offset by higher full year cash taxes due to prior year timing benefits related to Section 181. We do expect cash taxes in 2016 to decline significantly as the cash tax deferral effect of 181 subsides. Thanks again for your time this morning and now David and I will be happy to answer any questions you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you very much. Please, stand by for your first question. And the first question comes from the line of John Janedis from Jefferies. Please go ahead.","John Janedis - Jefferies LLC","Thank you. David, as you mentioned, beyond Discovery, your ratings across your portfolio have largely decoupled from the industry this year. Can you talk about the drivers more so meaning is it a lot more original hours, a different way to promote them, and in the second quarter where ratings are scarce, can the gap in ad growth between you and the market widen further?","David M. Zaslav - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay, thanks, John. First I would say broadly we've effected a strategy which we started about a year ago which is to get back to the core brands, and I think that's really working for us. I think there was some brand drift across the industry, there was some brand drift across our platforms, and in order to have our content working stronger here in the U.S. having more value to advertisers and working in a much more compelling way around the world. We got rid of some of the programming that wasn't on-brand.","And so you really see that difference on Science, you see it on Discovery which has been two of the bigger drivers, having Discovery now as the number one network in America for men 18 years old to 49 years old for the majority of this year, and having that kind of leadership and having that content work around the world is a big deal for us. And it goes through every one of our channels that we've really focused on; what is the brand, how do we deliver on it. And I think that works also not only for around the world and in the U.S. but we own all that IP.","And as this transitions to people want to be curated for the content they want, people knowing that when they go to Animal Planet or they go to Science or they go to Discovery or TLC or the Oprah Winfrey Network that they see content on-brand, it reinforces the viewership. I think that's one of the reasons why we're seeing gains. Quarter-to-date we're either up 1% or relatively flat against a market that's down 7% or 8% and in April we're seeing even better trends.","So I think that pivot to being on-brand is really helping us, our GMs are really focused on using our 12% to 13% viewership on cable to promote between channels, which we think is much more effective. We did this in Latin America where we actually curate and let people know across our channels what's coming up. You're watching Discovery in Brazil and they'll tell you what's coming up on Science, what's coming up on Animal Planet, what's coming up on our car channel, and that had real value for us so we're starting to take that around the world.","On the advertising side, I do think that with our ratings, the ratings momentum that we have and the brand strength, that if the volume is there, that we could do \u2013 that we can continue to accelerate a differential. The question on the advertising side is, will the volume be there? As we've said for our projections for the year, we're assuming it stays tepid. It's been slightly better. We've been able to take advantage of it to some extent, but if there was more volume we would have had a much more robust quarter. Because we had the inventory, we had the strength, we had very attractive demographics. And so we're not getting excited. We can't see really what's happening in the Upfront yet, although we've sold about 30% of the Upfront so far and we're staying conservative.","John Janedis - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. That's helpful. Maybe separately, since last quarter's call there's been a lot of discussion about skinny bundles and where Discovery fits within them. How important is it for you to be a part of them? Do you think the Verizon offering will have broad appeal from consumers and does it pose risk to you or the ecosystem if others follow?","David M. Zaslav - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. I don't want to really speak too much about any particular player, but the ecosystem at least for the next few years, I believe, will stay together in terms of the overall majority. For most of our channels we have contractual agreements, long-term agreements that require 90%, 85%, 95% that our channels be provided. So the ability to just determine to offer a smaller bundle, I just don't see that as likely given the contractual obligations across the industry. Having said that, since we own all of our content, to the extent that others want to pick the best channels and make those available domestically and around the world or even take content outside of channels and offer them, that's more dollars for us and more opportunity.","In the longer term, I think it's important for us to continue to keep the existing ecosystem, which is very favorable to us, and as we transition to fight for the right kind of economics, like platforms like TV Everywhere. So I think that you'll see it at the margins, if you look at what Charlie's doing, it's starting, it's growing small but there are certain gates on that in terms of its ability to be marketed to only subscribers that don't have cable. I think the Apple platform is interesting. And all these things are good if you own all of your content and you have content that people really want. And that's why we've been really focusing hard on our super fans, who loves Discovery, Science, Oprah, Animal Planet, ID, having really strong brands that people love that we can curate to is more important, I think we got out early on that and we'll continue to take advantage of it.","John Janedis - Jefferies LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Michael Nathanson from MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead, sir.","Michael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC","Thanks. I have one for David and one for Andy. David, you were one of the only media companies and one of the only execs I know to stand up and oppose the Comcast deal. I wonder, do you feel retribution when that deal comes due later this quarter or do you think that the fact that you were so public gives you counterintuitively some protection that Comcast won't drop you because it's such a public squabble. So I wonder what was your thinking in going public and opposing that deal? And what do you expect to happen in the next quarter?","David M. Zaslav - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Michael. Well, first we didn't oppose the deal, what we said is we had some concerns about it. And at this point, look, we've always had great respect for Brian and for Neil and Steve Burke and I've worked with them over the last 30 years, they're very effective, they run a great company. And we've always managed to work together. The concerns that we raised, the concerns that we raise around the world, issues of what does consolidation do to content? What happens in terms of content investment; that's all behind us now. I think the goal for us and for Comcast is to find a deal that makes sense for both of us. We've been able to do over the last three years over 180 deals where we were happy, the distributors were happy.","We represent between 12% and 13% of viewership on cable and we still only represent between 4% and 5% of the economics. So, I think we're quite attractive with Discovery as the number one network and TLC as number one in many of the markets in Middle America, and as we've said, a lot of the affinity channels that we have like Oprah and Science, we've had conversations and negotiations. I'm going to see Neil later after this call, I'm headed to Chicago. I saw Neil on Saturday night. And so I think that it's business as usual now. Comcast is a great company; they're going to look to create a deal that's fair for them and so will we and we have plenty of time and we're very hopeful that we'll get something done; I know they are, too.","Michael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC","Okay, hey, thanks, and let me ask Andy, when you look at your domestic cost growth for this year, what quarter or two quarters do you think just gives you the highest cost growth, could you talk a bit about your profile of expense growth domestically this year?","Andrew C. Warren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President","Sure, Michael. Yes, we're very happy with how the cost trends have played out. We've been saying for a while now that we're committed to revenues growing faster than expense. We saw both in the U.S. and globally margin expansion in 2014 and in the first quarter of 2015 and we certainly see that trend continuing over time, but to answer your question we do think costs will uptick in the second quarter and third quarter based on predominantly timing of content, when they air and some marketing investments and then they will abate again in the fourth quarter. But, again, the focus on margin expansion both in the U.S. and internationally couldn't be more real and has been playing out very nicely for us.","Michael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC","Okay. Thanks, Andy. Thanks, David.","Operator","Thank you very much. The next question comes from the line of Benjamin Swinburne from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you, good morning. One for David; then I have a quick follow-up for Andy. David, you've acquired a lot of assets overseas to build scale. And I think at least some had the expectation that affiliate revenue growth over time might accelerate particularly in Europe given how much you've built the portfolio out. But it seems to be slowing and I think part of that might be by strategic design as you pivot a little bit more free-to-air but I don't want to over-read the quarter.","So, could you just spend some time talking about the affiliate revenue growth outlook and maybe just the general strategy to drive the top line internationally given what you're seeing in the landscape over there?","David M. Zaslav - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. Thanks, Ben. Look, I think that the fact that we have 10 traditional channels in 220 or 230 markets and now we have two to three sports channels across all of Europe, these are long cycle, these deals, and they take some time. What you've seen in the short-term is, given the geopolitical issues in the Ukraine, which as we all know what's happened there, we took a one-time only hit there from \u2013 because it's affected the cable market. And in one \u2013 Andy said markets, it's really one market in Eastern Europe, and we'll announce in the next few weeks which one it is. We've gone from a pay-only to pay and over-the-air, I think it's going to be quite effective for us, I think it's going to be a very good deal. It'll generate more value for us. We're able to \u2013 Turkey is a market, that doesn't have \u2013 oops, it doesn't have enough pay-TV, so that's a market that we're going free-to-air as well as pay. And we think we'll get pretty meaningful incremental value out of that.","Having said that, we still think that you'll see a trend to high single and longer-term you will see some good affiliate growth as those deals come up, as we have an ability to take advantage of scale and the scale is part of the scale is our market share growth. One of the key elements for our growth as a company has been that we've been able to grow our market share outside the U.S. and it translates almost pretty efficiently to advertising revenue, and we're getting a little better at advertising revenue, so we're over delivering.","So the fact that we were up 10% in market share around the world and then we were able to grow advertising 12% is really effective. And it's driven by our channels getting stronger, a little bit more localization, but also by the fact that we have real conviction across Eastern Europe and Western Europe, we have conviction in Latin America and in Asia. And a lot of the local players, as the economies have gotten more challenging, are spending less on content, and a lot of the U.S. players are pulling out and spending less on content.","And so we've seen on average, mid-teen growth over the last four years and we expect that that's going to continue. We have an awful lot of momentum on our growth. And so, we remain very optimistic about our international business. We have between channels and free-to-air, as well as sports in Europe and leadership with kids in Latin America, a very strong hand. We are seeing a slowdown in Asia.","So I would say an acceleration in Latin America, continued strong performance in Eastern Europe and Western Europe, with a little bit of a hiccup from some geopolitical. And the overall market in Asia outside of India, a little bit slow, that we were seeing double digit growth there over the years and that's really flattened now. But overall, I think our story's intact or better and we're aggregating a lot more IP under the covers. That's not only helping our market share and helping our brands around the world, but is better positioning us for the new world.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you. And just quickly, Andy, on currency, it looks like it was an even more significant hit to the international advertising growth this quarter. If you could just remind us of how the ad exposure compares to affiliate? It looks like there was a, I mean, a bigger SKU in Latin America, I'm just guessing looking at the results.","Andrew C. Warren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President","Yes, yes, the currencies continue to, Ben, as you know, to move against us. The ad sales exposure particularly with the euro, you look at some of the Nordic currencies, you look at Brazil, places where we have a greater proportion of free-to-air and ad dollars, that's where the currencies have moved against us. We have a success, though, if you look at what we said at year end, we said, well, the revenue impact from foreign exchange is going to be $350 million, $150 million OIBDA, we updated that today to say it's $475 million (sic) [$425 million] (46:49), and $150 million. So you do see that our hedging strategy is working, we are mitigating some of our bottom line exposures, but clearly the proportion of revenues coming out of Europe do dictate more ad sales impact.","David M. Zaslav - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","One last point, Ben, on advertising. There were some markets where I think a lot of the hard work that we've done will really pay off over the next couple of years. Some of the issues that we see, the gestational slowing of the U.S. and the question of what business models will emerge and how quickly and what will happen to bundling over the next five years to seven years, and outside the U.S, in a number of markets, particularly Latin America and India, it feels a lot like the U.S. did 10 years ago and a lot of what we see here will take many, many years.","Brazil, for instance, reached 30% cable penetration last year. As a result of that, we saw 40% or 50% advertising gains. Brazil is probably our strongest market; we're the leader in kids, we're the number one cable channel in all of Brazil, not just for kids, we have a channel called Home & Health, which is like the Home & Garden of Latin America, and that's the number three channel for women down there and we have Discovery, so when you look at our 11 channels in Brazil, it's extremely strong, we have five of the top 15. And coming off of last year where it was up 40% to 50%, we're seeing growth this year of another 40% to 50%.","And so, there is this moment in a lot of these markets where all of a sudden what was just DR starts to move over into advertising and you start to see the acceleration that we saw here in the U.S. in 1996, 1997, 1998. And so, Mexico and Brazil in particular I think are going to be engines that will really help us both gestationally, but also in terms of revenue growth because we have such strong content down there.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you, both.","Operator","Thank you very much. The next question comes from the line of Alexia Quadrani from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you. On the U.S. advertising front in the domestic networks, I guess my question is, I think you previously mentioned having less advertising spots this year. I guess, can you give us some color how you think that will give you some leverage, whether it's in the Upfront or just generally in pricing?","And then, just a follow-up question that's still staying on the U.S. on the distribution front; I know you've said you're not going to break out the over-the-top or SVOD going forward, but maybe more generally speaking, how we should think about U.S. distribution growth and the relative mix of the long-term of sort of traditional versus non-traditional?","David M. Zaslav - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure, thanks so much. Look, I think there's always this balance, but we have opted not to add meaningful inventory into our services, and I think this is a key element for us. When people go to Discovery, when they go to Science, when they go to Animal Planet or Oprah, we think that the load is critical. So that 1% could've been higher if we added some more spots, there's no question about it. We're significantly less than a lot of our peers, but we think for long-term brand value that's important.","And I think it's a philosophical long-term position for our company. We're still investing a lot in content, we're investing in IP, we're seeing how do we position Discovery so that we have more viewers, we have better content and we have more strength three years to four years from now than we do now. So, you won't see us adding a lot of minutes to make a good quarter. We're going to focus much more on are we getting more people enjoying spending time with our channels, are we building more characters and building more shows that could really work, not just on linear but outside of linear.","Right now, SVOD is relatively immaterial here in the U.S. because we own all of our content and we have a 30-year library. We have a fair amount of optionality. And depending on how the marketplace develops, there's a chance for us to do that, but that would be upside. And if there is a change in the marketplace and there is curation directly to consumers even if that content is not brand new, the ability to develop content, which we've looked at, for instance, on Science, developing a Science app, it's already converted into 48 languages. There has been some interest, as we've looked into the marketplace for Science, there could be some interest in Animal Planet that we could offer, much like you would see a Silicon Valley new media company, where we could offer some of those worldwide concepts like Science or Animal Planet in an app around the world over-the-top with content that isn't even that fresh that could nourish an affinity group. And that could be incremental, but that's not built-in today.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you very much.","Andrew C. Warren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President","And just to add to the domestic distribution trend. This has been a multi-year effort for us. We've talked about our share of viewership is much higher than our share of wallet. So, the deals we've done in the last three years, we talked about the rate increases, we talked about the various economic benefits, and you see that in spades in the first quarter with the organic distribution rate up 8%. So that traction and those new deals continue to support not only our brands and our content but trying to close that gap between share of viewership and share of wallet.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks, Andy.","Operator","Thank you very much. The next question comes from Todd Juenger from Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead, sir.","Todd Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Oh, hi. Thanks a lot. I'll keep it to just one question at this point in the hour. Just like to turn back to content strategy and I guess related to expense also; I know Rich has now firmly installed and last quarter you mentioned several high-profile direct reports to Rich overseeing things like scripted or programming miniseries programming, you talked about broadening your appeal to more targets.","I guess, one, listening to all of that could interpret that to sound like somewhat of a shift toward a little more scripted or, may I say, expensive-sounding programming, I just want to test you whether that would be a correct interpretation, whether you feel an imperative given the increasing on-demand consumption model to move to more sort of higher profile and maybe even scripted programming or would that be a misread, is it more just getting more to the core Discovery non-fiction plan? Thanks.","David M. Zaslav - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, thanks, Todd. No, and, in fact, I would say that you'll see more resources going against our best characters and shows and against blue chip. And we have two initiatives there, and some of these actually are less expensive. We have a 30-year library of fantastic content in the space genre and natural history and some of it has been narrated or edited in a way that feels like it's a little bit old, and so one of the initiatives that John Hoffman is looking at with Rich is an initiative called, Hello world!. We have the best library in the world of content. And we're now working with a number of the best producers and musicians to create kind of a fresh, a refresh of a lot of the fantastic content that we have, so that we can get another shot at that. We also have an initiative called, Discovery Impact, which is a socially conscious, what's happening with the world, whether it relates to water or the environment or extinction of a lot of the animal races that were \u2013 racing extinction is just one of those.","But we don't see a significant increase in investment. What we see is a hyper-focus on blue chip and the quality content, and we will be doing some stuff with John Goldwyn, who is great and he'll be overseeing scripted but we think we could do scripted in a much more efficient way; we're going to do it in more long form as opposed to one-offs and we'll do it with content that could work around the world so we could share it across 230 countries.","Andrew C. Warren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President","Yes, and just to add the financial perspective on that, Todd, we still see the U.S. content growth being low-single digits to mid-single digits, international as being mid-single digits to high-single digits. So that parameter of how we see the cost trends does not change.","Todd Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","That's very helpful. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Thank you very much. The next question comes from the line of Anthony DiClemente from Nomura. Please proceed. Thank you.","Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Hi. Thanks a lot. I have one for Andy and one for David. Andy, just on the buyback, going back to the TF1 put, you mentioned the $1.5 billion available for the year. Is it fair to assume that if you have no M&A and TF1 doesn't put their stake, that you'd use the majority or all of that $1.5 billion on buybacks? Can you just give us a little more there and then a follow-up for David?","Andrew C. Warren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President","Yes. Well, the answer is clearly yes, Anthony. We still see the $1.5 billion, as you said, of capital availability. Clearly, our priority would be on strategic bolt-on M&A and the TF1 put is part of that. But look, we couldn't be more bullish on our stock today. And I've said before, I'm a very simple free cash flow per share guy. When I look at that IRR, it's incredibly compelling to David and the board and I; so the answer is yes. That clearly is where we'd put available capital, staying within our BBB rating, which is an important strategic imperative for us.","Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Great, thanks. And then, David, I couldn't help but notice that you mentioned that you thought Apple TV was interesting. Just wanted to probe a little bit there what you think is compelling about it for the consumer, and then would you consider doing a deal with Apple TV that encompassed only let's say a few of your networks as opposed to all of them?","And then do you think that you'd include a robust portion of that 30-year library that you've mentioned; would VOD content from Discovery be a big piece of that sort of agreement (57:17)? Thanks.","David M. Zaslav - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Anthony. We can't speak about any specific deal. Really, we are platform-agnostic. But I think as there is some transition within the marketplace, the fact that we have \u2013 that Discovery is stronger than it's ever been and is the number one channel for men 18 years old to 34 years old in America and we're winning a number of nights where we're even beating the broadcasters. The fact that TLC has real strength where we can be in a position where several nights a week in 40 of the Middle States in America we're the number one cable network for women and Oprah is \u2013 and Tyler, Tyler's programming when he goes on the air on OWN we have over a 20% share of the African-American community and Oprah's programming is working so well on OWN. And ID is the most \u2013 is the stickiest channel on cable.","These become more and more important when people can make choices about what shows they want and what channels to put on different platforms and how much they're going to pay for those channels. Because in a world where there's a lot, a lot of opportunity, you want the best stuff with the most people that are yearning for it. For us, it's all about the economics. We want to make sure we get the right economics for our programming. We opted not to do certain SVOD deals in the U.S. because we didn't think the money was strong enough and we thought we'd rather hold on to it ourselves and either do something ourselves directly with consumers or do something with the existing distributors.","And every time there's a new player in the market that's looking for content, if we as an industry can stay disciplined about economics and how that content is offered, it just reinforces the fact that whether it's Apple, whether it's a Sony device, whether it's a cable-distributed product or a satellite or any new device, those are all essentially, in the nicest way, they're a pipe or a device to a consumer. What the consumer really wants is great brands, great characters, great stories that make those devices or those interfaces come alive. And anybody that's going to curate on any of those platforms, no one's going to buy it for the pipe or the platform. And so, our mission stays the same, but even more focused on the best content, the best brands will make Discovery more successful in the future on every platform.","Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you very much. This is the final question; it comes from the line of Rich Greenfield from BTIG. Please go ahead, sir.","Rich S. Greenfield - BTIG LLC","Okay.","David M. Zaslav - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Rich?","Operator","Rich has disconnected, sir.","David M. Zaslav - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We have to wait for Rich, otherwise he's going to be mad at us. We don't want Rich mad at us.","Jackie Burka - Vice President of Investor Relations","One last question?","Operator","Okay. A couple of people have now disconnected. Please confirm who you want as your next question, please.","David M. Zaslav - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Is Rich back on?","Operator","He's not, sir. I have one final question now; it comes from the line of David Bank from RBC. Please proceed.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Wow. Okay. Well, thank you, Rich, for dropping off so I could get in here.","David M. Zaslav - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We didn't do that. We didn't do that.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And I assure you I didn't have him drop off either. So, look, to offer greater transparency in the affiliate growth, you kind of helpfully called out some of the drivers domestically for distribution, including the Sony distribution deal. I think, I can't remember if Andy or David called it out, but no good deed goes unpunished. Since you kind of called it out; is the Sony deal, and maybe \u2013 I know you don't want to talk about specific deals, but maybe talk about it as kind of a template generally for these kinds of deal. Was this more of a bulk take or pay kind of deal? Or was it based on existing subs during the quarter? How does it reflect a template as we see some of these new over-the-top IP-based cable systems or MPB systems rolling out? Thanks.","David M. Zaslav - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay, thanks, David. We just can't talk specifically about any one deal. Sony's a very good company and they're offering I think a platform that's interesting and we're rooting for them. We hope they, like every other platform out there, does well. I would say that when there's a new platform, if we have channels that have real leadership with affinity groups and we're very strong, particularly with young demos as we are across a lot of our portfolio, that it gives us a strong hand in those discussions. But, again, we're coming off a small base. When you look at our overall \u2013 the revenue that we take from the marketplace, most of the money goes to sports and retrans. And that's just \u2013 we don't complain about it because that's the way it works. But if you looked at those players, they would have a percentage of viewership and then the revenue would be a multiple, some percentage significantly higher than that. In our case, we have 12% trending toward 13% of viewership and we have between 3%, 4%, or 5% of the economics.","And so, even when you look at those existing platforms, not only are we attractive because our content has some leading edge to it and the demos that we deliver, but even if we get what looks like a great deal for us or a very favorable deal, still compared with some of the other content that's out there, we're a pretty good buy. And I think that helps us, domestically and around the world, that to be the number one channel in America 18 years old to 49 years old and look at our cost base versus some of the guys that we compete with, including the sports guys, that's pretty compelling model. And that's pretty much true in the majority of countries around the world, that we're the number one channel for men in non-fiction. And in many of these countries where we've launched over-the-air Turbo channels, the demo is even younger. We're really in that 18 years old to 25 years old with the cars. And so, I think aggregating those audiences is going to be helpful and we tend to get much better deals with new players around the world. But it also is because our \u2013 the looks of our content compared to the sports guys is much more reasonable, and unscripted.","Andrew C. Warren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President","And just to quickly clarify, David, the numbers.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yes.","Andrew C. Warren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President","It was a de minimis impact on our first quarter affiliate. The plus 8% was driven by the many deals we've gotten done, both at end of 2014 and the end of 2013. So that continued traction on the distribution line was more driven by the substantial increases on the base business.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thanks, Andy. Thank you, guys.","Jackie Burka - Vice President of Investor Relations","Thanks, everyone.","Operator","Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the presentation.

Thank you for joining us for Discovery Communications 2014 Third Quarter Earnings Call. Joining me today are David Zaslav, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Andy Warren, our Chief Financial Officer. You should have received our earnings release, but if not, feel free to access it on our website at www.discoverycommunications.com.","On today\u2019s call, we will begin with some opening comments from David and Andy. After which, we will open up the call up to your questions. (Operator Instructions) Before we start, I would like to remind you that comments today regarding the company\u2019s future business plans, prospects and financial performance are forward-looking statements that we make pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are made based on management\u2019s current knowledge and assumptions about future events, and they involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations.

There has been a lot in the news lately on consumer disruptions to the video marketplace and the emergence of more over-the-top video options. Through all the innovation and press releases, we believe there remains one constant, it is a great time to be in the content business. Despite shifting behaviors and new digital offerings, more and more viewers are gravitating to high quality content and we still believe, there are many years of sustainable, organic growth from the continuing global rollout of pay television, as well as more new opportunities to display our content than ever before.","I want to start this morning by putting a framework around Discovery strategy and how we are driving organic growth around the world and building the next-generation of businesses and brands. The five pillars of our global strategy have not changed.","First, drive organic growth and leverage our infrastructure across the global pay TV market. Second, invest in content, format and IP that can take market share and attract new audiences across platforms. Third, take a strategic approach to localization on a market-by-market basis and selectively pursue smart bolt-on acquisitions to augment our portfolio. Fourth, unlock the value of Discovery\u2019s Beachfront real estate and distribution advantage around the world and lastly continue to deliver strong financial results and drive free cash flow per share growth.","We\u2019ve been pushing hard on our first principle to drive organic growth across the global pay TV market. 25 years ago, we launched Discovery Channel in the UK. Today, we have an average of eight channels in more than 225 countries. Discovery Communications\u2019 now reaches nearly 3 billion cumulative subscribers in every corner of the globe, distinguishing the company as the world\u2019s number one pay TV programmer with the world\u2019s most widely distributed network, The Discovery Channel which is in almost 500 million homes.","Overall, our global business continues its strong organic growth with international now accounting for more than 50% of our total company revenue and growing. That\u2019s an important inflection point for our company, a key differentiator for Discovery and the foundation of our growth strategy going forward.","That international infrastructure has allowed us to build a global brand factory. TLC is now the world\u2019s leading female network reaching more than 300 million homes in over 200 countries. ID is one of the world\u2019s fastest growing channels. We announced on Friday that ID has reached 100 million global homes with new launches in India and Denmark, that\u2019s an astounding milestone for a brand that did not exist anywhere in the world just five and half years ago. ID remained in the early stages of its growth cycle in every market, including the U.S.","We are building the next-generation of growth with the launch of Velocity worldwide, under both the Velocity and Turbo brands, we are launching our next global platform as a dedicated auto channel. The goal is to reach over a 125 million homes through the end of 2015, creating a very attractive global consumer and advertising brand.","We continue to see strong viewership gains around the world, with our global audience reaching an all-time high in the third quarter with aggregate ratings up 6% year-over-year. Two areas I would like to highlight for their consistent and attractive organic growth are our pay TV business in Latin America and India. Discovery has 13 brands in 49 countries across Latin America that offer a wide range of content to all demographic groups. The portfolio has had its best quarter ever with ratings up an impressive 20% in primetime across the region, driven by the Discovery Channel, our lifestyle brand Home & Health and Discovery Kids, an absolute juggernaut in the region and the number one pay TV channel in the key growth market of Brazil.","We have a very strong portfolio across Latin America today and are well positioned with multiple channels in the basic analog packages that are attractive to the emerging middle class around the region and should continue to see double-digit affiliate and advertising growth in the years ahead.","India also continues to be a particularly strong market as we roll-out new channels and brands including the recent launches of ID and Turbo. We now have 11 channels in five languages and a passionate consumer base for our science, technology and natural history programming. Ratings growth in India is over 100% this year, led by The Discovery Channel, Discovery Kids and Animal Planet. The market remains one of our most exciting growth opportunities for the company.","The second element of Discovery\u2019s growth strategy is investing in content, formats and IP that can take market share and attract new audiences across platforms. In September, we closed our deal to acquire UK-based independent production company, All3Media, through a joint venture with Liberty Global. This is a long-term strategy to broaden and deepen our IP holdings through this diversified asset that owns 19 separate production companies working across the non-fiction, scripted and sports genres.","In the U.S., TLC remained a top 10 ad supported cable network during the quarter and just last week had its highest audience in four years with 19 Kids and counting making TLC the number one network for the night.","And OWN continues its strong growth trajectory ranked as the number one cable network on Tuesday, Wednesday and Saturday nights for African-American women highlighted by Tyler Perry\u2019s \"The Haves and the Have Nots\" and the newest hit series \"If Loving You was Wrong\" and our newer networks American Heroes Channel, Destination America and Velocity continue to build viewership. American Heroes Channel was up 16% and Destination America and Velocity reached up almost double-digit.","Despite these wins our portfolio was not immune to the ratings declines across the TV landscape this summer. Improving our ratings is a top priority here in the U.S. Our laser focus on quality storytelling is paying off in the fourth quarter with ratings at Discovery Channel up more than 10% in October driven by a strong and balanced schedule. Sundays with Alaska \u2013 The Last Frontier, Mondays with Fast N\u2019 Loud and new hit MISFIT GARAGE and Fridays with Gold Rush, the number one show for men on TV on Fridays.","We also recently made a leadership change at The Discovery Channel and announced last week that long time Disney Executive, Rich Ross, the great old friend of mine that I\u2019ve always admired will join the company as President of The Discovery Channel in January. Rich is an extremely talented, creative executive with a history of producing great content, driving ratings, building strong global brands. He built Disney\u2019s TV channels worldwide and we have high expectations from Rich to draw Discovery Channels next chapter of growth, he\u2019ll be starting early in the year.","A key differentiating factor for Discovery is our content ownership, which allows us to be platform-ready and flexible in how we reach consumers. We produced 2,500 hours of content a year. No other company can say that and we own almost all of it. We recently reached an agreement with Sony to provide Discovery Networks content on their new platform. An exciting new platform for us to display our brands and last month, we completed a strong renewal with SouthernLINC Communications in the U.S. for our entire portfolio of U.S. networks. As part of this deal, we expect SouthernLINC\u2019s customers to have authenticated access to Discovery\u2019s content inside and outside the home and start building those new TV Everywhere offerings of the future. Three other platforms, where we are exploiting our IP for learning and new revenue streams are Discovery Education, Eurosport and SBS Nordics.","Discovery is a leader in digital education, reaching over half of all U.S. schools and 35 million students with our innovative digital text books and sweet of educational products. Discovery Education is meaningful to our top and bottom-lines and exposes our brand to millions of kids in a really positive enriching way and that exposure and relationship allows us to build trust and engagement with the next-generation of media consumers at a very early age.","In addition as part of our Eurosport acquisition, we also picked up the Eurosport player. A strong direct-to-consumer over-the-top subscription product or app that has grown consumer significantly in the last few months. We have also begun to do some great work in the Nordics with a new over-the-top product called D Play in Norway. With high broadband penetration and strong demand for our content across the Nordics, an aggregated service of our combined Discovery, scripted and sports products has provided a growth in paying subscribers that amounts to nearly a three-fold increase in the past year.","D Play and Eurosport players give us new incremental revenue streams as well as great data for viewing habits on mobile platforms, how to best distribute and schedule, our consumer offerings across linear and digital and help us develop expertise in building new SVOD products and revenue models that are additive to our pay TV business.","The third principle is to take a strategic approach on a market-by-market basis and selectively pursue smart bolt-on acquisition to augment our portfolio, but also looking for opportunities to diversify our content, keeping our local relevancy and add meaningful scale.","Last month, we began our latest localization initiative in South East Asia. Our strategy is to shift resources from our current Singapore headquarters to new local offices in growth markets including the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand.","Additionally, in South Korea we are investing in a new in-country presence and leadership team following the implementation of the free trade agreement and the ease of restrictions on foreign broadcasters. In the Nordics, we continue to see the benefits of last year\u2019s acquisition of SBS Nordics, due to our selling and enhanced portfolio offering to advertisers.","In Europe, newly acquired Eurosport is starting to show the benefits of having increased access to compelling sports rights as we have taken a combined Eurosport and Discovery offering to the market. In addition, Eurosport previously relied almost exclusively on Pan European ad sales. The benefit of discoveries local teams means, we can increase our inventory to sell local in addition to Pan European and local ad markets are significantly bigger than Pan European.","For example, a few weeks ago, we presented our combined portfolio for the first time to advertisers at our upfront in Germany. We announced that Eurosport acquired the exclusive TV and digital rights for MotoGP in Germany and the Netherlands for not a lot of money. These popular high-speed motorcycle races hold strong appeal to sports fans in both countries and are a good example of how we are surgically strengthening Eurosport\u2019s content in two important markets.","Additionally, where we have the rights we are just beginning to sample our new sports content across Discovery\u2019s other platforms. Our new Turbo channel will air Bundesliga soccer matches in Poland. And during the U.S. Open we add the women\u2019s final matches on our SBS channel can now five to all-time high ratings in Denmark because Wozniacki, a finalist in the U.S. Open was Danish. Again, just some very early examples of the optionality that this platform will give us to co-sale co-program and build out a combine pay TV offering with more meaningful scale in many key markets.","Another part of our strategy is to create the equivalent of regional sports network in the U.S. by localizing content on Eurosport 2 to make individual channel feeds even more compelling to local advertisers, distributors and viewers. In Sweden, we\u2019ve relaunched the network as Eurosport 2 Sweden with local Hockey rights and customized in the local language with local talent and with the dedicated feed. The distribution that Eurosport 2 provides could be the basis for a number of strong local channels in the year ahead.","Our fourth growth principle is to unlock the value of Discovery\u2019s Beachfront real estate and distribution advantage around the world. Here we are thoughtfully investing in new TV brands and identifying category wide space. We\u2019ve recently increased our stake in the Hub network to 60%, renamed the channel Discovery Family Channel and the network debut in on October 13th continues our partnership with Hasbro. With reach of over 70 million U.S. homes, the network features has both studio kids content during the day and Discovery programming for families and parents watching with kids in the evenings and primetime. In the first few weeks ratings are up double-digits and their strong advertiser interest for co-viewing in a quality brand environment.","Our final principle is to continue to deliver strong financial results. Andy will provide more detail on our financial performance, but we had another quarter of double-digit organic OIBDA growth as we expanded organic margins both domestically and internationally and we remain focused on driving free cash flow per share growth. So with all the opportunities and new platforms, we remain confident Discovery is very well-positioned now and for the future with our strong global brands, ownership for popular non-fiction categories, diversified worldwide assets and strong operating and financial track record. We firmly believe we can deliver sustained long-term growth and continued shareholder value creation.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Andy for details on our financial results.","Andrew Warren","Thanks David and thank you everyone for joining us today to discuss our third quarter performance.","Discovery\u2019s ability to execute on our key strategic global growth initiatives while focusing on tightly controlling costs led to another quarter of solid results. On a reported basis, total company revenue in the third quarter increased 14% led by 32% international growth, which is partially offset by 1% decline in our domestic networks, primarily due to digital licensing revenues in the prior year.","Total operating expenses on a reported basis increased 18% mostly due to the inclusion of the Eurosport leading to reported OIBDA growth of 8%. Excluding the impact of Eurosport, digital licensing revenues and foreign currency movements, total company revenues grew 7% with our strong and successful focus on controlling costs and ensuring that revenues grow faster than expenses. Our organic expense growth was up only 4%. Behind this 4% expense growth was a 5% increase in cost of revenues as we remained disciplined about our investment in programming while still continuing to gain audience share globally and a 3% increase in total company SG&A. With revenues growing 300 basis points faster than costs, our organic adjusted OIBDA grew 10% with underlying margins expanding by a 100 basis points versus last year.","Net income available to Discovery Communications increased 10% to $280 million driven by the improved operating performance, as well as increase in equity investment earnings and lower mark-to-market equity-based compensation, partially offset by higher restructuring costs related to Eurosport integration.","We also lowered our effective tax rate from last year\u2019s third quarter by 400 basis points to 35% this quarter as we remain extremely focused on lowering both our effective and cash tax rates by fully utilizing our increasing international business mix. To this end, as we continue to grow our foreign assets and content production capabilities in critical international markets, we now have land at site to our being able to reduce our global effective tax rate to below 30% for fiscal 2017.","This sustained year-over-year reduction and our tax rate would not only drive net income growth but also accelerate our free cash flow and capital availability growth as well. Adjusted net income which is a more relevant metric from the comparability and evaluation perspective, as it excludes the impact from non-cash acquisition amortization of intangible assets with $330 million this quarter, a 9% improvement versus last year.","Earnings per diluted share for the third quarter was $0.41, 17% above the third quarter a year ago, adjusted earnings per diluted share was $0.46, a 15% increase. Looking at the last 12 months, adjusted net income increased 21% to $1.3 billion, while adjusted earnings per diluted share increased 27% to $1.87.","Free cash flow in the third quarter of $393 million declined by 10% versus a year ago as the improved operating performance was more than offset by higher cash taxes mostly due to the expiration of the accelerated content cost recovery under Section 181.","Over the last 12 months, free cash flow decreased by 3% to $1.1 billion as the higher tax and content payments more than offset the stronger operating performance. However, free cash flow per share a critical metric for us and one that most influences our strategic planning and execution was up nicely over the last 12 months as a decrease in our share count due to our aggressive stock buybacks more than offset the declines in free cash flow.","Content spending during the third quarter excluding Eurosport increased mid-single-digits, even as we continue to drive the Euro market share growth across the globe. Before moving on to the divisional results, I do want to highlight that were not part of our free cash flow, OWN continues to increase its cash flow generation and repay Discovery a net $70 million in the third quarter.","And turning now to the operating units, revenues of the U.S. Networks were down 1% on reported basis through the digital licensing revenues recognized a year ago. Excluding the impact from licensing revenues, organic domestic revenues grew 3% with advertising and distribution growth partially offset by a $3 million decline in other revenues again primarily due to lower content licensing sales, as we are sharing more programming this year with international networks versus selling the third parties.","Domestic advertising revenues increased 1% in the quarter. We faced the tough comp versus the 12% of advertising growth in the third quarter of last year but healthy volume and price increases this year more than offset lower delivery. Distribution revenues excluding licensing revenue increased 6% during the third quarter, as we again benefited from the higher rates, we were able to secure during our last round of affiliate negotiations.","Looking at the cost side, domestic operating expenses declined 4% from the third quarter of 2013 on a reported basis and declined at 2% excluding the impact of SVOD. This was primarily due to an 11% decline in SG&A partly offset by a 7% increase in content amortization versus last year. Our ability to tightly manage cost led to flat reported domestic adjusted OIBDA despite the decrease in reported revenues and led to organic adjusted OIBDA growth of 6%. This resulted in organic margin of 59% up fully 200 basis points versus the third quarter a year ago.","Turning to the other main segment of our business, our International division continue to deliver strong results growing reported revenues 32% and increasing reported adjusted OIBDA 25%. Reported results include the impact of the Eurosport acquisition and foreign currency headwinds. Foreign currency had a significant negative impact on our results in the quarter. Given the continued strengthening of the dollar versus the euro and other key currencies. The euro and the four Nordic currencies comprise over half of our international OIBDA. So with the euro down 7% in the quarter and the Nordic currencies each down between 5% and 7% against the dollar, the profit impact was significant. Therefore for comparability purposes, my following comments on our international business will refer to our results excluding both Eurosport and FX fluctuations.","Total international revenues grew 10% as advertising revenues increased 12% and affiliate revenues grew 8%. International advertising continues to be the fastest growing segment of our business and significantly outperforms the overall international ad markets. There are some small pockets of softness in the third quarter in Russia and neighboring countries as well as certain countries within Asia, we were able to grow organic advertising revenues, a very healthy 12% as a majority of our regions to our ad revenues up double-digits.","Growth was led by Western Europe as we continue to benefit from the success of our free-to-air initiatives in Italy, Spain, Germany and the UK and by the Nordics where we still grew ad sales in the high single-digit range as we continue to see a scale driven pricing benefit across our networks, despite lower net ad sales in Sweden due to their lower put levels.","Latin America remains an incredibly healthy growth market for us, driven by Brazil and Mexico as the Central and Eastern Europe were higher pricing in Poland more than offset political instability in Russia as well as the issue that some advertisers in Russia have started to move dollars out of cable TV to broadcast ahead of the cable TV advertising ban that goes into effect on January 1st of next year.","Asia was soft again this quarter as the tourism category has been negatively impacted by local geopolitical issues in certain key markets.","Taking a step back, we expect international advertising to remain the top growth driver of our global business as we see double-digit organic growth continuing for the foreseeable future. Our unparalleled global distribution platform will allow us to continue to benefit from the rapid evolution of the global pay TV market as we increasingly take share and increase CPMs at our existing networks while simultaneously rolling out our homegrown brands like TLC, ID and Velocity to more and more markets around the world.","On the affiliate front, the 8% affiliate revenue increase in the quarter was driven primarily by subscriber growth especially in Latin America from the continued expansion of pay television in Brazil, Mexico and Colombia and in Central and Eastern Europe from additional subs in Russia and Africa and from new channel launches in the Middle East, Turkey and Africa.","Turning to the cost side, operating expenses internationally were up 7% in the third quarter, primarily driven by higher content amortization and increased personnel costs as we further expand our global footprint. Our ability to grow global revenues in excess of global costs led to 16% adjusted OIBDA growth in the quarter. Very importantly, we delivered another quarter of strong organic margin expansion internationally with margins on the base business up over 100 basis points year-over-year.","Finally, taking a look at our overall financial position with the strong balance sheet and sustained financial and operating momentum and given our gross leverage targets and long range free cash flow per share growth assumptions, we expect to continue returning capital to shareholders as we invest in our global businesses.","During the first nine months of this year, we bought back over $1 billion worth of our stock including another $298 million during the third quarter and we still plan to return more capital to shareholders in 2014 than we did in 2013. Since we began buying back shares towards the end of 2010. We now spent over $5.3 billion buying back shares, reducing our outstanding share count by around 25%.","Turning now to our full year forecast, primarily due to the considerable foreign currency headwinds, I previously discussed, as well as the significant geopolitical issues in Russia and lower than expected domestic ad sales. We now forecast total company revenues to be between $6.3 billion and $6.35 billion. Adjusted OIBDA to be between $2.5 billion and $2.55 billion. Net income to be between $1.15 billion and $1.175 billion and adjusted net income of $1.275 billion to $1.305 billion. We also now expect our 2014 free cash flow to be approximately $1.125 billion for the year. It\u2019s extremely important to highlight that for the non-controllable currency headwinds and the negative impact of the Russian geopolitical situation would have been at or close to the bottom-end of our previous guidance ranges.","Also important to note, these updated guidance ranges utilize current foreign currency exchange rates and assume stabilization of our U.S. ratings. They also include approximately $20 million of anticipated 4Q content impairment changes mostly associated with our recently announced cancelations of Honey Boo Boo and Sons of Guns as well as the nominal benefit of our now consolidating The Discovery Family Channel which would have past many quarters had reported largely breakeven results.","Thanks again for your time this morning and now David and I\u2019ll be happy to answer any questions you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","(Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Michael Nathanson from MoffettNathanson. Please proceed.","Michael Nathanson \u2013 MoffettNathanson LLC","Thank you. I have one for David and yes one for Andy on your numbers. In the past month or so has been lot concerned about the creation of smaller cable bundles within the U.S. I wonder given the diversity of your portfolio, do you think this is a legitimate concern or just philosophy on working with operators looking to create smaller bundle? That one for Andy.","David Zaslav","Okay. There is a lot of, I think press release activity in the marketplace. In the end, I think if the marketplace moves that way, it\u2019s likely to move pretty slowly, people are still watching more TV than they ever have and the duration of the bundle was very effective. The unbundling, I just don\u2019t see it happening, I think it\u2019s \u2013 if it does move in that direction overtime we own all of our content which is in advantage. We\u2019re taking advantage of it with Eurosport in Europe, we\u2019re taking advantage of a little bit with D Play in the Nordics but here in the U.S. I think you\u2019ll see the pay TV model maybe working this way but even then they\u2019ll be working that way with distributors in a way that is not too disruptive. ESPN has gone in a way that\u2019s very limited for broadband, so I think there are a lot of releases here. It\u2019s unlikely to have a significant impact in the near-term in the next four, five or six years as content goes directly to consumers. We have great super fans of our content domestically and around the world and if it moves that way in any meaningful way, we\u2019ll be able to take I think very strong advantage of it because the affinity groups we have, the quality of content that we have and the fact that we own it, we own all of it. So you don\u2019t have to go to anybody for it.","But I think it\u2019s going to get a little more overplayed over the next couple of months, they\u2019ll be a lot of announcements in this question, what\u2019s the price? What\u2019s the platform? Will people aggregate together? In the end, there will I believe be a rationalization, we have a strong marketplace here in the U.S. basic cable is very effective it\u2019s also going to be a lot cheaper. And if you try and aggregate a few of these direct-to-consumer products.","Michael Nathanson \u2013 MoffettNathanson LLC","Okay, David. Let me ask Andy, I don\u2019t think you gave us an update on your verifications for international advertisement growth. What are we assuming for the fourth quarter for domestic in terms of growth?","Andrew Warren","Michael, we\u2019re not providing any forecast in that right now. There is a lot of moving parts with the international ad sales. Well, pricing is good, there is a lot around volume right now. Lot more being brought closer to air and so for us, we had a strong delivery in October. But we\u2019re not going to give any guidance yet in the fourth quarter as given how close right now bookings are to air time.","Michael Nathanson \u2013 MoffettNathanson LLC","Okay. Thanks Andy.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alexia Quadrani from JP Morgan. Please proceed.","Alexia Quadrani \u2013 JP Morgan Chase & Co","Hi, thank you very much. Just digging in a little bit further on your commentary on the domestic advertising environment. Do you find that the softness in the third quarter was largely just ratings delivered because of softer ratings or was it really because there was any I guess smaller budgets or any change in sort of the way allocation spending was and if there is any further insights in that that would be helpful.","Andrew Warren","Sure Alexia. In the third quarter, if you looked at overall viewership for the summer on cable. It was down that\u2019s coming back a little bit. We\u2019ve seen this outside the U.S. I think it\u2019s too early to call it a trend. There are a lot of markets where we\u2019ve seen viewership come down and then come back up. So, certainly ratings and in our case, our ratings I think were lower than we expected had an impact. Pricing is fine, the scatter market I would say held up okay in the third quarter. in the last month or so we feel that it\u2019s gotten a little bit softer so pricing is still I would say pretty steady maybe even good, but there is a lot more scatter out there not just from us but from everyone. And people are booking closer to time we\u2019ve been booking on some of our networks for this past weekend we were booking on Thursday and Friday for the weekend.","So normally we\u2019d be able to give you a real good sense of where we would be through the end of the year here domestically, but the visibility is not what it\u2019s been that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s going to be bad. But I would say for the first month there was some softness in terms of the volume. And whether that picks up in the next two months or not we\u2019re going to have to see if we do our ratings are doing better, Discovery is doing better, we have some good premiers coming up, we have some strength on TLC with some series coming back strong. I think we\u2019ll do fine, the question is will the scatter volume be there and we just don\u2019t have that much visibility right now.","Alexia Quadrani \u2013 JP Morgan Chase & Co","And thank you very much. And just a follow-up on your commentary about the \u2013 in the prepared remarks about the SVOD. Are you guys still in conversation I guess with other SVOD players for a domestic deal here and the Sony deal that you had highlighted and if there is any color if you can give us in terms of the potential financial impact of that in \u201815.","Andrew Warren","Okay. On Sony we were able to structure I think a very favorable deal for us and for them. I think it\u2019s an innovative platform and I think they got good value and we felt that we got very good value so I think that worked that very well. On SVOD in general, here in the U.S., we continue to talk to Amazon, to Hulu, to Netflix, we think they are strong players in this marketplace, it\u2019s an extra bite at the apple which provides incremental value and for us it\u2019s been almost old drops to the bottom line.","Overtime, I think we will get significant value. The question is whether we\u2019ll get it directly from them or whether we\u2019ll get it by pursuing it ourselves. I expect that right now it\u2019s really just a value issue we could have done deals with all them but we felt that our content was more valuable.","Alexia Quadrani \u2013 JP Morgan Chase & Co","Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Todd Juenger from Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed.","Todd Juenger \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC.","Hi thanks. Good morning. David I\u2019d love to pick up right where you just left off. And just give you a chance to respond to something I hear a lot I\u2019m sure we all do. So just thinking about as you contemplate the SVOD window, how do you responded to those who say the fact that Discovery hasn\u2019t found a deal that works yet with those players. Is somehow a signifier of a decreased relevance of Discovery\u2019s content in an increasing on-demand world and I wonder how you respond when people say that \u2013 and I have a follow-up. Thanks.","David Zaslav","Thanks Todd. Well, we would significantly disagree with that on a couple of levels. One, SVOD is really determining itself what it is. If SVOD ends up being HBO and it\u2019s basically movies and a couple of original scripted series. And the answer maybe that for that platform we\u2019re not at the top of the list. And in that case I think there are likely to be others that will take the strong quality content that we have and in a similar model reach consumers. So that\u2019s one is what will Netflix and Amazon be? Will it be mostly movies and a few scripted or will it be a broader offering? We represent now over the last seven years we\u2019ve grown our reach here in the U.S. from about 5% of viewership on cable to almost 12%. And on any given night one of our channels is either number one or two network in America. On Tuesday nights we\u2019re the number one network in America with Tyler Perry\u2019s content on OWN. Later on Tuesday night, we\u2019re the number one channel in America with 19 and counting where we get over a 3 rating in the demo on TLC. On Friday nights we\u2019re the number one network on TV including the broadcasters with Gold Rush and they are in scripted series but lot of it well except in the case of Tyler where we have two very strong scripted series, but they\u2019re thematic programs that have very strong viewership, very strong DVR and a lot of social.","So when you look across our 14 networks, we have a lot of great content and so the question is how do we reach consumers and how do we get the value that we deserve for and I think overtime, we will get a substantial amount of value in that window. It may present itself with TV Everywhere is another app.","Todd Juenger \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC.","Okay, thanks. Fair enough. And Andy if you don\u2019t mind just a quick one, as we think about program investment into \u201815, I just wonder given probably a little software revenue environment right now than you wish and you\u2019re putting together budgets for next year. Are you thinking that you need to increase investment to recover ratings or that you need to maybe lighten up on investment a little to protect margins or something in between and where should we think about content investment for next year? Thanks.","Andrew Warren","Sure. If you look at what the last \u2013 for the last couple of quarters we\u2019ve kind of increased our base content spend, call it mid-single-digits and so we came down from the kind of higher investment period of 2012 and 2013 and we\u2019ve been much more at this kind of mid-single digit range. I would say that that\u2019s very much our hypothesis for the next several in many quarters. I think it\u2019s the right level of increase for us as we continue to expand our networks internationally and as we look to have and nurture new content domestically. I don\u2019t see it being really any more than that, we don\u2019t need to, to still generate our market share growth and so I think in terms of base content spend being mid-single-digits for the foreseeable future.","Todd Juenger \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC.","Got it. Thanks guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jessica Reif Cohen from Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.","Jessica Reif Cohen \u2013 BofA Merrill Lynch","Thanks. I\u2019ll follow along the same path as everyone else one for David and then for Andy.","David, what trust is really interesting hire for you guys? Given his success at the Disney channel. I\u2019m just wondering what we should look for at Discovery. Is there any kind of change in content strategy, what are his priorities?","David Zaslav","Well, the good news with Discovery is, I think we have some real upside. We have three nights, we\u2019re at the very top of within the cable universe for [men] but when we look at Discovery and we see what Discovery can do? There are number of markets, where our market share are more than two or three times what it is in the U.S. in a number of our markets and so I think building on the Discovery is still the number one cable brand in America, by the surveys of cable operators, the brand that viewers most value and so I think that there is even in a flat market like the U.S. is upside, if we can up our game a little bit with more quality content, with some better storytelling, better characters because when we get it right, the viewer show up and it works everywhere in the world, Rich is a great programmer, very strong creative. He and I spent a lot of time talking about what Discovery could be and the opportunity to grow it and I think Rich is going to do a great job, we\u2019re going to line up behind him and I think Discovery can have a real chance to get even stronger and for the brand to get even stronger.","Jessica Reif Cohen \u2013 BofA Merrill Lynch","Yeah, he had amazing run at Disney. And then Andy I guess it\u2019s like the two part question but how does the hub effect, the hub consolidation effect of fourth quarter numbers you said it was breakeven until now and can you give us an idea of the impact of that the Russia ban on advertising. What does that mean for 2015?","Andrew Warren","Sure. So just on the first question for the hub. It\u2019s about $20 million to $25 million of top-line per quarter it\u2019s what the hub has been driving, mostly around distribution versus ad sales and as you\u2019ve said it really has been for the last many quarters largely a breakeven profit line as the cost for the hub is predominantly match the revenues.","With regard to Russia. I guess it is less than 2% of our global revenues again predominantly distribution revenue versus ad sales for this year relative to our previous guidance. The reduction of our guidance has been predominantly driven by two things uncontrollable things. First of all, foreign exchange that we talked about unprecedented level of strengthening of the dollar of the last several weeks and that\u2019s been about a $100 million impact on the top-line for the year relative to what we thought back in July and then Russia is about 20 million so those are two big impacts for sure. But again the key highlight with Russia is less than 2% of global revenues and predominantly distribution revenue.","David Zaslav","And for the near term. The subscriber growth in Russia is quite strong. So we\u2019ll get the benefit of that and as Andy said next year, we\u2019ll lose the benefit of the ad sales piece.","Jessica Reif Cohen \u2013 BofA Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Bank from RBC Capital Market. Please proceed.","David Bank \u2013 RBC Capital Markets, LLC","Okay. Thanks very much. Hey David I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the contribution to the overall domestic growth rate from what I guess you would call the developed portfolio of the flagship channels versus the developing portfolio and how you kind of see those trends, how the contribution has evolved maybe over the last couple of years and how you see it evolving over the next couple? And then for Andy, you gave us a comment about sustainable double-digit I believe international ad growth for a while but double-digit is a pretty wide range, is there any way you could kind of put a little bit more context around that comment? Thanks very much.","David Zaslav","Great, thanks so much. About 70% of our revenue is from Discovery, TLC and Animal Planet but used to be 85 or 88. We\u2019ve launched more channels in the last 4.5 years than all media companies combined here in the U.S. really because we believe if we deployed that capital then we could still grow audience. So ID is the number, is a top five network in America that didn\u2019t exist a few years ago, it\u2019s the number two network in daytime. Number two in late night and it\u2019s still growing. OWN is the top network for African-Americans and a top network for women and still growing. Velocity is a great kind of niche network that we\u2019re seeing substantial growth out of, we have AHC which we\u2019re moving into aggressively in the history space and military space in a way that\u2019s showing real growth in Destination America. So into that 5% growth of market share that we had that\u2019s grown to almost 12 probably would have been 5 to 6.5 or 7 and so I think that strategy has really worked for us. And it raises two issues, one of the reasons I think we got a great opportunity with Rich is I think we can do a better job on our flagships of growing our audience and the last year or so it\u2019s been relatively flat and so I think that we can, with the right creative leadership we could really drive that.","The second is this environment where we\u2019ve deployed all this capital to launch all these new channels, we\u2019ve done it is because it\u2019s been a healthy marketplace. And the ability to do that and continue to do that in the future, the whole Comcast consolidation in the industry raises some questions about the ability of independent program as we\u2019re the largest independent programmer in America, to continue to invest in new channels and new niche content that can attract viewers.","Andrew Warren","And David your question regarding the look forward on international ad sales. We feel still extremely foolish and good about ability to outperform the market as our share of wallet continues to follow the share of viewership. I would think that the third quarter is kind of being a proxy what we see for the next kind of four or plus quarters. We had 12% growth and that was really driven by still sustained high-teen growth in Latin America, Central Eastern Europe, and Western Europe as again we continue to see great organic growth there and even some good pricing leverage as well. If you look at the Nordic region, we were able to deliver 8% growth in Nordic as the power ratio, the kind of new focus of that acquisition, we got the cost synergies done, now we\u2019re moving on the revenue synergies. So we\u2019re seeing really some outsize and some sustained growth out of Nordics, so I would think in terms of sustained double-digit going forward like you saw in the third quarter I would think in terms of still a very strong growth in our core growth regions and kind of in that 10, 11, 12, 13% growth is what we expect for the next many quarters.","David Bank \u2013 RBC Capital Markets, LLC","Okay thank you very much for that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Benjamin Swinburne \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Thank you. Good morning, Andy on your tax comments, can you just give us a sense for your cash tax expectations overtime I think you said you\u2019d get I think below 30 by 2017 on a GAAP rate. And if that has any implications for whether or not an inversion might make sense for the company at some point now that you\u2019ve got this line of sight and then if either you or David on the SBS acquisition should we be thinking about that high single-digit growth rate as representative of those assets because I believe that the decent acceleration on how they performed before you acquire them, just trying to get a sense for whether that SBS specific or sort of Pan Nordic for lack of a better term?","David Zaslav","Sure. Ben on the tax one, I couldn\u2019t be more happy and enthused about the progress that we\u2019re making on our global tax structures and rate expectations. We do now see line of sight and first time we already given kind of a long-term perspective on our tax rates and so we definitely see below 30% for fiscal 2017. The question on the cash tax rate well 181 has had a big impact this year in a negative way by about a $150 million giving the timing of cash taxes relative to that ruling.","As we look forward and we see roughly cash taxes being at or 1% below the effective tax rate as we look to maximize the value of deferred tax structures. So certainly our cash taxes will be kind of at or slightly below whatever effective tax rate once we work through this kind of 181 cycle. And so with regard to also regarding inversion like it doesn\u2019t change our view on that, as we said before well inversion can make some sense, the key notion is inversion can make a very good deal of great, it can\u2019t make a bad strategic deal good and so we\u2019re taking the hard look, we\u2019re very confident in our ability to still drive down our effective in cash tax rates given international structures and given our now ability to generate more and more content and tax advantage jurisdictions. So we don\u2019t need inversion to get to a significant amount of tax rate reduction overtime.","Benjamin Swinburne \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Thank you.","David Zaslav","With regard to the kind of organic growth story around acquired assets, look for SBS clearly part of our thinking there was around the power ratio, around the ability to leverage that market positioning and grow our already established channels in that market we\u2019re seeing that now I think for Eurosport it\u2019s a very different notion, it\u2019s much more about going from Pan European sale to a local sale I think we can definitely drive a lot more ad sales growth out of that asset across those different markets than we are seeing with SBS. It doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re not happy with the SBS ad sales growth in fact 8% is clearly meaningfully higher than market and I think it reflects our power ratio that we\u2019re going to be able to drive for the next many quarters but definitely thinking in terms of for Eurosport and maybe other acquisitions that we look at, there\u2019s not only notion of the combination of market leverage but also the idea of leveraging our local infrastructure, leveraging our local ad sales team to drive much more localized ad sales growth.","Benjamin Swinburne \u2013 Morgan Stanley","it sounds like based on our long-term commentary or medium-term commentary the sort of macro slowdown hasn\u2019t impacted your growth rate in that region broadly at all, is that fair?","David Zaslav","Absolutely fair. it just go back to this whole notion of our overall viewer market share is so much higher than our share of ad sales, the share of viewership versus share of wallet, we still have a long way to catch up and that\u2019s really is driving right now our out performance.","What are the advantages for us is that there was a real retraction across Western and Eastern Europe and over the last several years we\u2019ve gone in hard and we also have a huge amount of content, quality content that we bring into the marketplace that works well when others have retreated with investment but the amount of quality content that we have in language that we can bring into the market is significant and so we see our share advantage continuing to grow and as our share advantage grows we get the advantage of that but we also pickup as our scale grows some power ratio advantage, so we\u2019re pretty optimistic about Western and Eastern Europe.","Benjamin Swinburne \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vasily Karasyov from Sterne Agee. Please proceed.","Vasily Karasyov \u2013 Sterne Agee","Thank you. David, when you were talking about softness of cable ratings in Q3 unlike couple of your peers I don\u2019t think you mentioned the potential impact of Nielsen measurement and sample changes. So I was wondering if you disagree that there is a big impact in the decline from what Nielsen is doing and it differs because of your different key demos so if you could comment on this, I would appreciate it?","David Zaslav","We\u2019re talking to Nielsen behind the scenes, I think our job is to drive our channels and deal with the existing currency which is Nielsen. But when we look at actual setback data, we see a different story and we do think that Nielsen is quite antiquated and I gave an example on our last call that in Norway viewership was down almost double-digit and then they came with the new Q-tone measurement system where you wear a device and anytime you see something or show if it\u2019s with commercials that whether you see at a bar whether you see it on your iPad, whether you see it at your guest home, whether you see it on your computer you get credit. And viewership in Norway is up mid-teens now in for the last couple of months.","So there is clearly a viewership issue and the people are consuming content a little bit differently and they need to catch up. But we\u2019ll work that behind the scenes and from our perspective we need to grow our share and we can\u2019t look and say well it\u2019s Nielsen. We\u2019ve been able to grow our share every year and we continue to believe we can grow our share every year, we have the advantage that when we do grew that share. We take it outside the U.S. and get a multiple on that share so for us it\u2019s a much more efficient investment. But we still believe in the U.S. and we just got a focus on telling more great stories and stronger quality content because when we deliver the big audiences come.","Vasily Karasyov \u2013 Sterne Agee","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Anthony DiClemente from Nomura. Please proceed.","Anthony DiClemente \u2013 Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.","Hi thanks. One for David and one or two equivalents for Andy and David I think [prudent] is trying to force a reduction of non-Russian owned cable networks that reside in Russia to 20% or below I know it\u2019s until 16 but is there a way that you can softer that in terms of Russia I guess I mean can you redomicile your Russia cable networks somewhere outside at Russia or how can you avoid being forced to sell those.","And then Andy I was just wondering you mentioned early free cash flows impacted by cash content payments which I presume were higher than reported so can you just talk to us about that difference between cash content costs and reported content spend and over what time period that disparity could unwind.","And then sorry for the third one but final one is just on the scatter market softness just wondering if you guys would attributed more so to a shift to digital platforms or more sort of economic sluggishness in the U.S. or to what it would be attributed to. Thank you.","David Zaslav","Okay. Hi Anthony, on Russia look I mean just as a backdrop. The good news for us is we\u2019re in almost 230 countries it\u2019s almost like a mutual funded portfolio. And so there are a lot of markets that are performing much better than expected. And so in the aggregate we\u2019re very pleased with the international business and we\u2019re pleased with Eastern Europe. The issue we have on Russia is we\u2019ve been there for a long time. And we\u2019ve been able to get very substantial traction with our brands and our content and the world is changing there and it looks like it\u2019s going to change for some time. So for the near-term we\u2019re not going to be hurt too badly because the majority of our dollars comes from other subscriber fees. And those will continue to grow and we\u2019ll get the advantage of that through the end of \u201816. And what you talked about takes effect at the end of \u201816 with this restructuring.","One is we expect that probably will happen although its two years away and you never know. If it does happen there are many markets that we deal with their \u2013 we\u2019re, there are foreign ownership restrictions on broadcasting cable. Usually they\u2019re on broadcast but there are some markets that have them both. And the question then is do you have great brands have great content that people really want in the market. And in the countries where we have that we\u2019ve been able to get a very meaningful stream of revenue as licensing revenue for our brand as licensing revenue for our content.","And we\u2019ve able to do work around whether ultimately we can do that in Russia it remains to seen we have I would say more powerful content and more volume in Russia than we have in lot of other markets because we\u2019ve been there for so long. And when you wake up in Russia and you put on Discovery you put on science or you put on Animal Planet there are three of the top channels on pay TV there and they\u2019re viewed as Russian channels. And so we\u2019re optimistic that we can get some significant work arounds, but the question we\u2019ll just have to see how it plays out.","On scatter it\u2019s very hard to tell I mean the \u2013 all of the feedback that we\u2019re getting and I spend a fair amount of time on the last couple of weeks with Joe (inaudible) who run sales for us one of the best in the business. There is no question that the last month, the things have slowed, there is no question on the volume side there is no question that there is more scatter in the marketplace. And there is no question that advertisers are holding their wallets closer even on the movie side and kind of coming in in the late bursts. We really can\u2019t say where it is, our sense is it\u2019s good to be a little more cautious about how to deploy capital. But we have the holiday season coming up and we just kind \u2013 we may be surprised that it does very well and we may continue to be slow the way it is. We can\u2019t really tell where it\u2019s going right now.","Andrew Warren","And the question on the cost and more versus cash. We still have as you saw in the third quarter a few point disparity with expense being higher than cash really driven by two reasons, one there is still bit of a catch up based on the prior year level of increased investment. But also the fact that they we do have more a live events we have more 10 events that have a shorter and more window.","So as I kept this from significant in the last several years and it used to be kind of a key level of expense growth now we\u2019re down to kind of high single-digits. I do think it will be still probably a year plus until we really have parity between kind of the mid-single digit cash growth and mid-single digit (inaudible) growth. There is going to be a bit of a mismatch based on the two factors I mentioned.","Anthony DiClemente \u2013 Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.","That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kannan Venkateshwar from Barclays. Please proceed.","Kannan Venkateshwar \u2013 Barclays Capital","Thank you. Just one question from me, recently there was a lot commentary coming out of Comcast on their perspective on the content agreement with Discovery and so on. Just wanted to get your thoughts on how you\u2019re going about that renegotiation, I believe that comes up next year. Thanks.","Andrew Warren","Yeah, thanks Kannan. Look we continue to examine from our perspective that transaction and we have some concerns we\u2019re looking at it closely. Everyone should be concerned. We\u2019ve seen similar market dynamics before we\u2019re in 230 countries. In countries where there is a dominant ops and e-power. It creates real challenges for consumer and in many cases in almost all cases there is a retraction of consumer of investment and content. And so it\u2019s \u2013 you look at Comcast there in 17 of the top 20 markets, they pass 70% of broadband in America with probably the best speed and it raises real issues that all of us are looking at in the business.","I think that\u2019s why in terms of the timing, things are getting pushed out and I think rightfully so. The Justice Department and FCC are now talking looking at this very, very carefully, we\u2019re now looking at probably early summer. There is real issues that just raises. And our deal comes up next year as David [Kone] mentioned. And that we always deal with our distributors in the normal course. Our deal is up in less than a year with them and we\u2019ll see how it goes.","We have issues and I think all the content players in the industry as well as the broadband players should be looking at this very carefully.","Kannan Venkateshwar \u2013 Barclays Capital","Alright.","Unidentified Company Representative","Okay.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference may be recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Andrew Slabin, Executive Vice President, Global Investor Strategy. Sir, you may begin.","Andrew Slabin","Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for Discovery\u2019s 2018 First Quarter Earnings Call. Joining me today is David Zaslav, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Gunnar Wiedenfels, our Chief Financial Officer.","You should have received our earnings release, but if not, feel free to access it on our website at corporate.discovery.com. During today\u2019s call we will begin with some opening comments from David and Gunnar, after which we will open the call up for your questions. Please try to keep to one or two questions, so we can accommodate as many folks as possible.","Before we start, I would like to remind you that today\u2019s comments regarding the company\u2019s future business plans, prospects and financial performance are forward-looking statements that we make pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.","These statements are made based on management\u2019s current knowledge and assumptions about future events and they involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. In providing projections and other forward-looking statements, the company disclaims any intent or obligation to update them. For additional information on important factors that could affect these expectations please see our Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2017, and our subsequent filings made with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.","With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to David.","David Zaslav","Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. The first quarter was a transformational period for Discovery, marked by a number of important milestones that will help to further differentiate our strategy from the rest of the marketplace, enhance our portfolio of quality, trusted brands and position us for our next generation of growth.","In addition to reporting solid operating momentum across our businesses, we closed on our Scripps transaction and quickly began integrating the two companies. And thus far, I can unequivocally say, we love this combination even more now than when we first announced it. As Gunnar will detail, our combination is exceeding expectations on every level, which you will see reflected in our upwardly-revised synergy target, and we are continuing to drive more synergy value off of this base, and look forward to updating you in future quarters.","In short, we feel real good about where we are, operationally, financially and strategically. And we see multiple areas where we can create meaningful long-term value. Behind this momentum, we are ahead of plan to rapidly reduce our debt levels and now plan to be around four times net debt to pro forma adjusted OIBDA by the end of this year.","I\u2019d like to share a few thoughts on the state of our industry, our differentiated position as the global leader in real life entertainment and why we are increasingly confident in our strategy.","Let\u2019s start by looking more closely at the current state of our business. Despite the challenges of the ecosystem, our existing business continues to show real growth. Net growth continues at the same time we are investing meaningfully across the company in new opportunities like direct-to-consumer, new technology that we expect to bear fruit and give us meaningful growth in the years ahead.","We have a steady financial and operational tailwind and a model that provides a strong visible free cash flow generation. We are a free cash flow machine. Indeed, our free cash flow is like a moat in turbulent times. It\u2019s a distinguishing strategic asset for Discovery. That free cash flow will, over time, provide us with a loaded gun, giving us flexibility to deploy that free cash flow like bullets wherever we see opportunity to drive shareholder value.","Whether it\u2019s investing in content, IP, platforms, products and services, extending our content onto all bundles and services, whether linear, digital, mobile, or direct-to-consumer, or just buying back our stock, we will have the cash to decide.","Our focus on cost efficient, real life entertainment leveraged across all formats, regions and methods of delivery, gives us another distinct advantage over our peers. We\u2019re not caught up in the increasingly competitive and high-cost scripted content game that has captured so much of our industry\u2019s attention and resources over the past several years.","We don\u2019t just do shows; we curate passion brands for enthusiast audiences who, in a world where they can watch anything, seek us out, because our content provides them with something special and useful for their daily life. In cooking dinner to designing their dream home or car, we engage our viewers with content that entertains and inspires, while also providing real everyday value and utility.","We don\u2019t have just viewers either, we have super-fans, consumers who trust our brands and believe in our talent. And we have families who feel safe and entertained while watching our content.","We\u2019re also not renters. We own the vast majority of our content across regions, platforms and formats, and have the flexibility to take it wherever we want. As more and more viewers turn to their mobile devices, our strategy around global IP ownership, married to our portfolio of high-quality passion brands and utility content, gives us a distinct edge, we\u2019re different than everybody else.","And finally, we aren\u2019t just in the U.S. We are truly international with our sales teams and relationships with consumers and our creative teams in over 220 markets. A marketing platform that can light up any show or brand in any market with our portfolio of world-class free-to-air, broadcast, and digital assets, facilitated by an industry-leading cloud-based IT platform, we know better than anyone how to take content around the world in multiple languages, and we\u2019re just getting started with the Scripps IP.","I believe these distinctions make us more differentiated relative to our peers as ever before and increasingly well-positioned to grow and deliver value as our industry evolves. Additionally, I remain confident in our ability to gain further penetration on skinny bundles and virtual MVPDs. However, here in the U.S., despite a number of promising advances, our industry still isn\u2019t fully meeting the needs of its viewers. The vast majority of skinny bundles domestically are still by and large anything but skinny. At $35, $60, $90, or more a month, they\u2019re inflated by the heavy costs of retransmission consent and sports.","And given that nearly half of all households are either light or non-viewers of sports, and that about 25% of all audiences never watch any sports at all, the industry should be able to find a better way to accommodate what consumers really want.","The tolerance of consumer subsidizing all that sports content is waning and weighing on the U.S. sub growth. The good news is the market is now beginning to respond to consumer sentiment and demand; the non-sports real skinny bundles. Many pay-TV and mobile companies have announced that they\u2019re going to do non-sports skinny or entertainment heavy bundles, and new virtual providers have started to provide these offerings to try and meet consumer demand.","As these offerings gain a stronger foothold, which I believe they will, the skinny bundles will go a long way to improving the stability of the U.S. ecosystem, even maybe gaining some traction against subscriber declines. These bundles present a terrific opportunity for content providers like Discovery. It\u2019s our sweet spot. I have been saying for years, time\u2019s up. It\u2019s time for the U.S. to begin to look like every other market in the world.","Turning to our transformation process with Scripps, Gunnar and I will provide more detail. At this point in the process, we feel good and we feel like we are in full command and control; drilling and driving forward every day, trying to optimize our company, Discovery and Scripps\u2019 full potential.","Turning to our combined efforts, we introduced the new Discovery to the marketplace here in the U.S. at numerous upfronts over the last few weeks to a very strong response from the advertising community. We\u2019re off to a good start. The upfront, which feels healthy, presented us with the first opportunity to showcase our full and unique offering, and what we mean when we call ourselves the global leader in real life entertainment, a marketplace position that has great scope and reach, a deep endemic advertising base and category leadership across key quality brands; Food, Home, Science, Crime, Oprah and Cars, to name a few.","Because we own and produce all of our own content, we have unique flexibility as we face the advertising market. Our portfolio accounts for 20% of ad-supported cable viewership in the U.S. And we have four of the top seven networks for women in total day viewing on all of ad-supported cable. I think the first time a company has accomplished that. We couldn\u2019t be more excited about this year\u2019s upfront as we go in as the new Discovery, with trusted quality brands and a strong comprehensive menu of demos and very broad reach across our networks. We believe we will be very successful for our advertising partners, the agencies and most of all, in creating more value for the new Discovery.","I\u2019d also like to share a few highlights from our digital businesses, where many of the initiatives we carefully seeded over the past few years are beginning to report meaningful user traction and revenue contribution as we expand our competency in building direct-to-consumer products and services.","Our TV Everywhere business comprising our GO apps continues to provide meaningful contribution as a source of higher CPMs and incremental revenue and audience share, delivering more than 25 million streams monthly. We recently extended GO with the creation of an OWN app, and we anticipate adding HGTV and Food Network in short order. We think all of that will create more value and stronger demos in the future.","Internationally, the Eurosport Player continues to benefit from the broad exposure it received on the back of the 2018 Winter Olympic Games. As we collect a greater share of data and insights from each sporting event and season, our dialogue with sports super-fans becomes even sharper, allowing us to better target subscribers for upcoming events, such as cycling and tennis at the moment and ultimately, how the better manage churn from sports that are rolling off.","The Motor Trend group, our digital automotive joint venture, is another great example of how we are taking our expertise in nourishing super-fans in niche genres to a key consumer vertical, where we can become the multiplatform leader.","The Motor Trend app, our OTT\/SVOD product already has nearly doubled its subscriber base from when we came together last September, and is quickly becoming a leading digital destination globally for auto fans. As a next step, we will rename the Velocity network to Motor Trend network this fall, reinforcing our linear and digital car franchises under a common brand.","Going forward, you can expect us to expand on this strategy in other key verticals, such as Food and Home, where our category leadership with Scripps presents numerous opportunities. For example, how do we own the kitchen with advertisers and e-commerce companies across multiple platforms and formats?","In sum, we love our hand. Our differentiated position, where our IP ownership, aggregation of quality brands and focus on nourishing our enthusiast audience with content they love and seek out in a cluttered content world, will continue to open up new and exciting ways to connect with our fans. With the integration of Scripps moving swiftly forward, we are defining our future as the new Discovery with a broader strategy, portfolio of assets and a financial profile that we believe will allow us to deliver great upside to our shareholders this year and in the years ahead.","Thanks for your time this morning. I\u2019ll now turn it over to Gunnar.","Gunnar Wiedenfels","Thanks, David, and thank you everyone for joining us today. As David expressed, this is an incredibly exciting time for us, and I could not be more optimistic about the opportunities ahead of us in transforming the new Discovery.","I will first provide a brief overview of our first quarter results, followed by an update on our integration and transformation efforts, and will close with our outlook for the second quarter and fiscal year 2018.","My commentary today will focus on our constant currency pro forma results unless otherwise stated which differ materially from our reported results given reported actual results only include 26 days of Scripps as of the merger\u2019s close on March 6, whereas pro forma results are more [ph] reflective (16:01) of our underlying trends.","Please also note that pro forma results include the operations of Scripps as well as OWN and Motor Trend, formerly The Enthusiast Network, as if all had been owned since the beginning of 2017. Please refer to our earnings release filed earlier this morning for all of the detailed cuts for our first quarter results.","Now, let\u2019s delve into the numbers. On a constant currency, pro forma basis first quarter total company revenues grew 10% driven by 2% domestic growth and 26% international growth, while adjusted OIBDA was down 6% with 1% U.S. growth and a 30% decline at international largely driven by the timing of the Olympic Games as we had highlighted on our fourth quarter call.","Note that Discovery stand-alone first quarter adjusted OIBDA was down 9%, better than what we had guided to, due to strong cost controls across the board. And also note that excluding the impact of the Olympics, both Discovery\u2019s stand-alone adjusted OIBDA, as well as pro forma adjusted OIBDA were positive.","Looking at each operating unit, first quarter U.S. revenues grew 2% led by 2% advertising growth and 2% affiliate growth. The 2% advertising growth was driven by continued monetization and integration of our GO platform and digital offerings, as well as higher volumes, partially offset by lower linear delivery.","Let me add that on a stand-alone basis, Discovery nets grew organic advertising 4% in line with our guidance of up low to mid-single digits, while the Scripps was modestly positive, primarily due to higher pricing, offset by lower delivery. The 2% distribution growth was primarily due to increases in affiliate rates, partially offset by declines in subscribers. Again, the Discovery stand-alone growth was in line with our previous guidance at 2%.","Delving further into the drivers of U.S. affiliate and looking at the pro forma sub trends, subscribers for our combined portfolio were again down 5%, consistent with the trend over recent quarters. More importantly, subscriber declined for our combined fully distributed networks was again 3%, with some positive impact from HGTV and Food.","With respect to affiliate fee trends, as we have previously noted we renewed our FiOS deal at the end of 2017. So while the deal was very successful, it impacted a smaller number of subscribers, so there was less of an overall pricing lift versus prior years. Pro forma first quarter U.S. adjusted OIBDA increased 1%.","Turning to the international segment, all of my commentary will be on a pro forma constant currency basis, though it is worth highlighting that given the weakening dollar, currency was a very nice tailwind on both reported revenues and adjusted OIBDA.","Pro forma total first quarter international revenues were up 26%, driven by 11% advertising growth, primarily due to the successful delivery of the Olympics across Europe, as well as strength at TBN in Poland, partially offset by weakness in Asia and LatAm due to lower pricing in the first quarter.","Pro forma affiliate growth was 9%, driven by 10% growth at Discovery in line with the fourth quarter, and 1% growth at Scripps, which is a much smaller business, at around 5% the size of the legacy Discovery affiliate business, given Scripps\u2019 limited historical pay-TV presence outside the U.S.","Looking at the drivers of our first quarter affiliate growth by region, in Europe we had another quarter of solid growth, driven by higher digital revenues from the Eurosport Player due to the Olympics and another quarter of Bundesliga, as well as increases in contractual rates.","In Latin America, we also saw healthy growth. We continue to see lower subscribers, particularly in Mexico and Brazil, but this was more than offset by higher pricing. And in Asia, our smallest market, we continued to be impacted by overall linear declines, given lower pricing as affiliate deals renew. However, on the positive side, we had another quarter of strong contributions from our mobile content licensing deal, as we had highlighted on our year-end call. We also saw significant growth in first quarter [ph] other (19:59) revenues internationally from sublicensing part of the Olympics IP.","Turning to the cost side, pro forma operating costs were up 44% in the first quarter, driven primarily by sports rights and production costs, most notably from the Olympics. Adjusted OIBDA was down 30%, primarily due to the timing of revenues versus cost recognition of this year\u2019s Olympics, which as we had previously called out, requires that all content and production expenses be recognized during the quarter in which the games are aired, while certain associated revenues are spread out pre and post the game.","Having reviewed the highlights of our first quarter results, let me now provide some color on our second quarter expectations. Again, I will focus on pro forma constant currency growth. We expect second quarter U.S. advertising growth to be up low single digits. Trends remain consistent with our previous quarters with lower delivery offset by monetization of digital, and we expect second quarter U.S. affiliate growth to be again up in the low single digits range. Second quarter international advertising is expected to be up low single digits as well. We expect the solid pricing and delivery in key European markets to continue and trends in LatAm, particularly in Brazil, are picking up while trends in Asia remain soft.","Finally, second quarter international affiliate is expected to be up in the mid-single digit range, driven by continued growth in Europe and LatAm for legacy Discovery\u2019s nets and continued low growth of Scripps\u2019 legacy affiliate business, partially offset by overall declines in Asia.","And now I would like to share an update on our integration of Scripps. With our deal now having closed, we are in full transformation mode. As David mentioned, this is more than an integration of two combined companies. We are fully engaged in reshaping the business and positioning it to best address our industry\u2019s challenges and opportunities. To that end, we have identified dozens of work streams and around 1,000 initiatives, examining how to best maximize the potential of the new Discovery, touching upon and refining virtually all of our core competencies, including content creation, advertising and global distribution of IP. All of our initial progress is extremely encouraging.","With that, I am pleased to provide an update on our cost synergy target. We are raising our cost synergy target from the initial $350 million run rate within two years that we had laid out, and now expect to achieve at least $600 million of run rate cost synergies alone within the first two years of close or by March 2020, with an eye towards additional cost savings as we dig deeper and more broadly into the transformation.","So, where is this all coming from? From a high level, key areas of focus include, number one, head count across virtually the entire combined company. Number two, real estate consolidation. Number three, marketing as we see room for more efficient spending across our broader portfolio. Number four, supply chain efficiency, where we see upside from coordinated global procurement. Number five, content spend at our networks where, for example, we have just begun to layer in legacy Scripps content across some of our international nets, ultimately allowing us to reduce costs while becoming less reliant on acquired content.","Let\u2019s look at cost-to-achieve. In the first quarter, we booked $56 million of Scripps stand-alone integration costs and $241 million of restructuring costs, including a reserve for severance and content impairments in the Nordics, where we look to increasingly leverage Scripps content versus previously acquired content.","While a lot of the transformation activity is still being refined and restructuring impact is difficult to estimate at this point, we currently expect that we could see as much as roughly another $200 million for the second through fourth quarters of 2018 or early 2019. We will know more when our plans firm up, and we\u2019ll provide details as we progress. Of the total restructuring cost for 2018, we currently anticipate that around two-thirds will impact our 2018 free cash flow.","Note that first quarter free cash flow included roughly $70 million of cash restructuring and legacy Scripps transaction and integration costs. We are equally excited by the revenue synergy potential and enhanced growth prospects we will enjoy from the combination. We see them falling into several buckets. First and foremost is our combined U.S. upfront. We see real near-term opportunity from driving our domestic wallet share of pay-TV advertising around this year\u2019s upfront, with negotiations having just begun, following our well-received presentations to Madison Avenue. We have also identified additional near and midterm revenue synergy potential to stem from greater focus on global distribution of Scripps Networks contents and networks.","Ultimately, while the revenue opportunity here may indeed be the largest of all, this of course will take some time to unfold. We are in early innings, having just completed an analysis which identified several thousand hours of legacy Scripps Networks\u2019 content that will roll out internationally throughout the year, as our content teams assess the strategic fit within their portfolios. The initial wave includes multiple pay-TV networks and free-to-air channels in Poland, the Nordics, Latin America and EMEA.","Further, we are moving forward with our analysis and strategic plan to identify the market opportunities from launching Food and HGTV-branded networks in certain territories. For example, in Latin America, we will use the Scripps Networks Lifestyle content on a number of our networks, initially at our Home & Health channel, in addition to finalizing a rollout strategy for launching new brands across the region.","Having walked through our updated synergy expectations, let me now turn to our outlook for the full-year 2018. We expect pro forma constant currency adjusted OIBDA growth to be in the mid-single digit range versus 2017\u2019s pro forma adjusted OIBDA of $4.055 billion, even with the Q1 Olympics impact and with continued investment in digital initiatives like our GO platforms and the Eurosport Player. Please keep in mind that our full year reported adjusted OIBDA will be roughly $250 million lower than pro forma, since we are only including Scripps in our reported numbers from March 6 on.","Turning to taxes. We expect our full year book tax rate to be in the mid-20% range and our cash tax rate excluding PPA amortization to be in the low 20% range, with full year total intangible asset amortization expected to be around $1.2 billion. As we have stated, the combined company will continue to generate significant cash flow. We expect full year reported free cash flow to be in the $2.3 billion range after the cash cost to achieve I previously noted. Please note that these numbers will depend on the timing of our synergies. Again, we will update you as we progress throughout the year.","We will continue to allocate virtually all of our free cash flow towards paying down debt, and now expect to have leverage of net debt to pro forma AOIBDA of around four times by the end of the year. Note that in this number, we are currently not anticipating any additional material asset sales other than the recently closed sale of our Education business for $120 million.","I will also again quantify the expected foreign exchange impact on our 2018 results. At current spot rates, FX is expected to be a nice tailwind and will positively impact revenues by approximately $200 million and positively impact adjusted OIBDA by approximately $50 million versus our 2017 reported results.","In closing, as we continue to transform the new Discovery, we remain extremely optimistic about this powerful combination, which will allow us to accelerate the transformation of our business, drive free cash flow and ultimately generate significant long-term value for our shareholders.","Thank you again for your time this morning, and now David and I will be happy to answer any questions that you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Drew Borst with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Drew Borst ","Great. Thanks for the question. Wanted to ask about the synergy target. Thanks for the update. Do you anticipate \u2013 the $600 million, do you anticipate reinvesting any of that back into sort of growth initiatives for the business?","Gunnar Wiedenfels","Well, so we \u2013 if you look at what we\u2019ve said previously, we continue to make investments in our business for future growth a priority, and we have already budgeted for significant investments in our digital activities around the entire global footprint. So that will continue to happen. We do believe that the $600 million that I pointed out earlier are going to be a net impact that\u2019s going to fall to the bottom line.","David Zaslav","Drew, as we look at the synergy, just simplistically, Discovery itself is at about 1.4 \u2013 was at about $1.4 billion in free cash flow and Scripps was at 8. And we look at the cost synergy that we have, we have $600 million now in hand that we believe we can fully execute on, and we still have a number of buckets that we\u2019re looking at, another 40 or 50 workstreams, which we\u2019ll get back to you on.","But our target is, we really think that we can \u2013 there\u2019s no reason why we shouldn\u2019t better than double our free cash flow. One of the main reasons for this transaction was all the strategic elements that we\u2019ll talk about, and how this grounds us as maybe the leading IP global media company in the world.","But when we look at our $1.4 billion, together with our synergy, we think we can get to $3 billion. And so, getting to $3 billion for us is a target, but we\u2019re going to be relentless about it. And we also think that there\u2019s some upside to that as we look at revenue opportunity moving our content around the world, and seeing how this great portfolio works with the advertising market. So that\u2019s our target.","Drew Borst","Great. Thank you. And if I could just get one more in, I wanted to ask about the legacy Scripps business. And I don\u2019t want to dwell on this too much, because there was obviously a transition quarter with the deal closing in March. But, based on the numbers you presented, it did look like the U.S. Networks EBITDA for Scripps legacy was down a little bit, maybe low-single digit, 3%. I was wondering if you could just spend some time talking about what happened there in the quarter? And maybe more importantly, what do you see for sort of the remainder of 2018 at the legacy U.S. Networks for Scripps?","David Zaslav ","Well, generically as a big driver is the ratings of Food and HG, and one of the values of putting these companies together is not only the global scale that we have, but the portfolio that we have in the U.S. And we\u2019re never going to be in a position where all the business \u2013 all the channels are growing at the same time. A year-and-a-half ago TLC was down 25%. We said to you we\u2019re going to focus on who the audience is, how we grow it. We said we thought we can continue to drive ID. We thought we can get Science going and Velocity. Discovery has been down; Food and HG are down and one of our big priorities is focusing on those audiences.","In the case of HG and Food, the actual household audience is quite strong. What we really need to do with those two channels is continue to refresh them and grow them, and we got a great team. One of the reasons that we were so attracted was the quality of the leadership there, and we\u2019re convinced in spending more time with Kathleen Finch and her team, that we have a great team.","But we are doing a lot of work on who the audience is, how we continue to nourish them, it\u2019s what we do for Living. But we also have been more aggressive in getting our authenticated GO apps out. I mentioned that we\u2019re generating 25 million streams, it\u2019s primarily people under 30. That\u2019s something that wasn\u2019t being implemented at HG and Food.","And so a piece of this is really trying to innovate those platforms by getting the content authenticated on all devices to as many people as possible as quickly as possible, and we think that will generate some growth. But then really digging in, like we did at TLC, like we\u2019ve done at ID and like we did at Discovery and we need to do again to continue to grow. We look at the marketplace and we think it\u2019s really a function of us. There\u2019s an opportunity for us despite what\u2019s going on in the marketplace to grow these channels, and we just have to do as good of a job as we can, creating quality content.","Gunnar Wiedenfels ","And then Drew, maybe from a financial perspective, one thing to keep in mind is the way I look at it is that Scripps essentially created a plain vanilla budget for the year knowing that we\u2019re coming up on closing the transaction. So the Q1, \u201cScripps\u201d stand-alone result is driven by increasing content and marketing expenses to sort of safeguard the asset.","When I talked about the mid-single digit AOIBDA growth for the entire year earlier for the combined entity, that obviously includes the performance of the Scripps portfolio in the first quarter, and when it comes to an outlook for the rest of the year, clearly all those cost elements are part of our transformation initiatives, and we will look at everything. But it\u2019s all baked into that mid-single digit growth guidance for AOIBDA.","Drew Borst ","Great. Thanks. Really appreciate that. It\u2019s helpful.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question will come from the line of Jessica Reif with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Jessica Reif ","Thanks. I have two questions or two topics. First on the international, can you \u2013 Gunnar, you went so fast, I just \u2013 it sounds like the opportunity is rolling out Scripps content, and then also rebranding channels or creating new channels. I was hoping maybe you can give us more color on that, and are you planning on shutting down any channels? Can you size the opportunity and timing?","And the second question is, David, talked a lot about, especially in your opening remarks about how the industry is changing which we all know. So if your leverage comes down to, let\u2019s say, roughly the four times range by year-end 2018, our number, which may or may not be correct is 3 to 3.5 times year-end 2019. At what point would you consider making acquisitions or how do you think about the changing landscape, do you build or buy as your asset mix evolves?","Gunnar Wiedenfels","Thanks, Jessica. So on international, you exactly pointed out the two most important levers. One is just lighting up the content in our global footprint, and as I said, we\u2019ve been starting to create language versions for literally thousands of hours of content. We\u2019ve put some stuff on air, but it\u2019s very, very early days. But there will be different waves of rolling this out across the global footprint throughout the rest of the year, and we\u2019ll keep you updated.","And also programming teams in virtually all of our territories are looking at their programming strategy right now, and as for example in LatAm, there might be an opportunity to launch additional networks, create additional formats across territories. It\u2019s early days still. We\u2019re doing everything to get the stuff on air as quickly as possible. But it\u2019s really too early to come up with any \u2013 very specific numbers here.","On your question regarding leverage and capital allocation, so we will continue to follow the same logic that we have followed. Number one is the determination of our optimal leverage target range, and that continues to be at a 3 to 3.5 times leverage range. Number two is, we will then evaluate investment opportunities. We will continue to take a rigorous approach to make sure that we\u2019re getting good returns, but we will make it a priority to grow the business. And number three is, we will continue to return excess capital to our shareholders through buybacks, and those will continue to be the priority, and as you rightly say, we\u2019re at four times by the end of the year, so we should be breaking through the 3.5 times number during 2019. And that is exactly the logic that we will apply.","David Zaslav ","And we are on a mission in terms of speed. We think having that free cash flow in hand and that flexibility is very important. We like our assets. But we want to get down to a point where we do have that flexibility of looking, of investing more, of buying more stuff, of buying back more of our stock, just having the full flexibility to use that, figuratively the bullets that we have as a result of being a company that\u2019s generating so much free cash flow. And we do feel like pace is important, because with things moving in the marketplace, we could uniquely acquire, invest, or take advantage of what we see as an opportunity even within our own company.","Jessica Reif ","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Vijay Jayant with Evercore. Your line is now open.","Q \u2013 Vijay Jayant ","Thanks. Just want to follow-up on your comments, David, about the digital opportunity. Obviously Scripps is on Sling and Hulu, but Discovery is not on, I think you have a cash deal with DISH this year. How optimistic are you given the relationship Scripps has there to get the Discovery channels on that? And then just quickly, as you look to de-lever the balance sheet, some of your non-strategic assets I think like UKTV and Lionsgate, are those potentially for sale to expedite that process? Thanks so much.","A \u2013 David Zaslav","Okay. Thanks, Vijay. We don\u2019t comment on deals. But we think that we have very strong quality channels. We think Scripps does too. And as some of these over-the-top bundles develop, we think we really are in the sweet spot, based on every survey of what people want, whether it\u2019s Discovery\u2019s number one or between ID, Food and HG, they tend to be either one, two and three or in the top three of the top five channels that people want. And we\u2019re moving toward this point of instead of stuffing these bundles with what gets leveraged in through re-trans and sports to thinking about what\u2019s going on everywhere else in the world, which is the way you build a product. What do people want? And we have a lot of the great content that people want and we\u2019re investing in making it better.","The other piece that\u2019s important as you look at \u2013 as we look at where we are versus the marketplace is, you look at one side of the business with scripted and movies, and executing in a \u2013 with exceptional storytelling and they\u2019ve attracted some of the best producers and writers. But it\u2019s getting a lot more expensive. It\u2019s getting a lot more crowded. And when you look at what are the offerings if you\u2019re a consumer and you want to spend $10 or $15, what could you get aside from traditional cable? You get Netflix, movies and scripted. You get HBO, movies and scripted. STARZ and Showtime, movies and scripted. Amazon Prime, movies and scripted.","And so when we look at what we have, we see all that as over there. I\u2019ve said before, that\u2019s kind of the ball at my kid\u2019s soccer game, and everyone\u2019s running over there. Well you look at the rest of the field and you say if you\u2019re here in the U.S., or you\u2019re anywhere in the world and you want to have, as Reed said years ago, Netflix doesn\u2019t have everything, but there\u2019s some \u2013 if you go there, there\u2019s some good stuff that you\u2019re going to like, and it\u2019s going to nourish you.","And if you just put together our entire portfolio which we own globally, and you said that we were going to offer that platform alone, we could do it with others, we could do it with a few others, we could do it with one of the broadcasters, we could do it with a broadcaster in each market, but let\u2019s assume we did it just ourselves globally. What other company could offer a multitude of 18 brands, 10 of them that people know everywhere in the world, and offer it for less than any of those channels and have content whether you\u2019re in Brazil, Mexico, Italy, Poland, the U.S., Canada, where you look at that content and you say there\u2019s loads of characters, stories and brands that I love.","And so when we look at the marketplace, we say \u2013 it was announced two weeks ago, there\u2019s two players with over 100 million subscribers, Netflix and Amazon, and there\u2019s a hunt including with Disney, fantastic company, they\u2019re going to try, who\u2019s going to be the next one to get to 100 million subscribers? I believe the next one to get to 100 million subscribers is not going to be another scripted and movie player, because there\u2019s just too many of them. Oh, another one of those? What\u2019s the difference, who has what scripted series. What we have is different. It\u2019s quality. And what mom around the world wouldn\u2019t say that they \u2013 and it\u2019s safe, that they would want what we have to offer.","And so as we look at how we go direct to consumer, going global or going regional, doing something with one of the [ph] big fang companies, doing something ourselves, all of that looks attractive to us, because we think the marketplace is very crowded, and that the understanding of what each of those means is melding together. And you\u2019re starting to see a lot of the same stuff and we\u2019re different.","Q \u2013 Vijay Jayant ","Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Rich Greenfield with BTIG. Your line is now open.","Q \u2013 Rich Greenfield ","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. A couple. As we look at the consolidation wave or maybe consolidation battles might be a better way of shaping it, there\u2019s going to be a bunch of big companies that don\u2019t win out on assets they\u2019re trying to buy. And while you\u2019ve talked about potential growth for Discovery, also wondering given that everyone seems focused on expanding outside of the slowing U.S. market into kind of the attractive overseas markets, what\u2019s Discovery\u2019s appetite to actually be consumed by one of these larger players? And then two, on AT&T Watch, during the trial a few weeks ago, Randall Stephenson essentially announced a product that\u2019s coming, a sportsless bundle, that\u2019s going to be free for probably 15 million, 20 million AT&T wireless subscribers. Wondering, David, is this the watershed moment for Discovery and the other non-sports cable network groups that you\u2019ve been waiting for?","And then just a little housekeeping point, Gunnar, you\u2019ve mentioned that U.S. cable networks were actually helped a little bit by Food and by HGTV. Is there any way to look at what the organic growth rates were for the core Discovery networks?","A \u2013 Gunnar Wiedenfels ","Yeah, let me start with that last question, so that was related to my comment on subscriber trend, again on a consolidated, full portfolio basis, same pattern as in previous quarters with 3% sub decline for the fully distributed nets, and then 5% for the full portfolio. And you can think about it this way, Food and HG have been contributing positively to that 3% decline for the fully distributed nets and for Discovery stand-alone if you look at the old legacy Discovery portfolio, the trend has been bang in line with what we\u2019ve seen in previous quarters.","Q \u2013 Rich Greenfield","Thank you.","A \u2013 David Zaslav","On the question on AT&T, I don\u2019t really want to comment on any specific company. AT&T is a great company. There are a lot of very strong multichannel to the home companies and they are listening to their consumers every day. I can\u2019t predict whether the moment is now, but the moment is coming.","Consumers can\u2019t subsidize these massive sports rights anymore. It\u2019s not fair. And we\u2019re suffering from it. The idea that you have to pay so much money in order to get the bundle, it\u2019s something I\u2019ve been saying for years, I think it\u2019s going to end. It will either be driven by one or two players moving quickly, and then others following or it will be driven by some of the entrepreneurial companies that are already popping up. But there\u2019s no question in my mind, because it\u2019s an outlier, you look at all the countries in the world and the skinny bundles and you see the ecosystem there in most countries healthier than we are, because we don\u2019t have an offering for somebody that doesn\u2019t have a lot of money.","We don\u2019t have an offering for someone that goes to college. Their only choice is to get Netflix. It\u2019s not sensible that we have all these broadband subscribers, and that the only product that they\u2019re offering now is Netflix. Why aren\u2019t they offering products that they help develop or they invested in for all these years?","And so I think sensibility will come to the marketplace. More importantly, consumers are going to get what they deserve, which is an entry level ability to have multichannel cable without subsidizing sports and paying a massive amount to get an entry.","On the point of what\u2019s happening in the marketplace, we love it, because we\u2019ve been hanging out outside the U.S. for the last 25 years. It\u2019s where I\u2019ve spend most of my time. In Europe, we\u2019re the largest pay-TV media company in the world. We have infrastructure, sales, content and marketing know-how, every country in the world. Our brands are everywhere. This has been a conviction driver of John Malone and of Bob Miron from the Newhouse family, before I even got here. It\u2019s the heritage of our company that we\u2019re taking these quality brands everywhere in the world.","And so there have been times when it\u2019s been lonely, and there have been time as we\u2019ve been investing in growing our free-to-air in our brands and building our infrastructure all around the world where when we went into sports in Europe, people said what are they doing that for. Now, we\u2019re the leader in sports. We\u2019ve got so much success with the Olympics. We invested in Kids in Latin America where we\u2019re bigger than Disney in Brazil.","And we\u2019ve been doing that all with an eye towards the, where is the ball going to be? And we think having this very big international business was quite clever and owning all this IP everywhere in the world globally is clever. And so when we see people fighting over Sky, that looks to us like hey, we\u2019ve been there, we\u2019re in business with Sky, we compete with Sky, we\u2019re bigger than Sky on the content side in Italy, and it looks to us like the market is coming our way.","And when great companies like Disney and Comcast are looking for scale, they\u2019re going to look around and they\u2019re going to find there\u2019s very few companies that have scale. Our goal is to stay as we are right now, because we think we can generate huge free cash flow. We think that we\u2019re right about these affinity brands that we own, that we can make the turn that people are going to want to buy it, whether it\u2019s the big global companies or the regional companies. We saw it with T-Mobile, they\u2019re starting to offer Netflix. When mobile companies around the world want to offer something special to de-commoditize their platform, we got a whole menu.","Having said that, there\u2019s nothing different that we would be doing as we look to create broad shareholder value and execute on this free cash flow machine that would be different. Whether it\u2019s a year from now or four years from now, if we\u2019re the leader in sports, if we\u2019re the leader with international infrastructure and free cash flow and EBITDA and if we\u2019re the leader in Kids, those are things that would be very attractive to us in terms of shareholder value. But it also would be on a parallel basis very attractive, because I don\u2019t know that there\u2019s another company that has that basket.","Q \u2013 Rich Greenfield","Sounds like it\u2019s going to be a fun summer.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question will come from the line of Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Q \u2013 Alexia Quadrani ","Hi, thank you. Scripps has historically been able to achieve relatively strong pricing in their flagship networks. I guess is there any color you can provide about how that may compare with some of your key networks, and the opportunity to leverage that strength? And is that what you\u2019re referencing at least in part when you\u2019re talking about already seeing some revenue synergies in this coming upfront?","A \u2013 Gunnar Wiedenfels ","Sure. So, Alexia, that really was one of the most important points for us when we looked at Scripps last summer. If you look at the performance of the two portfolios, Scripps certainly has had a strength in their monetization of their ratings. If you look at it from a power ratio perspective, many people have done the math. They were at a 1.1 versus a 0.8 for us. That\u2019s certainly something that we\u2019re hoping to be able to get some benefits out of.","And as David said earlier, the upfronts so far have been positive for us from a feedback perspective, it\u2019s still early days from a negotiation perspective, but we do see a lot of interest and we have full confidence in Jon Steinlauf who has taken over the combined ad sales team, and that\u2019s why I said, I do think that there is a nearer term revenue opportunity here, again, way too early to put some hard numbers against it, but we\u2019re optimistic.","David Zaslav ","There are some broad reach comparisons as with cable versus broadcast, that when you look at them, they just feel out of whack. With broadcast getting $45, $50 CPMs and cable really in the $10 to $20 CPM, and then you take a look at our ability to deliver across our women\u2019s networks on any given night, a three rating, or on a good night, a four rating or a five rating. The ability for us to \u2013 the differentiation from the perspective of the advertiser was the ability to generate scale. Well \u2013 and to be able to have reach that\u2019s compelling.","We now have some very strong reach and we have some ability to really give detail on demographics and people that may be arguably are more engaged with our platforms than they are on a broader platform. And so we think that there\u2019s some opportunity to make the argument that we have a very \u2013 that our audiences are even more valuable. It\u2019s an argument that we would have been making before, and it\u2019s an argument that we\u2019ll make now.","Alexia Quadrani ","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Steve Cahall with Royal Bank of Canada. Your line is now open.","Steve Cahall ","Thanks. Good morning. David, maybe one for you, and then Gunnar one for you as well. David, you\u2019ve talked for a few quarters now about the global rights opportunity. I think it\u2019s one of those issues where investors remain a little suspect until there\u2019s a deal on the horizon. So can you get us any indication of whether or not you think you might be able to do a global deal here in the next year or two? And then Gunnar, just on the free cash flow side of things, there\u2019s a few areas just because you ran through a lot, I want to make sure I understand. As we\u2019re thinking about the bridge into next year, can you just help us with how much of the restructuring, again you\u2019ll have this year versus the future years? And then also how the savings sort of stack up between 2018 versus the years beyond? Thanks.","David Zaslav ","Thanks, Steve. It is a work in progress. We are [ph] IP long (52:32). We own all of our content on all platforms, and as much success as we have with the Olympics, and we had a lot of success, we really expected that most of the mobile players across Europe would \u2013 we have the rights to the rings, so we could provide the rights for mobile players to affiliate with the rings year-round. We could have provided a lot of exclusive content to different providers in the marketplace. It wasn\u2019t quite ripe yet. But the idea that we own the Olympics for the next nine years, and we\u2019ve had from the date that we did the deal 11 years to build around it is a, for us, we think a successful formula.","And outside of the Olympics and Eurosport we own all of our content globally and we look at it really more in the long-term. But this \u2013 one of the big successes that we had with the Olympics was generating a half a million subscribers, paying for the Olympics in less than 10 days, and being able to build a platform that got top ratings and that generated 3,000 hours \u2013 over 3,000 hours of streaming and then ability to navigate and curate within that platform to very good reviews. And at the same time to provide content in over 20 languages in linear and on cable.","So we certainly, more than any other company, know how to provide content in every language on multiple platforms. And what we learned about the Olympics is on a parallel track to what we\u2019ve learned with the Eurosport Player, that people seem to be willing to pay and not churn out a lot on things that they\u2019re really passionate about. So for the people that love the Olympics, they really want it. It\u2019s one of the reasons why we\u2019ve gone from the buffet which we still offer, to this idea, just like you buy a magazine for tennis or you buy a magazine for cycling, that we give you much more dense, much more IP, short form, long form within a specific area.","And so we pass on a load of stuff, but we are on the hunt now with Food, with Home, with Cars, and we\u2019re looking at what other opportunities are there globally to own IP for the long-term that we cannot only build a global platform, but monetize it. And we\u2019ll be focused on what we pay for that IP, to make sure that we can generate global IP, but global IP that if we can get the turn, either through a global player or the regional player, that we can generate real value. Food and HG and Travel are three that we think we can globally take advantage of, but we are looking at loads of opportunities, but we\u2019ve passed on a lot of them, because we\u2019re looking for the right ones.","Gunnar Wiedenfels","And then Steve, on the free cash flow, a couple of maybe clarifying comments on the synergy ramp-up. I want to make sure that you guys understand what we see as the potential, the $600 million plus. The timing of that is obviously still influx, right? And the delta is going to be, are we going to be able to get those numbers earlier or later. And that\u2019s why I don\u2019t want to give any very specific guidance for a fiscal year, which is a bit of a random cutoff.","But if you look at the comments I made earlier, we\u2019re looking at mid-single digit AOIBDA growth for the year, obviously that is to a large extent synergy driven and could be on the lower end if we\u2019re slower, could be on the higher end if we\u2019re faster. That\u2019s the way to look at it. But either way, the lion\u2019s share of the synergy is going to hit in 2019.","So, if you go back to the free cash flow guidance I said $2.3 billion after the cash restructuring expenses. We\u2019ve already paid out $70 million in the first quarter, and as I said, we do expect a slightly higher total restructuring number than we originally guided to. So let\u2019s say maybe $400 million. And I would encourage you to put in about two thirds of that for the cash impact of 2018.","Steve Cahall ","So, Gunnar, just if I understand that, I mean, we should have a pretty nice bridge in terms of synergy plus restructuring tailwind as we move into 2019. Is that correct? Am I thinking about that right?","Gunnar Wiedenfels ","I agree.","Steve Cahall ","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question will come from the line of Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open.","Michael Nathanson","Thank you. David, I have two for you. One is on advertising, one\u2019s on the Olympics. When you look at Scripps, one of the most amazing things was [ph] they had (57:23) really high commercial load per hour versus your own networks have a very low. So how do you see the balance of raising commercial loads maybe at your core networks versus reducing them at Scripps, and how you think about the right way to blend commercial minutes per content?","And then I wondered now that you had the Olympics on the air, how do you feel about buying more soccer rights, where you don\u2019t really have a nine year or 11 year hold on licenses? So can you contrast your sports appetite for maybe short-term soccer rights versus [ph] maybe rights (58:00) I don\u2019t have those short-term cycles?","David Zaslav","Thanks, Michael. I don\u2019t know if you timed this in some kind of a special way. But I think this is the second year in a row that I have to wish you a happy birthday.","Michael Nathanson","Yeah, thank you, David. [ph] You too David.","David Zaslav","I\u2019ll call you later with my wish and you can give me your wish.","Michael Nathanson","Okay. Thank you. Thank you.","David Zaslav","On the Scripps side, one of the things that they did was their commercial load was very high, and their promo load was extremely low. We were the opposite. We have now the ability to promote across all of our networks. So this idea that on any given night we\u2019re getting a 3 or a 4 or 4.5 in women, for instance, we now have the ability to use the promo, not only to promote a particular network, but if we have a great show it\u2019ll be able to go across ID, OWN, TLC, HG, Food.","And in fact, HG spent a lot of money buying local time on ID trying to get people to come over. And so we\u2019re going to try and understand promo in the traditional sense, our unique ability to do promo across our channels to move people around, both to save dollars, but also to maximize the movement of audiences, and then the importance of fully monetizing our platform.","We\u2019ve also developed a lot of analytics that are quite important. We\u2019re seeing, for instance, when we go on our GO platform and we can quantify what \u2013 the viewership in terms of length of view and age, we can get a dramatic increase in CPM with some of the analytics that we have in place now. We have an ability to get higher CPMs. And we look at what Viacom is doing. We\u2019re doing a similar thing, maybe there\u2019s an opportunity. We\u2019re talking to them about maybe doing something with them.","And so the net-net is we\u2019re going to put it all together and we\u2019ll figure out how do we maximize growth of our channels, taking advantage of the unique ability we have that no one else has to reach across all of our platforms and let people know. We\u2019re even looking at this idea of not just promoting. But if somebody\u2019s watching on HGTV and the next show coming up is a show that they don\u2019t want to watch, what would normally happen is they\u2019d go to their other five or six favorite channels. But can we alert people that are watching HG, here\u2019s what\u2019s coming up on Food, here\u2019s what\u2019s coming up on ID, TLC and OWN? We\u2019re doing it in a pilot \u2013 on a pilot basis, but we think that reach could be successful for us or unique, at least, and we\u2019re trying to figure out how we use it.","On the Olympics, I think the Olympics is a great model for us. We own it on all platforms for over a decade. We could build expertise. We\u2019ve got 0.5 million subscribers in direct-to-consumer this past time, what worked with Snap? What worked with Facebook? What\u2019s the ceiling? Could we get 1 million next time? Could we get 2 million? How would we get it? What would we do differently? And so the ability to iterate is very, very important.","For us, I think it\u2019s unlikely that you\u2019ll see us competing in these three-year cycles of football. To the extent that we do, it will be because we get \u2013 we have some unique opportunity. But look, the Bundesliga was difficult for us. And in that case, we paid almost no increase and it was difficult for us. And so it was a good experience and it led us with better IP to get into this joint venture with ProSieben. But it also taught us a lesson in what we do and what we can\u2019t do. And so I think it\u2019s unlikely, particularly when you\u2019re competing with platform companies that are trying to build asset value on the back of that IP and are willing to lose money on it.","And so I think we\u2019re going to stick to our knitting which is let others pay a lot for that kind of IP. And if we could own all the other sport at low single or reduced rates or high single in some cases, if we think the IP is great for extended periods of time, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been doing, much, much longer renewals, because we have something very unusual with Eurosport. We\u2019re the only Pan-European player. That\u2019s what we\u2019re going to go.","And the Olympics just added to that [ph] Patina (01:02:45). The IOC couldn\u2019t have been happier. And so is there an opportunity for more Olympics in the future? Maybe. Our relationship with Bach is extremely strong. And is there an opportunity to get more IP? Well, if anybody was thinking, who should I be in business with in Europe in sport, as more and more leagues and IP owners that are saying they want to be in business with us.","Michael Nathanson","Thanks, David.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question will come from the line of John Janedis with Jefferies. Your line is now open.","John Janedis ","Hi. Thank you. David, maybe a bit of a follow-up. In the past, you\u2019ve talked about improve [ph] monetization (01:03:25) as revenue driver for ID. And I was wondering, are you at a point now that it starts to accelerate with Scripps, because I think in the past you talked about an opportunity maybe in the hundreds of millions, and so I\u2019m wondering does that still hold?","David Zaslav","Well, we were on a mission with Scripps with \u2013 before Scripps with ID, because it\u2019s the number one cable channel in America for women. Just to take a victory lap for Henry Schleiff and his team, the last fully distributed top 10 network in America was in the, it was History and I was on the Board of that and FOX News. And seven years later, eight years later, we launched ID and then Henry and his team come onboard, and it\u2019s now the number one cable network in America. It\u2019s loved. Its length of view is the same length of view or more than FOX News.","And so we have been on a mission for the last couple of years to say that we should be getting more value for that great audience and for the type of audience that we generate in daytime, in late night, in prime, and the numbers only keep growing.","And so now as we have a bigger menu and we\u2019re going into the marketplace, and we have Jon Steinlauf running our operation, who had an ability to generate higher CPMs across the board at Scripps, got a better power ratio than we did, we hope that some of his know-how, his relationships and his unique approach will help ID as well as the rest of our channels.","John Janedis","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude your program. You may you all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day."],"7221":["Discovery Communications, Inc.

My name is Mark and I'll be your operator for today. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we'll conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Jackie Burka, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.","Jackie Burka - Vice President-Investor Relations","Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for Discovery Communications 2015 Third Quarter Earnings Call. Joining me today are David Zaslav, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Andy Warren, our Chief Financial Officer. You should have received our earnings release. But if not, feel free to access it on our website at www.discoverycommunications.com.","On today's call, we will begin with some opening comments from David and Andy, and then we will open the call up for your questions. Please keep to one question so we can accommodate as many people as possible. Before we start, I would like to remind you that comments today regarding the company's future business plans, prospects and financial performance are forward-looking statements that we make pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are made based on management's current knowledge and assumptions about future events, and may involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations.","In providing projections and other forward-looking statements, the company disclaims any intent or obligation to update them. For additional information on important factors that could affect these expectations, please see our annual report for the year ended December 31, 2014, and our subsequent filings made with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.","And with that, I will turn the call over to David.","David M. Zaslav - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. A month ago, Discovery hosted our first Investor Day to provide a detailed overview of our global strategy and outlook and introduce you to our corporate and international executive management team. It was great to see so many of you there.","During that presentation, you heard me talk about where we've come as a global media company, where we're going, what sets us apart, and the keys to our continued operational growth and financial success. Because of our confidence in our financial performance and our free cash flow outlook, much of which is locked in through long-cycle affiliate deals, today I'm pleased to announce that we have increased our buyback authorization by $2 billion. And we will be back in the market buying our shares this quarter.","Andy will share more information on the buyback authorization increase and take you through the financial details in just a moment. First, let me briefly take you through some of this quarter's top-line performance highlights.","First and foremost, our strong brands and award-winning content in the U.S. market continued to perform remarkably well, generating enduring value. I'm pleased to report our portfolio of U.S. channels again outperformed broadcast and cable peers and commanded an increase of share of our ad-supported cable. Discovery Channel had the highest rated quarter ever for persons 25 to 54 delivery and has been the number one ad-supported cable channel for men four months so far this year alone.","As we showcased at Investor Day, our ability to reach audiences around the world with great storytelling will be on full display on December 2 when Discovery Channel premieres the landmark documentary, Racing Extinction, a truly global event reaching 1 billion viewers in over 220 countries on one day. Only Discovery can do this. It is our unique advantage.","Among women, ID was the number one ad-supported cable channel in total delivery for the month of September, number one ad-supported cable channel for women in September, really extraordinary, and prime delivery on ID rose 16%. Given our low cost per hour, our ability to top the ranking charts and grow delivery across ad-supported cable is significant for ID.","Our U.S. ad sales were very strong this quarter, up 6% versus last year due to record scatter volume, strong pricing and improved demand. And we were able to monetize our ratings improvements at key networks like Discovery Channel, ID and Velocity. On the affiliate side, revenues rose 12% in the third quarter. We continue to see the benefits of the strong price increases we have secured through the current renewal cycle, of which we are now 80% complete here in the U.S. The price escalators are locked in for years to come. And we also are adding revenue from new partners such as Verizon Go90, Hulu and Sony.","At our Investor Day, I also said that our leading global distribution platform is Discovery's secret sauce. That's once again true in the third quarter. International viewership grew mid-single-digit overall with ID, TLC and Eurosport up double-digit or better. Our ability to increase share of viewership internationally helped drive strong organic advertising and affiliate growth. Organic ad sales rose 12% and organic distribution growth also was strong, up 8%. These figures demonstrate our strong international growth profile and best-in-class platform.","Across Europe, we are continuing to build Eurosport's offering by strategically investing in sports rights and increasing production values to bring local fans closer to the action. As a result, viewership is up 16% this quarter, with some countries like Poland and Germany gaining market share rapidly where we have added locally popular franchises to our lineup.","Owning our IP, another key to our performance and growth, is also presenting new possibilities. In a multiplatform world, ownership of our content gives us the ability to tell stories, create brands, build community on new platforms, and we have found that our content does play in multiple ecosystems. We have recently seen a dramatic increase in views across Discovery Digital Networks as we nourish audiences with storytelling only we can do across multiple platforms. And we are seeing real engagement with our online channels including TestTube, Seeker and SourceFed, 3 of 90 YouTube channels that we have which now aggregate to over 200 million views a month, 50 million of them on Facebook alone.","To better leverage the value of our content across all of these platforms, we have brought Paul Guyardo to our executive team. Paul was a leader working for Barry Diller and he spent many years at DIRECTV with their marketing and direct-to-consumer business. As Chief Commercial Officer, Paul is hyper-focused on maximizing our powerful brands and programming revenue across all platforms. Overall, the combination of Discovery's unique content with our IP ownership position, category leadership and creative and innovative management team ensures we will be one of the leading content creators for years into the future.","No other media company owns such great content and IP to exploit against platforms. No other media company has such a broad international distribution platform and brands that resonate so deeply with global audiences and super fans. I remain extremely confident and excited about our future and in Discovery's ability to succeed and grow.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Andy for more details on our financial results and plans to return capital to our shareholders.","Andrew C. Warren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP","Thanks, David, and thank you everyone for joining us today. Discovery continues to execute well on our stated operational and financial goals. And while as expected, costs were elevated in the quarter mostly due to the timing of content and marketing investments, we are extremely pleased with the solid organic top-line growth we generated both in the U.S. and internationally.","All of our key third-quarter financial metrics are in line with the numbers I presented at our September Investor Day. On a reported basis, total company third quarter revenues decreased 1%, and adjusted OIBDA was down 9%. Excluding currencies, revenues were up 8% and adjusted OIBDA was down 1%.","On an organic basis, so excluding the impact of foreign currency as well as the impact of Eurosport, Discovery Family and the June 30 sale of SBS Radio, total company revenues increased 7% and adjusted OIBDA declined 1%.","As we had anticipated and have previously discussed, after two quarters of strong cost control, we saw a significant uptick in costs both domestically and internationally given this year's cadence of content and marketing investments which are weighted towards the second half of the year and peaked in the third quarter.","Net income available to Discovery Communications of $279 million was relatively flat versus last year third quarter net income of $280 million, as the lower operating performance was offset by a positive swing in our mark-to-market stock-based compensation as well as lower income taxes. Our third quarter tax rate decreased by 400 basis points versus last year to 31% due to some discrete one-time tax settlements during the quarter. We still expect our effective tax rate to be 33% for full year 2015 and to be at or below 30% for fiscal 2017.","Our declining tax rate will continue to drive sustaining net income growth as well as accelerate our free cash flow growth over time. Earnings per diluted share for the third quarter was $0.43 and adjusted earnings per diluted share was $0.47. Excluding currency impacts, both above and below the line, adjusted EPS was up 25% for the third quarter and up 11% for the last 12 months. Free cash flow in the third quarter decreased to $234 million after being up 55% in the second quarter, primarily due to the timing of working capital and content spend. We still expect our full-year free cash flow to be up low-single-digits versus 2014 and expect it to accelerate nicely in 2016.","Turning now to the operating units, despite all the talk about domestic secular concerns, our U.S. Networks grew revenues an impressive 8% this quarter, as we benefited from another quarter of strong distribution growth of 12% and a significant acceleration in advertising growth to up 6% year-over-year. We are extremely pleased with our third quarter ad sales performance. As David mentioned, our ratings outperformed the industry and this outperformance helped us benefit from robust scatter pricing and volume as well as stronger overall demand. Distribution revenues, excluding the impact from consolidating Discovery Family's results, did accelerate in the second quarter and were up 7% this quarter.","We again benefited from the higher rates we garnered from our new deals with NTTC, Cablevision, Sony and others at the end of 2014 as well as from contributions from our new Hulu deal which started January 1 of this year. Discovery Family will be fully lapped starting in the fourth quarter, so our 4Q reported and organic growth rates will be the same. And then looking ahead, our favorable Comcast renewal will go into effect on January 1, 2016.","Tuning to the cost side, domestic operating expenses in the quarter were up 14% on a reported basis and were up 11% excluding the Discovery Family consolidation. Excluding Family, costs of revenues were up 8% due to the timing of content spend and SG&A was up 15% as we ramped up marketing spend after two quarters of declines. This led to a 200 basis point decline in reported and organic margins to 57% versus the prior year.","Moving on to our international operations, our International division saw an impressive organic ad and distribution growth in the third quarter. On a reported basis, revenues declined 9% and reported OIBDA declined 21%, but excluding currency, revenues increased 6% and adjusted OIBDA decreased 4%. Changes in FX rates reduced our revenue growth rates by 15% and our adjusted OIBDA growth rate by 17% as the stronger dollar versus last year, especially versus the Brazilian real, which fell another 21% during the quarter, remained a major headwind.","On an organic basis, so excluding currency impacts, as well as Eurosport and the recent sale of SBS Radio, revenues were up 9% and adjusted OIBDA increased 4%. For comparability purposes, my following International comments will refer to our organic results only, so I'll exclude the impacts of Eurosport, SBS Radio and foreign exchange. The 9% third quarter revenue growth was led by 12% advertising growth and 8% distribution growth. Ad growth was led by extremely strong 30-plus percent growth in Latin America, led by higher volumes and pricing in Brazil as well as strong trends in Mexico, Colombia and Argentina. Southern Europe also grew ad revenues over 30%, led by higher volumes, pricing and ratings in Italy and solid double-digit growth in Spain. Excluding Russia, CEEMEA, led by Germany, also continued to grow nicely, with advertising revenues up 15%.","Distribution revenues grew 8%, driven by another quarter of double-digit growth in Latin America due to higher rates and the continued expansion of paid television in key markets like Brazil, Mexico and Argentina, and to a lesser extent, increases in subscribers in Central Europe and Eastern Europe. These country-level results reflect the strong long-term opportunity for our international markets as you heard about from JB Perrette last month. With just one quarter remaining, we are confident that full-year international organic advertising growth will be in the low-double-digit range, and we can now firmly say that organic affiliate growth for the full year will be in the high-single-digit range.","Turning to the cost side, operating expenses internationally grew 13% in the quarter, primarily due to higher content amortization and increased personnel costs as we continue to focus on localizing our International businesses. Adjusted OIBDA grew 4% and International organic margins were down 200 basis points to 36% versus the prior year. Eurosport standalone margin in the third quarter was 6%, and we still expect margins to be in the high-single-digit range for the full year. As we've stated, the benefit of increased investments in sports is expected to double Eurosport's ad revenue from 2015 to 2020 and will help Discovery's entire European business through sustained strong top-line growth for years to come.","Now, moving on to our Education and Other segment, which reported a small operating loss for the quarter, given our strategic focus on producing and utilizing more content from our in-house, own production studios, which has no margin associated with it, and our continued investment in Education's digital textbooks to drive the long-term value of this industry-disrupting business, this segment is expected to report a small loss in the fourth quarter as well.","So now, taking a look at our overall company financial position, in the third quarter, we only repurchased $52 million worth of preferred shares. But as David mentioned, we will resume our common share repurchases this quarter and intend to buy back approximately $1.5 billion worth of our stock over the next 12 months. Given this, the board has increased our share repurchase authorization by another $2 billion. Our previous authorization only has $415 million remaining and expires in February of next year, while this additional authorization does not expire until October of 2017.","On our last earnings call, we stated that we were unlikely to repurchase additional shares through the end of 2015 in an effort to retain capital allocation flexibility for strategic transactions as well as to pay down debt to lower our leverage ratios. But given our solid and better-than-expected third quarter revenues and bottom-line results, the successful Comcast renewal, our significant higher level of confidence in our ability to drive accelerating free cash flow, our high and growing cash flow-to-total debt yield, the continued favorable interest rate environment, and finally, that we find the return of buying our shares at these levels to be extremely attractive, we have adjusted our view on leverage. After very careful consideration, we are now comfortable with increasing our gross debt to adjusted OIBDA ratio to the 3.25 times to 3.4 times range versus the 2.75 times target we previously outlined, all while being highly committed to remaining an investment-grade debt issuer.","As we stated during our Investor Day and on previous earnings calls, our capital allocation priorities remain the same: first, to invest in driving organic growth; second, to invest in strategic M&A, platforms and IP; and third, to repurchase our stock. We have been active buyers of our stock since the inception of our buyback program in 2010, and to-date, have repurchased over $6.2 billion of our stock and have reduced our outstanding share count by over 30%.","Turning now to our full-year guidance for 2015, which we updated at our September Investor Day, we are still confident in our ability to achieve every metric that we laid out at the beginning of this year. To reiterate our constant currency guidance I gave in September, we expect revenues to grow at 9% to 10%, adjusted OIBDA to grow in the mid-single-digit range and adjusted EPS to grow in the low-double-digit range. These guidance ranges still include the recent sale of the non-core SBS Radio assets as well as the just over $50 million negative non-FX-related impact from Russia.","We are also today updating our full-year foreign exchange impacts versus last year's reported results. At current spot rates, FX is still expected to reduce our constant currency guided revenue for the year by $460 million or roughly 7%, adjusted OIBDA by $180 million, also roughly 7%, while adjusted EPS is now expected to be reduced by $0.26 to $0.31 assuming no further below-the-line currency adjustments.","Longer term, as we outlined at our Investor Day, we conservatively expect our constant currency adjusted EPS and reported free cash flow to both grow at a low-double-digit CAGR from 2015 to 2018.","In conclusion, while there is currently much uncertainty in the marketplace, I remain extremely bullish on our global market positioning, our long-term strategic outlook, and our continued ability to achieve our stated financial goals.","Now, we'll open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good morning. Two questions. David, can you talk about the direct-to-consumer over-the-top work you've been doing in Europe, which I think has been successful and whether Paul's hire is sort of a sign you might be thinking about going into the U.S. with that strategy? Because obviously he comes with a lot of retail success at DIRECTV and building subscription businesses, so I didn't know if there was a connection there. And then I'll just ask my second. Andy, on the leverage change, do you plan to operate at that 3.25 to 3.4 gross leverage rate because you're not there today? And if you do, how quickly do you think you're going to get there or is that sort of a ceiling based on the opportunity set in front of you? Just any more color on that would be helpful. Thank you.","David M. Zaslav - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Ben. The direct-to-consumer business is something we're just getting started with, but we have invested over the last year and a half primarily through our Eurosport partnership and in Northern Europe with the Eurosport app and with Dplay. We're learning a lot. Both of those platforms are growing meaningfully. We do have a target in place which we're calling March to a Million. We have 200,000 subscribers right now. And if we can get to a million at the $6 to $8 a month, we could generate close to $100 million in revenue, which I think gets our whole company's attention in terms of culture.","The exciting thing about the Eurosport app is that we're growing our direct-to-consumer business, but it's not coming at the expense of the linear channel. In fact the linear channel grew more than 15% in the past quarter. So people are signing up for the U.S. Open and they're watching maybe a choice of 18 courts. Most of it is when they're outside the home and then when they're in the home, they're watching one of the three Eurosport channels in most cases. So we're finding that it's additive. We're learning a lot.","The good news for us is we've improved our IP, so we did a lot of deals for Eurosport that were in the low single-digit increase for rights. Where we stayed away from the big soccer, we've acquired a lot of kids' rights where we are a leader in kids in Latin America and now in Asia. And we own all of our content on Discovery, on TLC where we've focused more on being on-brand, with stronger, bigger content. And so we have a lot of optionality. I think it's just \u2013 it's early days, but we do have a lot of flexibility here in the U.S. to make a move if we want to and we're looking at it. We're looking at it.","Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks.","Andrew C. Warren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP","Ben, to answer your question on the leverage, we expect to kind of accrete our leverage up to the 3.25, 3.4 times by year-end 2016. It's just so important to highlight that even at that level, our free cash flow to debt yield is still going to be mid teens to high teens, the highest in the industry. Our interest coverage ratio is going to be the highest in the industry. And we feel extremely comfortable given our growth profile of cash flow, that's the right leverage target and capital structure for us. But we do expect to be at that level over the course of the next 12 months.","David M. Zaslav - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Just one more point, I think that we've worked really hard to build content in these super-fan groups; Sports, Kids, Oprah, Tyler, Discovery, Science, ID, I think having Paul Guyardo come over, he spent a lot of time at HSN with Diller, he ran this business for DIRECTV, it just gives us some real expertise. And Paul has brought in some additional people into the company that think a little bit differently, and I think we need that. We're going to be driving our linear business where we're growing share, but we're going to try to be really opportunistic about how do we take our content on mobile, how do we take our content directly to consumers in a way that can provide additional meaningful growth?","Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you both.","Operator","Your next question comes from Alexia Quadrani from JPMorgan. Please proceed.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you. Can you update us on your interest in acquiring free-to-air networks internationally? I guess, is there a particularly more attractive strategy now owning more free-to-air now that you have the Olympics rights? And then just a follow-up question about the third-quarter maybe for Andy, is there any color you can give us in terms of how much Shark Week, the success there contributed to the ad growth in the quarter? And with that in mind, how we should think about Q4 advertising domestic trends?","David M. Zaslav - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Alexia. Look, right now, we feel very good about the growth characteristics of our International business. We're growing share. Because we've been able to grow share, we feel like we have a real ability and you're seeing it in our ability to drive price on advertising, and together with Sports in Europe and Kids in Latin America and more scale to drive pricing on distribution and you'll start to see more of that. Because we're in 220 countries and we have, on average, 10 channels, we have a fair amount of synergy. And so we're always looking opportunistically, but we don't need any additional assets if in fact \u2013 we have free-to-air channels in a number of markets in Europe that we can take advantage of with the Olympics. We just launched a free-to-air channel acquired in Turkey, which gives us some optionality. So I think if we can \u2013 we'll be looking at the question of can we grow as fast or faster by acquiring additional assets outside the U.S. and we'll look at everything, but we don't feel like we need to do anything. We do think that we're probably the best buyer for a lot of assets because we have knowledge in the marketplace, we have infrastructure and we have synergy, but we don't need anything.","Andrew C. Warren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP","Just, Alexia, to provide some color on the third quarter ad sales, look, as you know, Shark Week was an absolute home run for us. And while we moved it from August to July, it was still in the third quarter and it was just a huge ratings and ad sales driver for us. The third quarter, if you take ex the inclusion of Family, was up about 4.5%, really driven by solid demand, solid pricing. We even actually cut back a little bit of inventory to drive a better viewer experience which showed up on our ratings, so overall, a very healthy overall quarter for us. Your question about fourth quarter, look, the market is similar than what we saw in the third quarter and we expect our ad sales to be up solidly year-over-year.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Doug Mitchelson from UBS. Please proceed.","Doug Mitchelson - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks so much, guys. I think first, just boring question and continue on advertising, any sense of how the calendar upfront is shaping up? Any thoughts on first quarter cancellation options? I know you said fourth quarter was pacing well, but just trying to read the tea leaves as we start to think about 2016. And then I think for David, on Eurosport, given you've closed the rest of it and I think you've given obviously a lot of confidence at the Analyst Day, a lot of details at the Analyst Day and today. But I think investors are curious how much more do you want to invest in Eurosport? Is there more cycles coming because you're anticipating strong future results, whether it's direct-to-consumer or the leverage? And any sort of examples on the execution side of whether or not that acquisition is benefiting you at this point would be helpful. Thank you.","David M. Zaslav - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. It's really too early, Doug, to get a sense of where the calendar upfront is going or cancellations. We don't see right now anything that gives us a sense that things are better or worse. The only thing that we see that's attractive is the advertising market in third quarter and fourth quarter has been consistent and is better than it was in fourth quarter, first quarter and second quarter.","On the Eurosport side, we've been quite aggressive about going out and doing deals. And so far we've learned a couple of things. We've learned that we can grow viewership significantly without buying big-time soccer. We've also watched as big-time soccer has grown in terms of rates across Europe, 60%, 70%, 80%, 100% in terms of fees, and in many cases, it's big distributors that are fighting for that, and in many cases, there has to be more than one distributor that gets it. And so, it's created kind of a feeding frenzy around that content.","The good thing for us is we've kind of ducked our heads on that. And because so much economics has gone to soccer and because we're the only player that can offer a pan-European platform, we've been able to sweep in 60-plus deals of very compelling rights, whether it's speed skating, speed jumping; most of winter sports, summer track and field, more cycling, more tennis at mid-single-digit. And we're even having discussions with some players that bought soccer that are looking to pick up some extra economics by selling some of these niche sports.","And for us those niche sports are looking like those are the drivers that are quite attractive for the Eurosport app. Those are the super fan groups that love \u2013 that want to see all the speed skating or want to see all the cycling. And so right now, I think we're quite comfortable that we already committed that Eurosport will not go upside down \u2013 it will be profitable. We took the profitability margins down from in the 20%s to single-digits. And we think over time that we should be able to not only be profitable, but we should start to get some of the benefit of the app, which is all-incremental and the viewership gains that we're getting now which will \u2013 we'll get the benefit, and we've seen in some markets already that when you put Eurosport together with our 10 traditional channels, we get benefit and by selling Eurosport locally, we're getting benefit; so I'd say so far, so good.","Andrew C. Warren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP","And just, Doug, some financial parameters on that, one thing we've spoken about is this investment in sports not only is going to allow us to at least double our Eurosport-specific ad sales over the next five years, but as you know, the combination of the Sports and the Olympics and our share of viewership across pan-Europe is going to really help drive the top-line affiliate as well.","David M. Zaslav - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And we will, after Rio, the Olympic Rings will go on, on our Eurosport channels. We also have Eurosport.com, which is the number one online site for sports scores and clips. The Rings will go on that. We're working very effectively with the IOC, and it's very early days. But we're having some interesting conversations on multiple platforms about the fact that we own the Olympic IP for the next decade.","Doug Mitchelson - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Bank from RBC Capital Management.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, guys. Thank you very much. So, David, Andy, we tend to track what is reported, right? We're pretty focused particularly on the linear ratings that we see and trying to figure out what's driving ad revenues. But from you guys' perspective, there are integrated revenues and there are digital revenues in particular that I think are probably ramping. Can you give us a sense how much of the ad revenues are coming from that linear viewership right now versus the non-traditional, and in a sense, the non-tracked by Nielsen C3 or Live+7 Ratings?","Andrew C. Warren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP","Yeah, sure, David. There's no question that you're right. We are seeing a ramp of our non-linear ad sales. Looking specifically at the third quarter, the majority is still very much from linear. And Dave talked about the traction we're seeing, the 200 million monthly views. I mean, clearly there's a growing, growing opportunity for us to monetize that. But specifically for the third quarter, it still is very much our linear ad sales, driven by pricing and demand.","David M. Zaslav - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","The good news \u2013 the bad news is we haven't done a great job in monetizing that. And when you look at the overall effort, it's about break-even with all the effort that we've made. That's the bad news. The good news is that more and more we're talking to advertisers that like the scale that we have. We're changing our approach in how we're selling to take advantage. We see a lot of players like Vice who have done, candidly, an extraordinarily good job of monetizing their streams. And so this is another thing that Paul and our team is looking at, that we've been, I think, best-of-class with linear. And over the next two years to three years, if we could really build up our capability and our expertise in digital, I think that'll be a significant upside because we haven't been great at it.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Nathanson from MoffettNathanson. Please proceed","Michael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC","Thanks. I have two, let me do one for David and one for Andy after that. David, you guys have been very honest the past two years about calling the cable market tepid for advertising. And as you mentioned, this was your fastest growth in two years, so I wonder when you really dig into the quarterly data this quarter, was it, you think GRPs, volume, pricing and scatter that led to the results and do you think perhaps this is a turn for either cable or for yourself in terms of those dynamics that drove the market?","David M. Zaslav - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","It's way too difficult to prognosticate where the advertising market is going. It moved away quickly in the fourth quarter, we didn't quite know why. It flattened out, and now there's no question that volume has been much stronger and pricing has been good. A piece of that candidly is that we're outperforming. There are a number of players in the industry that have \u2013 ratings have dropped significantly. And so there's been a meaningful ADU issue in the marketplace. And so if you want to put money to work, the fact that our ratings are up and our, more importantly, our share is up, we didn't have that issue, so we were open for business. The other thing is that our channels are on brand. So, Discovery has never been stronger and the ability to get aligned with the number one network for men, and now we have ID, which was the number one network for women.","ID is still meaningfully underpriced. And when you look at the CPM differential between broadcast and cable in general, it's still over 30%. And we can deliver with Gold Rush. We could be number one for men and beat the broadcasters, and ID's length of view is so high. We have super-fan groups around Oprah and Tyler and Science. So I think that being on brand has really helped us and we have a good momentum story by having gone back to brand and the fact that our share is growing. And so we're just going to have to see. Right now, Joe Abruzzese and his team are doing a very good job and so are our programming teams in the aggregate here in the U.S. And so we're going to continue to ride this out and hope that the advertising market stays. We'll see.","Michael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC","Okay. Thanks, David. And the one for Andy is, I know that you're confident, David's confident and the board is confident about the future of your company. As you saw over the summer, sometimes the market gives you these opportunities to buy things really cheaply. So I wonder why not keep your powder dry on buybacks and maybe wait for another time when you can actually come in and get a really fat pick. So talk about the timing of the buyback now versus maybe keeping it on the sideline for better opportunities.","Andrew C. Warren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP","Yeah, Mike, look, it's a very fair question and one that we talk a lot about. The good news is this: we talked about earlier this idea that we're going to \u2013 we'd expect to buy back about $1.5 billion of our stock the next 12 months. The good news is, given our still prudent, but slightly more aggressive leverage target, as well as our really expanding cash flow profile, we're still going to have a lot of powder on top of the $1.5 billion, so we still sit here today and say our stock is cheap, it's a smart allocation of capital and we still have an enormous amount of capital available beyond that for some opportunistic either buying of IP or investing in scale. So, it certainly is not one or the other. The good news is, and maybe surprising for investors is that we can still achieve both given what we see is our cash profile and given the slightly increased level of leverage.","Michael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC","Okay. Thanks, Andy. Thanks, Dave.","Operator","Your next question comes from Todd Juenger from Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed.","Todd Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning. I'll keep it to one question because it's potentially a rather large one depending on how you choose to answer it. I'd love to explore international, particularly the affiliate fees a little bit with you, if you don't mind, and just the world is a big place, but when we think about how to get confidence going forward, anything you could do to decompose the sources of growth there? A lot of your press release talked about subscriber growth in the emerging markets. How much is that as a sort of percentage of your growth going forward as opposed to, say, more stable parts in the world like Western Europe, where you think about your pricing cadence and deal renewals and Eurosport and new additions like that?","Anything you could share on sort of the mix of how that goes? And in the Western Europe part of the world, if there's anything you could say in terms of pace of renewals, pricing expectation on renewals, I know we all find that very helpful. Thank you very much.","David M. Zaslav - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Todd. First, the cycle internationally in general tends to be more like three years versus five years or six years or seven years here in the U.S., that's first. And this won't surprise most of you, but there really is a difference historically in pricing of distribution deals. The way that it's worked historically is that you get your extra pricing by growth. So price has been relatively flat over the last 10 years for most of us in the content business, and it's because distribution was growing pretty aggressively almost around the world.","We still see aggressive growth, meaningful growth in Latin America, particularly Brazil and Mexico, although Brazil has slowed down a little bit with the economy, and India, we're seeing meaningful growth in Eastern Europe. There are lot of other markets that are more mature now, like Western Europe and a number of the markets in Japan. What we've been able to do with our strategy, which is starting to come through and we'll take a shorter time than it did here in the U.S. where the cycle is longer, is we have been scaling up in Europe over the last four years or five years.","And with the Olympics, with Eurosport, but more importantly just with the overall scale expansion, because we've been growing our market share double-digit for the last six consecutive years in Europe and Latin America, we now sit with distributors. And we started about a year-and-a-half ago where in Western Europe, since there's very modest sub growth, it's not going to work for us.","And so the good news is we have enough scale, we believe, to drive price. And we've been able to do that as our deals come up, the same way we had an attack plan to drive a step up in pricing here in the U.S., we have that outside the U.S. We're not executing it everywhere because there were a number of markets we're getting better than double-digit growth just because gestationally these continue to be higher growth markets. And then those markets, we'll play the old game where we're continuing to grow share, we're getting our channels carried, distributors are promoting us, and we're getting double-digit growth.","In the more mature markets, we are being quite aggressive. Look, in Sweden, we pulled our signal. And we were off for four days, and then we went back on and we were able to get better than double-digit increase. Across much of Europe on renewals, we have been very clear that our scale is up, our investment is up, and we need significant increases. And so you'll see those come in over the next couple of years.","Todd Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you.","David M. Zaslav - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","One other point, Todd, that I think we can provide that I think is meaningful is that TV Everywhere and SVOD is becoming a big part, particularly TV Everywhere and VOD across those mature markets. And we have a 20-year library in language, and we also have the Olympic IP, and we also have sports IP. And so, the ability for us to have a win-win, which is you take our channels, but in addition, we'll give you some more content for TV Everywhere because we have a ton of it, it's a win for them, it's a win for us, and it helps us further substantiate the pricing rather than just the old Shootout at the O.K. Corral.","Operator","Your next question comes from Anthony DiClemente from Nomura. Please proceed.","Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Thank you very much, and good morning. David or Andy, you had a nice acceleration in the U.S. distribution revenue from 6% last quarter to 7%. It seems like there has been some stability in terms of U.S. video subscribers in the quarter. I know it's tough to track quarter-to-quarter, but following a pretty tumultuous quarter last quarter, I just wanted to ask about that. I know that rate is the driver of that 7%, but are you guys seeing any of that stability in terms of the paid subscriber accounts that you see that you track and get paid for? Thanks. And then I have a follow up.","David M. Zaslav - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Anthony. As you know from our Investor Day, we assumed, as the industry started to show very slight decline that that was going to continue. There is a lag because we tend to get paid two months to three months later. But looking at the earnings reports from the distributors, I think it was very encouraging.","Some of them have gained subs, others are declining at much lower rates. If that flows through, that'll be meaningful upside for us to what our plan is because we've assumed that there'll be slight decline and even at the numbers that we were seeing in the recent earnings reports, that's better than what we have in our plan. And so, we'll just have to see. For us, the good news is we're very protected on the bundle. We could've gotten more price and structured deals where there was more flexibility to move some of our channels. We opted to have the maximum security for our channels, and get price, and so we will track pretty closely what the universe estimates are because we did build into our deals over the last four years less flexibility to move around our channels.","Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Thanks a lot, David. And then, Andy, on the organic international ad growth acceleration, up 12% in the 3Q versus 7% in the prior quarter, a nice acceleration. You pointed out in your prepared remarks or David or Andy you did I think the specific country strength in Brazil and Latin America. I just wanted to ask how sustainable is that 12% as we go forward into the fourth quarter and next year? How should we be thinking about? Is it safe to assume double-digits? Anything you can give us on the forward outlook for organic international advertising would be helpful. Thanks.","Andrew C. Warren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP","Sure. Well, Anthony, we certainly don't want to give too much expectation today about 2016, but look we're very encouraged by that 12% trend. I think it continues to speak to our share of viewership being meaningfully higher than share of wallet. We talked about the third quarter, the second quarter being a bit of an anomaly, so us being back in the double-digit range is where we should be.","For me, I continue to think that's where we're going to stay for a while. We just have so much growth potential and opportunity across so many of our key markets and regions, and so I think the third-quarter trend not only is encouraging, but I think indicative of a lot of the kind of core ad sales metrics we're seeing across our international markets.","Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Great. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of Kannan Venkateshwar from Barclays. Please proceed.","Kannan Venkateshwar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you. Andy, just one question on the buyback. I just wanted to check, I mean, given that the Investor Day is just about a month old now, what changed in the last month for you to go to the other extreme of actually increasing the leverage target and levering up to buy back stock versus what you guys mentioned during the Investor Day?","Andrew C. Warren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP","Hey, Kannan, this is something that we've thought about and debated the merits of for quite some time, quite frankly. We had one of our board meetings in October and look, when we look at our portfolio, we look at our free cash flow growth, we look at the fact that 80% of our U.S. affiliate deals are done with tremendous rate CAGRs; when we look at our cash tax rate and what we're doing there to drive that down, when we compare ourselves, not only those operating metrics, but then we compare ourselves to our peers around, as I mentioned I think before, our interest coverage ratios, our free cash flow to debt yield, it's the right capital structure for us.","We have de-risked U.S. business model. We have an accelerating cash flow model. I'm extraordinarily comfortable with the seat I'm in, that we can sustain this higher level of leverage still being fully committed to maintaining our investment grade and allow ourselves to drive a higher level of return on equity while still being very prudent with our debt and capital structure. So, it just was very much kind of the timing of not only board discussions, but then just operationally how confident I feel now about our growth profile.","Kannan Venkateshwar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got it.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Ms. Jackie Burka, Vice President, Investor Relations. You may begin.","Jackie Burka - Discovery Communications, Inc.","Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for Discovery Communications first quarter 2017 earnings call. Joining me today are David Zaslav, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and for the first time, Gunnar Wiedenfels, our Chief Financial Officer.","You should have received our earnings release, but if not, feel free to access it on our website at www.discoverycommunications.com. On today's call, we will begin with some opening comments from David and Gunnar, and then we will open up the call for your questions. Please keep to one question so we can accommodate as many people as possible.","Before we start, I would like to remind you that comments today regarding the company's future business plans, prospects and financial performance are forward-looking statements that we make pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are made based on management's current knowledge and assumptions about future events, and they involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations.","In providing projections and other forward-looking statements, the company disclaims any intent or obligation to update them. For additional information on important factors that could affect these expectations, please see our Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2015, and our subsequent filings made with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.","And with that, I will turn the call over to David.","David M. Zaslav - Discovery Communications, Inc.","Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Discovery's first quarter marked a solid start to 2017 highlighted by strong gains in global distribution revenues, continued ratings momentum across our portfolio of superfan brands and channels, and distinct progress in growing our digital and direct-to-consumer businesses.","As the media landscape continues to evolve, we are focused on strengthening our global content portfolio and positioning it to reach our superfans every way they consume content. We continue to make significant headway on our strategy of maximizing our existing linear business, while simultaneously driving growth and investing in areas like mobile and OTT.","Since the start of the year, we expanded multiple existing digital initiatives such as: our Amazon SVOD channels partnership in the U.S.; we made demonstrable progress with Eurosport Player, our live streaming service in Europe that provides an all access pass to the greatest sports events; and we entered into several strong new digital partnerships, including a pioneering joint venture with Germany's ProSieben to create a next-generation streaming OTT service, a first of its kind partnership in Europe.","I'd like to spend a moment talking about the solid performance of our global content portfolio. In the U.S., our networks outperformed the down-market in both prime and total day led by Discovery and TLC, and also strength at ID, OWN and Velocity, which helped drive our U.S. ad sales up 2% on an underlying basis or 1% excluding the impact of the Group Nine transaction. And internationally, our ad sales grew 3%.","In the U.S., Discovery Channel was again the number one non-sports cable network for men. And TLC continued its resurgence, gaining nearly 20% and ranking as a top ranked network for women. Internationally, TLC posted strong double digit viewership for the quarter and set new delivery records.","At ID, we maintained first place in total debuting among women in the U.S., a significant achievement with also the longest length of view in cable. We did that while growing our international ID viewership by 17%. Velocity and, international counterpart, Turbo saw their highest U.S. ratings ever and substantial international growth in the high [audio skip] (5:01) men's demo.","Turning to our distribution business, our domestic affiliate revenue grew 5% in the first quarter and our international affiliate revenue climbed 10% organically, driven in part by our enhanced portfolio of sports, including the Olympic Games in Europe for the next four games, which begins next year.","Looking next at our overall digital and direct-to-consumer business, we continue to aggressively pursue our three-pronged global digital strategy. First, we are driving our authenticated TV Everywhere offerings that enable cable and satellite superfans to watch our long-form content wherever they want, whenever they want. Second, we're taking our long-form content over-the-top with new distribution partners as well as direct-to-consumer offerings. Finally, we are focused on short-form mobile-first content that appeals largely to a younger audience.","During the quarter, we made real progress with our first initiative around TV Everywhere. In the U.S., our suite of GO apps is growing rapidly and are also driving awareness and engagement for our linear brands. Our GO apps are now available to 80% of U.S. households. And by year-end, we expect they will be available on 115 million connected devices including on Roku, PlayStation 4, Apple TV and Xbox.","We are seeing great consumer engagement with GO, especially with younger viewers. Even as our streaming volume increases, 18 to 34 year olds still account for half of our visitors. GO is now delivering incremental revenues as well. In the first quarter, we realized a full point of ad sales growth domestically from GO. And we expect to continue improving our monetization going forward.","Outside the U.S., our market-leading TV Everywhere product in Latin America, Discovery Kids Play, continues to grow. We now have 60% distribution across all of Latin America, with 90% distribution in Brazil. And in Europe, our direct-to-consumer streaming service, Dplay, reported 19% year-over-year subscriber growth as both local content and global tent poles like Gold Rush helped drive higher overall viewing across linear and digital.","The second piece of our digital strategy is expanding the reach of our long-form content through over-the-top direct-to-consumer and onto new and emerging platforms. As mentioned, the Eurosport Player, our sports Netflix product, is off to a fantastic start this year with year-to-date gross subs up over 70% and our total sub base up almost 50% year-over-year, suggesting our new season pass strategy from Paul Guyardo and his team is beginning to work.","You may recall that it was Paul who built DIRECTV's NFL Sunday Ticket season pass and other sports packages to an over $2 billion business. Paul's country-by-country approach has pivoted the business away from a one size fit all model to one that marries tailoring pricing and packaging strategies such as seasons passes with specific premium and local sports rights.","Another key direct-to-consumer offering is our recently announced joint venture with Germany's number one commercial broadcaster, ProSieben. Together, we are launching an ad and subscription option video on demand service that will stream our combined free-to-air channels in Germany. This product will help strengthen our All Screen strategy and deliver incremental advertising dollars in one of our most important international markets. We will welcome discussions with other media companies to participate in our partnership.","We also continue to pursue OTT and direct-to-consumer products in deep niche verticals that appeal to our fans with specific affinities and passions. In the U.S., our Amazon streaming channels continue to grow, and we recently launched a third subscription video on demand channel on Amazon, Say Yes, featuring more than 500 hours of exclusive wedding content. Say Yes follows the success of True Crime Files by ID and Destination Unknown, which we launched last year. While it's early days, we believe our niche verticals have strong appeal with superfans, and we continue to explore opportunities for our genres where we have a unique brand advantage.","Our third area of focus in digital is creating short-form mobile-first content that appeals primarily to a younger audience. A key vehicle is our strategic partnership with Group Nine, which continues to build momentum and, today, achieves 4.2 billion monthly video views across our properties, including Thrillist, The Dodo, Seeker and NowThis.","We continue to work together to sell our Group Nine brands in conjunction with our GO apps in order to deliver a true 360-degree solution targeting millennials. During the quarter, we also announced that Group Nine's NowThis, a leading creator of short-form video for social media, and Eurosport will partner to produce and distribute sports-related social media, including content around the 2018 Olympic Winter Games.","We're also working closely with Snapchat, which we see as an important new way to reach younger viewers, leveraging the platform's 160 million daily users, over half of who are ages 13 to 24. We now have several Snapchat channels, including Eurosport, NowThis and The Dodo, and we'll also be creating premium Snapchat content around marquee Discovery brands like Shark Week starting this summer.","In summary, as the media industry continues to evolve, we will continue to grow our businesses while positioning ourselves for the future with new ways to reach and engage our global superfans. Part of paving a successful road ahead is ensuring we have the best, most forward-looking team in media.","We recently welcomed Gunnar Wiedenfels as our new CFO and he has hit the ground running. Gunnar's extensive experience in Europe and international markets and in building direct-to-consumer and digital businesses is already proving invaluable as we focus increasingly on all three areas to drive growth at Discovery.","So, for the first time, I'll turn the call over to Gunnar for a detailed look at our financial performance.","Gunnar Wiedenfels - Discovery Communications, Inc.","Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone, also from my side. I want to start off by saying that I'm very excited to be here at Discovery. Discovery is a company with an incredible global reputation, especially in Europe, and I have followed its trajectory closely throughout my career. David and his team have built an unrivaled portfolio of global brands that is uniquely positioned for growth around the world. I am thrilled to have joined this world-class team and to bring my prior experience in the European and digital markets to this exciting and dynamic company. I'm very optimistic about Discovery's strategic positioning and outlook, and I look forward to speaking with all of you more going forward.","Now, delving into our financials, as David highlighted, our first quarter results were driven by continued global distribution growth combined with a strict focus on cost management. Our total company reported revenues and adjusted OIBDA were up 3% and 5%, respectively, while constant currency revenues and adjusted OIBDA were up 5% and 4%, respectively.","Currency impacts continue to improve. In the first quarter, currency reduced revenue growth by 2%, while the combination of our successful hedging program and certain emerging market currencies moving in our favor led to currency helping our adjusted OIBDA growth by 1%.","Net income available to Discovery Communications of $215 million decreased versus the first quarter a year ago. This was on the positive side driven by our improved operating performance and lower effective tax rate. These positive effects were more than offset by a one-time debt extinguishment charge, a larger solar-related loss from equity investees, and higher restructuring charges.","Please let me explain these effects in a bit more detail. Our tax rate of 20% was a full 700 basis points lower than our full year 2016 rate as we began to realize the beneficial tax credits of our investments in solar power. On the flip side, our equity income was impacted by an initial first quarter $83 million pre-tax book loss due to the timing of losses allocated from our solar investments. These book losses created a negative equity income, which was otherwise positively impacted by improved contributions from OWN and other investments.","Looking forward on the full year, we still expect our full year tax rate to be 20% or below, primarily due to our solar investments, while the full year book loss from solar is expected to total approximately $200 million, approximately $30 million of which are expected for the second quarter. Net-net, we still anticipate that our solar investments will have a positive impact on full year net income as the benefits from our tax credits as well as the tax shield on the book losses will more than outweigh the $200 million book losses.","Let us now turn to EPS. Earnings per diluted share for the first quarter was $0.37 and adjusted earnings per diluted share, which excludes the impact of acquisition-related non-cash amortization of intangible assets, was $0.41. That means, excluding currency impacts, adjusted EPS was down $0.05 or 11% for the quarter, but was up 9% year-over-year for the last 12-month period. Excluding currency impacts and the $34 million or $0.06 after-tax one-time debt extinguishment charges, first quarter adjusted EPS increased by 2%.","First quarter free cash flow, while traditionally the lowest of the year, did increase significantly to $208 million. This was primarily due to a large decrease in cash tax payments, partially due to certain payments being deferred to the second quarter this year versus being paid in the first quarter last year, as well as our improved operating results despite higher capital expenditures due to an increase in technology and infrastructure spending.","Turning to the operating units, let me start with U.S. Networks. Our U.S. Networks had another solid quarter, with total revenues up 3%, led by 5% distribution growth and 1% advertising growth, and adjusted OIBDA up 6% given our reduction of total domestic costs. Our advertising growth of 1%, or 2% on an underlying basis excluding the impact of December's Group Nine transaction and the deconsolidation of Seeker and SourceFed, was primarily due to pricing and improved monetization of our GO platforms, which added a point of growth in the quarter, partially offset by lower delivery due to continued universe decline.","As we look ahead to the second quarter of 2017, we currently expect U.S. ad growth to be up low-single digits on an underlying basis or flat to up slightly on a reported basis after including the impact from the Group Nine transaction. In more detail, while delivery is expected to be down due to continued universe declines and Shark Week moving to the third quarter versus mostly in the second quarter last year, we continue to maximize yield on our linear networks as pricing remains healthy. Additionally, included in our outlook is, again, a point of growth from our GO platform.","Looking at distribution, our first quarter domestic distribution revenues were up 5%, with growth primarily driven by higher contracted affiliate rates partially offset by a slight decline in subscribers. To a lesser extent, the growth was driven by contributions from other distribution revenues, i.e., content deliveries under licensing agreements. Total portfolio subs in the first quarter declined by just over 3% year-over-year, a slight acceleration versus the fourth quarter.","As we stated on our year-end call, we still expect 2017 full year distribution revenue growth to be in the mid-single digit range, assuming subscriber trends remain relatively consistent. We will continue to benefit from higher pricing in our existing affiliate deals and we will also continue to aggressively pursue additional ways to increase our digital distribution revenues and monetize our content across all platforms with existing and new distribution partners as the media landscape continues to change.","Turning to the cost side, operating expenses in the quarter were down 2%. Costs of revenues were down 5%, mostly due to lower impairment charges and the timing of content expense. SG&A increased 4%, primarily due to higher marketing costs. The decline in total cost led to an adjusted OIBDA growth of 6% with margins expanding by almost 200 basis points to an impressive 60%. As we look ahead to the rest of the year, we will continue to focus on managing limiting U.S. cost growth with a year-over-year total cost growth expected to peak in the low-single digit range in the third quarter due to Shark Week and our scripted drama MANHUNT: UNABOMBER.","I will now turn to our international operations. Reported revenues and adjusted OIBDA were up 5% and 7% respectively, while excluding currency, revenues increased 8% and adjusted OIBDA increased 4%. For comparability purposes, my following international comments will refer to our organic results only, so will exclude the impact of currency.","The 8% first quarter revenue growth was comprised of 10% distribution growth and 3% advertising growth. Our 10% distribution revenue growth was driven by higher affiliate rates throughout Europe where we have already been successful in monetizing our expanded content portfolio that now includes sports to secure higher contracted pricing increases. Second driver was Latin America with an increased subscriber number and higher pricing.","Looking forward, second quarter growth will decelerate 200 basis points from the 10% increase in the first quarter. This is primarily due to prior year comps with a catch up effect associated with contract renewals in the second quarter of last year. That being said, for the full year, we're still aiming for the distribution revenue growth of 12% to 13%. Our 3% advertising growth was mostly driven by increases in the Nordics, primarily due to higher pricing and volume and the absence of the Telenor blackout that occurred in the first quarter of 2016, higher volume and ratings in Latin America, and higher pricing and volume in CEEMEA.","These increases were offset by declines in the UK, where we were impacted by overall market weakness as the total market was down in the high-single digit range as well as lower ratings on our own networks, and declines in our smallest market, Asia-Pacific, primarily due to weakness in India post November's demonetization. As we look ahead to the second quarter, we expect ad sales to again be up in the low-to-mid single digit range as we expect positive ad growth in Southern and Eastern Europe, the Nordics, and LatAm to likely again be partly offset by declines in Asia-Pacific and the UK due to continued market softness.","Turning to the cost side, operating expenses internationally grew 9% in the first quarter, primarily due to higher sports content and production costs. Looking ahead, we expect total cost growth to be in the high-single digits to low-double digit range each quarter for the rest of the year with growth peaking in the third quarter primarily due to the timing of our sports rights.","Now, taking a look at our overall financial picture, in the first quarter, we spent a total of $200 million repurchasing our own shares after investing a gross amount of $181 million in solar. We have now spent over $8.2 billion buying back shares since we began our buyback program in 2010, and we have reduced our outstanding share count by over 36%.","Discovery's capital allocation philosophy will be a top priority of mine over the next couple of months, and I will work closely with David, our senior management team and our board of directors on how to best position the company to maximize returns on our invested capital. While we remain completely committed to maintain our investment grade rating, we will take a fresh look at our target leverage ratios and investment priorities as well as hurdle rates.","At this point, for the second quarter, our capital allocation priorities will be the same as over the last two quarters. We're not committing to a specific level of buybacks, but we'll allocate excess capital beyond any high return investments towards repurchasing our shares. On solar, we have already spent over half of the $340 million 2017 gross commitment amount. And in the second quarter, we currently expect to invest another $50 million in additional solar investments.","One other item I would like to note is the financial impact of the Raw and Betty sale, which closed at the end of April. Raw and Betty contributed approximately $8 million to $10 million of revenues per quarter to our Education and Other segment, which includes our studios business, with a minimal impact on adjusted OIBDA.","Finally, we are reiterating our full year guidance of constant currency adjusted EPS growth of at least low-to-mid teens. Growth will be driven by maximizing our advertising and distribution revenues on our existing linear business and across new and emerging platforms, combined with a continued laser focus on controlling cost growth and a lower effective tax rate.","Pulling together our commentary on U.S. and international costs, we continue to expect total company constant currency cost of revenues to grow in the high-single to low-double digit range, and total company constant currency SG&A growth to be flat to up low-single digits.","I would also note, as has consistently been our practice, that our adjusted EPS guidance does not adjust for any below-the-line items except for purchase price amortization. So it does not back out the first quarter one-time debt extinguishment charges. It also assumes full year stock-based compensation of approximately $30 million to $40 million.","I'm also pleased to reiterate our growth guidance for the full year 2017 constant currency free cash flow of at least low-double digits. While we now expect capital expenditures to be up year-over-year to just over $100 million as we continue to invest in technology and infrastructure, we now expect our full year cash tax rate to be in the low-to-mid 20% range, down from our prior expectation of the high 20% range due to the timing of expected additional refunds.","Finally, we are reiterating our three-year 2015 to 2018 guidance for constant currency adjusted EPS and constant currency free cash flow CAGRs to grow at least low teens. I also want to update you on our expected year-over-year foreign exchange impact on our full year reported results, which has improved versus our prior guidance, given the recent weakening of the dollar as well as our hedging program.","Assuming rates stay constant for the rest of the year, the year-over-year FX impact on revenues is now expected to be negative $20 million to $30 million. On AOIBDA, currency has become a slight tailwind and is expected to have a positive impact of $10 million to $20 million, and currency is now expected to have a negative $0.09 to $0.11 impact on adjusted EPS, primarily due to last year's below-the-line FX gains.","In closing, while I have only been here for a relatively short time, I'm extremely pleased with Discovery's start to 2017 and our outlook for the rest of year. I'm very optimistic about the global portfolio and our overall financial and operating room (25:41).","Thank you again for your time this morning, and now David and I will be happy to answer any questions you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And our first question comes from the line of Alexia Quadrani of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you very much. Just following up on your comments on domestic advertising trends, where you highlighted better pricing, I guess, any more color on the scatter market and how it's trending in the second quarter?","And then, just a quick follow up on your commentary on your investment in short-form digital video that you highlighted. Can you add some color on how you expect to monetize it over time? Is it largely gaining mind share for the millennials and building up your brand? Or do you see, I guess, an incremental revenue opportunity associated with those videos as well? Thank you.","David M. Zaslav - Discovery Communications, Inc.","Sure. Hi, Alexia. The advertising market kind of feels steady as she goes. We don't have a lot of visibility to the upfront, but scatter pricing is up mid-to-high teens over the upfront. The volume is relatively steady. We come into the market right now in the second quarter and into the upfront, I think, with a very compelling story. Our ratings are up. We're up in April in prime, up 5%, while the industry is down 8%. And for the full year-to-date, we're flat in prime with the industry down 6% and broadcast down 12%.","But, more importantly, I think we're a very protected environment. Our brands have never been stronger. So not only do we have a growth story, but we have a real strength of viewership story on ID, on TLC, on Discovery, on OWN. And so, it's an environment the advertisers are quite comfortable with, and so I think that we're finding the market to be steady, and we're starting to take advantage of it with the quality of our brands and the fact that we actually have some real ratings.","On the short-form monetization, the good news for us is that we're learning a ton. This whole Group Nine transaction has been terrific for us. We're building even stronger relationships with Facebook and Snapchat. We're understanding a lot more about the consumption of one minute videos. We're up to over 4 billion in views. We're the number one or two video provider for news on Facebook, and we're experimenting with them in different ways to monetize that.","Guyardo is working with our entire team in putting Group Nine together with GO, together with our traditional inventory, so we have a great 360. And together with Snapchat, I feel like we're reaching more demos, a significant difference from two or three years ago where we felt like some of those demographics were being left behind and our story-telling capability in short-form, we felt like really needed to be improved.","So we're quite happy with where we are. I think the monetization of short-form has a fairly long way to go. And so if there is upside there or if it takes a turn, we are now one of the \u2013 we're the number two or three provider of short-form content in terms of all the media companies, and we have a right to take control of Group Nine in two years. So I think it's been good and it's working very well with our ad sales team, and it gives us, I think, a very forward-looking view in terms of being able to reach all demos as we hit the upfront.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey, good morning. David, can you talk a little bit about your expectation? I believe your guidance is for acceleration in international distribution revenue growth later this year. And any update on sort of how you're thinking about the Bundesliga rights monetization. And I don't know if you guys are comfortable talking about through the Olympics next year, but to the extent you can help us think about distribution revenue trajectory into 2018. That would be really helpful.","And Gunnar, I was just curious if you could \u2013 I don't know if you're willing to, but if you could give us the impact on U.S. distribution revenue from the year-over-year licensing change. I don't know if there's any \u2013 like a basis points impact or anything to help us isolate the core number. Thank you both.","David M. Zaslav - Discovery Communications, Inc.","One point before I pass off to Gunnar who spent an enormous amount of time dealing with these issues in Germany and with ProSieben. One of our philosophies on our IP is that we own it on all platforms, which is meaningfully different from the way that sports is sold here in the U.S., for instance, where when you see it on a mobile player or on another platform, it might be the league that sells it, it might not \u2013 somebody's buying a broadcast window or a cable window.","So when it comes to the Olympics and when it comes to the Bundesliga, when it comes to all of our sports rights, when it comes to almost all of our IP, we own it for all platforms. And so, if you see our content turning up or if you see the Olympic rings turning up with a mobile player in Europe, if you see the content over-the-top on mobile, on any platform, or the Bundesliga or any of our sports, that's why we can go direct-to-consumer with it, we could offer some of it free.","And so, I think there's no question we're a little bit long on IP. We are profitable with our sports, but we're long on it because we think owning that IP for all platforms, owning our kids IP for all platforms, is part of the part of this transition we're making into creating real value to address some of the terminal value concerns that the industry's facing. Gunnar?","Gunnar Wiedenfels - Discovery Communications, Inc.","Yeah, sure. Ben, good morning. So, on the affiliate revenue growth guidance for international, as you could hear in my opening remarks, we're continuing to target a 12% to 13% full year growth rate, and if you look at the run rates, as you say, we got 10% in Q1. I also said that we're going to see a slightly lower rate in Q2, which is not a change in the trend, but it's more related to a prior year comp where we had some catch up in Q2 2016. And then, as you say, we're targeting a pickup in the second half based on some deals that we're working on currently to get to that 12% to 13% figure for the full year.","On Bundesliga specifically, maybe allow me one or two comments. As David said, I've lived in that market for all of my life, and really, it's important to understand Bundesliga is one of the top, top sports franchises in the market. We've got a good share of that. We own the rights for four years. It's a strong right and a good deal for us in terms of the duration.","And looking at the number of players that are in the market that are looking for premium IP, we're talking to a number of players, and I'm absolutely convinced that the Bundesliga deal will help us strengthen the portfolio in the market. Talking about Bundesliga, again, from my perspective, a very interesting deal; I very much like that pan-European cross-platform approach to that deal. And again, I believe we will be able to create a lot of value, especially if you look at the eight-year period that we're looking at.","David M. Zaslav - Discovery Communications, Inc.","For the Olympics.","Gunnar Wiedenfels - Discovery Communications, Inc.","For the Olympics, yes.","David M. Zaslav - Discovery Communications, Inc.","And the deals that we've done for the Olympics thus far have been ahead of plan. And by locking in those rights, we're excited about the fact that Germany is kind of the real center spoke of Europe, so not only do we have Eurosport free-to-air and pay in Germany, we have a free-to-air female channel, a free-to-air male channel, and we'll be doing the Olympics ourselves in Germany, which we think will add a significant amount of value, and having extra scale in Germany is important to us because it's such a robust market.","Gunnar Wiedenfels - Discovery Communications, Inc.","And then, Ben, maybe your second question, the impact of those other distribution revenues on the U.S. side, we just felt it important to highlight that there were some contributions from those deals. It's small in the greater scheme of things in the whole distribution revenue line item. And we see more of those deals coming forward as we look at the full year.","David M. Zaslav - Discovery Communications, Inc.","So that was really just some bulk delivery of content to our existing partners. It's a very small component of Q1, but when you add it on top, it provided some growth. So we felt it important to point that out and we may do more of those.","Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. Thank you, both.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Nathanson of MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open.","Michael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC","Thank you. Two \u2013 one following up on Ben and a new one. David, you guys been very clear about the Olympics in 2018 driving affiliate revenue growth internationally, it's going to step up. Could you talk a bit about how the costs layer in for the Olympics and is 2018 incrementally profitable because of those stepped up affiliate fees or is the Olympic profitability more back ended?","And then, on the cost line, if you go back to your Investor Day in 2015, like almost two years ago, you guys talked about your ability to control costs under different scenarios of revenues. Now that we're two years later and you kind of see the normal rate of growth in the market, can you talk again about your ability to control cost and kind of what's the right way to think about domestic cost growth if this is the new normal of revenue growth?","Gunnar Wiedenfels - Discovery Communications, Inc.","Okay. Michael, this is Gunnar. Let me take that. So, on the Olympics, it's still too early to really talk about the exact cadence of how the P&L impact will turn out. A couple of things that are clear from today's perspective is that the 2018 allocation of cost is going to be the lowest given that we don't have all the rights or not as many rights as in later years. So we will update our models and update you as soon as we have a reliable set of figures across those eight years.","Generally speaking, the Winter Games are less expensive than the Summer Games, and we definitely see an upside from the Olympics deal generally on affiliate revenues. As a matter of fact, you can already see European affiliate revenues going back to double-digit without even having factored in all the sports rights. And we also, obviously, see contributions from our Eurosport Player. (37:10)","David M. Zaslav - Discovery Communications, Inc.","The cadence that Gunnar was talking about is simply that we got all the rights for eight years, but in the UK and in France, we didn't get the Olympic rights until 2022 and 2024, but we did structure a deal with the BBC, whereas part of their rights to carry the Olympics, we got a substantial amount of rights and extensive digital rights in 2020 and 2022. But when you allocate the actual fees, because of France and the UK, the cadence is a little bit different, that's all.","Gunnar Wiedenfels - Discovery Communications, Inc.","And then, Michael, on the cost guidance, I think, looking at the Q1 numbers, you see that the company is very focused on cost management. Clearly, coming in, I will continue that focus and take a fresh look at cost as well, but I must say I'm very happy with the performance that Discovery has delivered on the cost side in Q1.","So, the general guidance for us for 2017, as I said before, is total company organic cost of revenues up high-single to low-double digits, and we will be even more restrictive on SG&A on a total company level targeting flat-to-low single digit increases for our cost base. So please be assured it will continue to be a clear focus of the management team here.","David M. Zaslav - Discovery Communications, Inc.","And Michael, just to confirm our company but also my full engagement in social media, I was following the hundreds of notes and likes for your birthday yesterday on Facebook, as well as the numerous picture posts, all of which I thought were very nice. Happy birthday.","Michael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC","Thanks, David. Thank you. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Richard Greenfield of BTIG. Your line is now open.","Richard Greenfield - BTIG LLC","Hi, thanks for taking the question. AT&T's Randall Stephenson was testifying before Congress late last year, and he said point-blank to Congress that he said a huge number of consumers want cheaper video bundles without the high cost of sports. And David, you've talked to the rise of these new virtual MVPDs as an opportunity.","So far, they seem all very sports heavy, including kind of, as a basis, the broadcasters and the RSNs, which push not only the cost towards $40, but it also has led to Discovery and others being left out of things like Hulu and YouTube launches. Wondering what do you think of the prospects are for new bundles that may not have the broadcasters or may not have the RSNs that could be priced below $20. And then I have a follow-up on Group Nine.","David M. Zaslav - Discovery Communications, Inc.","Thanks, Rich. Well, first, I think, ultimately, consumer behavior and consumer consumption is what drives the capitalist market. So you can develop a channel, but you have to create content that people want to get nourished by. So you can sit in a conference room and say what you want to provide people. Ultimately, the consumer is the one that is always the determining winner.","And you look at outside the U.S. \u2013 outside the U.S., there have been very successful skinny bundles. We're on all of them. We have quality content with strong brands that are valued. Our cost of content is relatively low. And we've done extremely well on all of those skinny bundles all over the world, in Latin America, in Eastern Europe and Europe, and each of them have been in the very low price range.","And even when there is sports, sports is just hyper-extended here in the U.S. reflected in regional sports, traditional sports. Retransmission can extend the integration of sports with other channels. And so this is a bit of a stuffed turkey here, and in many ways, when I read about the skinny bundle here in the U.S., I see the skinny bundle in 200 countries. When I look here in the U.S. and I read skinny bundle, there is no skinny bundle here.","Skinny bundle in the U.S. is a fiction. The idea that you have a $40 offering filled with regional sports, sports and all these \u2013 an incomplete package, really, and then you have to buy broadband on top of it, so the skinny bundle is $60 or $70. So it's really not a skinny bundle. It's a bundle. It's a bundle that may be attractive to a small group of people. But, in the end, I think the market will be rationalized.","We represent 12% or 13% of viewership. We have the top channel for women in ID, the number one channel for men in Discovery, top channel in Middle America with TLC, a top channel for African Americans with Oprah and Tyler, and our cost of content is low. We are on DIRECTV NOW. We're on Sony. We're on many of the platforms. But, ultimately, there should be a bundle like everywhere else in the world that's $8, $10, $12. And I believe that will happen.","I think these overstuffed turkeys are going to end up being a challenge from a consumer perspective, and the consumer's going to say, I'd like to have an opportunity here. And in many ways, Netflix is a terrific company, and they continue to be very effective, and so does Amazon, but we as an industry need to complement that with a quality offering that isn't \u2013 that's a true skinny bundle in the spirit of what's working around the world, and I think that'll happen. It's just a question of when.","Richard Greenfield - BTIG LLC","And just wanted to follow up on Group Nine. I think you mentioned 4-plus billion, I lost the exact number, but 4-plus billion views is what you're getting across a variety of online mobile platforms. Is that a business that at that scale is generating profits or is that a business that's still losing money? Or like, is there any way to size kind of the revenues and whether it's profitable or not?","David M. Zaslav - Discovery Communications, Inc.","Well, it's not profitable, but it's pretty close, and our overall approach right now \u2013 it's run by Ben Lerer, who's doing a terrific job there. We put some of our assets into it. When we closed on it, it was $3 billion. Now it's $4.2 billion. We continue to learn about what engages people. We have great analytics. So I think that it helped us lean into our understanding of what kind of content we could provide for Snapchat. It's informing the way we tell stories, the kind of stories.","And so this pivot to mobile is quite important for us. As we look at over $7 billion screens out there, we're the leader in traditional platform on linear around the world, and we own all of our content so we can move a lot of our long-form content. But being able to repackage with The Dodo, we have Animal Planet, which is a leader around the world, and now we have The Dodo, which is the leader now in short-form animal content on the web.","And so being able to own those different areas are critical. We're not focused today on making money. We're focused on learning. We're focused on getting more scale. We're focused on building our relationship with Snapchat, with Facebook, with all of the different outlets out there, and have millennials kind of really get nourished and excited about what we're doing. And in the long term, we're hopeful that they'll be a meaningful currency, and we're actually working with Facebook now on different ways that we can do that, which I think is in both of our interests.","Richard Greenfield - BTIG LLC","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Todd Juenger of Sanford Bernstein. Your line is now open.","Todd Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi, good morning. I'm following along for my colleagues across the various revenue lines. I guess maybe I'll tackle international advertising, if I may, especially since you guys probably have the best view of that of pretty much any company I know. So, I guess I'd frame my question this way. If you think about sort of the run rate that you are at this quarter and have been for a while, and compare that back to the Investor Day, which your expectations, I think, were somewhat higher, trying to figure out like what's caused that delta? How much of it is cyclical? How much of it is structural? How much of it is geopolitical? And are we basically at a new reality now where the run rate we're seeing is kind of the run rate going forward?","And just a quick follow-on related is we've talked about the Olympics in many ways. Nobody's asked yet about Olympics advertising. Again, I don't know what you're prepared to comment on, but it's only a year away for the Winter Games, which is a big geography for you. Any help you can give on advertising perspective, just the magnitude of that box as we're thinking of where the health could be there? Thanks.","David M. Zaslav - Discovery Communications, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, Todd. On the advertising side, look, we \u2013 in Europe, we really haven't gotten help in 11 years. GDP across Europe, if you take out the UK, has been effectively flat, and the advertising follows GDP. So we've been able to grow despite that. But there have been some geopolitical issues. There's no question.","You have the UK down 4% and Brexit has had a meaningful impact on the UK. That's a big market for us. There was a restructure in Russia. We're one of the leading players in Russia. We were the first ones that were brought back. Many of the media companies that want to get into Russia now have to go through our media partnership. But Russia changed because we can only own 20% of it. There are values that we can get outside of the 20%, but things changed there.","So, in mainland Europe, we're doing quite well. We're growing in \u2013 outside of the UK and Asia, we're growing in every market. And Latin America is growing high-single digit now, but it was growing 20%, 30%. So the fact that Brazil kind of tipped and Argentina has struggled for a while, and Mexico is having some challenges is having an impact, but we're still seeing high-single digit growth in Latin America. We're still seeing growth across all of Europe. Some of that has to do with the fact that our share is growing, and our brands are stronger, but we expect that that will continue, and we're used to doing business in a difficult environment.","The other thing that we're seeing is Asia is tough, and it's likely to be tougher. In some ways, we have a smaller business in India, but I'm glad we have a smaller business in India because the demonetization has been a struggle. The recovery from that demonetization has been longer than expected. We got a report out this morning and yesterday from the team over there now. It looks like things are slow and there's a government regulation regime that looks like it may be coming down in India, that's going to put a damper on a lot of the growth that was assumed to be coming out of there. The good news for us is that's going to have a very minimal effect on us.","So I think our positioning of being big Europe, quite strong in Italy and Germany and across all of Europe with real scale, together with strong positioning in Latin America probably puts us in as good of a position as we could be in. I wouldn't want to overweight in Asia right now. And the other Asia issue is just being the potential, and we're looking at doing this, of just jumping right over in many of these markets traditional distribution and going direct-to-consumer, which is what we're looking at doing in a lot of the areas in Asia. We're entrenched in a very good business in Japan, but it's not growing that much, and a lot of other areas of Asia, we're actually going to \u2013 we're going to take all of our IP and we're going direct.","So, I like our combination. It's certainly not robust. I would say steady eddy, and I wouldn't expect that things are going to get much better. I hope we don't have more Brexits. I think the France thing helps us.","Gunnar Wiedenfels - Discovery Communications, Inc.","And Todd, maybe if I can add one point to that discussion, I think if you take a step back, you referred to the 2015 mid-term guidance, right? Yes, advertising has been somewhat slower, affiliate has been slightly stronger, and if you look at the total company guidance, EPS, free cash flow guidance has even been raised after.","Todd Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Fair point. Thanks. Any comment on the Olympics while we're on this or not?","Gunnar Wiedenfels - Discovery Communications, Inc.","Yeah, so as I said before, it's really too early to give you any specific numbers, but I feel very strong about the Olympics deal. We have all kinds of monetization opportunities: sub-licensing, affiliate, advertising. We have complete rights, all platforms. So we'll be able to cover literally every moment of the games on air, online, over-the-top, on-the-go. So I think there's a lot of opportunity for us, but please understand, it's just too early to give you any specific guidance there.","Todd Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Got it. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Vijay Jayant of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","David Joyce - Evercore Group LLC","Thank you. This is David Joyce for Vijay. Could you please help us think about the distribution opportunity internationally? Obviously, you've talked a lot around your over-the-top and direct-to-consumer opportunities, but with the increasing penetration around the globe of the pay TV footprint, how should we think about growth in the different regions? Thank you.","David M. Zaslav - Discovery Communications, Inc.","Sure. What we've seen is, across Europe, we'd expect it to be relatively flat, maybe even slightly We pivoted. We pulled our signal four times in the last 18 months, so most of our growth now is coming from price. We're being helped by sports. In Latin America, a lot of our growth is coming from price, which is really a change. If you look at the last 15 years, the majority of growth in Latin America, in Asia, even in a lot of Europe was really \u2013 the U.S. was increasing price, so you got double dip. You got a higher price and you got more subs during kind of the heyday. Outside the U.S., your price increase came from subscriber growth.","And so, we have had to kind of retrain that market over the last two years by getting our content and our IP more important and by driving for price, and we've been successful with that. In some of the markets, Brazil was growing quite aggressively. In the last 18 months, two years, Brazil has actually lost 2 million subscribers. And so that's a function of the actual economy. The C class had accelerated, and then the disposable income had evaporated, and you actually \u2013 if some of that comes back, which a lot of people are predicting that it will over time, as Argentina's feeling better now, Colombia's feeling better, if Brazil makes the turn, that would be upside for us. We don't have that in our plan. Our plan is that the growth would be coming from primarily price.","David Joyce - Evercore Group LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steven Cahall of Royal Bank of Canada. Your line is now open.","Steven Cahall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yeah. Thank you. Maybe just one on subs and then sorry for another one on the Olympics. Maybe first on the subs, I think in the press release, on domestic subs, you noted a slight decline, and then I thought in the comments, you noted a slight acceleration. So I wonder if you could just give us a little more color as to what you're seeing in the overall pay TV sub picture domestically.","And then on the Olympic side, again, sorry to push you again, I think this is going to be a theme for the next few quarters. But, looking at your filings, I think your President of International had some new targets around the Olympics. When I sort of back into, if he's able to achieve those, it would suggest to me a margin on the Olympics that maybe looks a little bit like that double-digit you talked about for Eurosport before. Is that just getting way too exact way too early on, or is that a reasonable assumption for how to think about the games in 2018?","David M. Zaslav - Discovery Communications, Inc.","Yeah, so look, we're seeing \u2013 what Gunnar said is what we're seeing. We're seeing a slight acceleration on universe decline. We said we were on average about 3%, and for our bigger networks, it's actually less than that, and we have some pretty good protections against that. That's where most of our overwhelming amount of money comes from. Some of the smaller network, we actually saw meaningfully higher. So when you put it altogether, it was about 3%. That's in our plan. So this is not ahead of what our plan was for the year. If there was significant acceleration from that, then that would affect our plan, but we were doing a little bit better than planned last year, and so now we're kind of on it. So that's where we are on that.","One point on the Olympics; the overwhelming majority of the value that we get is kind of what I would call long cycle sub-distribution revenue. We're holding back. In some markets, we're doing all of it. But, in a lot of markets, we're sub-distributing to a free-to-air player. We get guaranteed revenue. We've done that in multiple markets. We then hold back a significant amount of content for Eurosport, which we then sell. We then hold all the rights and we go direct-to-consumer. We could offer it as a whole package. We could do it by sport. But this is \u2013 the overwhelming majority of the dollars is sub-distribution revenue that's more long cycle that we'll be able to give you some visibility on, but we're ahead of plan on the deals that we've been doing.","But it's too early to talk about the actual margins. But it's \u2013 not only do we think that we'll do nicely on it, but it also has helped us in the marketplace. It's helped us in terms of building up our overall distribution revenue. It's helped us in aligning with the federations; it's helped us with the IOC, with additional sports throughout Europe. So it's been a very \u2013 it's been a big positive and we're looking forward to it.","Steven Cahall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Anthony DiClemente of Nomura Instinet. Your line is now open.","Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Instinet","Thanks and good morning. I have two. First, for David, on the Eurosport Player, so David, you mentioned contributions from Eurosport. I mean, I suppose this might be for Gunnar as well. How many subs do you have? You talked last year, I think, about the March 2 (56:43) million subs. Just wondering broadly where we are. You gave us pretty robust growth rates of subs in your prepared remarks. And so what I'm getting to is, how many points of your international distribution growth is coming from the Eurosport Player? So you gave us the number of points from GO in the U.S. Just wondering right now how much of that growth is coming from Eurosport and then what's in your outlook for 2017 and beyond for contribution.","And then, separately for Gunnar, the company struck this streaming joint venture partnership with ProSieben, your alma mater, I suppose. So what are the expectations for that product? You'll be competing with, let's say, Netflix and other subscription OTT services in the German market. Is this kind of ad supported OTT strategy something you think is specific for that market or is it a blueprint that you can potentially replicate in other geographies? Thank you.","David M. Zaslav - Discovery Communications, Inc.","Thanks, Anthony. Look, we're adding a substantial amount of subs. We're doing a better job with churn, but what's most important for us is, directionally, we're figuring out what nourishes an audience, what people are willing to pay for, what excites them about the player, and what kind of a player we need to have a really competitive sports Netflix product to serve the 730 million potential opportunities we have across Europe.","And one of the big learnings we had is our old player was only able to offer all the sports. And so by August of this year, maybe early September, we'll have our BAM, Major League Baseball product, deployed across Europe. That's going to be a huge difference for us, because one of the things we're finding is rather than people paying $8 to get a whole bunch of things, what they really would rather do is do a seasons pass. They'd rather pay $6 and get all the cycling, and then they could hit another button and they can get all the tennis or they can get all of the speed skating, or they can get all of the winter sports, or all the track and field, or all the squash.","And so we've deployed a full team now that's operating out of the UK. This is a team that helped build not just the NFL package here in the U.S. with DIRECTV, but the NBA package. So we've hired a whole different group of people. And we haven't even launched our new player, which we'll be launching in the next couple of months. So are we doing a lot better? Yes. Is our churn doing better? Yes. But most of our success has come from the fact that we're learning that, instead of offering a magazine that offers a little bit of a whole bunch of sports, that we're better off going to these superfan groups.","And over the next year, year and a half, we'll give you significant \u2013 much more information about how we're doing. We first want the player to launch. We'll be offering the Olympics. We'll be offering the Bundesliga. We'll be offering individual sports, which we've already started to do in Northern Europe and in certain markets. And right now, the affiliate growth is not in any meaningful way from the player. And we have a significant amount of cost that we're putting against it, because we've hired a lot of people and we really believe that that sports Netflix product is a game change for us.","Gunnar Wiedenfels - Discovery Communications, Inc.","And Anthony, on that streaming JV, I'm very excited about that deal. I think it's a great JV in itself and it's even more opportunity and optionality for us going forward. So I think there is a desire for people and for consumers in the marketplace to have one destination where they can get most of the stuff they want to consume on an OTT basis, and I think we have done a great step towards that.","ProSieben has an established seven TV platform with a strong installed base already, and we're leveraging that now. And I think there's a lot of optionality going forward. We're open to bringing on other players via broadcasters or some of the networks that are otherwise only available in pay TV. So, you can think about an SVOD option. You can think about integrating the Eurosport Player, et cetera, et cetera. So there's a ton of optionality and I'm very excited about that JV in the German market. And I clearly think that it can be replicated in other markets in Europe and that should be our aspiration as well.","Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Instinet","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's Q&A session. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day."]}}
