Doug will begin the call and then we'll turn the call over to Nick for a review of our financial results before we turn the teleconference over to Q&A.","So, with that, thank you again. And I will now turn the teleconference over to Doug.","Robert Douglas Lawler - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Thank you, Brad, and good morning. Over the past year, we've continued to make significant progress in building a stronger Chesapeake for the future. During our Analyst Day held a few weeks back here in Oklahoma City, we highlighted the strength in our asset base, technology and expertise. To briefly summarize, the financial and operational improvements of the company over the past few years are foundational and differential. We've reduced our total leverage by $10.9 billion, reduced cash cost by roughly 50%, substantially improved capital efficiencies and productivity and materially improved midstream gathering cost, all to build a more competitive, profitable Chesapeake that we forecast in 2018 to achieve free cash flow neutrality and the ability to generate more than $3 billion in EBITDA. All this progress has been made despite depressed commodity prices.","At our Analyst Day, we released significant technical detail regarding the potential of our oil and gas portfolio, notably, the estimated net recoverable resources of 11.3 billion barrels of oil equivalent. We provided a roadmap that highlights the opportunity for profitable and efficient growth through our captured resources over time along with projected financial results through the end of the decade under certain reasonable price assumptions.","I'd like to update you today on a couple of operational results of interests since our Analyst Day. In the Haynesville, we are currently fracking a 10,000-foot lateral well with 50 million pounds of sand, or roughly 5,000 pounds per lateral foot, at ultra-tight cluster spacing. This completion will have the largest number of stages we have ever pumped in the Hayneville in a single well, and the well should be placed to sales in the next few weeks. We are recognizing transformation value improvements in this asset and we look forward to sharing more results of our progress in the Haynesville in the near future.","In the Mid-Continent, we recently introduced a new concept area that we call the Wedge, in which Chesapeake has approximately 870,000 net acres under lease and where we are targeting several oil and gas bearing stack horizons. We have two recent step-out wells in the area that are currently producing 1,000 to 1,400 barrels of oil equivalent per day, 50% to 70% of which is oil from one-mile appraisal wells. We believe the development potential in this area utilizing two-mile laterals is tremendous. We're excited about the potential from these assets and with our other operating areas as we look ahead to 2017.","With an inventory of over 17,000 wells still to be drilled across six major operating areas, with 5,600 of those wells currently having a rate of return greater than 40%, we are confident that the Chesapeake operating machine is stronger today than at any other time in our history.","Turning to the results from the 2016 third quarter. Our total production was 638,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, an increase of over 2% compared to a year ago adjusted for asset sales. In our IR slides we shared this morning, we detailed the production impact of our year-to-date divestitures to demonstrate the strength and resiliency of our production base even after those adjustments.","While total volumes from our divestitures in the Mid-Continent Area, the Barnett and now pending transactions in the Devonian and Haynesville were primarily gas, the full impact of approximately 8,200 barrels of daily oil production divested since the beginning of the year was recognized in the 2016 third quarter. We have already started to replace these oil volumes with new volumes from the Eagle Ford and the Mid-Continent. And our total net oil production for October is projected to be approximately 91,000 barrels of oil per day. With our productivity in capital efficiency improvements and subject to final capital allocation and commodity prices, we currently forecast that we will replace the divested oil volumes in 2017 and begin a strong oil growth trajectory.","In the slides, we also highlight our forecasted production growth over the coming quarters. We are currently projecting an exit-to-exit increase in total production from the fourth quarter of 2016 to the fourth quarter of 2017 of approximately 7% adjusted for asset sales. More importantly, we are projecting an exit-to-exit increase in our oil production from the fourth quarter of 2016 to the fourth quarter of 2017 of 10%.","Looking further forward to 2018, the growth continues even stronger. We previously estimated that our 2018 year-over-year total production growth rate would be in the 10% to 15% range. However, when looking at exit rates from 2017 to 2018, we see a strong trajectory throughout the year. We are currently projecting an increase in our total production from the fourth quarter of 2017 through the fourth quarter of 2018 of approximately 15%, primarily driven by an exit-to-exit increase in our oil production from the fourth quarter of 2017 to the fourth quarter of 2018 of over 20%.","We believe our Eagle Ford and Mid-Continent assets will be driving this growth, and the Powder River Basin will be beginning to accelerate as well. These numbers are a reflection of our capital efficiency, productivity and the power of our portfolio.","Turning to our costs. Operational efficiencies are driving lower production expenses. We see this trend continuing both in the fourth quarter of 2016 and for the full year of 2017. And as a result, we've reduced our production expense guidance for both time periods. We also believe these efficiency-related cost reductions are sustainable beyond 2017.","Our G&A expenses for the 2016 third quarter were up year-over-year due to lower recoveries of G&A expenses due to asset sales and a slight increase in stock-based compensation and compensation related to achieving certain annual performance goals tied to capital efficiency improvements, cash cost reductions and gathering process and transportation expenses.","On the A&D front, we currently have gross proceeds from divestitures either closed or under signed PSA of approximately $1.3 billion in 2016, or about $1 billion net. We are on track to achieve our stated asset divestitures target of more than $2 billion in gross proceeds, all of which should be closed in the first quarter of 2017. We will continue to optimize our portfolio in 2017, accelerating value for our shareholders.","In closing, I am pleased with the significant and foundational progress we have made in reducing our debt, eliminating complexity and lowering our costs. We will continue building on our record of performance and efficiency improvements and we will continue to drive for greater profitability and competitiveness. We remain committed to further improving our balance sheet and we are uniquely positioned to create value for our shareholders through our high-quality assets, our driven, talented employees and a liquidity run rate built out for several years. We are excited about our opportunities and our progress. We have more to do, and the momentum behind Chesapeake Energy will continue to build.","I'll now pass the call to Nick, and then we'll follow up with questions on the call.","Domenic J. Dell\u2019Osso - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Thank you, Doug, and good morning, everyone. Let me start out by saying that this has been an extremely busy quarter as we continue to recapitalize the balance sheet, improve operational efficiencies and flexibility and position the company for profitable and efficient growth. We realize that there have been a tremendous amount of adjustments and moving parts to model recently with a lot of related explanations to cover, all of which highlight very positive trends in our underlying business. I will try to summarize the highlights here today.","While there were several gives and takes this quarter related to LOE, G&A, gathering, processing and transportation and interest expense line items, the primary driver of lower EBITDA compared to what we had expected this quarter was found in our marketing segment, the impact of which was just under $30 million. This is primarily driven by the loss of margin due to the sale and acceleration of value of a long-term gas contract and some out-of-period charges related to assets we are selling in the Barnett and Devonian.","We continue to focus on reducing our cash costs and balance sheet leverage, and we were able to make significant progress in these areas over the past several months. On the operating cost side, we have not only reduced our LOE expenses per unit of production, as Doug mentioned, but we have also achieved significant improvements in our midstream and downstream cost structure going forward. With the closing of the Barnett Shale transaction earlier this week, we are removing a significant amount of gathering, processing and transportation expenses. With 2016 fourth quarter alone, we will be removing two months of GP&T costs, including the minimum volume commitments, totaling approximately $235 million related to the asset.","We also decreased our Mid-Continent gathering fees effective July 1 of this year, and expect the same in our Powder River Basin area effective January 1, 2017. As a result, we anticipate our total gathering, processing and transportation expenses to decrease by roughly 8% in 2017. These changes reduce our commitments and improve the economics of future drilling opportunities, leading to significantly improved operating flexibility as we continue to evaluate our capital allocation in pursuit of the projects that will maximize shareholder value.","On the NGL side of our gathering, processing and treating costs, we have seen an increase this quarter due to higher than expected levels of ethane rejections. This was offset by an increase in the realized prices we received for NGLs as our mix shifted to heavier liquids following our Granite Wash sale earlier this year.","Note in 2017 we are guiding to higher NGL gathering, processing and treating cost due to revised contracts in the Mid-Continent area, where increasing volumes will be gathered under contracts structured with processing fees, allowing us to receive a greater uplift in net NGL revenues. Therefore, we believe we will continue to see improved net NGL revenues that will offset the increase in processing costs.","Our primary financial focus has been the reduction of both our near-term and total debt and improvements to our near-term liquidity. Over the past 12 months, we've been able to reduce our debt maturing or puttable in 2017 through 2019 by $3 billion. In total, we have removed approximately $2.1 billion in principal amount of debt over the past 12 months, making good progress on our longer-term goal of $6 billion to $7 billion in total debt.","As far as extending our maturities, we entered into a $1.5 billion secured five-year term loan facility during the third quarter and used the net proceeds in a tender offer for maturities primarily in the near-to-midterm of our debt maturity stack. Further, in October, we issued $1.25 billion principal amount of unsecured 5.5% convertible senior notes due 2026, which essentially prefunded our remaining 2017 and 2018 maturing and puttable debt. And we have already purchased approximately $100 million of 2017 and 2018 maturities at a discount to make-whole since closing on the convert.","As a result of these steps, we sit with $3.7 billion of liquidity, including approximately of $650 million of cash today after having closed on the Barnett Shale transaction earlier this week. I would note that we have formulaically reduced our availability under our revolver by a little over $200 million as a result of asset sales. As previously noted, our current reserves calculation is well in advance of the levels that support the full $4 billion.","We are currently scheduled to re-determine our borrowing base next summer, but do have the option to request a re-determination sooner. At the moment, we obviously have ample liquidity and do not anticipate our pending assets sales having any further impact on this calculation. Through all of these cost structure improvements, asset sales and balance sheet transactions, we've greatly improved our cash flow profile and have cleared the debt maturity runway, allowing us to focus on our operations instead of our obligations. Additionally, to further improve our capital structure, we exchanged an aggregate of approximately 110 million shares of common stock or approximately $1.2 billion of liquidation value of preferred stock at a discount of approximately 40%.","On the A&D front, we have announced that a PSA has been signed for our Devonian assets, and we intend to buy back the VPP related to that asset when consummated. We believe that cash to the company will be a nominal net positive as a result of these transactions. When these transactions are completed, we will have only one remaining VPP, that one being in Northern Oklahoma.","We've also noted that we are looking to sell approximately 126,000 net acres of our Haynesville position in two separate sales packages. Bids are in for the first package, which has net production of approximately 30 million cubic feet of gas per day. We are pleased with the indications, which we expect to be at a substantial multiple over the EBITDA we projected on the PDP of this asset in 2017 of approximately $15 million. We expect to proceed the execution on the sale with an anticipated close in the first quarter of 2017.","The data room for the second package has just been opened. This package has net production of approximately 45 million cubic feet of gas per day and was expected to contribute about $25 million in EBITDA from those PDP volumes in 2017. Based on the current interest and the need by buyers to digest the recent and upcoming strong well results we continue to see with new wells in the area, we look forward to updating the market on the results of the second package in early 2017.","As noted during our Analyst Day presentation, our 2017 projected production guidance reiterated today has been adjusted for both the expected Devonian and Haynesville divestitures. So, we kept our 2017 projected production guidance the same as previously stated back in August, despite the removal of expected net volumes of about 35 Bcf from these anticipated transactions.","With the continued volatility of both gas and oil prices, we are pleased that our hedge position for both the remainder of 2016 and 2017 is already fairly robust, particularly on the natural gas side. We will continue to monitor market conditions and may increase our positions in both gas and oil at the appropriate times. Our current hedge position is detailed in the slides we posted to our website this morning.","In closing, we are making meaningful strides in our debt reduction efforts and look to continue our progress in this area. We expect more success in the A&D market and expect to be able to discuss these transactions soon. As Doug noted, our production remains strong. When you start to look through 2017 to 2018, our production rate only gets stronger, given our highly efficient capital program in 2017.","That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we'll take our first question from Neal Dingmann with SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hey, sorry about that, Doug. Can you hear me all right?","Robert Douglas Lawler - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","We can.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. Sorry about that. Say, Doug, although not necessarily these ones earlier, could you talk about just any potential near-term and longer-term asset sale candidates?","Robert Douglas Lawler - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Neal, as we've highlighted, the Haynesville is our principal area of focus, if I could point to the huge inventory of resources and the strong assets we've got to drill the locations. We haven't provided any other guidance yet. Although with that significant inventory across our portfolio, you can expect to see additional asset sale candidates potentially from any of the areas in 2017.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","And then just secondly, just on the Eagle Ford, it looks like you continue to make a lot of improvements there. Could you talk a little bit about any upside you might be able to see, let's say, in 2017 from either the efficiencies or lower cost? I was just noticing on this slide that only about 25% has been drilled. So does that mean you can come back and return to existing pads, do improvement there? And do you see lower costs as well?","Robert Douglas Lawler - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Yes, it absolutely does, Neal. That's part of the comp as we have in some of those continued capital efficiencies, operating efficiencies, we see significant potential there. And just as a highlight, too, is many other companies have reported \u2013 remember that Chesapeake's position, we often in many of our pad locations and sections, have just a single well. So it's not like we're coming out with very strong, aggressive downspacing. This is a significant development opportunity essentially from a blank slate with that many opportunities in front of us.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Great. Thanks.","Operator","And our next question comes from David Heikkinen with Heikkinen Energy Advisors.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Good morning, all. You sound remarkably well rested given the amazing end to the World Series last night. I'm just hoping that my energy levels can hold in as well. The question I was thinking about was in the Mid-Con, can you talk about your water volumes on the Wedge wells? Is there any \u2013 trying to get some details on zones. And I know you're not ready to do all that yet, but any indications of additional information would be helpful.","Frank J. Patterson - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Yeah, this is Frank Patterson. Depending on what zone it is, it's less than, say, the Mississippian. But we're still in the early days trying to understand it. So, you've got multiple zones in there. You've got Chester, Meramec, Osage, and each of them are going to react differently. We really haven't got enough data yet to really give you a good feel for what the water cut is, but it looks like it's going to be less than the Mississippian as a whole. They're quite a bit different reservoirs. They're tighter than what the Mississippian play is.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","And then around the Mississippian, what is the current status for water and water disposal and any impact of earthquakes or shut-ins for your assets?","Frank J. Patterson - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Yeah, this is Frank again. We do have volume shut-in. We are in compliance with the OCCs requirements. We are in the process of converting some disposal wells to shallower zones. We're also shutting in wells or managing wells that are higher water cut. If you went to the Investor Conference, with the information we have today, we can actually target lesser water cut wells in our forward program. So it's an all hands on deck manage that process. But what we're seeing today is our volumes are starting to come back with the good work, the field and the teams have done on the technical side.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","How much volume's shut-in?","Frank J. Patterson - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Jason, do you remember how much longer we have shut-in?","Jason M. Pigott - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","I think they've got most of it opened up. With all the recompletions, we've been able to increase our capacity prior to any of the restrictions we had on. So early on, we took a hit on the water volume, but I think we're almost at full capacity right now. So any wells that are shut-in are shut-in just for economics and pricing situations, not due to restrictions from the water.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Your October volumes are like a true number. That's what I was getting at on that question. Thanks, guys.","Robert Douglas Lawler - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from James Sullivan with Alembic Global Advisers.","James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Hey, guys. Good morning. A quick question on the marketing number. Could you just help us a little bit going through the math on that? I know that you've obviously got the forward sale contract, which I think in the report you said was factored into the results. So a little bit of help on the quarterly number. And then I know that the 2017 marketing margin was a little wider than it's been in the past. Is that I assume as well because of the forward sale? So just any help you can give us on that, that would be really great.","Domenic J. Dell\u2019Osso - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Sure, James. You were trailing off a little bit there. So I think I got the gist of the question. If I don't answer it fully, just come back with more. But we did sell a long-term gas supply contract during the quarter. We had announced that previously. That had with it a mark-to-market gain on future periods of $280 million that had been in the asset section of our balance sheet. You can think of that fairly consistent with the way you would account for a hedge, where the future value of that contract was marked each quarter and was in a gain position, so it was an asset. So that came off. It was not included. The removal of that gain was not included in our adjusted earnings.","What we did include was $146 million of actual cash proceeds we received from accelerating the value of that contract to the quarter, again, all received in cash. And we wanted to really highlight that. And so right in the paragraph where we discuss the things that we adjusted out, we highlighted that we included that in. The reason we chose to include it in is that the realized portion of that contract has been in now for several periods in a row, and if you didn't include the acceleration of value anywhere, you would likely have a miss of not seeing that contract trend continue.","So we thought it was important to highlight for investors that that value was accelerated and then came in. And then you should adjust your marketing margin going forward for the fact that we will not see the value of that contract continue to pay out in future periods, as, again, it all accelerated into the third quarter of this year.","I will note that the value of that contract was pretty high on a per-quarter basis in 2016, as basically it was a $4 floor gas delivery contract. And so during the periods in 2017 where gas was very low, the profit on that contract was pretty high. Going into next year, of course, as the strip returned to the neighborhood of $3, the value of that contract would have been coming back in a little. But still, obviously, it was a good contract that we were pleased to accelerate the value of almost $150 million in cash this quarter at a time where we can use it to apply to our balance sheet.","James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Okay. Thank you. That's a very complete answer. I appreciate all that. Just if I could ask for also just a little bit more detail, switching over to the Haynesville here. You guys gave out the two packages that you're working on. I think you gave your anticipated PDP EBITDA. Can you break out just for each of those the acreage number? I know you've given an aggregate acreage number that you're looking to sell, but for the two packages, and I don't know if you want to go into this level of detail, but the acreage number, the slowing production and then just if you could repeat that anticipated EBITDA number, that'd be very helpful.","Domenic J. Dell\u2019Osso - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Yeah, so there's a little more acreage in southern package than there is in the northern package. It's a bit of a mix of \u2013 it's not all core Haynesville acreage. There's a little bit of Bossier acreage in there as well. So we haven't, I don't think, broken out the exact acreage of the north and the south and we'll probably hold off on doing that today. But the southern package has more acreage, less cash flow. Northern package has less acreage, more cash flow is the way to think about those two.","James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Okay. Great. That's very helpful. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Next we will hear from David Tameron with Wells Fargo.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yeah. Good morning. Doug, back to the Haynesville. Can you go through what you said your most recent completion is and how should we think about that as far as what do you need to see additionally from that well in order to justify the higher completion costs?","Robert Douglas Lawler - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Yeah, you bet. Actually, I'm going to have Jason to answer it. This is so cool. You're going to love it.","Jason M. Pigott - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","So this is Jason Pigott. We've got a couple of tests underway right now. We've brought online and announced at our Analyst Day the first 5,000-pound per foot job. But that was on a shorter lateral. So we've got a really good test going on there right now where we've got a 3,000-pound per foot job flowing right beside one of the 5,000-pound per foot jobs. We've kind of tried to manage them and keep them as equal as we can, but the 5,000-pound per foot job is flowing back at, I guess a week later, 17 million cubic feet a day and 7,900 pounds, and the 3,000-pound job, that's 14.5 million cubic feet a day and 7,500 pounds. So we've definitely seen a big gain from going to 5,000-pounds per foot and we're excited about it.","And we've updated our cost. It cost us about, if you extrapolated this to a 10,000-foot well, it's about $600,000 more to go to the \u2013 well, $1.2 million if you go all the way from 3,000 to 5,000 pounds. So it's not a huge incremental investment considering the gain that we see already on the side-to-side test. The record well that we also highlighted with the 50-million pounds has got all of its plugs drilled out and will be coming online Friday. So we're really excited about that. It will be the first 10,000-foot well with this bigger design on it.","And then Doug highlighted in his notes one that tested the limits of even tighter perf clusters was the big job that they're getting ready to do as well. So we've got several exciting tests coming online. We're very encouraged by the incremental performance from the increased sand and perf clusters facing. We've got several other tests with 4,000-pound jobs that kind of split the difference coming up. So, very dynamic program in the Haynesville, but one we're very excited about and it seems that every little bit extra we do to these wells is producing a very positive return to us.","Robert Douglas Lawler - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Yeah. So, hey, David, I might just add to that. So think 4 Bcf in 120 days.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Oh, okay. All right. Yeah. That's a big well. I guess one more just, I'll go with this one. Doug or whoever, when I start thinking about sand, start talking about those volumes of 50,000 pounds, logistically, if that becomes your standard design, how do you manage that from an operational standpoint just getting the sand from wherever it's coming to the well site, and especially when we start thinking about on the development program longer term over the next year to two, how do you manage that?","Robert Douglas Lawler - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Well, I think it's just like any of our operations, there's quite a bit of detail and planning around it. And as you have experienced and seen with Chesapeake in the past, this company is capable of handling significant operations, significant detail complexity in our operations and managing of that as we narrow in on an optimum design, won't be any trouble for us at all.","Keep in mind also that a lot of the cost efficiencies that we have accomplished have been a result of synergies and the number of jobs, the planning and engineering that goes into completing a very high number of stages on a daily basis, which creates significant opportunity for our contractors and service providers. And so we have great relationships there. And their interest in doing work for Chesapeake and being a part of our program is very strong and that helps us on the logistics and planning side as well. I don't know, Jason, do you have, Frank, anything you want to add to that?","Jason M. Pigott - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","I think the big thing for us, though, as we do a lot of work on the pre-planning of these jobs before we even show up on location. For one of these Haynesville 50 million pound job, there's 1,000 trucks full of sand that pull up there. But we did it our first try without a hitch, so it's just something that we do well. We plan ahead. Everybody knows what they're doing. That allows us to get more stages per day done, but also handle logistics as well.","Frank J. Patterson - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Yeah, the other thing I would add \u2013 this is Frank \u2013 is I think there's kind of in your mind maybe thinking about our entire inventory receiving this type of a completion design, but we are designing our completions for the rock type and for the play. So it's working really, really well at high concentrations in the Haynesville. It might work in other plays, but other plays we might have a different recipe. So we're not talking about that type of sand in every single play.","Robert Douglas Lawler - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","I'm going down there in the next couple weeks, David. If you want to go, let me know.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","All right. Sounds good. Yeah, I was just thinking about how many trucks it takes to get in there. But thanks for the color. I appreciate it.","Operator","And we'll take our final question from Jacob Gomolinski with Morgan Stanley.","Jacob Gomolinski-Ekel - Morgan Stanley","Morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question.","Robert Douglas Lawler - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Morning.","Jacob Gomolinski-Ekel - Morgan Stanley","Morning. Thanks. I just had a quick question on the \u2013 just a quick clarification on the $280 million supply contract derivative and the $146 million cash addition. Just trying to get to what is an acceleration versus what would have been in Q3 to get to a run rate EBITDA number. Of that $146 million in cash realized that was added back, what would have been in Q3 on a run-rate basis?","Domenic J. Dell\u2019Osso - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","It had been running in the neighborhood of $15 million to $20 million. I didn't go back and calculate exactly what it would have been just for the quarter if that had stayed in place. Again, it's on a $4 floor, so that would have been I guess a little up Q3 to Q2, so it would have been a little less in Q3.","Jacob Gomolinski-Ekel - Morgan Stanley","Okay. Thanks. And then I think you had said pro forma cash post the Barnett sale was $650 million. I don't know if you're able to do a walk from, there's like the $4 million as of 9\/30, the $900 million from the Analyst Day and the $650 million. If don't know if that's driven by the payment to Williams or if there's something else to go from $900 million to the $650 million.","Domenic J. Dell\u2019Osso - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Yeah, you got it. It's basically the payment to Williams is the big move there. It was $334 million. We had some other cash come through the company and then back out for contracts associated with the Barnett. So fair amount of moving pieces there. The biggest piece is Williams. That's done. The reason to have given that number today is that's done and that's where we sit from a liquidity perspective after all of that.","Jacob Gomolinski-Ekel - Morgan Stanley","Okay. Great. And I just want to make sure I heard correctly.","Domenic J. Dell\u2019Osso - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","One other piece I just want to highlight there \u2013 sorry to butt in. But when you think about reconciling back to the proceeds we received from our convert at the beginning of October, we have already put to work about $100 million of that in open market purchases of 2017 and 2018 notes.","Jacob Gomolinski-Ekel - Morgan Stanley","Right, right. Great. And then just a last question on the Haynesville asset sale. Were you saying that the \u2013 is the initial sale still expected to be before the end of the year, or is that moving into Q1 of next year? And if it is moving into Q1, is that just to give buyers more visibility into the most recent high-intensity well completions?","Domenic J. Dell\u2019Osso - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","We'll have an announcement on the first package before the end of the year. And whether or not it closes before the end of the year is kind of hard to predict as you get into holidays and, frankly, not that meaningful to us. We want to get the deal right and get it papered right. Second deal, like I said, we just opened the data room, and so not sure that we'll be able to announce that before the end of the year. And, again, want to make sure that we have the time for buyers to digest all of the things that Doug and Jason have commented on this morning with respect to the Haynesville and the incredible well performance there. So might stretch that one out a little bit in order to get the right answer.","Jacob Gomolinski-Ekel - Morgan Stanley","Great. Thank you very much.","Robert Douglas Lawler - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Thanks, Jake. Thank you all for joining us today. Please feel free to reach out to Brad. We're happy to share any additional information about our progress and the accomplishments of the company. And that concludes our teleconference. Thank you all for participating.","Operator","And, again, ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our conference for today. We thank you for your participation.

Today's conference call is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Brad Sylvester. Please go ahead.","Bradley D. Sylvester - Vice President-Investor Relations & Communications","Good morning and thank you, everyone, for joining our call today to discuss Chesapeake's financial and operational results for the 2015 full year and fourth quarter. Hopefully, you've had a chance to review our press release and the updated investor presentation that we posted to our website this morning.","During this morning's call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which consist of statements that cannot be confirmed by reference to existing information, including statements regarding our beliefs, goals, expectations, forecasts, projections, and future performance and the assumptions underlying such statements.","Please note that there are a number of factors that will cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements, including the factors identified and discussed in our earnings release today and in other SEC filings. Please recognize that except as required by applicable law, we undertake no duty to update any forward-looking statements. And you should not place any undue reliance on such statements.","With me on the call today are Doug Lawler, our Chief Executive Officer; Nick Dell'Osso, our Chief Financial Officer; Chris Doyle, our Executive Vice President of Operations for the Northern Division; Jason Pigott, our Executive Vice President of Operations for the Southern Division; and Frank Patterson, our Executive Vice President of Exploration.","Doug will begin the call and then turn the call over to Nick for a review of our financial results before we turn the conference over for questions and answers.","So, with that, thank you. And I will now turn the teleconference over to Doug.","Robert Douglas Lawler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Brad, and good morning. I hope you've had the opportunity to review our press release issued earlier this morning. We also have a few slides related to our call, as Brad noted today, that can be found on our website. Despite the challenging commodity market, we made significant progress in 2015. Further details regarding our financial and operating performance can be found in the press release.","For the purpose of this call, I want to focus more specifically on our strategy and plans for 2016. I want to address today the primary issues facing the Corporation and hopefully answer any questions you have about Chesapeake.","To start, I'm very pleased with the meaningful progress in asset sales year to date. We have closed on or have under a purchase and sale agreement approximately $700 million of divestitures. This amount significantly exceeds our prior 2016 first-quarter projection of $200 million to $300 million. The asset sale areas include properties that are covered by three VPPs, or volumetric production payments, and we will use a portion of the proceeds to repurchase these VPPs at favorable prices and further reduce the complexity of our balance sheet.","Net proceeds from these property sales will be approximately $500 million. In addition, we also have line of sight on another $500 million to $1 billion of further asset sales that we expect to close by year-end. Due to the size and diversity of Chesapeake's portfolio, we have received several inbound offers and sales inquiries for smaller, non-core, non-operated properties from strategic buyers. These smaller packages can range anywhere from $10 million to $500 million with limited EBITDA and production.","The interest level in larger $1 billion-plus sized asset sales is very low in the current market. We expect to continue to make progress on several smaller asset divestitures, which when taken together, can add up to meaningful amounts until we can evaluate the possibility of divesting a larger asset. The quality and diversity of our portfolio provide tremendous opportunities to further optimize our current assets and bring additional value forward.","Secondly, we are addressing the operational leverage and commitments we have as a company. In 2015, we were able to renegotiate two gathering agreements with mutually beneficial solutions to Chesapeake and Williams in our Haynesville and dry gas Utica areas. In 2016, we will continue to actively pursue improving our gathering and transportation costs, as demonstrated by two recently signed agreements with other midstream service providers.","These two agreements will enhance our EBITDA by an additional $50 million this year through lower firm transportation volume commitments and lower fees on certain pipelines in our Haynesville, Barnett, and Eagle Ford areas. These achievements were primarily with our midstream partner Energy Transfer and were achieved by awarding additional business for services we need in our core basins at market rates.","We continue to work with all of our midstream partners in each of our major operating areas to find cost-effective, mutually beneficial solutions reflective of the current operating environment. By leveraging Chesapeake's future midstream business opportunities for incremental dedications, for gathering services, processing, fractionation, liquids handling, and marketing, we expect to continue to negotiate improved gathering processing and transportation costs for our company in 2016.","Turning to our cost structure, in 2015, we reduced our production costs on a per barrel of oil equivalent basis by 10% compared to 2014. We also reduced our general and administrative costs per barrel oil equivalent by 24% in 2015, including non-cash stock-based compensation. Our confidence remains very high that we can continue to lower these costs even further in 2016, as we are targeting another 10% reduction in our production costs and a 15% reduction in our G&A costs on a BOE basis.","On an absolute dollar basis, this represents a combined reduction of over $200 million compared to 2015. As we plan for 2016, our current capital program is 50% lower than in 2015 using the midpoint of our guidance. And we will focus on shorter cash cycle projects that generate positive rates of return in today's commodity price environment. The improving quality of our operations, our capital efficiency and lower service costs all give us incrementally positive point forward economics even with today's price deck.","In 2016, we'll be focusing on more completions and less drilling, with our completion dollars representing 70% of our total drilling and completion program. We plan to place 330 to 370 wells on production this year, resulting in a flat to modest decline of 5% compared to 2015, adjusted for asset sales. Commodity prices are front of mind for all of us. So we remain flexible in our capital program depending on prices and market conditions.","And, finally, we've made significant progress since the third quarter of 2015 to reduce our overall debt level by $2.2 billion through an exchange using second lien secured debt in December that also reduced cash interest expense due to redemption of convertible notes in November and through ongoing open market purchases. This is a stunning accomplishment, and it's also no secret that we're looking forward to reducing our debt load even further in 2016.","We expect continued pressure on commodity prices. The current deposition and the high operational leverage associated with our midstream commitments exacerbate the challenge here at Chesapeake. However, we have multiple levers available to us to further strengthen our financial and operational stability and strength.","Liability management initiatives are underway for 2016, asset sales are progressing, and our capital efficiency and cost structure continue to improve. We'll continue to demonstrate our commitment and passion to create value for our shareholders, using all of our available resources in this current market.","I'll now pass the call to Nick, who will share more with you regarding our balance sheet and liquidity.","Domenic J. Dell\u2019Osso - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Doug, and good morning, everyone. I want to start by addressing our strategy in managing our near-term maturities. We made significant progress in 2015 to reduce our overall debt level by $2.2 billion, primarily through an exchange using second lien secured debt in December but also reduced our cash interest expense.","However, there is much more work to do. The primary focus for Chesapeake is the reduction or removal of our 2017 and 2018 debt maturities. We are pursuing several avenues to reduce these obligations, including the use of additional secured debt, private negotiations with bondholders and other types of exchange and tender offers. We will continue to be active in the market to exchange or repurchase our debt and reduce these principal balances even further.","Turning to our liquidity. Our undrawn revolving credit facility has just under $4 billion of availability to us, with about $92 million of LCs and collateral posted. We went back to a secured facility in late September, with our oil and gas assets acting as the collateral for the credit facility lenders.","However, there were unencumbered assets and assets that have been pledged to our collateralized hedge facility properties that were not pledged to the credit facility lenders. As of this month, our collateralized hedge facility has been terminated, which gives us more flexibility, as we move into the spring redetermination season.","If necessary, we can pledge our unencumbered assets and assets previously pledged to the hedge facility to be used as collateral for the credit facility lenders in April. As a result, we feel good about our ability to maintain robust liquidity through the upcoming borrowing base, despite the significant drop in commodity price strips.","We expect to end the month of February with approximately $300 million in cash on hand, which reflects having already used approximately $230 million of cash to retire bonds due March 15 at an average price below $95.","This cash balance also reflects only $135 million of the approximately $700 million of asset sales Doug referred to in his comments that have already closed, the remainder of sales for which we have signed purchase and sales agreements and expect to close between now and end of the second quarter.","Along with these pending sales, we will repurchase three of the company's previously sold volumetric production payments, our VPPs 2, 3 and 10 for approximately $200 million. The total projected net impact of these expected sales after purchasing the VPPs will be a reduction of approximately 25,000 barrels a day of equivalent production, which has been adjusted in our outlook provided this morning.","We are pursuing additional asset sales targeted at $500 million to $1 billion of proceeds in 2016 to further improve our near-term liquidity. I look forward to updating you on our asset sales progress throughout the coming months. As you have seen in our press release, we have broken out our gathering, processing and transportation charges in a line item in the income statement to provide greater transparency into these costs.","Previously, these were reported as deductions to oil and natural gas and NGL revenues. We continue to work to further reduce these costs and expect to optimize additional gathering, processing and transportation agreements in 2016.","As Doug noted in his comments, we're proud to announce that we recently completed an agreement to reduce our Haynesville transportation volume commitment and fees, primarily on Energy Transfer's Tiger Pipeline, to better align with our volume profile, resulting in a $0.06 per Mcf reduction in our total company gas gathering transportation costs in 2016.","To further maximize our cash flow in 2016 and provide additional protection against even lower commodity prices, we have hedged over half of our projected natural gas production at approximately $2.84 per Mcf and over half of our projected oil at approximately $47.74 per barrel.","So to close, we have a lot of work to do to execute our strategy. We will rely on our extremely talented workforce, outstanding portfolio of oil and gas assets, and strong partner relationships to attack our challenges. Based on these strengths, we believe we can continue to adjust our business to reflect the new operating environment as a result of lower prices and return to significant profitability as a highly efficient developer of high-quality unconventional U.S. oil and gas assets. We appreciate your time today. That concludes my comments and I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We'll take our first question from Neal Dingmann with SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Morning, guys. Say, Doug, just a sort of, philosophical question, how do you guys think \u2013 obviously you've laid out the plan on your CapEx, so I'm just kind of wondering, when you think about bond repurchasing and some other finances in that respect versus drilling dollars, how do y'all think about that this year and going forward?","Robert Douglas Lawler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Neal. Thank you for the question. The discounts that we recognize today for open market purchases are very, very attractive. And so what you can expect is we will continue to look for opportunities to buy back in that debt at a discount. And that has been taking place and we will continue to look for those opportunities for those near-term maturities.","And we'll weigh that very closely against the opportunities to invest in our portfolio; very mindful of the current pricing environment and mindful of getting the best return for our shareholders. So that balance is ongoing on a daily basis and right now we see a lot of opportunity in trying to pull in some of that debt at the discounts that we recognize.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","All right. Then just maybe quick question for Nick. Nick, if you could just further talk a little bit about the credit redetermination \u2013 you mentioned about the collateralized hedges gone. Your thoughts about as you come into April, any concern about the redetermination or just anything more you can say about that?","Domenic J. Dell\u2019Osso - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, the process will be completed in April. We stay in regular communication with the bank group. We understand where they are on prices today; they very closely match the strip. We can run that through our models ourselves. No ability to be precise about where things will land, but we feel good about our ability to get through the redetermination season with a really strong credit facility.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Got it. And then the last question, just maybe an ops question, Doug, for you or obviously for Chris or Jason. To me, those STACK results looked as good as we've seen by anybody out there, and I know you mentioned in the release that you plan to operate up to three rigs in the area. Just your thoughts, any of those assets on the block to potentially sell? Or now given the results you're seeing in there, is that going to continue to be one of your larger growth areas?","Robert Douglas Lawler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure, Neal. I'm very excited about what we see in the STACK. I continue to say that our Mid-Continent area is one of the most undervalued assets in our portfolio. I've been super pleased with the recent performance that we've seen there and I think \u2013 like you said, I think we have an excellent position. We will be very closely monitoring our capital program; that is a extremely competitive area at these low prices. But also mindful, if we can accelerate value to our shareholders, we will consider that. So at this point in time, we do not have any intention of selling that area, but it doesn't mean that we wouldn't if we couldn't capture an excellent value for the company.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. Thank you, all. Excellent quarter.","Robert Douglas Lawler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from David Tameron with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. David, please check the mute function on your phone.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Sorry about that. Haven't been doing this long enough to realize you have to press the mute button. Doug, as I think about the credit restructuring news that came out, can you give us any color as far as timing or when you'd want that to be resolved by? Can you give us anything around that?","Robert Douglas Lawler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I'm sorry, Dave \u2013 you're saying the credit restructuring is \u2013 what are you asking about there?","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Just the news that you had hired somebody to restructure the debt and some of that news that came out a couple weeks ago.","Robert Douglas Lawler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure, Dave. Look, this is a pretty challenging time in the market and we had hired Evercore to help us out with our exchange back in December. That news was released and generated some headlines. We also have brought in counsel that's pretty adept at debt exchanges and other more complicated transactions around balance sheet restructurings like this, where there are restructurings. And that context to me can mean a lot of things and debt exchanges are much more complicated than your regular way transactions.","And it makes a lot of sense to have counsel around that works on these types of things on a regular basis. And is very, very helpful in navigating all the things that need to be considered when going through this type of an effort. We have debt securities that trade at a significant discount. There is real opportunity in that and we are going to continue to think through the various avenues the Company can take to deal with the near-term maturities we have, try to capture some of that discount that's there, and position the Company for better success in years to come.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Now, let me ask, going forward, if I think about the rig activity level coming down, I guess four to seven is kind of what you put in the press release as far as 2016. How should we think about the ability to ramp on the backend?","Is the goal still, Doug, to stay within cash flow? Let's say we get through the summer season, gas prices firm up a little bit. Are you still thinking about staying with the cash flow of 2017 and how quickly could you step on the pedal if need be on the backend?","Robert Douglas Lawler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. The plan there as we look forward to 2017, Dave, is just to continue to be very, very prudent in our capital expenditures, mindful of the opportunities to purchase the debt at a discount. I will tell you that inside of Chesapeake, there is a remarkable air force ready to take flight if we decide to ramp up our drilling activity.","That said, we just have to be very mindful of the balance sheet. We have to be very mindful of our cash flow. And its \u2013 I'm not in any way concerned about the company's ability to ramp up and deliver the efficiencies that we've recognized across the portfolio \u2013 the operating synergies, capital efficiencies, the recoveries that we see, productivity on a per well basis.","Our asset position and opportunity to drive value very quick there I think is as good or better than anyone in the industry. But that all has to be tempered with we have to be very mindful of our financial position and make sure that we're making the best investment across the portfolio, which could include still working on the balance sheet.","So no commitment on how we will respond in 2017 at this point in time with higher prices, but definitely want to be as balanced as we possibly can be, using asset sales as a measure to help with that activity and as a measure to help buy down debt at a discount.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. I appreciate the answers. I'll let somebody else jump on.","Robert Douglas Lawler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks Dave.","Operator","Our next question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","John H. Abbott - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning. This is John Abbott. I'm calling in for Doug Leggate. Just really quickly, with regards to your asset sales, could you provide some color as far as production that you're sort of thinking about potentially selling with those assets?","And then secondly, you did provide a relatively wide range for CapEx in 2016. How should we think about your activity levels in relation to commodity prices? Thank you.","Domenic J. Dell\u2019Osso - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. I'll take the asset sales question and then I think Doug has something he wants to say on CapEx. But on asset sales, like I said, our outlook has been adjusted for the impact of the asset sales under purchase and sale agreement of about 26,000 barrels a day. So, that's already included in our guidance.","As to additional assets that we may sell, I'll stay away from production guidance at this point, but just remind you that we're looking for things that will be accretive to our situation.","So, we're looking to sell assets that are going to have an amount of cash flow with them to make them attractive to a buyer and yet, not fundamentally change our position relative to the cash proceeds we get versus what we sell.","So, it depends on proceeds we get and how things go; that's obviously \u2013 those are obviously transactions that are in negotiations and there's several of them that could combine to be in that range.","Robert Douglas Lawler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And John, just on the CapEx question, just a little more color there. So, the range that we provide is $1.3 billion to $1.8 billion, inclusive of our capitalized interest. And our drilling and completion program that we have a wide range on it and the purpose for that is to account for flexibility in the program.","We also know that our teams will continue to do a very good job in capturing all the synergies and cost \u2013 capital cost savings possible. And so, we have that range on there. Obviously, as prices stay at lower levels, we'll be pushing for the low end of that, but we have some flexibility as well depending on what our best investment may be, whether that be repurchasing debt or investing in our program. So, we've specifically had a wide range to account for flexibility going forward in the year.","John H. Abbott - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I appreciate it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice. Please go ahead.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Yes, good morning to everyone there. I wonder \u2013 you guys mentioned in your press release about bringing on some curtailed volumes in 4Q. But I'm wondering if you could give us a little bit more detail on whether you brought back all your curtailed volumes and whether you anticipate \u2013 or what conditions under which you'd anticipate curtailing volumes in 2016, if that's even a possibility.","Christopher M. Doyle - Senior Vice President-Northern Division Operations","Charles, this is Chris. We did \u2013 the curtailed volumes that we brought on were primarily out of the Utica that led to the big bump in Utica production quarter-over-quarter. We did bring on all of those volumes. We're currently producing about 1.1 Bcf a day out of that asset, gross, and that's full bore.","We're seeing some good cash realizations \u2013 not fantastic, good. And \u2013 but we'll \u2013 it's something we look at daily and we'll adjust accordingly. We have also brought on some curtailed volumes in the Marcellus. We probably entered the quarter with about 500 million a day behind choke. We bumped that to over 2 Bcf towards the end of the year and currently sit just shy of 2.2 Bcf. Again, good cash realizations. But a daily conversation will occur and we'll adjust accordingly.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Thank you for the detail, Chris. Just so make sure I understood, so if you were at 500 million curtailed year-end, now you think you are down to around 300 million in the Marcellus?","Christopher M. Doyle - Senior Vice President-Northern Division Operations","Yes, probably 200 million to 300 million.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Okay, that's great. And then Doug, if I could just go back to that last question you fielded and get you to elaborate a little bit more on that range for the CapEx. If I understood you correctly, you've identified two things that could swing that. One would be commodity prices and the second would be your appetite for deploying dollars into debt buybacks versus the \u2013 versus your E&P program. Is there also an aspect that you would swing \u2013 you would move around in that range based on these asset sales? Can you just \u2013 I know there's multiple dimensions here, but I just want to get a feel for what the big levers are in your mind.","Robert Douglas Lawler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","That's a possibility, Charles. That's not something that we're targeting at this point in time, so we continue to \u2013 we'll be evaluating each of those opportunities as we progress through the year. Prices will dictate a lot and the efficiency of the program and opportunities for where we can get the best return to improve the company for the long haul. So everything we're doing is focused on strengthening the company from a financial standpoint for the longer term. And those decisions that we make will be focused on that.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Okay. That's helpful. Thanks, Doug.","Robert Douglas Lawler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks Charles.","Operator","Next question comes from Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning. Nick, I wanted to ask you a little bit more details around the spring redetermination. Borrowing base stands at $4 billion. Some of the headlines that we've read suggests that there may be 15% to 20% industry-wide declines in terms of borrowing basis. I was wondering if you could maybe comment on \u2013 you talked about pledging some unencumbered assets. What kind of a tailwind could that provide in the spring period? Just order of magnitude?","Domenic J. Dell\u2019Osso - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","It's pretty significant, Arun. We had \u2013 and again, this would be \u2013 I'll preface it by saying we are \u2013 we have the ability to do that if we need to and we have to get through where the price decks are and see where the banks come out on collateral.","It's a calculation that's somewhat negotiated between companies and their bank group as they look at their reserves. They look at where their capital budgets are. They look at all the various factors. So we will continue to work with our bank group and determine the best answer as to whether or not we want to pledge additional reserves there, need to, et cetera to get the borrowing base where we think it should be.","But I feel really good about our ability to maintain a very robust borrowing base. It's impossible for me to say at this point that it will remain exactly at 4 billion, but there's a lot of moving pieces to it. And we have a lot of collateral to move around to support that calculation if we need to or want to.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And just a quick follow-up on that, Nick, obviously you've had discussions with the banks, would you say that the current focus is on additional covenant tweaks or more just on that total commitment amount?","Domenic J. Dell\u2019Osso - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, we may ask for additional covenant tweaks ourselves, but banks don't really have an opportunity to ask us for that unless we haven't asked (27:16) of them, right? So we'll see how the year goes. We'll see what we decide we want to do and how we decide we want to do things. But as far as a redetermination goes, it's a process that if we just go through the process and have the collateral we need, the banks really don't have an opportunity to ask us for anything in that process.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks for clarifying that. My final question really regards the minimum volume commitments on the midstream. Doug, you mentioned that there's some levers that CHK could pull in this process. I was wondering if \u2013 I'm interested to understand if Chesapeake could, call it, normalize some of the midstream commitments through, call it, industry standards. What kind of, cash flow or cost benefit could you see on an annualized basis? So what is the prize, if you are to successfully renegotiate these contracts on an annualized basis?","Robert Douglas Lawler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","It's a great question, Arun. It's very large. Substantial opportunity exists there, and either through negotiating directly with our midstream partners, where we have good relationships, or through the award of additional business \u2013 negotiating contract extensions through awarding additional business that we have that's a part of our normal program, we see significant opportunity there. And we are pursuing it aggressively.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. So I take this to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars kind of, range? I know it's probably hard for you to give us an exact number.","Robert Douglas Lawler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","That's correct. That is absolutely right, Arun.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Robert Douglas Lawler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","All right. I think that concludes the prepared remarks, we want to have today. We thank you for joining us and please feel free to reach out to Brad with any questions that you might have. That concludes our conference call. Thank you, operator. Thank you, everyone.","Operator","And this does conclude today's program. Thanks for your participation. You may now disconnect.

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Brad Sylvester. Please go ahead, sir.","Brad Sylvester - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today to discuss Chesapeake's financial and operational results for the 2018 second quarter. Hopefully, you've had a chance to review our press release and the updated investor slides that we posted to our website this morning.","During this morning's call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which consist of statements that cannot be confirmed by reference to existing information, including statements regarding our beliefs, goals, expectations, forecasts, projections and future performance, and the assumptions underlying such statements. Please note that there are a number of factors that will cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements, including the factors identified and discussed in our earnings release today and in other SEC filings. Please recognize that except as required by applicable law, we undertake no duty to update any forward-looking statements, and you should not place undue reliance on such statements.","We may also refer to some non-GAAP financial measures, which may help facilitate comparisons across periods and with peers. For any non-GAAP measures we use, a reconciliation to the nearest corresponding GAAP measure can be found on our website and in our earnings release.","With me on that call today are, Doug Lawler, Nick Dell'Osso, Frank Patterson and Jason Pigott. Doug will begin the call and then turn the call over to Nick for a review for our financial results before we turn the teleconference over to Q&A.","So, with that, thank you. And I will now turn the teleconference over to Doug.","Robert Douglas Lawler - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Thanks, Brad, and good morning, everyone. Chesapeake continued to build upon the transformational momentum established over the last several years through consistent operational and financial improvement. The announcement of our Utica divestiture is yet another step that demonstrates our commitment to achieve and sustain top-quartile performance amongst our peers.","The enterprise strength of Chesapeake Energy comes from our strong diverse portfolio of assets and our solution-minded employees, each providing optionality and opportunities for greater shareholder value. We have fundamentally transformed all aspects of the company in the last five years. With closure of the Utica transaction, we'll have eliminated $12.2 billion in total leverage, lowered our annual gathering, processing and transportation expense by approximately $900 million, while raising over $10.3 billion in additional midstream and downstream commitments. We've reduced our CapEx cumulatively by more than $12 billion, while keeping adjusted production relatively flat, and removed over $1 billion of annual cash costs.","Importantly, we have done all of these while delivering record environmental health, safety and regulatory performance. Simply put, we have accomplished differential performance improvements during the challenged commodity price environment. As noted previously, our sequential and successive improvements have yet to be materially recognized by Chesapeake's common equity holder. I believe we are positioned today with continued progress to deliver that differential value growth to our common equity holders. We recorded another solid quarter, our fourth in a row, growing adjusted production year over year and increasing cash flow and operating margins per barrel of oil equivalent.","For the 2018 second quarter, we posted total production growth of 8% year over year, after adjusting for asset sales, which is roughly 38,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Importantly, we grew our oil volumes 11% adjusted for asset sales, contributing to the increase in our full-year oil production guidance of 500,000 barrels. We attained a 47% increase in our cash flow before working capital changes compared to last year, while growing our adjusted EBITDA per barrel by 16%. This is higher than the percentage increase in oil and gas revenues per boe. So, we continue to create additional margin beyond that which was afforded by the move in oil and NGL prices.","As announced last Thursday, approximately $2 billion of proceeds from our Utica sale will go directly to debt reduction, further strengthening our balance sheet and improving our profitability by eliminating up to $150 million in annual cash interest expense. In addition, the transaction greatly improves our gathering, processing and transportation expenses, yielding a $0.50 per boe improvement driven by removing approximately $450 million in projected 2019 GP&T expense and a total of $2.4 billion of future midstream and downstream commitments. Additionally, assuming flat 2018 commodity prices, we anticipate our divestiture of the Utica Shale will increase EBITDA by approximately $0.70 per boe in 2019.","As also noted in our Utica divestiture release last week, this transaction marks the conclusion of Chesapeake's strategy of asset sales being the primary driver of debt reduction. That strategy was necessary given the debt profile of the company. Going forward, organic production growth, exploration, strategic acquisitions and portfolio management will drive us to achieve our ultimate goal of improving our leverage ratio to 2 times net debt to EBITDA.","We also shared last week that we expect our diverse portfolio to deliver 10% adjusted oil production growth in 2019 and additional growth is anticipated for 2020. Notably, with that oil growth, we project that we can organically replace the EBITDA loss in the Utica transaction within a year through the production ramp we are expecting principally driven from our Powder River Basin asset. We believe the production growth and trajectory of the Powder River Basin is now fully evident. Thanks to optimized completions and customized facility design, we recently reached net production of 32,000 barrel oil equivalent per day. And while we currently anticipate our production will reach 38,000 barrel oil equivalent per day by year end, we've already increased our net oil production in the Powder River Basin by 90% year to date, with additional growth that will come from a further 28 turn-in-lines anticipated for the remainder of the year.","From a cash flow perspective, I'm especially pleased that we have been able to reduce our costs and cycle times, as drilling times on three recent Turner wells are less than 20 days from spud to rig release and total cycle times are now in the 90-day range. While the Turner continues to drive our Powder program, we anticipate moving to other zones in 2019, another benefit to our acreage unique hotspot advantage. Oil production from the Powder River Basin is expected to increase by 100% in 2019. And depending on oil price movement, we're considering adding a sixth rig in 2019 to attack those opportunities.","While we are pleased with the progress in the Powder recognized this year, it's not the only asset that has seen significant performance improvement. The South Texas team continues to demonstrate improved capital efficiency, driving costs out of the operation and turning an asset which was cash flow negative even at $100 per barrel as recently as 2014 into one expected to generate approximately $475 million in free cash flow this year. While South Texas will continue to deliver low-cost, high-margin barrels, the team is also excited to implement our first improved oil recovery project in 2019 and begin development in the Austin Chalk and Upper Eagle Ford, two horizons which we believe can provide additional growth opportunities.","Chesapeake continues to produce oil efficient growth from the Mid-Continent, or volumes from the Mid-Continent, and we're attempting to reinvent this legacy asset in our portfolio. In many ways, as we work to appraise liquid-rich opportunities across six Mid-Continent formations, our technical team sees parallels to the Powder River Basin from a few years ago. Meanwhile, our Oswego volumes continued to climb with average 30-day production rates of 1,015 barrels of oil equivalent per day with over 80% oil cuts, delivering a 50% rate of return.","With the pending sale of the Utica, our gas assets are now even more competitive. Perhaps, nowhere in Chesapeake's portfolio has our drilling and completions excellence yielded greater results than in our Gulf Coast asset. While we are pleased with our progress, we continue to push for greater results driving innovation and operational excellence to unlock additional value. This starts with our drilling program. We successfully drilled the first 15,000-foot lateral ever drilled in the basin, helping us grow 2018 second quarter production by approximately 15% year over year with the exact same number of rigs.","We are repeating that same success in Pennsylvania, where we believe enhanced completions and longer laterals have begun to scratch the surface of unlocking greater value from both the Lower and Upper Marcellus formations and eventually, the deeper Utica formation. We have just drilled the longest lateral to-date in the Lower Marcellus at approximately 13,380 feet and are drilling an even longer planned lateral of approximately 14,500 feet. We expect to place both wells on production before year end 2018.","In total, we anticipate the Marcellus will generate approximately $300 million in free cash flow in 2018 as the asset continues to define capital efficiency. I continue to be extremely confident in our future, thanks to our improved balance sheet, higher profitability and simpler overall path to creating shareholder value. We have emerged from our transformation stronger than at any point in our history. We expect to further build on our performance track record in the months and quarters ahead as we continue our relentless drive to achieve our strategic objectives of 2 times net debt to EBITDA, enhanced margins and reaching cash flow neutrality.","As I've previously stated, I'm very pleased with our progress and we look forward to driving differential shareholder value from our high-quality assets. Please go to our website and access our updated asset slide deck for additional detail regarding our operating performance.","We now want to take a few minutes to share more information regarding the balance sheet and our plan of action with the proceeds from the Utica divestiture.","[0B432N-E Nick Dell'Osso]","Thank you, Doug, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased with our results this quarter as we continue to see the benefits of our improved cost structure, realized prices and improved asset portfolio profile. This morning, I'd like to focus my comments on the recently announced Utica sale transaction and the positive impact we expect on our balance sheet as we move toward closing on the deal.","We expect our proceeds at closing to approximate $2 billion in cash before effective date adjustments. And we intend to use the proceeds to retire outstanding debt and intend to focus on our secured debt. A 1.5 lien term loan becomes callable this month at a price of $104.25 and our second lien notes become callable at $104 in December.","Additionally, in May, we purchased existing overriding royalty interest on our Utica-operated wells, as well as our obligation to deliver future overriding royalty interest in the Utica from third parties. The value of the producing overrides of $77 million was passed directly through to the buyer and the purchase, while the retirement of the future liability for $122 million resulted in a decrease of current and long-term liabilities on our balance sheet of $183 million. So, we retired it at a discount of $61 million.","This anticipated decrease in secured debt and liabilities is a significant improvement to the overall capital structure and will result in a meaningfully reduced interest expense drag on our cash flow of up to $150 million per year as we move toward achieving a sustainable free cash flow profile.","We've also begun working with our bank group to renew our revolving credit facility that would otherwise mature in 2019. As we noted in our release last week, excluding our Utica properties, we have in excess of $7 billion collateral available for the borrowing base, and we expect to successfully close on a new facility during the third quarter.","Lastly, we will likely look to access the high-yield market to opportunistically refinance any remaining secured debt and other near-term maturities in the second half of the year, provided market conditions remain attractive to do so. At that point, we believe we will have reduced our total outstanding debt and interest burden materially, renewed our access to liquidity and meaningfully increased the average tenor of our remaining outstanding debt. This will be a fundamental shift in the financial risk of our company.","We will remain focused on the goal of improving our leverage ratio to 2 times debt-to EBITDA that will pivot our strategy to reach that goal by being more growth-oriented. While we will still actively manage our portfolio, and we will likely sell some amount of assets every year with proceeds available to further reduce debt, asset sales will no longer be our primary financial strategy. We look forward to continuing to deliver operational results similar to this quarter with increasing oil volumes and cash flow into next year that will drive significantly increased shareholder value with substantially reduced financial risk.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. At this time, we will start the question-and answer-session. We shall take our first question from Neal Dingmann of SunTrust. Please go ahead, sir.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Good morning, guys. Nice details. Doug, my first questions for on the PRB. You obviously have seen some recent success, I guess a question for you or Frank, the recent success you've seen in the down-spacing, your thoughts as you progress forward, is that something you'll do in other areas there or maybe just talk about the spacing in general on the play.","Frank J. Patterson - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Good morning, Neal. This is Frank Patterson. Yeah. We are in the midst of a six-well down-spacing test. We've talked about it. We now have 100 days of performance. We actually put a slide in the deck to kind of give you an update on that. What we're seeing, it's early, is really no effect to down-spacing to 1980 feet. If we are able to down-space to 1980 feet with confidence across the field, that would give us probably another 80 wells plus. So that's pretty powerful. We've already run spacing tests in the Niobrara and we have a pretty good feel for what the Parkman is going to look like and the Sussex. So, once we get this information, we'll be able to develop the field and then the proper spacing from the onset and that will allow us to create a lot of synergies off of pads. We'll have a significant number of multi-well pads across the field.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Certainly sounds encouraging. And just one last follow-up (00:15:25) for Nick or Doug. Just on CapEx, a question overall, that overall CapEx was about $2.3 billion. What does that include for the Utica? I guess, does that include bringing a couple of those Utica rigs back or how much of that is going to be factored into that overall CapEx? And maybe Doug, just aside (00:15:42) on that, maybe just talk about free cash flow, how you guys, you or Nick, sort of see that going forward.","Domenic J. Dell\u2019Osso - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Sure, Neal. This is Nick. I'll answer that. So, the CapEx, we increased our range last week. Keep in mind that we are now running five rigs in the Powder, and based on the success we've seen this year, we're really pleased with that level. It's generating great cash flow growth and will be the driver of our cash flow growth in 2019 versus 2018 as we have a pretty significant turn-in-line program in the second half of this year. When we originally put our budget together, we had three rigs in the Powder.","So, our outlook \u2013 initial outlook was based on lower activity there. We have shifted some dollars around, so that's not all, just a net add from the Powder. We've pulled some activity down in other places and just generally been able to optimize moving some dollars around, really largely based on the efficiencies we've seen working faster in each of our plays and we continue to see that in the Powder as well. It's a theme across the portfolio. We're getting more done every day in the field with the same dollars. And that's been a big help to the growth profile.","As we look at the Utica, though, we did add some dollars back into our program. This summer, we had front-end loaded our drilling program in the southern portion of our Appalachian region. Remember, we think of our Appalachian region historically as being both the Utica and the Marcellus. So, we had rigs in Ohio in the first half of the year. We had planned to move those rigs to Pennsylvania in the second half of the year, with frac crews then filling out in Ohio behind them. They were actually going to finish up during this quarter. So, what we've done now is we've shifted. We have rigs staying in Ohio through the closing of the transaction, and then they'll stay there post the closing of the transaction. We'll operate them under a transition services agreement. But as soon as the transaction closes, the CapEx moves off of our books and on to the buyer. So, there is some there for the transaction. There's a good bit of it is just overall activity, accelerated activity in the Powder. And again, you see it in our results, our growth rates are showing the benefit out of it.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks, guys.","Robert Douglas Lawler - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Neal, I'm going to just add \u2013 just if you don't mind, I'll interject with the last comment around the free cash flow. Just to remind you that each of the assets, with the exception of the Powder River Basin, are free cash flow positive today. We anticipate in 2019 with the increased oil production there and the efficiencies we're seeing that the Powder River will be close to free cash flow positive and the team's targeting to achieve that. And so the assets are performing outstanding. And then, as we just look at the larger balance sheet and how we continue to attack that through further growth, exploration and acquisition opportunities is how we'll continue to further delever.","And I'll build on that just one step further as well, Neal, which is that as we think about being free cash flow positive, it has to be at a sustainable level of cash flow. And post the sale, what we've said is that we will replace the EBITDA from the sale within a year. So that will certainly put a little bit of pressure on being free cash flow positive in 2019, but we're doing so with a significantly reduced balance sheet and then as we replace that cash flow, it becomes a place where you see the leverage start to move lower very quickly. So we could be free cash flow positive anytime we choose, right? You can just drop your CapEx, but it's got to be at a sustainable level and one in which we know from that point forward, we can add shareholder value every day, while maintaining that free cash flow profile.","We're pretty close. We're going to get there very soon. And we're going to now do it with a lot less leverage. So it all feels pretty good to us.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Yeah. That makes sense. Thanks for the additional details.","Operator","We shall take our next question from Charles Meade of Johnson Rice. Please go ahead.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Good morning, Doug and Nick and to the whole team there.","Robert Douglas Lawler - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Good morning, Charles.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Thank you. Your last comments have actually really teed up, I guess, the question I wanted to ask well and it's that you made this comment about the asset sales being no longer the primary way of deleveraging. And I wonder if you can talk about 2019 and what the broad parameters of how that is going to look. I think, Nick, you were just alluding to it a bit. It sounds like you guys are planning to stop the outspending versus cash flow and now spend within cash flow. And is that the right read on 2019? And what's the kind of commodity price at which we should think about that being a valid read? And how are you \u2013 I know it's early, but how are you projecting oil volumes to grow and your overall volumes to grow?","Robert Douglas Lawler - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Sure, Charles. We're happy to provide a little more clarity with that. And as we've stated, we anticipate our 2019 oil volumes to grow by 10% and this recognition of our ability with the remaining assets post Utica divestiture of being able to replace that EBITDA within a year speaks to the capital efficiency and the cash flow generating capability of our assets.","As we look forward to 2019, the reduction in our interest expense, it will help us as we pay down some of our debt. But we anticipate that that free cash flow neutrality is \u2013 as a primary target will be something that we have to continue to look at. And as Nick noted, in 2019, we aren't forecasting any major asset sales. But through our own operations from our existing assets, we expect that production growth will help us in reducing any outspend.","Nick's point on the sustainable free cash flow at this point and you look to 2019, we will accomplish that principally through our organic production growth, but we will also have and continue to look at smaller asset sales and other opportunities for us to generate cash.","What we're excited about is that, as I noted, each of the assets are free cash flow positive today, with the exception of the Powder, and the oil's growth, strength there, we clearly will achieve that in 2020, but targeting with the team to try to achieve that in 2019.","So, our objective to be free cash flow positive is very strong. And from an operating cash flow basis, we're there. When you look at all the other corporate liabilities that we have, we're making excellent progress on that and expect to share good results with you as we progress.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Got it. Thank you, Doug. It kind of seems like a phase change taking place for you, guys. But picking up and maybe going a step further there, you've mentioned acquisitions a couple of times, and that seems like a really intriguing possibility for you guys, especially since there is a lot of \u2013 it seems like there's a lot of assets for sale in the marketplace. But you also mentioned deleveraging through acquisitions. Should we interpret that as meaning that that equity is one of the currencies that's on the table for acquisitions and could you give us an idea, are you just looking at kind of small tuck-ins on existing plays or is it really kind of wide open on the field for you, guys?","Domenic J. Dell\u2019Osso - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Sure, Charles. This is Nick. Acquisitions are something that we always look at. We are more mindful than ever of the opportunity for acquisitions in the marketplace, because there are a lot of assets for sale and many of the assets that are for sale are in basins where we operate, where we have a high degree of confidence, where we have a great cost structure and where there would be real synergies.","So it's something we always pay attention to. There's nothing in front of us. We're not ready to execute on anything today. It is just prudent for us to be cognizant of it. We recognize the power that it can have to our financial performance over time, if you can check all the boxes with an acquisition that being that it's the right value that you will add incremental value to it with synergies and that you can finance it appropriately.","And so, as we think about how you finance an acquisition appropriately, I couldn't tell you today whether it would be something that would justify the use of equity or not unless we're talking about a specific deal. But if you're going to look at an acquisition, I think you look at what makes sense for the deal and where you are as a company and what value your currency has in the marketplace. So those are just all considerations you think about as you approach transactions like that.","We get called a lot to look at stuff and we will continue to get called a lot to look at stuff as people recognize that our balance sheet is improving, we're in a healthier position and that we are an operator of choice in many of the basins which we operate.","Robert Douglas Lawler - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Let me just add further to that, Charles, that the Chesapeake's experience and expertise and the fact that we are the leader in unconventional shale development in the United States gives us tremendous optionality. We are capable of absorbing additional assets, bolt-on assets. And so, as Nick noted, the opportunity to \u2013 where we can utilize and lever our core strengths, 00:25:31 we will always be looking for those opportunities.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","That's helpful detail. Thanks for sharing, guys.","Operator","We shall take our next question from Doug Leggate of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks, guys. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking my questions.","Robert Douglas Lawler - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Good morning, Doug.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Doug, Nick, I hate to beat on the CapEx question, but I just wonder if you could just help us with the moving parts a little bit. What was the Utica spending in the budget for this year, including the two additional rigs, which I presume you will get by incremental capital at close? But if you could just give us that and then help us walk through how the deltas with the additional rigs in the Powder leave the year-over-year outlook going into 2019.","Domenic J. Dell\u2019Osso - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Yeah. So, Doug, our spending in the Utica this year was intended to be about $450 million. It'll go a little bit higher as we go into the third quarter here and have this incremental activity. The increase that we guided to last week is the same number we're talking about this morning. There's no difference there. And again, that's a mix of that incremental, as well as the Powder River Basin incremental activity where, in our original outlook for the year, we were targeting three rigs based on success and confidence in that program, sustained good oil pricing, and continued hedging of those oil prices into 2019. We've gone from three rigs to five rigs. That rate of return is solid and that incremental CapEx is doing very, very well for us across the board, including encouraging the sale of the Utica asset. So, it's all of those things combined and it's generating very good return for us.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So, to be clear, do the two additional rigs for the full year in the Powder offset fully the $450 million drop in the Utica?","Domenic J. Dell\u2019Osso - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Well, wait a minute. We're talking about 2018 CapEx here. So, the Utica...","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I am talking about going...","Domenic J. Dell\u2019Osso - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","...CapEx are (00:27:41) for three quarters.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah.","Domenic J. Dell\u2019Osso - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","(00:27:43)","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I am talking about going into 2019, as we go into 2019.","Domenic J. Dell\u2019Osso - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","No, no, no, no two rigs in the Powder does not equate to $450 million.","Robert Douglas Lawler - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","No.","Domenic J. Dell\u2019Osso - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","No.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So to be clear, net-net, we should expect spending trend to be lower next year?","Domenic J. Dell\u2019Osso - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Yes.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you. My follow-up, if I may, is for Frank. Frank, obviously, the Powder is getting a lot of attention and I think you first flagged this to me personally about two years ago. So, tremendous success and congratulations on that. However, my question is that the 2016 type curve you gave is obviously now stale and I'm guessing the inventory is pretty stale as well particularly when you look at Niobrara and Parkman opportunity. So, can you just speak to the depths of inventory that you see today and what trend type curve we should be using for development as we look forward on this?","Frank J. Patterson - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Yeah, Doug. We are updating type curves as we speak. We have a couple of type curves in the Turner. The big change in the Turner is we have learned through going through this process that we want to manage the chokes a little bit more than what we had anticipated, so we're not going to see this high IP, what we're seeing is a lower decline rate. So we're seeing that the wells perform \u2013 actually, pretty spectacular. If you look at the graph that's in the presentation, every well that we've turned on in the Turner has been in the upper quartile in the basin. So, I think that speaks for itself.","We've seen a lot of operators in the Turner, flow up casing and flow up unconstrained. It looks really sexy the first 30 days. But around 60 days or 65 days, they cross over the wells that we're actually flowing up tubing and managing the choke.","On the Niobrara, the big difference, we still have some work to do. But the big difference is, the historical Niobrara wells were severely under-stimulated and, quite frankly, drilled probably too tight a spacing. So, we're going to up-space that, put longer wells in the ground and put bigger fracs on the wells. The three wells that we have, that we have had larger fracs on, we had a historical well called the Barton out to the east that had \u2013 it was a 10,000-foot lateral and a larger frac.","It's the best Nio well in the country as we can see it from the data that we can pull. We've now done three DUCs with larger stimulations that were shorter wells, and those wells are performing in the upper quartile of Niobrara as well. So, we think the Niobrara needs to be up-spaced, larger completions and longer wells, and that's the way we're going to head.","We only have, I think, three wells in the Parkman. The Parkman is basically a sandstone. It's going to be drilled kind of in a \u2013 very similar to what we're doing in the Turner. We'll have pretty light stimulations on that. It's not over-pressured so we'll have to put it on submersible lift. But those wells will be fine economically, because they're shallower, we can knock them out quicker. The other zones, the Sussex, we know that zone has really good transmissibility. So, we've up-spaced that. So, we'll have less inventory than we spoke of before in the Sussex.","So, the inventory is long and deep. We still have the Maverick (00:31:23) that we have to get out and drill a well in the oil window to see what it'll do. We drilled a well in the gas window, a pretty short well and it performed well, but it was a gas well, so really the economics were not outstanding. We need to get out and drill a Maverick (00:31:38) well. So, we're seeing this play evolve, we're getting the spacing right. I believe we are seeing opportunities to stack on almost every single section we operate. There is a slide in the deck on page 11 that shows you how many potential wells we could have in a given section for the play. We're pretty excited about the play. We're just getting started. So things are going to change.","The big thing \u2013 and I'd like kind of Jason to maybe mention a couple of things, but we've seen huge improvements in the drilling side and the completion side, and that is driving the economics as well.","Jason M. Pigott - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Yeah. Thanks, Frank. Yeah, in addition to the productivity gains we've seen, they've been (00:32:24) just phenomenal work done on the completion and drilling efficiency. We've cut 10 days off our drilling time over the last year. So it's just phenomenal. They've had average 24 days for the quarter. But we've had several wells hit the sub-20-day mark, so they're killing it there. We're doing innovative things like drilling with produced water which can cut one of our bigger expenses which is mud costs, some of the cluster spacing test they've got can cut cost on the completion side up to $200 per foot as well. So, in addition to the productivity, again, efficiency gains, capital costs are going to come down in the area and we're going to get faster and better every month.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. Therefore, I'd like to hand the call back to Doug Lawler for any closing statements or remarks.","Robert Douglas Lawler - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Yes. Thank you, operator. Just in closing, I just would like to further highlight the confidence we have in our continued progression. Chesapeake is already a top quartile performer in capital efficiency and the way we run our cash cost and all associated costs in the business. And what we're seeing is continued incremental steps of improvement, and I think the investment community can expect nothing but continued performance.","And our excitement and our confidence in the things that we're doing is very high. And this is what we consider to believe a very attractive opportunity in our equity as we continue to build on the Utica divestiture and other transformative events that will put us in position to further round out being a top quartile company in every aspect of our business. So, thank you, all, for your time today, and we'll talk to you all soon. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation.

Doug will begin the call and then turn the call over to Nick for a review of our financial results before we turn the call over for Q&A.","So, with that, thank you. And I will now turn the teleconference over to Doug.","Robert Douglas Lawler - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Thank you, Brad, and good morning. We are pleased with our first quarter results and we are confident in our ability to deliver our strategy in 2017 priorities of, first, increasing EBITDA through oil production growth, superior capital efficiency and cash cost leadership and, second, further improving our balance sheet through debt reduction. The first quarter reflects continued progress on these priorities and, of note, our performance is consistent with our Analyst Day guidance provided back in October of last year.","Chesapeake has reached an important and pivotal point in our transformation. The company is now returning to production growth from our portfolio of high-quality assets. Importantly, our oil production will be increasing in the second half of the year at a meaningful pace. From the first quarter 2017 level of roughly 84,000 barrels of oil per day, we are on track to achieve our target of 100,000 barrels of oil per day by year-end 20117. As a result, we raised the lower end of our oil guidance range for 2017 along with our gas and NGL guidance. The significant increase in our oil volumes will also provide accelerated rate of change to our EBITDA and margins.","The oil growth rate will be driven from three assets: the Eagle Ford, the Powder River Basin and Mid-Continent, which are all poised to deliver stronger volumes as the year progresses. In the Eagle Ford Shale, we set a daily oil production record from a new well with a peak rate of 2,800 barrels of oil per day, or roughly 3,200 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This is one of our longer lateral wells that was also completed with more sand per foot and tighter cluster spacing compared to our standard design. We plan to place more wells on production with these enhanced completion methods and we believe the enhanced completions can generate both a production and economic uplift to our program.","We also drilled our first Upper Eagle Ford Shale well, with an 11,300-foot lateral. This well was placed online yesterday, so we should have a peak production rate to report in a few weeks. Our South Texas assets will be the major driver of oil volume growth through 2018 and we expect continued strong results through our long lateral drilling program, improved base optimization and shorter cycle times.","In the Powder River Basin, we announced first operated Turner well in March that reached a peak rate of 2,560 barrels of oil equivalent per day with a 78% oil cut, or 2,000 barrels of oil per day. This well continues to display strong performance, with gross cumulative oil production of approximately 36,000 barrels during its first 30 days of production.","Our second Turner well, the Rankin, is expected to be placed on production next week and we anticipate this well will deliver equivalent or better production on a per-foot basis than the first well. While the Rankin has a shorter lateral, approximately 4,500 foot compared to 7,100 foot in the first well, the Rankin has higher pressure at a shallower depth. The higher pressure and impressive 45-foot flair while drilling the lateral is expected to translate into greater deliverability on a per-foot basis.","Finally, we cored the Turner and the Rankin well, and it was saturated with oil. It looks really great. We'll have a good sense of the production on this well in a couple of weeks after it's turned-in-line. And dependent upon these results, we may elect to move another rig to the Powder River Basin to focus exclusively on the Turner.","We also drilled our first of two Parkman wells in the Powder River Basin. While production constrained, the first well has already reached a peak rate of 714 barrels of oil per day, or 763 barrels equivalent per day. We have also placed three notable Niobrara DUCs on production this year, which had peak rates of approximately 750 barrels of oil per day, 1,200 barrels of oil per day and 1,215 barrels of oil per day. In the third quarter, we plan to put to sales approximately 9 to 12 Sussex wells and we'll begin to flow back our first deep Mowry test. The Powder River Basin is revving up at Chesapeake and we expect a substantial rate of change in oil our production from this asset over the next several years.","In the Mid-Continent, we drilled our first extended lateral while targeting the Saint Genevieve formation in Major County, Oklahoma. This well was put online recently and is still cleaning up, so we plan to release those results soon. We plan to drill up to 20 additional extended lateral wells in the Saint Genevieve formation in 2017. We'll also be testing additional formations in Mid-Continent later this year, including the Chester limestone and sandstone formations. We control approximately 230,000 net acres that we believe are prospective for the Chester and we have taken two full cores to help us optimize our completion designs. We are looking forward to our first test results from the Chester in third and fourth quarters.","Our turned-in-line count of 76 wells in the 2017 first quarter and expect it to increase to around 120 wells in the second quarter, then range between 120 wells and 140 wells in the third and fourth quarters. The turn-in-line rate should be a strong indicator of the path and momentum we are building in the latter part of 2017 and as we enter 2018. The combined results of these oil-directed investments are delivery. The average oil rate for April is more than 1,000 barrels of oil per day above our first quarter average oil rate and current daily field estimates are approaching 90,000 barrels of oil a day. We are on the ramp.","Our strategic focus and near-term priorities will result in continued incremental, positive improvements in our operations and financial position. I believe the strength of our portfolio, determination of our employees and our relentless pursuit of improvement will drive competitive differential value for Chesapeake shareholders, leading with superior capital efficiency, cash cost management, strong oil growth and financial flexibility.","I'll now pass the call to Nick for further details regarding our first quarter performance.","Domenic J. Dell\u2019Osso - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Thank you, Doug and good morning, everyone. We're pleased with our earnings and cash flow results for the first quarter. Our production exceeded the mid-point of our projections based on strong gas performance in the Appalachian region and strong oil production from new wells drilled in the PRB, Mid-Continent and Eagle Ford. Looking ahead, we believe we've seen the low in our oil production in February and our production ramp in the second half of the year looks very strong, fueled by a significant increase in wells placed online over the next three quarters.","On the cost side, we've continued to reduce our production expenses sequentially from the fourth quarter and expect those to decline even further in 2017 on a BOE and production basis. We're forecasting that our G&A will increase slightly throughout 2017, primarily as a result of costs moving from LOE to G&A due to last year's asset sales. Given the movement between LOE and G&A, it's important to measure the combined trend. And together, LOE and G&A per BOE decreased by 2% sequentially, indicating a drop in the absolute spend.","Our gathering, processing and transportation expenses also improved sequentially on a BOE basis, and we look for these to move lower throughout the year. We reduced our oil GP&T guidance along with our basis guidance on all three products. Basis has improved considerably and the reduction in our forecasted basis differentials is meaningful. We continue to work on improving our realized prices by moving our crude and NGL production to better price points, by accessing new markets for these barrels and optimizing our point-of-sale for all three products further downstream.","As a reminder, we noted in our fourth quarter earnings call that we bought down a couple of midstream commitments at favorable economics during the first quarter for roughly $390 million in cash. The results of these buydowns will show up beginning in our April financials.","All of these cost improvements, LOE, G&A, gathering and transport, and marketing, have led to a 10% improvement in our margin for BOE, excluding the increase in commodity prices. Many of these operating cost improvements are a result of refining the assets in our portfolio around our most profitable basins and properties. This gives us confidence in the sustainability of the margin increases as prices recover. And, in fact, as we see volume growth from new wells and base production increases, we look for economies of scale to provide further opportunities for improvements. As we noted before, our cost structure is becoming a competitive advantage for the company and one that we are very focused on maintaining and growing as prices recover.","On the A&D front, we closed our two Haynesville asset packages in the first quarter and continue to work smaller asset packages, particularly in Mid-Continent area. We will continue to optimize our portfolio as we work toward our goal of removing another $2 billion to $3 billion of debt off our books. Following the end of the quarter, we satisfied the judgment of $441 million related to our 2019 notes litigation on April 28, which also relieved the associated letter of credit. Our liquidity following this payment and the pending release of the LC is approximately $3.3 billion. As a reminder, this had no impact on our liquidity, as the posted LC had already removed the amount from our liquidity.","It's certainly worth noting that inclusive of this payment and the opportunistic buy down of certain midstream contracts we completed during the quarter and open market purchases of debt, we are seeing higher-than-expected available liquidity for the company due to strong performance of our underlying business.","Finally, for 2017 we currently have approximately 75% of our remaining projected gas production hedged at $3.05 per mcf and approximately 64% of our remaining projected oil production hedged at $50.25 per barrel. Using the midpoints of our production guidance, we have also started to hedge a portion of our 2018 gas production at a little over $3 per mcf and small portion of our 2018 oil production over $51 per barrel so far.","To close, we believe that the next 18 months are going be very exciting for Chesapeake as we start to see significant earnings and cash flow growth and margin expansion due to greater oil volumes, larger producing wells across our portfolio and new plays, like the PRB, that, combined with our leading operating cost structure and capital efficiency, will start to make a meaningful difference in the financial performance of the company.","That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from Neal Dingmann with SunTrust.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Good morning, Doug, Nick. Doug, question is, great results in Eagle Ford on those enhancements. I guess my question is pertaining to the Eagle Ford. Do you see that enhancement potentially working the entire \u2013 I guess I would say the enhancements and Upper Eagle Ford potential, do you see that in most of your 270,000 acres there?","Robert Douglas Lawler - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Sure. Good morning, Neal. I'm going to ask Frank to follow on. I'll just make a quick comment. As you recall, back when we did our Analyst Day, where we were roughly 25% developed in the Eagle Ford. So as we apply those longer laterals and those completion technologies, we do see additional opportunity for improved rates.","And I'll just ask Frank to chime in there with our further development program.","Frank J. Patterson - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Yeah, Neal. We're working through enhancing the completions on all the future wells. Also, looking at changing our targeting to maximize the value of each of these wells. That's an ongoing opportunity we have. And as we've moved forward, I don't know that all the wells are going react to that level, but we think we're going to be able to improve all the wells going forward. So we think it's going to be a step change in our development plan. The Upper Eagle Ford, that will be over a portion of our acreage. And we're going to just wait and see what this Upper Eagle Ford test looks like before we commit to what that means to us.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Very good. And then just one follow-up, Doug. Obviously, with the liquidity that Nick laid out, there's not an immediate need for further sales. I think there was some confusion on what you guys had maybe laid out for the year. Could you talk about potential non-core sales as it pertains to the rest of the year? Thanks.","Robert Douglas Lawler - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Sure. We have not put a specific target sale number out there for 2017. I will tell you we are actively continuing to evaluate the portfolio. Non-core, non-operated, lower-EBITDA, lower-production properties are our first target. We are still very focused on the guidance we provided to the investment community back in October of achieving $2 billion to $3 billion of additional asset sales over the next few years.","The strength and quality of the portfolio, the size of our acreage position, we're very confident in our ability to deliver that. And we will continue to update you and provide you further information as we progress. But the key note is that we are actively continuing to evaluate and look for further asset sales.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks, Doug. Great execution.","Robert Douglas Lawler - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Thanks, Neal.","Operator","We'll go next to Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Good morning, Doug.","Robert Douglas Lawler - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Good morning.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Doug, the Power River is obviously gaining a lot of traction here. I think a number of your peers have also talked about it with some of the highest returns in their portfolios. So I understand you're talking about maybe moving some rigs over there. But can you talk about the running room that you see at this point? Because I guess inventory life is still being established. And how this would stack up, pardon the pun, how it would stack up relative to some of the other plays as it relates to incremental capital allocation.","Frank J. Patterson - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Sure. Morning, Doug. This is Frank. I would like you to just look back at the October data that we gave you. We are on track there. We have a large number of Sussex wells that we're going be pushing through the system because, at the time, that was the best economics in the portfolio for the Powder and some of the best economics in the company.","We've now tested the Turner on one side. We're waiting to turn the second Turner well in line. Honestly, we've had that well drilled and ready to turn in for several weeks. It was a tight location that we could not do what we've been doing, which is building our facilities ahead of time. So we had to build our facilities after the rig left. That well will be turned-in-line here in the next week or so. When we get that well online, I think that's going open up the Turner as a really good position to run with.","And that's several hundred wells that we can drill there. They're going to have outstanding economics, probably, as we see it today, better than the Sussex. So that's going to jump to the top of the list. And that's why Doug and we've talked about, in that instance, we're probably going to move another rig in to focus on the Turner. The big question, the next big question, is going be the Mowry. We've now PD'd the first Mowry well. We'll be putting it online here in the second, into the third quarter. That will open up additional running room.","So, we see really strong running room in the Sussex, which we define by that big sand bar that we've been chasing. The Turner across the majority of our acreage, the Niobrara, now with the new enhanced completions, look much better than we had anticipated, so that's going open up. We see this as several thousand locations available us to. And that, remember, is on relatively broad spacing. So if we see an opportunity to downspace here, that's just going to increase our opportunity set.","Robert Douglas Lawler - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","That's what you needed, Doug?","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","It kind of is. But it's really a segue to a second question, Doug, if I may, which is, in terms of the \u2013 Frank, thanks for the answer. So we look at the way your portfolio is evolving, Northwest stack seems to be moving up the relative priority list as it relates to, again, your opportunity set. And I guess I wanted to ask the monetization question slightly differently, because the only thing that seems to be holding you back from getting recognition from some of this stuff is still the high level of debt and leverage obviously.","So I guess what I'm really asking is, as you evolve the portfolio towards these more oily areas, higher-rate areas, more economic areas, how do you think about the relative reset in your portfolio? I'm thinking specifically Marcellus and whether you would ever consider accelerating asset sales across some of your more pure-play gas positions?","Robert Douglas Lawler - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Sure. Well, it's a great question, Doug. And as we evaluate the portfolio constantly, the churn in evaluation consists of what is the EBITDA generation, what is the future potential, what is the competitive investment thesis in our portfolio of great assets going forward. But the key in my mind and across the company is that we're going to continue to improve our operations and continue to improve our balance sheet and look for opportunities to reduce our debt further as quickly as possible.","I'd just draw your attention back to what the investment community's view of the Haynesville was a few years ago, and the significant value that our operating expertise and experience, what that's done and the uplift there that we've recognized and the value of that asset in the past few years as we continue to drill and produce just big boomer wells there in the Haynesville Shale. That same transfer of technology and operating capability we've pushed to the Powder River. And we have that excitement there.","And as you look at the Marcellus and the Utica in the Northeast, these are very, very strong cash-generating assets. Some of the best rock shale, gas rock in the world. When you can spend $100 million and keep an asset flat at 2 BCF a day for next five-plus years, it's a tremendous asset to have in our portfolio. What I'm getting at there is that, if we can accelerate the value, we will absolutely do that and consider bigger asset sales, broader asset sales, to accelerate the value to our shareholders.","But make no mistake, along the way as we evaluate the portfolio and continue with our investment thesis, we are driving the greatest value in a very disciplined capital program, pursuing that free cash flow neutrality. Essentially, if it weren't for some of the extraneous items the past several quarters, our spending has been in line, capital spending for drilling and completion, CapEx within our EBITDA. And we're going to continue those asset sales and look for opportunities to add the value. But make no mistake, across the portfolio, we're making meaningful improvements that will generate value for our shareholders in the future.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Appreciate the full answer, Doug. Thanks.","Operator","We'll go next to Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Good morning.","Robert Douglas Lawler - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Good morning, Brian.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I had a question with regards to capital allocation. You talked a number of times about liquidity. And wondered if you could talk to your priorities on liquidity versus leverage. If you see the good results that you've highlighted here in the Eagle Ford and the PRB and allocate more capital to drilling and potentially another rig in the PRB, what are the key metrics that guide you? Is it more liquidity-driven, as you mentioned, or is it leverage, particularly, as we think about an environment if oil prices don't go up as much from here?","Domenic J. Dell\u2019Osso - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Brian, it's Nick. I'll take that. The primary financial focus of the company is going to continue to be to drive our debt balance lower and meet our long-term debt targets. If you think about the excess liquidity that we generated through strong operational performance, I commented in my prepared notes this morning that we have diverted some funds to reducing some burdensome contracts. Those were done at favorable economics.","And I can assure you as we think about doing something like that, we compare it to the relative benefit of retiring debt and think about the yield on doing so and found that retiring those contracts was more attractive. So when you think about the excess liquidity that we generated above plan, we applied that to a cost improvement effective leverage reduction. And we will always be focused on reducing our leverage until we hit our goal.","When Doug talks about reallocating some capital to the Powder River, think about the fact that that may very well be just that, a reallocation, not a net increase in rigs. And as we get into the second half of the year, we see what kind of commodity price environment we're heading into in 2018 and we determine what our proper total capital spend going into next year should be, given the market environment, given the cash flow we expect to generate, that's when you would make a decision about whether or not that's a net add or it's a shift.","So the focus remains debt reduction, liquidity. We protect, but I think we are comfortable, with the liquidity we have. We don't want to see it eroded to grow production, grow cash flow, unless it's doing so in a really high rate of return way that is additive to our overall efforts of reducing leverage and putting the company in a position to generate free cash flow. So none of these things can happen overnight unless you're willing to destroy value, and we're not. So we're getting there. And the previous question about asset sales is still very, very much front of mind for us and that will continue to drive the majority of our leverage production.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","That's great. Thank you. And my follow-up is with regards to the Haynesville. Can you give us the latest on what you're seeing from a well performance perspective? And I think you mentioned three rigs there. With gas prices, at least on a front-month basis above $3, but also other opportunities in the portfolio, how you're thinking about the direction of the rig count, up or down, as we go forward.","Jason M. Pigott - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","This is Jason. I can speak to the well performance. Again, we think we've got a good recipe out there for our frac designs. We've gone from a high end of wells that had 50 million pounds of sand with the starting point of wells with 30 million pounds of sand. So we've settled somewhere in between. We're planning to test the high end of it. But I went out to the field the other day and I stood on a location making 41 million cubic feet a day.","So we're still making some really large wells out there. And the team has actually got some wells they're looking at on the schedule that could be 15,000 feet compared to the 10,000-feet wells we have been drilling. So those will be a step change in productivity as well. So we're really happy with the performance in the Haynesville. It's one of our, I'd say, more consistent plays with respect to well performance. And we think we've got a good recipe there that works for us.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks. And rig count trending up, down, stays flat through the end of the year?","Jason M. Pigott - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","We're planning to stay flat at three rigs right now. But, again, as we think about reallocating to oil locations, this could be one of those areas that sees a shift. But for now, the plan is three rigs to stay flat.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company L.L.C.","Good morning, Doug, and to the rest of your team there as well. I'd like to ask a question on your PRB Turner well. The Sundquist well. And I'm looking specifically at slide five. I'm wondering if you can talk about how that well is performing. One of the things I'm looking at is, that cumulative graph is pretty straight, suggesting very little decline there. Can you talk about that, what you're seeing either on the decline rate or the pressure transient there?","Frank J. Patterson - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Charles, this is Frank. We're really not seeing decline right now. Remember, the Sussex and the Turner are actually silty sandstones, so they react a little bit differently than, say, your unconventional plays that are the shales or something much, much tighter. There is actually some permeability in this rock, so it's going behave a little bit differently. We will start seeing pressure and production decline. But right now, the well is really just cleaning up and getting its horsepower behind it, so that's why we're pretty excited about this.","If you remember the way the map was when we laid it out in October, this well is over on the very Western edge of what we thought the play was. It was kind of a well that we needed to drill on Federal unit to maintain the Federal unit and we also had good Parkman over there, so we decided to drill it and take a core. The core was better than we expected and the productivity of the well is much better than we expected.","Then we moved basically 17 miles to the East, the other well that we're waiting to turn on. It's in a much \u2013 probably a better part of the rock. That well is a shorter lateral, but we carried a pretty big flair with high mud weight while we were drilling that. And that well is just ready to turn on line as soon as we get the facilities hooked up.","This Turner looks like it's on the upper end of what we expected, so we're pretty excited about it. And that's why we're talking about if both these work the way they look like they're going to work, we're going to have to start focusing some serious effort on the Turner here. And the beauty of it is, we can develop Turner off of Sussex pads, we can develop Niobrara and Turner off the same pads. This is a stacked play where we're going to be able to develop a lot of production off of smaller footprints. We have to manage that, though, because we don't want to tie up a bunch of drilling and completion capital and not get the volume. So we're working through a field development plan right now to put all this in play.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company L.L.C.","That's great color, Frank. If I could go back to the Haynesville. There's been some smaller competitors out there that have elevated the Bossier, I guess really the Middle Bossier, as important target for them. And I know you guys haven't talked about that a whole lot recently. But if I go back, you guys had delivered some really impressive Bossier results in the Southern half of DeSoto County \u2013 or DeSoto Parish, I should get that part right. Can you talk about where that Bossier is as a target for you guys?","Jason M. Pigott - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Yeah, it's different quality across the field. We've got it in the more Southern half of our acreage. We've got some plans to test it with some of these enhanced completion techniques. So we'll do that. For us it's still second tier to the core Haynesville play. So we'll conduct some tests, we'll provide more information. We haven't tried one of these really big jobs on those wells yet, but we've got one coming up this year. So we'll provide more information on that. But we stick with our bread and butter, which is the Haynesville right now for the bulk of our development.","Frank J. Patterson - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Yeah, Charles. This is Frank. I think we've got a Bossier well coming up in the next quarter, so we will have some results towards the end of the year \u2013 third quarter. Third quarter. Okay.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company L.L.C.","Thank you, Jason and Frank.","Operator","We'll go next to David Heikkinen with Heikkinen Energy Advisors.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Good morning, guys. Thanks for the time. I had a quick question just thinking about your October Investor Day, where really the wedge play was a long-term driver for your growth and spent a lot of time highlighting details in other regions. Can you categorize and help us understand the diversity of what you're testing, what you're exploring and what's in development with the current rig count and kind of wells that are turned on line this year?","Frank J. Patterson - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Yeah. This is Frank again. In the wedge play specifically, as we described it, the wedge basically was from the bottom up was basically the Hunton, the Woodford and then the Osage, the Meramec and the Chester. What we've focused on initially is we've had a few wells testing different concepts. But we've kind of honed in right now on the Meramec for the time being because it has high productivity, we have a really good footprint. We've been able to put together a really nice acreage position on top of what we already had. One of the reasons we haven't talked about a lot of results is because we're continuing to add to our acreage position out there and coring up.","And then we knew the Chester was something that we were really interested in and no one had really chased it much. But when you look at the map, the reason it hasn't been chased much is because we own about 230,000 acres of it and we own the core of it. So we needed more data on that. We've now drilled two wells and taken core and we're laying one of those wells out horizontally and we'll be doing some completion testing. T","he thing about the Chester, they're thinner reservoirs. They do produce vertically, they're oil prone, but there's four to five stacked reservoirs on our acreage position. So we're really interested in that play, but we want to do the science and get it right, both on the geo side and on the completion side.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","So with the leasing program, I guess by the end of the year, might have a better idea of how that big wedge of 18 forward I guess \u2013 what the wedge does is what it sounds like. And that's why you're having the Powder discussion now.","Frank J. Patterson - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Yeah, what we're seeing, we are seeing good productivity out of the wells. We just haven't had a chance to really ramp it up. We've now moved another rig into the play to accelerate the Meramec side of that. We are just being cautiously optimistic on the Chester right now until we get some more data. But what we've seen so far in the core is pretty attractive. We've got to design some completions, though, to make that really hum.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","So, outside the Meramec, everything else is testing and exploring, the Meramec really is in full development mode?","Frank J. Patterson - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Yeah, I think if you would talk to the team, we're moving into more of a development mode in the Meramec and we're still in that testing phase on all the other horizons. We have not drilled the Hunton well yet. That's way down the road.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","That's awesome. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our final question comes from Jason Wangler with Wunderlich.","Jason A. Wangler - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.","Hey. Good morning. I was just curious, as you talk about the activity in the Powder River, how you see the infrastructure that you have now up there and where that can go as you look to ramp it up a little bit more across all the formations.","Frank J. Patterson - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Jason, it's Frank again. Really good question. We have to get in front of the infrastructure here. We're looking at water pipelines for both supply and disposal. And our water disposal system is fine right now for what we're doing. The bigger issue is going be should we start laying oil gathering lines and go to a large central facility. That's being worked today. As I stated previously, the piece that's being worked right now is that field development plan. What's it going to look like at the end of the day and how can we maximize the infrastructure around that and limit the infrastructure that we have to put in the ground.","On the gas side, we have plenty of gas takeaway at the plant. But if the Mowry works, we're going to have to look at expanding that capacity. And we're working with our gas gathering partner there to work through that problem. We'll have more information on that by the end of the year as we get the Mowry tested.","Jason A. Wangler - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.","Great. That's all I had. Thank you.","Robert Douglas Lawler - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Okay. Well, that concludes our comments and questions. Thank you, operator. I would just like to reiterate the confidence that we have in our program and highlight that we continue to deliver exactly what we said we would, and that's exactly what we will be doing going forward: focusing on increasing our EBITDA through our oil production growth, utilizing our operating efficiencies and cash cost leadership capital efficiency and continuing to improve our balance sheet through further debt reduction.","Thank you, operator.

Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time I'd like to turn the call to Mr. Brad Sylvester. Please go ahead, sir.","Brad Sylvester - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining our call today to discuss Chesapeake's financial and operational results for the 2016 fourth quarter and full year. Hopefully you've had a chance to review our press release and the updated investor presentation that we posted to our website this morning.","During this morning's call we will be making forward-looking statements, which consist of statements that cannot be confirmed by reference to existing information, including statements regarding our beliefs, goals, expectations, forecasts, projections, and future performance, and the assumptions underlying such statements. Please note that there are a number of factors that will cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements, including the factors identified and discussed in our earnings release today and in other SEC filings.

Doug will begin the call and then turn the call over to Nick for a review of our financial results before we turn the teleconference over for Q&A.","So with that, thank you. And I will now turn the teleconference over to Doug.","Robert Douglas Lawler - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Thank you, Brad, and good morning. 2016 was a year of significant progress and substantial achievements for Chesapeake Energy. We are stronger today than any other time in our history. Looking back across this challenging period of low commodity prices, we've successfully delivered on our strategy to de-lever, de-risk, and simplify our balance sheet, while driving improved capital and operating efficiencies and also driving the industry-leading low production cost.","The company is positioned to differentially perform through further debt reduction and development of our high quality asset portfolio in the coming years.","The most significant accomplishment for 2016 included successful liability management initiatives that resulted in reduced debt, refinance near-term maturities, and restoring a reasonable cost of capital.","Other major accomplishments included, one, divesting the Barnett asset, eliminating an annual negative impact of $200 million to $300 million in EBITDA, principally due to MVC payments and burdensome gathering and firm transportation agreements associated with the asset; two, renegotiating midstream contracts including new gathering agreements in the Powder River Basin and Mid-Continent assets; three, divesting of more than $2 billion in non-core non-operated and\/or low EBITDA generating assets; four, significantly improving capital efficiency with new technology, better engineering, and greater recoveries, resulting in higher quality, more efficient well economics; and five, reassessing our entire portfolio and confirming the long-term economic strength of our assets.","We have previously shared the strength of our portfolio, consisting of 11.3 billion barrels of net recoverable resources, 5,600 locations with an internal rate of return of greater than 40%, and a projected growth rate of 5% to 15% annually through 2020 at normalized flat pricing of $3 per mcf and $60 per barrel of oil.","We crushed our cash costs in 2016. We reduced our total production expenses by approximately $336 million or 28% per barrel of oil equivalent of production compared to 2015. We also reduced our total GP&T expenses by approximately $264 million or 7% per boe of production compared to 2015. These improvements totaled $600 million of annual savings. And we are not done.","Our total production in 2016 averaged over 635,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, down just 0.3% after adjusting for asset sales, while we reduced our total capital expenditures by approximately 53%. This excludes proved property acquisitions and the repurchase of volumetric production payment transaction. These accomplishments reflect the power, strength, and resiliency of our portfolio and the focus of our talented employees.","Last week we released capital and production guidance for 2017. We are committed to improving upon our 2016 performance, continuing the transformation of our balance sheet and increasing our productivity and capital efficiency. We included service cost escalation in our capital guidance. But we will utilize our operating strengths and purchasing power to minimize any potential cost increases.","We will be working to accelerated our stated debt reduction target of $2 billion to $3 billion over the next few years through additional asset sales. Our capital program is designed to achieve cash flow neutrality in 2018, as we progress toward our targeted net debt-to-EBITDA multiple of 2 times.","After planning for a lower turn-in-line count in 2017 in the first quarter, our production volumes are projected to return to growth in the second quarter of this year. We believe this strong growth trajectory will be driven by our oil assets, most notably the Eagle Ford, the Mid-Continent, and some exciting progress coming from the Powder River Basin.","Meanwhile, we expect our gas volumes will be primarily driven by the Haynesville and Marcellus. We are moving to more pad drilling in all of our operating areas, which we anticipate will generate a strong production ramp in the second half of the year.","Our production guidance for 2017 is projected to deliver an exit-to-exit increase in total production from the fourth quarter of 2016 to the fourth quarter of 2017 of approximately 7%, of which oil is projected to have an exit-to-exit increase of 10%. We expect this oil growth to accelerate even more in 2018 with oil production projected to increase from the fourth quarter of 2017 to the fourth quarter of 2018 by more than 20%.","Our portfolio across six major basins is getting stronger through the growing use of longer laterals, more aggressive fracture stimulations, and the shortening of our reinvestment cycle, all leading to greater productivity and higher cash flows for Chesapeake. To reiterate, total production growth through 2020 is expected to range between 5% and 15% per year.","Our corporate strategies and financial discipline, profitable and efficient growth from captured resources, business development, and exploration remain unchanged.","2017 is an important year for Chesapeake, a year where we pivot from defense to offense. As noted, we are committed to removing an additional $2 billion to $3 billion of debt from our balance sheet. And our plan is to execute upon this reduction sooner rather than later. We are focused on expanding our margins and thereby our EBITDA through greater oil production and our unrelenting drive to lower all of our cash costs.","I'll now pass the call to Nick to share some additional financial information.","Domenic J. Dell\u2019Osso - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Thank you, Doug, and good morning, everyone. We're very pleased with our 2016 results and the significant improvements in our capital efficiency, asset performance, cost structure, and liquidity that Doug highlighted in his comments.","Starting with our liquidity position, as a reminder, we have effectively taken over $4 billion of leverage and preferred stock out of our capital structure over the last 16 months. That's $2.6 billion of debt inclusive of our December 2015 debt exchange and $1.4 billion liquidation value of our preferred shares for common shares.","Importantly through these transactions and several incremental refinancings completed in 2016, we've removed or refinanced approximately $2.7 billion of near term debt that was maturing or could be put to us in 2017 and 2018, primarily through refinancing with only $77 million remaining due or puttable in that period.","Today we have liquidity of approximately $3.4 billion, including a projected $300 million of cash on hand at the end of February with no borrowings outstanding on our revolving credit facility. We're pleased with this liquidity position. But our goal is to reduce our debt even further. And as Doug mentioned, we remain prudently impatient in working toward removing another $2 billion to $3 billion of debt off our books.","We continue to achieve significant progress in lowering our production expenses and expect these to decline even further in 2017 on a boe of production basis. However, our G&A ticked up slightly year-over-year and will continue to increase in 2017 primarily as a result of costs moving from LOE to G&A following our significant asset sales.","We continue to see opportunities to improve efficiency around our reduced operating footprint, having sold nearly 10,000 operated wells in the last year. And with that, having removed the maintenance of over 30 field offices, significant IT and communications equipment, invoices to process, and decreasing the burden on several other administrative functions.","Given the movement between G&A and LOE, we believe the best way to measure the improvement is to note that our combined LOE and G&A per boe of production decreased by 8% year over year.","We also continue to see our GP&T expenses improve, decreasing by approximately 7% on a boe of production basis in 2016 and forecasted to decrease by approximately 10% in 2017. With our exit from the Barnett Shale, the restructuring of our Mid-Continent and Powder River Basin gathering agreements, and amendments to certain firm transportation agreements in the Haynesville and Eagle Ford operating areas, we have seen a reduction \u2013 a $5.5 billion reduction in our future GP&T commitments since the end of 2014 and a $2.9 billion reduction since the end of 2015.","We have additional commitments that will step down going into 2018 as well as expected synergies associated with volume growth in our key basins. And so we anticipate continuing the trend of decreasing GP&T costs on a per unit basis beyond this year.","This work continues in 2017 with our buy down of certain crude oil and natural gas transportation commitments this quarter for roughly $390 million in cash. The buy down of these contracts will remove approximately $560 million from our future transportation commitments, further optimizes our long-haul transportation plans, and significantly improves the margin in our marketing group over time. We have provided a slide on this earlier today, projecting how these buy downs have improved our GP&T commitments in the coming periods.","We also continue to improve our netbacks for our liquids production in various basins by accessing new markets for our hydrocarbons and optimizing our point-of-sale further downstream in several cases versus at the wellhead. Our marketing team continues to have success in improving our realized pricing for our production. And we look forward to further success.","On the A&D front, with the closing of our two Haynesville asset packages this quarter, we have received approximately $2 billion \u2013 $2.2 billion in net proceeds from asset sales that were signed during 2016. Like we have said before, we expect to continue to optimize our portfolio in 2017 and use asset sales proceeds for further debt reduction.","Finally for 2017 we currently have approximately 71% of our projected gas production hedged at $3.07 per mcf and approximately 68% of our projected oil production hedged at approximately $50.19 per barrel using midpoints of our production guidance. With these hedges in place, our cash flow is not materially impacted by the recent decline we have seen in natural gas prices. We've also hedged a meaningful portion of our 2018 gas production at a little over $3 per mcf.","We have stated before that our 2016 achievements have allowed us to focus on our operations instead of our obligations. Our return to production growth during 2017 sets Chesapeake up for an even stronger year in 2018. This production growth and the associated growth and cash flow accrues much more directly to our equity holders than in the past, given our significantly decreased total leverage and improved capital structure. We look forward to executing on these plans to deliver these enhanced returns to our shareholders.","That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. At this time we'll start our question and answer session. And we'll take our first question from Neal Dingmann with SunTrust.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Morning, gentlemen. Say, two questions. First, Doug, for you or Nick, I just saw \u2013 just something was reported on this expected \u2013 on the material weakness internal controls. Anything you can just suggest? Anything you're worried about to that come up on the 10-K?","Domenic J. Dell\u2019Osso - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Yeah. Happy to answer that, Neal. So this was an oil basis pricing differential calculation in one region for a discrete period of time. It has nothing to do with our reserves engineering and is isolated to that one regional oil price calculation. The impact to our financial statements was not material and is laid out in a table in the 8-K.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay, perfect. Thanks, Nick. Great to hear on that. And then, Doug, looking at the Analyst Day kind of how you laid out the rig scenario for this year and then just on the most recent slides. Looks like everything is pretty close to the same just one in \u2013 maybe in two areas. One, Mid-Con, you talk about four currently running. And I think during the Analyst Day you talked about potentially one to two in Oswego and three to 10 in the Miss and the Wedge. And then over in the Marcellus I noticed you currently don't have any running. And I think at the time you were mentioning potentially zero to two there. So maybe if you could just address those two areas?","Robert Douglas Lawler - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Sure, Neal, I'll comment. And Frank may want to chime in as well. Basically that as we look at the year and the capital expenditure program that we've laid out, there's a significant amount of flexibility that we built in based on taking advantage of either pricing, opportunistically looking at where we are testing new things, where we can drive the greatest value. There's not anything significant to take from that. It's just a normal shifting around of the program to optimize the best economics at the current time. Frank, do you want to share anything else you want?","Frank J. Patterson - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Sure. Neal, if you'll recall, we talked about in the Marcellus and the Utica, we've combined that into one business unit. And the driver there was not to make a massive business unit, but to allow a lot better rig sharing. So when you look at the Marcellus and the Utica, you need to look at it as a combined venture as far as drilling and completion. So we're moving rigs back and forth between those, depending on what wells we need to drill and what wells we need to complete. And it really creates a lot of efficiency for us in kind of a regional area.","In the Mid-Con, what we're looking at is we have two rigs running in the Oswego right now. The cycle times are really impressive there, the wells are performing great. The Wedge play, it is evolving. And as we get more and more data, we'll start to look at, do we ramp up? How do we manage that program forward?","So where we are today on the slide you'll see in the deck is kind of a static position. And as we get more data we'll make that call.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Very good. Congrats, Doug, great turnaround.","Robert Douglas Lawler - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Thanks, Neal.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you, good morning.","Robert Douglas Lawler - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Morning.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","One of the areas you highlighted at the Analyst Meeting for focus was the Powder River Basin. And wanted to just see if you could give us an update there? And the acceleration and how that translates into production and knowledge on the play?","Frank J. Patterson - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","You want to \u2013 hey, Brian, this is Frank Patterson. Since the time of the Analyst Meeting, we talked about putting a rig in play in November. We've done that. As we started to review our opportunity set and the potential in the Powder, we made the election before the end of the year to move in a second rig. That's just going to be basically Sussex-focused.","So where we are in the basin today is we are completing and drilling \u2013 actually drilling out our first Turner test now. So that will be online in the near future. We've drilled a Parkman test on the same pad. I will be online in the near future. We've gone in with a completion crew and begun completing DUCs, so our production volumes are turning around now.","And then the Sussex rig, the second rig was in the field and spud the first \u2013 on the first Sussex pad the first week of February.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks. And my follow-up is on natural gas prices. Given the whipsaw that we've seen in the \u2013 at least for now, warm recent weather, just wanted to get a sense as to how the natural gas price environment impacts your capital allocation and capital plans if at all for the year?","Robert Douglas Lawler - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","So, Brian, as Nick noted, the hedging position we have for the year is quite good at approximately 71% at $3.07 per mcf. So it doesn't materially impact the program for 2017, the volatility that we're presently seeing.","Keep in mind though that the flexibility of the company today is much improved. And where we sit with as we look forward to that capital deployment and the long-term pricing forecast, we can make adjustments in the program based on that volatility if we deem it appropriate and in the best interest of our shareholders to do so.","So I think that as you see continuing weakening in pricing, we'll adjust our capital program and redirect it at other opportunities in the portfolio. And the great thing about the company is the strength and resiliency of the portfolio. We can shift rigs around and drive greater value from other areas if the pricing conditions dictate.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. And what just \u2013 on a follow up to that. What gas price if you \u2013 would you believe it \u2013 would you have to believe in for 2018 to either increase or decrease activity in Haynesville Shale relative to where you're at right now?","Robert Douglas Lawler - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Well, we haven't set an exact price. As we've shared in the past, we have excellent breakeven economics in the Haynesville. And they continue to get better with the improved capital efficiencies that we've recognized. I think that in the \u2013 basically in the $2.50 to $3.50 range is where we anticipate gas to move with the seasonality.","And if you saw it dip below $2.50 for an extended period of time, we would probably start making adjustments. But we're \u2013 we haven't really said at a specific price we would move or adjust that. But the key is, as you know, we're focused on driving the greatest value where we can capture the greatest returns. And we'll make those changes immediately, as we deem appropriate that we can drive value from another area.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you very much.","Robert Douglas Lawler - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Thanks, Brian.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Jacob Gomolinski-Ekel. Please go ahead from Morgan Stanley.","Jacob Gomolinski-Ekel - Morgan Stanley","Morning, guys.","Robert Douglas Lawler - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Morning.","Domenic J. Dell\u2019Osso - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Morning.","Jacob Gomolinski-Ekel - Morgan Stanley","Hey, just had a question on the \u2013 it looked like there was $205 million of cash spent on acquisitions in the quarter, which included capitalized interest of $56 million. So just curious if you had any additional details on the $149 million of acquisitions in the fourth quarter?","Domenic J. Dell\u2019Osso - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Yeah. So during the fourth quarter we exited our Devonian Shale position. And associated with that exit, we repurchased a VPP. That ends up getting booked as an acquisition to repurchase the VPP. Those assets then move off with the acquisition. So we had noted at the time that we said we were going to divest of the acquisition. That it would be a nominal net amount of proceeds to the company. And that's where it came out. We had a nominal amount of proceeds that came in after repurchasing the VPP.","Jacob Gomolinski-Ekel - Morgan Stanley","Okay, got it. And then I don't know if you had any color on the outlook for that, for acquisitions in 2017?","Domenic J. Dell\u2019Osso - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","No. No specific plans for acquisitions in 2017. As I'm sure everyone is aware, there are a ton of opportunities out there to look at. And we have a very active and well-functioning business development team that works with our business units to look at opportunities in areas where we think we have good operating synergies, we have good geologic knowledge, and we have an ability to add value to things that we would purchase. That's always put through a lens of the purchase price and the opportunity relative to the set we have in front of us today, which is a significant drilling inventory at a high rate of return.","Jacob Gomolinski-Ekel - Morgan Stanley","Right.","Domenic J. Dell\u2019Osso - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","As we've highlighted for everyone before.","So we are very active in looking at things that come across. And we're pretty tough judges of what meets the bar that we would consider moving on. And we'll continue to do that. If we move on something, know that it would be something that we really felt was impactful to our portfolio, and we thought we could generate great returns on. We've got so much in front of us today that that's a very high bar.","Jacob Gomolinski-Ekel - Morgan Stanley","Got it. And then just a follow-up if I may in terms of the \u2013 into the flip side of that question I guess. You mentioned in the release additional asset divestitures. And just wanted to see if you might be able to provide any additional details around size and scale? Or perhaps which specific assets might qualify?","Domenic J. Dell\u2019Osso - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","We've stayed away from giving any specific color for the calendar year 2017, other than to note that it's important to the company to make progress towards our goal of debt reduction. It's important to the company to make progress towards right-sizing our oil and gas portfolio. And we'll make progress on that this year.","Exactly how much, when, what assets, we're going to stay away from, as it's market dependent on so many fronts. We're working a number of things today. And you can expect that we'll continue to progress that. But in terms of a specific point of guidance, we're going to continue to just point to the multi-year goal of $2 billion to $3 billion of debt reduction.","Jacob Gomolinski-Ekel - Morgan Stanley","Got it. Thanks very much.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Biju Perincheril with Susquehanna.","Biju Perincheril - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Hi, good morning. Just a couple of questions on the Powder River Basin. Doug, I was wondering at the Analyst Day you highlighted one well, I think it was the Barton well. And I was wondering the well that you recently brought online, how are the completions? How similar the completions were to that Barton well?","Frank J. Patterson - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Biju, this is Frank Patterson. Two things. One the Barton well was a longer lateral. It was the longest Niobrara lateral we had drilled. And it was the largest completion.","We had several Niobrara DUCs available to us. And so when we went back into the field, the completions team took a look at the completion design on that Nio well that was the Barton, which is basically the best Nio well in the country from a cumulative basis.","The new wells have received the larger frac. They're not extended laterals, so they didn't perform as -quite as well as the Barton. But the initial well that we brought on is still making about 1,230 barrels of oil a day. 60% \u2013 or boe a day. 60% of that's oil after almost 30 days of online.","So that we are seeing a response that is very positive. So now we're going to move, as we go into a new Nio program down the road, we will be putting longer laterals and larger fracs on those Nio wells and expect to have a good success.","Biju Perincheril - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Thanks. And then that recent well looks like it's sort of within your, I guess gas condensate window there. Given that was 60%, 70% oil, does your view of what the gas condensate window is, does that change at all? Or...","Frank J. Patterson - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","No. That well actually, it's performing on a cut basis as far as oil pretty much as expected. What it did do is it also validated the spacing assumptions that we're going with now with a little bit further spacing between wells. Gives you a lot higher sustained pressure and lot higher deliverability at the wellbore.","So everything we told you at the Analyst Day seems to be playing out pretty well. And we'll have a lot more data as we move down the road. The completions team and the drilling team are really focused on this. And I think we're going to do a really good job and deliver what we said at Analyst Day.","Biju Perincheril - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Great. Thank you.","Operator","That does conclude our question and answer session. At this time I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Lawler for any additional or concluding remarks.","Robert Douglas Lawler - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Great, thank you. We appreciate everyone joining us today. 2016 was a great year for Chesapeake. And we look forward to building upon that. And what you can expect is continued improved performance across all aspects of our business. And we look forward to sharing that with you in the coming months.

At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Brad Sylvester. Please go ahead, sir.","Brad Sylvester - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Good morning and thank you for joining our call today to discuss Chesapeake's financial and operational results for the 2017 fourth quarter and full year. Hopefully, you've had a chance to review our press release and the updated Investor Presentation that we posted to our website this morning.","During this morning's call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which consist of statements that cannot be confirmed by reference to existing information, including statements regarding our beliefs, goals, expectations, forecasts, projections and future performance and the assumptions underlying such statements. Please note that there are a number of factors that will cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements, including the factors identified and discussed in our earnings release today and in other SEC filings. Please recognize that, except as required by applicable law, we undertake no duty to update any forward-looking statements, and you should not place undue reliance on such statements.","We may also refer to some non-GAAP financial measures, which help facilitate comparisons across periods and with peers. For any non-GAAP measures we use, a reconciliation to the nearest corresponding GAAP measure can be found on our website and in our earnings release.","With me on the call today are Doug Lawler, Nick Dell'Osso, Frank Patterson, and Jason Pigott. Doug will begin the call and then turn the call over to Nick for a review of our financial results before we turn the teleconference over for Q&A.","So, with that, thank you, and I will now turn the teleconference over to Doug.","Robert Douglas Lawler - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Thank you, Brad, and good morning. 2017 was another foundational year for Chesapeake as we continued to transform all aspects of our company. We remain committed to building a strong value-generating enterprise that will be resilient to commodity price volatility and offer competitive returns for our investors.","Our business strategies of: one, financial discipline; two, profitable and efficient growth; three, exploration; and four, business development, have not changed. Today, all 2,800 Chesapeake employees are focused and driven toward achieving our three top priorities, eliminating $2 billion to $3 billion of net debt from our balance sheet, enhancing our margins and achieving positive free cash flow. We made important progress toward reaching all three priorities in 2017. I'm proud of our accomplishments during this challenging pricing environment and strongly believe our transformational improvements are second to no other company.","We once again demonstrated the depth of our portfolio by closing on approximately $1.3 billion in asset sales that had minimal associated cash flow. We also continued to simplify our capital structure by reducing our secured term debt by approximately $1.3 billion or 32%. We enhanced our margins, growing overall production by approximately 3% and oil production by approximately 2% year-over-year adjusting for asset sales, while importantly reducing our cost structure by more than $500 million on an annual basis, or roughly $0.58 per barrel oil equivalent.","We continued to reduce our legal complexity and our employees delivered record environmental, health and safety performance in 2017. We improved on our industry-leading operating performance across all plays with record lateral lengths in all assets and significant productivity gains through enhanced completions. As a result of these achievements, four of our six major assets were cash flow positive in 2017. And at current strip prices and with the divestitures announced a few weeks ago, Chesapeake is positioned to be cash flow positive in 2018.","While I'm proud of the progress we made, I assure you we are not done. In 2018, we expect to grow our total production, adjusted for asset sales, by approximately 3% year-over-year and our oil volumes will be approximately 5% compared to 2017 levels.","Our priorities will deliver further improvements in capital efficiency, greater cash generation and shareholder return through prudent investments in our highest return projects. We will continue to drive costs out of our operations, improve margins and utilize advancing technologies to create value across our portfolio. Ultimately, we will deliver increased EBITDA in 2018 despite a meaningfully lower capital program and lower absolute production volumes.","As stated earlier, restoring the health of our balance sheet remains a top priority. We are in active conversations regarding multiple, large divestiture transactions and while our debt maturity schedule affords us the opportunity to be prudent in our approach, we are committed to making material progress towards our goal of $2 billion to $3 billion in debt reduction in 2018.","We have also transformed this company in ways many thought not possible a few short years ago. We have reduced our total leverage by over 50% since year-end 2012. We have achieved nearly a $7 billion reduction to our midstream and transportation commitments since 2014. We have reduced our CapEx budget by 83% over the last five years while keeping our adjusted production relatively flat.","We have established ourselves as a cash cost leader in our industry by cutting our costs in half during this transformation. And we have done all of this while making a 92% improvement across all key environmental, health and safety metrics. I could not be more proud today of the effort, dedication and commitment, the value and safety our employees have displayed and continue to display on a daily basis.","While we know we have important work ahead, the future of this company is bright, and I believe we have the strategy, assets and, most importantly, the people to deliver significant upside and value to our shareholders. We are well-positioned to deliver our strategic priorities in 2018. In June, I'll record my fifth anniversary at Chesapeake Energy.","We have tackled many great obstacles the past few years, but the measurement of this great company will be what we deliver in the next five years. I'm excited, encouraged, and I would not underestimate the grit and determination of the company that has made the most progress during this depressed commodity price environment.","One last comment from me. Chesapeake has built a track record of continuous sequential improvement in our business. We have delivered what we said we would deliver. The substantial improvements in our company over the last five years have not accrued to the common shareholder due to commodity price and legacy burdensome debt commitments and obligations. But as our legacy obligations have largely been removed, the common shareholder is in an excellent position from our significantly improved fundamental business model.","I'll now pass the call to Nick.","[0B432N-E Nick Dell'Osso]","Thanks, Doug, and good morning, everyone. As Doug stated, the transformative changes we have made at Chesapeake over the past four years have been significant. And this was again evident in 2017 as we improved our cost structure, generated approximately $1.3 billion from asset sales, reduced a meaningful amount of our secured debt, eliminated legal complexities and recorded the best environmental and safety performance in our company's history.","Despite our accomplishments, we view last year as simply a setup year that has positioned us to create increased shareholder returns in 2018 and beyond. 2017 was about restoring our production profile, reducing legacy liabilities and improving profitability. As seen in our outlook this morning, 2018 has us delivering greater value on less spending. Our adjusted production will grow while our costs and CapEx will decline. As a result, we will generate more operating cash and free cash in 2018 as compared to 2017.","We are pleased with this outlook and its implied improvements in capital efficiency and operating profitability. Further, we are pleased with the balance sheet improvements we continue to highlight through our recently announced asset sale agreements for properties in the Mid-Continent, including a sales agreement for our Mississippi Lime assets signed earlier this month. Once closed, these transactions alone are projected to remove approximately $0.14 per barrel from our total LOE and GP&T expenses in 2018.","In addition, we recently sold approximately 4.3 million shares for net proceeds of $74 million from our legacy investment in FTS International, which completed its initial public offering earlier this month. We continue to hold approximately 22 million additional shares in this publicly traded company. All together, we expect approximately $575 million from signed or already closed asset sales and the partial sale of our FTS shares.","We expect that the proceeds from our asset divestitures and the FTSI investment will go toward producing our outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility for repurchasing high-coupon debt to reduce our annual interest expense. If applied to our highest-cost debt, the transaction signed in late 2017 and to-date in 2018 could reduce our interest expense up to $50 million annually.","As Doug stated, we continue to pursue multiple larger transactions as we work toward our goal of removing an additional $2 billion to $3 billion of debt from our balance sheet. The combination of our asset sales and our expected cash flow at today's strip prices will result in Chesapeake being free cash flow positive in 2018 after our planned capital spending and financing costs.","Our expected cash flow is largely protected by our strong hedge position in 2018. We have approximately 68% of our projected 2018 gas production hedged at $3.10 per mcf and approximately 79% of our crude oil production hedged at $52.41 per barrel.","Additionally, on the basis front, our crude and gas pipeline commitments are providing support for competitive basis realizations through access to premium markets, as seen in our strong Q4 realizations. We have also hedged approximately half of our exposure to the LLS oil pricing contract at $3.32 per barrel over WTI and half of our in-basin gas exposure at $0.77 less the NYMEX, a market improvement to 2017 prices for this location. We believe it is prudent to protect a portion of our cash flow through hedging and we'll continue to watch for opportunities to hedge both our gas and oil exposure for 2019.","On the operations front, we do experienced some outages and delays due to cold weather across several of our operating areas in January. However, despite this lower production, our earnings and cash flow have benefited greatly from the impact of higher commodity prices, primarily due to the cold early winter weather as well as the premium received on our oil sold under LLS contracts.","Because we remain focused on growing cash flow rather than growing our volumes, we are pleased to highlight further progress toward all of our goals with our 2018 guidance that we released this morning. All of our operating cost items are projected to be lower in 2018 using midpoints. This is all being done with production growth, adjusted for asset sales, of 1 %to 5%, on planned capital expenditures that are 12% lower from 2017.","We believe increasing cash flow while decreasing investment is a strong recipe for success. The improvement in our cost structure, capital efficiency, oil production and margin growth are all generating more EBITDA at current NYMEX prices and free cash flow, as well as increased financial returns from our assets. As Doug noted, the significant profitability and cash flow improvements for the last several years have gone toward reducing legacy commitments and obligations. We have direct line of sight today on these improvements delivering real shareholder returns in the coming periods.","Chesapeake is getting stronger, and while we believe this is not being fully recognized in the marketplace, we are poised to create meaningful shareholder value in the months and years ahead.","That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question will come from Neal Dingmann with SunTrust.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Good morning, guys. Hey, Doug, could you talk about your ideal leverage situation here in the next year or two, given what you're going to potentially have in free cash flow?","Robert Douglas Lawler - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Well, yeah, Neal, thanks for the question. Ideal leverage, it really is a good question when you look at Chesapeake and the progress we've made in the past few years. And we have put those targets out there that we target to be a 2x company. We believe that's the appropriate place that we need to be. And as we've highlighted the progress that we've made, we have not been able to deliver all of the proceeds and cash generation to further reduce that debt in the past few years like we'd like to, as we've cleaned up other legacy obligations.","And so, if you ask, straight out, the ideal place is we'd be at 2x. Well, we're not at 2x. And we'll continue to work that direction over the next few years. We'll do it as quickly as we possibly can. Key in that is we're not going to dilute the value of the company and we're not selling high-quality assets for $0.50 on the $1. And the way that our financial team, Nick and the financial group have managed our debt obligations, the debt that we have retired, the ability to refinance, extend some maturities, and all the while reducing complexity across our business, you can expect that to continue.","And so to say we have an ideal debt target, it's \u2013 we'll get to 2x. We've got $2 billion to $3 billion of targeted debt reduction from a major asset sale that we will conclude as fast as we possibly can.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Great points, Doug. And then just one last follow-up, on slide 6 where you break out the rig position you have now in each of the areas. Based on the CapEx that you have, do you anticipate that changing throughout the year or staying relatively sort of stable, meaning the Powder and the Eagle Ford still having the bulk of the rigs? Any color there would be appreciated. Thanks, Doug.","Frank J. Patterson - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Yeah, Neal. This is Frank Patterson. And I'll let Jason also chip in here. We continually manage where we spend our capital every week. We've talked about this before. I think we have a capital allocation. We're going to move rigs where the best value is for the corporation. I would say that you're going to see us move to four rigs in the Powder, try to move to five as fast as we possibly can. We're currently running five rigs in South Texas to get in front of a relatively big ranch area with an extra rig. We'll probably drop that rig and go back to four. But that will all be evaluated as we see the year unfold.","I don't see us actually adding any to the gas assets. We will be doing some appraisal work in the Mid-Con. If that were to take off, we could we could reallocate a rig there, if we had success there. Jason, do you have anything there?","Jason M. Pigott - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Not much to add. Just it's an exciting time for us on the drilling, completions and technology world as we test new completion designs and we've seen instances where overnight we've doubled the productivity of wells. So when we do things like that, it may change where we send a rig, but it's a really exciting time for us as we look at how information can help optimize the way we drill and complete wells. And the teams are very competitive. When they lose a rig, they find a new way to make their wells better as well, so we can kind of create some competition as well. But it's a really fun and exciting time for Chesapeake and how we're approaching developing these fields.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Great. Thanks so much, guys.","Operator","From JPMorgan, Arun Jayaram.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning, Doug. I wondered if you could just talk a little bit about the A&D market. You highlighted $2 billion to $3 billion of potential asset sales. It looks like you've signed on $500 million. So just maybe some thoughts around A&D and confidence in getting to your targeted range in asset sales.","Robert Douglas Lawler - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","My thoughts there, Arun, are probably exactly as you'd expect. It's very heavily price dependent. We still see out there for large and small asset sales that the backwardated curves, the confidence in fuller pricing is low, values associated with future development are minimal and that makes it extremely challenging. As we look at our portfolio, as we look at further opportunities to tighten and core up in areas, there will be further smaller incremental asset sales that we will pursue. We have a very large asset base. So those are options that we can always look to and always find strategics or smaller buyers private equity that are looking for \u2013 trying to build an asset position in an area where we may not get to that area for a long period of time. So accelerating that value forward makes a lot of sense. So you can expect that.","On the larger side, you still in the market do not see a lot of large transactions and we do have significant interest in our asset base that that interest comes from technology, it comes from record performance and the capital efficiency that our teams have driven into this portfolio. The clear line of sight and the improving returns that have been captured in those assets are of value to others. And as we see that opportunity to divest, we'll do it, but we're going to do it at a prudent pace and at a price that is accretive to our balance sheet and to our shareholders.","So I think what you can expect is we'll be watching the market and we'll be continuing to look for the opportunities and eager to act as quickly as possible, but always with the focus on returns and being accretive to our shareholders and our cash generation.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Fair enough. And just a follow-up maybe on the Powder River Basin. You guys highlighted a pretty strong Turner well in the press release. Just want to know if you could talk about future opportunities in the Turner and any plans? I know Devon talked about testing the Niobrara in the Powder. Any plans for tests in Niobrara there?","Frank J. Patterson - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Yeah. This is Frank Patterson again. What you're going to see in 2018 is basically a Turner-focused program in the Powder. We are getting wells down faster and cheaper. Every time we go out, we're tweaking the completion and getting those costs down. So it's becoming more and more competitive every day.","We have three rigs running now, and basically all of those will be focused on Turner going forward. We'll bring the fourth rig in and put that on Turner as well. When we bring the fifth rig in, we'll probably focus on Turner, but we could focus some time on the Sussex and the Nio. The Nio we already have significant number of wells in the ground historically in the play. What we know from what we've done in the last couple years, we can make those wells a lot more economic with new completion design and longer wells. That's the direction we will head.","It is not as competitive today as the Turner, so we're going to focus on where the greatest value is today. I think Turner becomes very valuable to us in the not too distant future. I believe that we have a significant number of Mowry, Parkman and other formations within that footprint that will evolve over time. We will focus today, though, on the greatest value and the greatest value in that asset is going to be Turner.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks, Frank.","Operator","Next we'll hear from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good morning.","Robert Douglas Lawler - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Hey, Brian.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Can you talk a little bit more on the Eagle Ford and the Haynesville? It looks like you're, probably for disciplined reasons, reducing the number of wells being completed this year, but I wondered if you could talk to how the intensity and productivity of the 2018 wells would compare to the 2017 wells.","Frank J. Patterson - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Brian, this is Frank again. In South Texas, as we're doing with almost every single one of our assets, we're trying to align the number of rigs and activity with how productive we are. We're actually knocking out wells faster. So we're getting a lot more productivity out of rigs trying to align those rigs with completion crews.","What we found last year, logistically, if you get in front of your completion crews, you build too big a DUC inventory. If you don't have a standing DUC inventory or a working DUC inventory of sufficient size, you might have to drop a completion crew, and that's very, very inefficient. So what we're trying to do around all of our assets is align our rigs to where we can be as efficient as possible with the completion crew.","So we are going to run five rigs today in South Texas and probably drop to four and try to stay pretty consistent with the three completion crew count. We may be able to drop to two at that point. The wells are highly productive. We have to align that activity pace with our ability to build out the larger facilities for the common facilities. So that's all basically running a efficient, highly effective logistics machine.","In the Gulf Coast, you see the same thing. We can run three rigs and basically keep one crew, potentially up to two crews at times, full capacity. In the Powder, one of the things we've struggled with in the last few months is three rigs can drill wells, but we're being so effective on our completions now, we can't keep one crew busy. So going to four rigs I think is going to align us really well with the completion crew. So this is all about maximizing the value of every dollar we spend.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Got it. Yeah. I was probably focused a little bit more just on the well count coming down and the underlying productivity of each well, but certainly the rig productivity is noteworthy.","In terms of my follow-up, can you talk to just a bit more on the quarterly trajectory for production? I think you mentioned in your comments, as have others, some of the weather disruptions in the first quarter. This last quarter's production was very, very strong on a sequential basis. Can you just kind of talk a little bit more about what we should see as we go through the year?","Frank J. Patterson - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Yeah, Brian. This is Frank again. We came out of the fourth quarter off of a really big completion ramp. That has now stabilized out. We're back in the field now going into the completion mode again in mid-January.","To be honest with you, we're doing well. We don't have a lot of experience with some of the completion designs that we have, how the wells are going to behave. They're behaving actually quite well both on the gas and the oil side. So what we're going to see is a little bit lower production coming into this first quarter, which was totally anticipated. We will ramp off of that and basically build just kind of a steady build through the year. And our plan is to try to keep that build going for years out.","Robert Douglas Lawler - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","I might just add \u2013 Brian, this is Doug \u2013 on top of that, the comments that Frank shared with you that as we pulled back our capital program in the past few years and maintained and adjusted for asset sales relatively flat production profile and also with our focus on that reduced capital program and the balance sheet, we have made up for capital dollars being expended through technology and capital efficiency.","And while we have the opportunity to spend more, we have focused on trying to reach that positive free cash flow as quickly as possible in the most efficient way possible. And as a result of that, we have adjusted our capital program throughout the years, throughout 2016, throughout 2017 that resulted in some lumpiness in our quarter-by-quarter production. And our goal is to eliminate or take some of that volatility amplitude out of our production profile while we continue to improve year-over-year, but maintain a more steady approach. And we're in position in 2018 as we roll through the first quarter to do that and have a more predictable profile.","And I'm encouraged by the work that's been done on the team to take out some of that volatility based on the capital investment pace and based on the capital efficiency and technology improvements we've recognized across the portfolio.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Very helpful. Thank you very much.","Operator","And we have time for one more question and that will come from Sameer Panjwani with Tudor, Pickering, Holt.","Sameer Panjwani - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Hey, guys. Good morning. I wanted to ask on the asset sales without getting into specific details. But it looks like for the past several years, you guys have been prioritizing the oil assets more than the gas assets. And even earlier in the Q&A session, you guys mentioned that very unlikely to see added activity to the gas assets. And so I'm wondering should we think about the potential asset sales to continue that shift of your production mix to a more liquids-rich kind of mix over time, or is it just you're kind of looking at all different options right now.","Domenic J. Dell\u2019Osso - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Hey, Sameer. This is Nick. I'll take that. So our asset sale approach, our portfolio redefinition, if you will, is going to continue to be all about value. As we look at how we create value in our program going forward, we are long gas today. So we have focused on some of the opportunities to sell down the gas portion of our portfolio. We also see some really attractive return opportunities in areas like the Powder River. And then as we're really redefining how we're going to create value in the Eagle Ford over the next couple years, we see just a tremendous amount of opportunity there. So as we think about what our best opportunities from a portfolio standpoint are, they have led us to gas.","That being said, we are value-agnostic, return-agnostic, we want to drive for highest value, highest returns. And if opportunities arise to sell out of an oil asset or down in an oil asset, those are things that we will continue to consider.","One thing that I would note for you is that there is some increasing interest around some gas assets from what I would think of as strategic and maybe nontraditional participants in the standard U.S. onshore A&D market, and it's a contrarian view. Gas is extremely out of favor in the equity markets, as you all know, and extremely out of favor in many circles. But the recognition of the fact that there is real financial return to be created in these assets and that there are some encouraging long-term supply\/demand dynamics by some participants in the market, particularly those that might be connected to world markets, is real.","And so we have ongoing discussions across all of our portfolio around transactions that will materially improve our balance sheet. And materially improving our balance sheet will allow us to increase the rate of return on everything else we own. And that's what our asset sale program will continue to be focused on. That's how we'll look to deliver value.","Sameer Panjwani - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Thank you.","Robert Douglas Lawler - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","So, in closing, thank you, everyone, for your time. We've had an outstanding year. We look forward to strong 2018. Our record share is incremental, predictable improvement each year, we'll continue upon that. Chesapeake has always been focused on returns and value. This company didn't get religion when prices went south. We're focused on returns and value. And the progress and the improvements we've made have not directly accrued to the common shareholder. We are positioned for that to take place now as those legacy obligations have been substantially improved upon and eliminated from our business. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's presentation.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Jeff Mobley. Please go ahead, sir.","Jeffrey L. Mobley","Good morning, and thank you for joining our call today to discuss Chesapeake's financial and operational results for the 2011 fourth quarter and full year. I would like to begin by directing your attention to the slide presentation available on our website that we will refer to in our prepared remarks this morning. The slides can be accessed at www.chk.com, then selecting the Investor tab near the top of the page, followed by the Presentations section in the menu bar. ","I would next like to introduce the other members of our management team who are with me today on the call: Aubrey McClendon, our Chief Executive Officer; Steve Dixon, our Chief Operating Officer; Nick Dell'Osso, our Chief Financial Officer; and John Kilgallon, our Director of Investor Relations and Research. Our prepared comments today will be a bit longer than our typical call as we have added additional detail on our operational performance that will be highlighted by Steven Dixon. We will then move to Q&A. I'd now like to turn the call over to Aubrey.","Aubrey K. McClendon","Thank you, Jeff, and good morning. We are very pleased with our company's operational and financial performance during 2011. Here are a few highlights to consider when analyzing our performance for the year. ","Turning to Slide #2. For the full year, we increased our production by 26% before asset sales and 15% after asset sales. Chesapeake remains the largest gas producer in the U.S. on a gross basis and the second largest on a net basis. More importantly, we moved up to the 11th largest oil producer in the U.S. during 2011 from the 15th largest in 2010 and from the 21st largest in 2009. We increased our proved reserves by 26% before asset sales and 10% after asset sales. And we now have proved reserves of approximately 19 Tcfe or the equivalent of 3.1 billion barrels of proved reserves. We found through the drillbit a remarkable 5.6 Tcfe of proved reserves at the very low drilling and completion cost of only $1.08 per Mcfe. Stated on a BOE basis, we found almost 1 billion barrels of oil organically. These results are unmatched in the industry and form the core of our ability to continue creating shareholder net asset value every year of at least $10 billion. ","Chesapeake's risk unproved resources are now in excess of 110 Tcfe. And between our proved reserves and unproved resources, we control more oil and natural gas resources in the U.S. than any other company. Based on our present market valuation, this unproved resource base is quite amazingly available free of cost to our investors. During 2011, our net long-term debt on an absolute basis declined by 18% and on a relative basis, which includes benefit of the growth of our proved reserves base, net debt for proved reserves declined by 25%. Further, we believe approximately $1 billion of our total long-term debt should be reasonably allocated through our midstream and oilfield service businesses. After this allocation, our E&P debt is only $0.49 per proved Mcfe, which is clearly an investment-grade metric and is in fact, lower than at least one of our investment-grade rated peers. ","We are focusing on creating per share value for our investors, and so we are proud to deliver strong operational and financial performance without incremental equity from the public markets. During 2011, our fully diluted share count increased by only 0.6%, which is solely related to employee stock compensation. I believe we still remain the only large cap E&P company that distributes restricted stock to virtually all of its employees, in our case today, nearly 13,000 people. I believe this practice at least partially accounts for the hardworking, creative and motivated organization that we have built. ","Speaking of which, on Slide #3, I am proud to highlight that recently, Chesapeake was named by FORTUNE Magazine as the 18th Best Company to Work For in the U.S., including the fifth best among companies with more than 10,000 employees. In addition, we were #1 among all companies in the oil and gas business. This is our fifth consecutive year on this prestigious list, and we have moved up from #61 to #18 in those 5 years. I would also like to mention that our fellow Oklahoma City producer Devon is ranked #28th on the list. That means that of the more than 400 publicly listed oil and gas producers in the U.S., only 3 made the top 100 Best Companies to Work For, and 2 of those 3 are located right here in Oklahoma City, a very noteworthy achievement for our community. ","Turning to Slide #4. During 2011, we sold assets for $8.5 billion, reaping pretax economic gains of $5.6 billion from those sales, or a profit margin of approximately 65%. Please note, however, that because of the conservatism of full cost accounting, only $437 million of those gains appeared on our income statement. On a percentage basis, our liquids production increased by 72% in 2011 versus 2010. This is the second-best track record of oil production growth in the industry on a relative basis. On an absolute basis, our liquids production increased by 36,000 barrels per day, also the second-best performance in the industry. Further impressive liquids production growth lies ahead for Chesapeake. For 2012, we believe our liquids production will increase by more than 70% or approximately 63,000 barrels per day compared to 2011. We remain convinced that Chesapeake will become a top 5 producer of liquids in the U.S. by 2015, with more than 250,000 barrels per day of liquids production. ","Moreover, on Slide 5, we announced our 25\/25 Plan in January 2011 that stated we would reduce our net long-term debt by 25% and increase our production by 25% during 2011 and '12. I'm pleased to report that during 2011, we achieved 72% of our debt reduction target and 60% of our original production growth target. With regard to unproved leasehold, always a popular topic among observers of our company, we invested $3.5 billion during the year and collected $4.4 billion in sales of unproved leasehold, resulting in a net cash unproven leasehold inflow of $900 million. At the beginning of the year, I committed that our undeveloped leasehold sales would be at least equal to our undeveloped leasehold acquisitions during 2011. As you can see, I was off by $900 million, but off to the good side. I further commit that in 2012 and 2013, we will also likely generate more cash from undeveloped leasehold sales than we will spend in undeveloped leasehold. Please keep in mind that these numbers are cash-only and excludes the benefit of drilling carries that we receive when we sell portions of our undeveloped leasehold. If we included carries in our calculation of the leasehold sales, these numbers would obviously look even better. The final takeaway, I think, on leasehold investment should be this: Whatever we spend on leasehold acquisitions in a given year, we will more than offset it from undeveloped leasehold sales. ","How are we able to continue doing this, you might ask? It's actually quite simple. Chesapeake is the best in the industry at finding new unconventional plays, acquiring big leasehold positions in the heart of the plays, and then selling off a minority interest to a bigger company from elsewhere in the world that cannot do what we do but has access to capital that we do not have. These are truly symbiotic relationships that benefit both companies, and I'm proud to say that Chesapeake was the first to recognize this extraordinary business opportunity back in 2008. Today, we have -- to date, we have entered into 7 JVs that have generated $7.1 billion in cash from undeveloped leasehold sales and $9 billion from drilling carries for a total value generated of $16.1 billion. Our cost basis in the assets sold was only $3.8 billion. That's an economic profit of $12.3 billion or more than a 3:1 return. However, again, due to the conservatism of full cost accounting, none of these gains are presented in our income statement. ","Turning to Slide 6. During 2011, we were the first company to establish commercial production from the Utica Shale, the first big new shale play since the Eagle Ford was developed -- discovered in 2008. We're very excited about the Utica, our results to date and its future potential. Steve Dixon will have some new well results for you from the Utica in a few minutes. To date, we have invested approximately $2.2 billion in the play and have sold off roughly 20% of our leasehold for a total cash and carry value of about $2.3 billion. Said another way, we recovered 105% of our cost to date and yet still have 80% of our acreage left. That's exceptional under any circumstances, but especially when you consider that Chesapeake's average holding period in its Utica leases is only about 1 year. ","On Slide 7, I wanted to point out that in 2011, we generated gains of $437 million from a drop-down transaction with our midstream affiliate, CHKM, that trades on the New York Stock Exchange. Please remember that most of our peer companies, unlike CHK, failed to capture midstream profits for their shareholders. We believe this is a very key element as to why Chesapeake's integrated business strategy is a superior business model. Also during 2011, we formed COS, that's Chesapeake Oilfield Services, a company that holds our various oilfield service businesses. Inside of COS, we own the nation's fourth largest drilling contractor, the nation's largest oilfield trucking company, one of the nation's largest oilfield tool rental businesses. And we are also building under the name of Petroleum (sic) [Performance] Technologies Limited, or PTL, what will become a top 5 fracture stimulation company. ","We now have 2 PTL frac crews in the field. And by the end of 2012, we will have a total of 8 frac crews active. And by the end of 2013, we will have a total of 12 crews in the field. We believe that by having Chesapeake's own in-house frac-ing capability, it leads to greater efficiencies and lower costs. We believe COS will make an excellent candidate for an IPO later this year, and it is another example of the benefits of Chesapeake's vertically integrated business strategy. Also in the service industry, with strong support from Temasek and RRJ Capital, we helped to recapitalize Frac Tech Services in 2011, which is today the fourth largest fracture stimulation company in the U.S. We own 30% of this fine company and have a cost-based incentive of only $100 million. Meaning, we have an embedded profit that will likely exceed $1 billion. ","Slide #8 shows that our commodity hedging program generated strong gain again this year. After our gains of $1.6 billion in 2011, we have now generated $8.4 billion of hedging gains in just the past 5 years, by far the best track record of hedging success in the industry. And finally, even in the face of sharply lower natural gas prices, our 2011 adjusted EBITDA and cash flow increased by 6% and 3% compared to 2010's numbers. We think this is a pretty extraordinary achievement given what happened to natural gas prices in 2011. ","On Slide 9, during the year, we also continued our industry-leading effort to increase demand for natural gas. One such project was to help lead $400 million of investments through multiple transactions in Clean Energy Fuels, stock symbol CLNE on the New York Stock Exchange. Clean Energy is the nation's largest provider of natural gas and to transportation fuel, and they have a very strong momentum in building out the infrastructure for America's natural gas super highway. I can assure you that the move is underway to move the nation's transportation sector increasingly away from imported diesel and gasoline towards domestically produced and much cheaper natural gas. ","You might also take note of yesterday's press release in which the 3M Company and Chesapeake agreed to jointly deliver a breakthrough in CNG fuel tank technology that will help lower the cost of natural gas vehicles. Also for the benefit of our entire industry, we have curtailed approximately 15% of our gross operated production or approximately 1 Bcf per day. Our share of this curtailed gas is about 50%. This is, of course, far more than anyone else in the industry has announced, and we think it speaks volumes about Chesapeake's financial flexibility and operational strength that we can make this sacrifice and still reach all of our objectives for the year. ","On Slide #10, the most important element of our ongoing success is Chesapeake's very high asset quality. I'm proud to report that Chesapeake now owns the largest or second-largest positions in the following 15 leading U.S. unconventional plays. Starting first with gas shale plays: we are #1 in the Haynesville; #1 in the Bossier; #1 in the Marcellus; and #2 in the Barnett. Moving to liquids-rich plays: we are #1 in the Utica; #2 in the Eagle Ford Shale; #1 in the Cleveland tight sands; #1 in the Tonkawa tight sands; #1 in the core area of the Granite Wash; #1 in the Mississippi Lime; and #1 in the Powder River Basin, Niobrara Shale. ","And in the Permian Basin, we believe our overall acreage position of 1.5 million net acres is tied for the second largest in the basin. In this largest oil-producing basin in the U.S. and arguably the hottest basin in the world, we have leading positions in the Wolfcamp, Avalon, Bone Spring and Wolfberry plays. So even if we were to sell 100% of our Permian Basin assets, Chesapeake would still retain a #1 or #2 position in 11 of the nation's best gas and liquids-rich plays. We're not aware of any other company that can claim more than 2 or 3 of such positions. Reviewing this extraordinarily high-quality lineup of assets, it should be no surprise to you that Chesapeake has single-handedly generated 30% of all the natural gas production growth in the U.S. during the past 5 years. It should also help explain how we have increased our liquids production by 170% in the past 2 years and how we intend to increase it by a further 190% in the next 4 years. As a result, we believe Chesapeake will likely turn in the best liquids production growth performance in the U.S. and one of the best in the world during the next few years. ","On Slide 11, we entered 2012 with a strong momentum and sound business strategy to continue making the shift from a 90% natural gas producer in 2009 to a much more balanced producer in the years ahead. However, we acknowledge that this shift away from gas to oil has required us to outspend our cash flow, and we also acknowledge this is causing anxiety among some investors and observers of our company. However, with our detailed announcement on February 13, we have now clearly articulated a strong plan of action that should enable us to generate $10 billion to $12 billion of proceeds from asset monetizations this year, that when combined with our operating cash flow will easily fund the gap between our operating cash flow and our capital expenditure on our spending for the year. It will also probably prefund any gap in 2013 as well, which will be much smaller, by the way, than this year's gap, as natural gas prices will likely increase, as supply growth wanes and demand growth comes on strong. More importantly, Chesapeake's production mix will continue to tilt towards more liquids production, and therefore, will generate more revenue per unit of production. By 2014, we are confident the company will reach breakeven between its operating cash flow and capital expenditures, even if natural gas prices remain at depressed levels, which given the rapidly changing supply and demand fundamentals emerging in real time before us today, we think is very unlikely. ","However, despite the obvious very good place where we are headed with our surging liquids production and despite the obvious very bad place we would be if we'd simply stayed within our cash flow and remain a 90% natural gas producer, I still read a surprisingly large amount of analyst commentary that remains singularly, and in my opinion, unimaginatively focused on how much CapEx we have spent. Our job as the management stewards of shareholders' capital is to create the highest amount per share of net asset value possible within our overall financial capabilities. That is why we focus on the outputs of our business, while it seems other people seem to obsess over the inputs to our business. But it is not the inputs that matter at the end of the day, it is the outputs. And our outputs are not only increasing in size, but also increasing in value on a per unit of production basis. ","And by achieving this quite remarkable and utterly complete transformation of our company in just 3 years, we will arrive at a place in 2014 when we are cash flow-positive and to a place in 2015 when our cash flow should be $10 billion to $11 billion and our company will be valued at several multiples higher than our total enterprise value to date. This will create enormous value for our shareholders in the next few years. Again, if inputs were the only thing that mattered, then we would live today within our cash flow and sit here and hope and pray for higher natural gas prices. But it is indeed outputs that matter, and so that's what our focus is on, to increase those outputs and total volumes and to increase the per unit value of those assets, or outputs rather, while at the same time delevering the company by 25% on an absolute basis and close to 40% on a relative basis in just 2 years. ","And by the way, we will get all this done in an environment of sub $3 natural gas prices. It's not easy, and I read that several analysts this morning are skeptical about our ability to achieve this transformation. But their skepticism will not be rewarded at the end of the day, while indeed our shareholders will be greatly rewarded. I'll now turn the call over to Nick for his further comments about the company's financial performance.","Domenic J. Dell\u2019Osso","Thanks, Aubrey. It's been an exciting start to 2012, and we're very pleased about where we're headed. First, to cover our Q4 and full year results, I'd like to point to our $2.80 per share in EPS, driven by production growth and cost control. Our LOE for the fourth quarter came in at $0.88 per Mcfe, a decrease of $0.02 per Mcfe over Q4 2010. In addition, current year LOE includes approximately $0.11 per Mcfe from the effects of VPPs. This is evidence of some of the efficiencies we've been able to create within the country's largest drilling program and vertically integrated model. We do expect this metric to tick up a bit in the future as producing oil and NGLs is more expensive. However, we're quite proud of the base from which we will grow and we'll continue to take advantage of our model to deliver a best-in-class cost structure. ","From a balance sheet perspective, our production and year-end debt balance show great progress towards our 25\/25 Plan. One quick note I'd like to add to the previous comments on our production growth target moving back to the original 25% level as a result of our curtailment decision is that in our outlook on Schedule A of our earnings release, we note a total assumed curtailment of 130 Bcfe during 2012. If we had chosen to produce the curtailed volumes, we would have achieved an additional 13% production growth or 38% -- total of 38% production growth in 2010, a remarkable level for a company of our size. We will certainly be poised to take advantage of rebounding gas prices when they occur. ","It's been our strategy to continue executing on 2 of our primary goals in 2012, increasing oil and liquids production and decreasing our financial leverage. We made the decision to stay the course on these goals even in the face of low natural gas prices, as we feel achieving a balance in our production profile and decreasing leverage are key to growing long-term shareholder value. As a result, as Aubrey mentioned earlier, we have been playing to outspend our operating cash flow this year. We were pleased to provide more transparency on how we plan to do that last week with our announcement regarding significant asset sales and other monetizations we plan to pursue in 2012 and hope that the table at the bottom of our 2012, 2013 outlook makes all of our investing activities for the year very clear to you. This summary of cash inflows and outflows should highlight that we have given ourselves quite a bit of headroom in 2012. And inclusive of that carryover, we'll have quite a bit in 2013 as well. ","To clarify a few things you read last night and this morning, we have made very little material changes to CapEx and only tried to provide more detail and transparency through the view on what is being spent and what is being monetized. We, of course, have been working on these monetizations announced last week for quite sometime and always maintained a good amount of optionality on how we think about funding our business, given our asset-heavy business model. Our diversity of assets, which include proved reserves, natural gas and oil production, large acreage positions and vertically integrated midstream and service company investments, provide a variety of assets from which there are many different buyers that find attractive assets within our portfolio. Great examples of the variety of assets we choose to monetize to buyers seeking different return profiles are: our Colony Granite Wash royalty trust, where primarily retail investors receive an income stream tied to the specific production of a certain field; and our Utica wet gas JV, where an international major took a significant exposure to a largely undeveloped play in Ohio with tremendous upside exposure. ","Further, in the outlook on our press release today, I'll point out that we have lowered our gas price forecast to more closely match the strip and now project 2012 operating cash flow before changes in working capital to be $4.85 billion at the midpoint of our range. Please remember that approximately 60% of our revenue in 2012 will come from oil and natural gas liquids at the prices modeled here and we hedged 43% of that production at approximately $102.50 per barrel. Also, please note that our operating cash flow projections are expected to increase by 65% in 2013 versus 2012. ","If you look at Slide 15 in this morning's presentation, you'll see that even if prices were to remain flat, our cash flow will jump by 35%. That's very exciting growth and really highlights the benefits of our shift to liquids-focused assets and the return we are seeing on our investment in liquids-rich acreage positions for the last several years. With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve to give an overview of some of our recent significant operational achievements.","Steven C. Dixon","Thanks, Nick. Moving onto Slide 18. 2011 marked another outstanding year for Chesapeake operationally. I'm very proud of the results in 2011 for our entire team as we continued our best-in-class performance and in reserves and production at very low cost while maintaining our high standard for safety and a keen focus on environmental stewardship. ","During 2011, we produced nearly 1.2 Tcfe on a net basis and increased our gross operated production to 6.4 Bcf per day. We finished the year with 18.8 Tcfe of proved reserves based on SEC pricing, and that's after sales of 2.8 Tcfe of proved reserves, primarily from our Fayetteville Shale transaction with BHP. Our operational teams performed exceptionally well during a rising oilfield service cost environment in 2011. And we delivered 5.6 Tcfe in proved reserve additions due to drillbit at a drilling completion cost of only $1.08 per Mcfe or approximately $6.50 per BOE. ","Notably, our reserve additions in just that 1 year of 2011 exceeded the total proved reserves of all but just a handful of our competitors, many of which have been in operation for more than 20 years. As an operator, we drove a total of 1,680 gross wells and connected more than 1,400 wells, or about 1 every 6 hours, and substantially all of these were horizontal wells. This is an unprecedented level of activity, a performance the industry has never seen before. We also participated in another 1,250 wells drilled by others, and those operators turned 1,050 wells online during the year. ","Slide 19 shows, in executing its business, Chesapeake enjoys tremendous competitive advantages through the size and scale but also by utilizing the largest data set in the industry that benefits from the most active drilling program in America, the largest U.S. leasehold position and a unique ability to evaluate technical and petrophysical data in our Reservoir Technology Center that has analyzed more feet of shale cores since its opening in April 2007 than the rest of the industry combined. Our company has developed key abilities in new play identification, leasehold acquisition, large-scale drilling and completion programs, where we have ramped up to 20, 30, even 40 rigs in a single play. ","Our operations are further enhanced by our vertical integration into oilfield service and midstream operations. Our goal in the end is to conduct our operations better, faster, cheaper and safer than our competition so that we can lead the industry at a per share net asset value creation. As a result, Chesapeake has clearly become the partner of choice for many international companies seeking access with the lucrative low-risk U.S. onshore natural gas and liquids plays. And we look forward to completing additional partnerships and transactions later this year. ","I'd next like to highlight a few operational results in some of our key liquids-rich plays. On Slide 19 in our Eagle Ford Shale play, our total net production averaged over 17,700 BOE per day in 2011's fourth quarter. That's up 60% versus last quarter and 370% year-over-year. Our current gross operated production from the play is 45,500 BOE per day and 22,600 BOE per day on a net basis. Our production mix in this play is approximately 50% crude, 20% NGLs and 30% natural gas. We continue to be very pleased by our performance in the Eagle Ford, and it's a driving force behind our liquids production growth targets in the months and years ahead. To date, we have 108 wells that tested with peak oil rates of 500 barrels of oil or more. And that's not an equivalent basis, that's black oil in the tanks. We are producing 178 wells in the play to date and have a backlog of almost 200 additional wells to be completed and connected in the coming months. This will fuel our production ramp-up through the end of the year and into '13. ","We finished 2011 with 7 frac crews running in the play and will be up to 11 by mid-March of this year and 13 by the end of 2012. We've also doubled our drilling efficiency in the play since January 2010 based upon drilling feet per day to now approximately 725 feet per day. And this has driven down our days per [ph] wells and helped reduce costs. And great progress has been made in building and restructuring the play with the addition of 350 miles of pipeline during the year. We expect to gain greater transportation capacity as 80 more miles of pipeline and regional rail and loading terminals are put in. And we also are adding 85 oil hauling trucks from Chesapeake's very own trucking company within Thunder Oilfield Services. These actions help ensure that our oil moves to markets that give us the highest oil price possible. ","I'd next like to focus on the Anadarko Basin, where we dominate several very successful liquids-rich plays, including well-discussed and prolific Granite Wash plays. For this call, though, I'd like to highlight 3 plays that we previously have not highlighted in detail for competitive reasons: the Miss Lime play in Northern Oklahoma and Southern Kansas; and the Cleveland and Tonkawa plays in Western Oklahoma. In the Miss Lime on Slide 20, our total net production averaged over 10,500 BOE per day in the fourth quarter. That's up 31% compared to last quarter and up 141% compared to the period last year. Our current net production is 11,300 BOE per day. Our production mix in the play is approximately 40% crude oil, 15% NGLs and 45% natural gas. The plays on the Chesapeake is one that Chesapeake discovered with the industry's first horizontal well drilled here in 2007 and today is dominated by Chesapeake and our friends at SandRidge. We continue to drill prolific wells across the wide area in Alfalfa and Woods Counties in Oklahoma. We're currently operating 22 rigs in the play and will maintain that level through 2012. To date, we participate in 33 wells that have tested peak oil rates of 500 barrels of oil or more. We previously announced here our intention to bring in a JV partner in the play and hope to have some -- a successful transaction to share with you later this summer. ","Next, I'd like to cover the Cleveland and Tonkawa plays on Slide 21, where we also have a dominant acreage position. Our total net production from these 2 plays averaged nearly 18,000 barrels of oil per day in the 2011 fourth quarter. That's up 20% compared to the last quarter and up nearly 125% compared to this period last year. Our production mix in this play is 50% crude, 15% NGLs and 35% natural gas. To date, we have participated in 70 wells that tested with peak oil rates of 500 barrels of oil or more. And we are currently operating 20 rigs between the 2 plays and expect to maintain that level through 2012. ","Next is the Permian Basin on Slide 22, which we recently disclosed we are considering a joint venture or an outright sale. Most recognize that Permian is the most prolific basin in the U.S. and it garners significant incremental capital from the industry at current oil strip prices. Our 1.5 million net acre Permian acreage position is focused on key development plays: the Avalon, Bone Spring, Wolfcamp and Wolfberry. Fourth quarter net production was approximately 33,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. That's an increase of 23% compared to fourth quarter of last year. And in 2011, we tested 21 wells with an average peak rate of over 1,000 barrels of oil per day. We look forward to sharing more information with prospective partners and\/or buyers in our upcoming data approval [ph] process. ","And finally, I'm pleased to highlight our latest large-scale discovery, the Utica Shale that's on Slide 23. This is where we recently welcomed Total to the wet gas window in the play as our JV partner, as a follow-on transaction to our mutually successful partnership in the Barnett Shale. We are continuing to delineate efforts in the play with 6 rigs running in the wet gas window and one each in the oil and dry gas windows. We will -- plan on ramping up to 20 Utica rigs here by year-end 2012. To date, we've drilled 42 wells in the play, with 7 of those on production and 35 waiting on completion or pipeline connection. Two recent completions included our Burgett and Shaw wells in the Utica, which produced at peak 24-hour rates on average of 700 barrels and 3 million per day. We are already starting to see drilling efficiencies in this play and have our recent best well drilled spud to rig release is only 16 days, and that's compared to 2x or 3x of that for our earlier wells. Through our midstream efforts, we've installed 200 miles of pipeline -- will install 200 miles of pipeline in 2012 and our local field office presence continues to grow. All the major oilfield service providers are establishing a footprint locally as a result of our activity, and this is driving significant boost through Eastern Ohio. ","Moving onto Slide 24. We are operating 161 rigs and have accomplished approximately 90% of our planned transition to liquids-rich plays. We do expect our operated rig count will stay relatively level for the year at an average of approximately 161 rigs for the year. This is including 33 rigs in the Eagle Ford Shale; 22 in the Miss Lime play; 20 in the Cleveland and Tonkawa plays; 14 in the Utica Shale play; 13 in the Granite Wash plays; and 10 in the Permian Basin. During the remainder of the first quarter and into the second quarter, we will continue to see a drop in natural gas rigs until we get down to 12 rigs in the northeast portion of the Marcellus and down to 6 rigs in the Haynesville. We are already at our stated goal of 6 rigs in the Barnett. We expect to spend $7 billion to $7.5 billion on proved and unproved drilling and completion activities in 2012, approximately 85% of which will be directed towards our liquids-rich plays. ","Finally, I would like to conclude by highlighting 2 important achievements that demonstrate the company's commitment to best practices in the environmental, health and safety areas, it's on Slide 25. I'm pleased to report that 2011 was Chesapeake's safest year ever in conducting its operations. Our 2011 total recordable incident rate was an impressive 0.53. While our company has continued to grow, our OSHA reportable incidents continued to decrease. Since implementing the SAFE program in 2010, which stands for Stay Accident Free Everyday, COI has improved our safety performance by 34% while increasing employee count. In 2011, we set a new record by working over 1.5 million employee hours without a recordable injury. This is a very important accomplishment, and we are very committed to making 2012 also the safest year in the history of the company. ","We also make environmental stewardship a priority. And in early 2011, Chesapeake furthered its commitment to progressive operational, environmental and safety standards by formally adopting a set of operational principles for the company's employees, contractors, suppliers and vendors to guide its oil and gas exploration and production operations throughout the country. These guiding principles represent our commitment to our surface owners, mineral owners, local citizens, shareholders, government officials and regulators and all stakeholders to make progress in improving our operational performance by working in an environmentally respectful way. In addition, during 2011, Chesapeake joined a nationwide public registry, fracfocus.org, that discloses the additives in the company's hydraulic fracturing operations. We currently have more than 1,300 wells posted on fracfocus.org, accounting for more than 11% of all the wells posted to date, more than any other operator. ","In summary, Chesapeake has an outstanding year of operation in 2011, and we look forward to providing further strong growth, particularly in our liquids-rich plays as the year progresses. I would now like to turn the call back to the operator and open the call up for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Doug Leggate at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I'm going to try a couple, if I may. On the production outlook, you've kind of caveated in your commentary that the guidance excludes the potential of several deals over the course of this year. My question is really about the longer-term, the target to get to 250,000 barrels a day of liquids. Assuming that you do execute some of the transactions you're talking about, particularly the potential exit to the Permian, how would you see that longer-term trajectory in terms of liquids targets move around? Is it material or will it essentially remain unchanged?","Aubrey K. McClendon","Remain unchanged, Doug.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So can you give us some idea as to what the headroom is?","Aubrey K. McClendon","Well, it's enough to handle a full divestiture of the Permian, if that's your question. It's about 5% of our current production, so we have -- continue to have a lot of headroom. You can frankly see it in our curtailments, where we've lowered our guidance. For 2013, I think it was about 50 Bcf on a midpoint perspective, and yet we're modeling a curtailment of about 130 Bcf. So if we weren't curtailing gas, we would actually be taking our gas production up for the year. So I think there's plenty of headroom, and we've modeled that we can still get to our 250,000 barrel number by just reallocating capital away from the Permian to other plays. We have -- actually the benefit of our business strategy is that we have leading positions not just in 1 or 2 plays but in 11, and we can spend additional money in the Anadarko Basin or the Eagle Ford or in the Utica Shale.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. My second one, and I'll leave after the second one really is on the CapEx program and, I guess, the disposal indications that you provided. Specifically on the oilfield services line item, it looks like the CapEx there compared to your previous guidance has moved up a bit. I'm not sure if there's something else in there beyond midstream and oilfield services. But if you could maybe give us some color on that. And at the same time, the $2 billion disposals you're talking about in the midstream, I know there's a lot of moving parts in there. But Nick has previously given some color as to how you guys see the value of those assets. I wondered if you could give us a quick recap on what's making up that $2 billion and what's some of the menu items are there that you might look at. And I'll leave it at that.","Domenic J. Dell\u2019Osso","Sure, Doug. This is Nick. We are not really changing our midstream and services CapEx by any material amount. There is a little bit of additional midstream CapEx. You saw yesterday that we had an announcement with a company called Gavilon to jointly develop a pipeline. And there's 2 or 3 other pipelines like that where we have equity options, and together, they amounted to maybe a 10% increase in midstream CapEx. But that's a rough number, and we have -- those are options we have to determine exactly what we're going to do. So we've given ourselves in our guidance here some room to participate in some of those projects, which we think will be highly accretive. Ultimately, though, what we do have there is midstream CapEx, services CapEx. And then we haven't previously given specific guidance on other CapEx, and so that's an additional element here. And other would include seismic. It would include corporate capital expenditures for things like software and other things that get capitalized in our budget. What we really tried to do this time was give a complete picture of our ins and outs, and so we want that in there. We are quite purposefully not giving very detailed, specific guidance on both midstream and services this time. You'll remember that, yes, you've asked in your question here about what are the items that we think will deliver the monetizations. One of those items, we believe, will be an IPO of our services business. And so we need to start being pretty careful about the guidance we provide outside of an SEC process and they'll plan to do that. So it will be that. It'll be midstream dropdowns, and then we said that we would like to see something happen. In fact, that may also have -- has one on file [ph], so there's not a lot we can say about that either.","Operator","We'll go next to David Heikkinen at Tudor, Pickering, Holt.","David Heikkinen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Just kind of thinking about you gave guidance for Chesapeake Oilfield Services in your projections and then Chesapeake Midstream Development. I know you're talking about doing an oilfield services IPO. Kind of thinking about the margins, though, of revenue versus operating expenses, they look a little low but then they expand. Can you walk through what your assumptions are that go into -- versus that sort of guidance?","Domenic J. Dell\u2019Osso","Sure. We, at the moment, are just entering the pressure pumping business. We frac-ed our first well in the fourth quarter. We now have 2 spreads running, terrific success early in the life of Performance Technologies, LLC, our frac-ing company and look forward to continuing to grow that business. That is, of course, a high-margin business relative to the overall base that we have there, which is dominated by our contract drilling business. And so we do expect the margins to improve as a result of the rollout of PTL. You probably will notice that the fourth quarter margins on a summary basis show a little bit less profit from COS. One thing that did occur there is we did have some additional roll-off of contracts that we're operating previous to our Bronco acquisition for third parties. And so as those rigs go to work for Chesapeake wells, we obviously have to eliminate a bit of that profit, whereas in the third quarter, that was pure profit to Chesapeake working for a third party.","David Heikkinen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","And then thinking about if you -- as you talk about that IPO selling roughly 20% of the business is a target, is that a reasonable assumption?","Domenic J. Dell\u2019Osso","That's a reasonable assumption, David. We're way early to give you any firm guidance on that. But that's as reasonable assumption for now as anything.","David Heikkinen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","And if you sold more than 20%, does that have any tax implications? Or would that change how you'd have to report capital expenditures or anything along those lines?","Domenic J. Dell\u2019Osso","Those are all the things that we're looking into. And we don't have a structure finalized yet that we'll pursue. So I'd like to just pass on that.","David Heikkinen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Now shifting kind of to the operating side. One of the thoughts and questions around your Permian assets and, Steve, you talked a little bit about the wells, 21 wells, in 2011. Can you give us a breakdown of what zones -- just a split of what those wells were to get an idea of how many acres you have in each play and kind of where you've actually had well results?","Steven C. Dixon","This is Steve again. I mean, it's predominantly in the Avalon and Bone Spring in the Delaware Basin. We do have 3 rigs running in the Midland Basin and Wolfberry play. But it's predominantly those big wells that are all in the Bone Spring and Avalon.","Aubrey K. McClendon","David, this give us an opportunity to say one thing. We did see in some analytical work over the last day that there is a view that we went out and acquired 800,000 acres in the fourth quarter in the Permian. That's not correct. What people, I think, are referring to is, Jeff, it would have been on our third quarter report, where we showed how many acres and announced 1.5 million, and the reason is because you had 600,000 acres in the other category.","Jeffrey L. Mobley","Yes, correct. In the third quarter drilling inventory, we had listed a portion of our Permian Basin acreage in the unconventional liquids-rich plays. As I recall, that was 820,000 or 830,000 acres. Also there was approximately 650,000 net acres in the bottom category that's grouped of our other conventional and unconventional plays. So we had 1.5 million net acres in the Permian at the third quarter. We have the same amount of acreage to date. And also for a point of reference, I'll also guide you to our disclosures in our annual report last year, where we had reported 1.2 million net acres in the Permian. So no big acreage spend and some others have kind of missed that point.","Operator","We'll move next to Dave Kistler at Simmons & Company.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Real quickly, taking the rig count down to 12 in the Marcellus, 6 in the Haynesville, 6 in the Barnett, obviously could certainly redirect that capital towards other liquids-rich assets. What's the incentive for keeping those rigs running there at all? Does that have to do with pipeline obligations? If you could just walk me through that, I'd appreciate it.","Aubrey K. McClendon","So it's primarily a combination of things, Dave. There is still some acreage lockdown that needs to occur in all those plays that will tend to peel off or become less of an item for the Haynesville as we go through the year. In the Barnett, we have permits that may be kind of \"use it or lose it\" type of permits. And so for the initial well on a pad, we want to get a well into production and then we can hold off on the incremental drilling after that. There are some FTE, some transport issues in some of the plays, but we're willing to try and take some of that and also going to try and renegotiate and kind of reshape some of our firm transports as well. So I've heard some companies say because of firm transport, they'll discontinue to drill gas wells and lose money. And our view is we should be able to take a little more commercial approach to that. So I'd just say it's a combination of things that put us in a position where we can go to these levels on an absolute well basis, and then we'll take a look at it from here. These levels of drilling do provide or cause a decline in our production in the Barnett, a decline in our production in the Haynesville. So we think that's certainly a good thing for the marketplace and we look forward to that playing out to the marketplace in 2012 and beyond.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Great. And then looking at kind of your '13 guidance and comparing it to your '12 guidance, dry gas production is getting about $900 million of CapEx in '12. Then in '13, you didn't adjust that production guidance down from what you gave us at 3Q. Is there going to be an uptick in CapEx to dry gas production at this point? Or is that the anticipated plan?","Aubrey K. McClendon","David, I just don't think we know enough about what the gas markets is going to look like in 2013, so we kept it to where it is for now. And well -- and also we have a significant curtailment this year as well of 130 Bcf. So I think there's -- if the gas market is attractive enough, there's a likelihood that we could produce more gas in 2013 than what we presently have modeled.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Okay, appreciate that. One last one if I can, looking at your commentary around the financial transaction for Ellis and Roger Mills Counties in Oklahoma, Cleveland, Tonkawa, I'm guessing kind of same sort of structure to what you've previously done in the Utica. If we think about that as sort of 7% financing before an overriding royalty interest, how do I compare that to then debt financing you just did at 7%? Realizing you want to hit investment-grade rating, that 7% seems attractive versus giving up an overriding royalty interest and a 7% distribution to the financial partner.","Domenic J. Dell\u2019Osso","Sure, Dave. I'll take that. We really view that transaction as an alternative to a strategic JV. Strategic JVs in this part of the world are complicated for us because of the overlapping geologic plays that exist and so we can take a specific zone and do this financial transaction. The relative cost of capital to a strategic JV is vastly different here, given the structure. The overall return on this one will be less than the Utica just because this one includes the current production and reserves and is a more well-defined play. But you're right, it will be a similarly structured investment.","Operator","We'll go next to Jeff Robertson at Barclays Capital.","Jeffrey W. Robertson - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Aubrey or Steve, in the Utica, you all talked about having one well active in the oil part of the play. Can you talk about your plans for the oil part and whether that's included in the Total joint venture that you all announced back at the end -- in December?","Aubrey K. McClendon","Yes, sure, Jeff. First of all, it wasn't one well, it's one rig running in the oil window and then one in the dry gas window. So think about, if you would, the Utica having 3 phases, just like the Eagle Ford, except rather than the south to north on gas to oil in the Eagle Ford, in the Utica, we go east to west, so gas on the east side and wet gas in the middle, and then oil on the west side. The deal we did with Total is simply right in the middle, it's the wet gas window, and we purposely kept our dry gas assets back for a better day. And then on the oil side, we just simply haven't drilled enough wells to be able to establish just what our EURs are going to be there. So there's a lot of interest in that joint venture with us on the oil side, and interestingly enough, a fair amount on the gas side as well as there are a number of companies that are signed up to export gas from the U.S. or planning to export gas from the U.S. want to back that up with some physical assets. And the Utica would be a great place for them to go. So we have about 400,000 acres in the dry gas window, and I think about 400,000 in the oil window as well. So we're going to continue to develop both of those sides of the play, but the primary amount of our drilling will be in the wet gas window.","Jeffrey W. Robertson - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Aubrey, will you run -- will you all have more than one rig out there over the course of this year in your oil part of the play trying to test that?","Aubrey K. McClendon","Yes, probably go up to maybe 2. And I think, Steve, we exit 2012 with how many rigs in the...","Steven C. Dixon","20 rigs. 20, we're at 9 today, is that right?","Aubrey K. McClendon","Yes, so it's going to be kind of proportional, I would say, Jeff, as we more or less double our wet rig count, we'll do the same on our dry and oil.","Jeffrey W. Robertson - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then moving over to the Rockies. Can you all just provide an update on where you stand in Niobrara and what your plans are for that for 2012?","Aubrey K. McClendon","Yes, I'll let Steve provide a little more detail. I mean, on the DJ Basin, like with other companies, our results have been spotty. And today, I don't think we're drilling anything in the DJ Basin in the Niobrara. On the other hand, our Powder River Basin play is working quite well. And Steve may want to highlight a couple of some wells there or highlight what our activity levels are going to be there.","Steven C. Dixon","Yes. We're just going to get ramped up to last year. we're up to 8 rigs in the Powder River now, wanting to grow that to maybe 15 by the end of the year. And, again, we're seeing 500 barrel a day IPs there. So we have some delineation to do. But as we bring in extra rigs, we can start focusing part of those in sweet spot also. So we're looking forward to Powder River and the Niobrara.","Aubrey K. McClendon","I might also mention that it's in both of those areas, it's not just the Niobrara. We're investigating lots of different other formations as other operators are as well. So I think for the DJ, I wouldn't say all is lost as you're outside of Greater Wattenberg, but there's going to be some other ideas. But we have certainly shifted our focus on the Niobrara play to the Powder River Basin.","Jeffrey W. Robertson - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Last question, Aubrey. Can you comment if you contemplate exiting a complete exit of the Permian, can you compare the results that you all -- the returns that you all anticipate on the different plays in the Permian to what you'll be keeping in the Eagle Ford and the Utica and the Mid-Continent liquids plays?","Aubrey K. McClendon","Sure. I mean, I think the returns from our projects in the Permian are first-rate. And I think that's why you see so much industry interest in the Permian, and frankly, why you see so much investor interest. I think if our -- just looking at the valuation of some companies that are pure Permian Basin players, we're tempted to spin out our Permian asset and just make it a separate company. But at the end of the day, it's probably best for our overall goals this year to work the JV approach and also to also work the 100% approach as well. So Bone Spring, Wolfcamp, Avalon, these are all plays that everybody wants to be in. And I don't need repeat the rate of returns that everybody is talking about getting there. But they're very strong, and our situation is just a real simple one. We're making the transition from strictly gas to oil, and along the way, we need to sell some of the assets that we developed. And this is an asset that we think that will attract a great deal of industry interest. And also from our perspective, it only being 5% of our production, it was never going to be a play like the Eagle Ford, where right now we're spending 25% of our CapEx on it. Likewise, a play like the Utica could ramp up over time to be a very significant player. We're spending about 25% of our CapEx in the Anadarko Basin. We just didn't see the Permian ever getting to a point where it could be as important to us as some of these other assets. So that's why we are considering the various asset monetization proposals that we've talked about.","Operator","We'll go next to Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Appreciate the additional operational disclosure by play on the call, and wanted to follow up a bit for some more color on the 2 Utica wells that you referenced. Specifically, if the wells from a lateral length perspective are analogous to the 2 Carroll County wells you disclosed in mid-September, how much of the liquids are oil condensate versus NGLs? And then with the drilling efficiencies that you're seeing, what your drilling and completion costs are in the play?","Steven C. Dixon","I don't have the lateral lengths with me, Brian, but they should be average. I don't think they were any longer. And those are preprocessed that was condensate production on those wells, averaging over 700 Bs. Capital costs are -- still a lot of science going on, a lot of pilot holes, still learning a lot. So as you can see from 45 days and some 16 days, there's a variety of cost also.","Aubrey K. McClendon","But it's 18 to 20 days, we should be able to get costs down to what...","Steven C. Dixon","We can get it down below $6 million.","Aubrey K. McClendon","Brian, that's what I kind of about on our long-term plan is a $5.5 million to $6 million CapEx plan for, let's call it, a 5,000 foot lateral or so.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. And so from the wells that you've drilled and completed and brought on now, what percentage of your wet gas acreage would you say you feel like you've derisked? I mean, there's been a lot of focus on -- it seems like a lot of focus on Carroll County. Or do you feel like you've derisked a much wider chunk of that acreage at the moment?","Aubrey K. McClendon","Well, I think we feel like we've derisked 100% of our wet gas acreage, given not only just our results to date but also just our petrophysical work to date. And remember, this is a formation that's been penetrated hundreds of times, as companies have drilled to deeper objectives like CNOOC [ph]. So we're 100% confident on the wet gas, 100% confident on the dry gas. It's the oil that we still haven't yet fully proved up how much of that is going into be prospective. There's a lot of other operators that are going to be throwing results out into the marketplace in the next -- well, throughout 2012. The difference is, I think, most people will look at this play see where our acreage is concentrated and think that we've got really the heart of the core pretty much locked up. And so we're very excited that we're likely to be able to deliver the best results. But my hope is that other operators who are around the fringes will also have success as well and that can only benefit us at the end of the day.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. And then lastly, you highlighted a decent backlog in the Eagle Ford Shale and then it led to a lesser degree in the Utica. Can you just talk to how and when would you expect that to change in 2012? Is it just bringing on the additional frac crews in the Eagle Ford or the midstream bottlenecks that you anticipate easing or not easing as well?","Steven C. Dixon","Brian, this is Steve. It's really both. It's ramping up our ability through the services to complete wells faster and more efficiently, but also is the midstream and we've got a lot of activity going on there now. And our ability to transport oil is increasing significantly just in the last few months and in the coming months.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So you do expect the 200 well backlog in the Eagle Ford to be entirely used or 50% used by the end of the year? Or does the ramp offset the -- there's an offset by the ramp-up in activity?","Steven C. Dixon","No, we expect to get work off this year. That's why we're going from 7 frac crews to 13.","Operator","We'll go next to Neal Dingmann of SunTrust.","Neal Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Just one clarification, Aubrey. Did you say -- when you just talked about just briefly now on the Utica cost, could you comment again what, on that liquid window, what the costs are running now for you or Steve? And then kind of well design, what's your -- kind of on laterals, if you could comment there.","Aubrey K. McClendon","What I said before, a 5,000-foot lateral, we're driving towards $5.5 million to $6 million well. And of course, to get there, we need to be doing enough science to it, and that's been really what we're moving into as the science part is over now to go knock it out. And Steve mentioned we've already got a 16-day well. And I think some of our first wells are 40 to 45 days. So it's really at pretty attractive depths. TVD, Steve, here is 6,000 to 7,000 feet. So we're nearly as deep as a number of the unconventional plays. So we've said from the beginning we love this play, and we're very excited about what we've seen to date. The dry gas is going to work when gas prices get a little better. And then on the oil side, we hope to have some breakthroughs this year as well and hope others in the industry do also.","Neal Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just one follow-up, Aubrey or Steven. In the Eagle Ford area, are you mostly doing now pad drilling there? And then the second part of that, do you believe -- have you looked and do you believe there could be other prospective liquids zones in parts of that play, in addition to the Eagle Ford?","Steven C. Dixon","On the pad -- this is Steve. On the pad drilling, we've only been able to dedicate just a few of our rigs to pad drilling, most of them are still out holding new leasehold. And we have not come across another liquids play yet. There is certainly a dry gas play in the Pearsall, but we're not looking for dry gas right now.","Operator","And next, we'll move to Marshall Carver of Capital One Southcoast.","Marshall H. Carver - Capital One Southcoast, Inc., Research Division","On the third quarter call, you all had 1.4 million net acres in the Mississippian plays. I think I had 1.1 million in the original play and then 300,000 net acres in the extension. Then in last week's release, you're talking about 1.8 million net acres in the Mississippi Lime plays. Where would you classify those 1.8 million acres? And where did the extra 400,000 acres go?","Aubrey K. McClendon","We're only buying in the core right now, so it depends -- other companies may have a different definition of the core and have a different definition of the extension. But we're trying to focus our leasehold buying in areas where we're pretty comfortable with what the outcome is going to be.","Marshall H. Carver - Capital One Southcoast, Inc., Research Division","So you were very active in the Mississippian acreage part over the last 3 months.","Aubrey K. McClendon","Yes, although starting to slow down as things get blocked up. But yes, it's one of our remaining plays where there's still some acreage to be picked up. And given the level of interest that we see in our Mississippi Lime joint venture, there's a lot of value to be captured for our shareholders by making sure we square up our positions before we enter into a JV.","Marshall H. Carver - Capital One Southcoast, Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And one more question. On the long-term liquids growth target to the 250,000-plus barrels a day in 2015, how should we think about that in terms of crude production or condensate versus NGLs? Do you have any color on that front?","Aubrey K. McClendon","Yes, I think we've modeled it about the same way that our production is today. Steve, do you have that? Or Nick, do you have the split?","Domenic J. Dell\u2019Osso","I think the split is about 35% to 40% NGLs, and the balance being crude and condensate.","Aubrey K. McClendon","So yes, just to call it, mid-60s, maybe 2\/3 oil, and the rest is in NGLs. And that's where it is today and where we expect it to remain.","Operator","We'll go next to Biju Perincheril with Jefferies.","Biju Z. Perincheril - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions. On the gas production side, Aubrey, in 2012 numbers, I think, you're only looking at about a 5% drop versus the previous guidance. And I would have expected something more, given the curtailments. So the question is, what is embedded into that guidance as far as when you think those production will be back on?","Aubrey K. McClendon","Yes, really, the answer is simply that had we not curtailed production, we would've well exceeded our production forecast for 2012 and would've had to take it up. So I think I've mentioned this in an earlier question, which is, we went down from 1,020 to 970 Bcf, and then are also curtailing, though, 130 Bcf, or we're at least planning on it. But we don't know how the year will play out. So obviously, we would've had to increase our guidance for 2012 for gas production had we not chosen to curtail as much as we're now curtailing.","Biju Z. Perincheril - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Got it. But you're not assuming that production stays soft for the rest of the year, though. Is that -- is that a fair assumption?","Aubrey K. McClendon","I think we have it internally modeled to be off through October.","Biju Z. Perincheril - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then on '13, and I think you mentioned earlier that you're just waiting to see how the markets shape up before you give more specific guidance or updated the 2013 guidance. But given the reduction in activity to date, do you need to increase from current levels to hit the guidance that you have provided now for gas?","Aubrey K. McClendon","I'm sorry, to do what levels? I missed the word, I'm sorry.","Biju Z. Perincheril - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","To meet the guidance that you provided now for 2013, do we need to see an increase in gas activities?","Aubrey K. McClendon","No, I mean, we're low on gas right now. So I wouldn't -- on your list of concerns about our ability to meet 2013 gas guidance, I think I'd mark that one off.","Biju Z. Perincheril - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. So with the activities there, you are still looking at an increase? Even with the reduced activities, you're still looking at a slight increase in 2013?","Aubrey K. McClendon","Yes, we are. And again, without knowledge of the gas market. But we've got -- if you were to do this -- if you look at our midpoint of the range this year at 970 Bcf and add 130 Bcf, that means our true capacity this year was 1,100 Bcf or 1.1 Tcf. And so we're modeling next year 1,050 Bcf. So we were modeling at a 4% decline 2013 from full capacity in 2012.","Biju Z. Perincheril - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","But I mean, that's pretty remarkable, given the kind of drop in activities that you're talking to still get that uptick. Is that because of activities that are in more liquids-rich and the associated gas production? Or is just the areas -- the shale plays are that much more prolific than you've been thinking?","Aubrey K. McClendon","Well, I appreciate you recognizing that performance is remarkable, it is. And that's what's driven gas production levels in the U.S. to where they are, we're responsible for 30% of it. So we feel also somewhat responsible for trying to contain ourselves a little bit. I think when you just boil it down, it's just the sheer productivity on a per well basis. So the play cycle times are down, recoveries on a per well basis are up. Associated gas helps a little bit, but it's not nearly the factor that I've read a lot of people -- and what I see a lot of analysts do is just model an associated wedge for the industry and just put it on top of flat shale production. We think that the declines from the Barnett and the Haynesville will offset the -- any gains from the Marcellus, and then we think the rest of the system they then decline. So when you take us out of the system as being a contributor to growth, it's pretty hard for the rest of the system to grow. And we'll wait for demand to catch up. We absolutely believe that will be the case, and we see evidence of it every day from -- if you burn diesel in the U.S. today, you are absolutely focused on trying to burn natural gas instead and can read more evidence of that every week in terms of what companies are doing to embrace it. So we're well on our way to the demand revolution in natural gas that will solve the overhang that we are experiencing today.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Bob Brackett at Bernstein.","Bob Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Could you give us an update on the Williston Basin? You've deemphasized it a bit. Are you doing more science there? Are you more positive, more negative?","Aubrey K. McClendon","Bob, yes, we drilled a couple of wells up there and not crazy about what we found to date, so kind of recalibrating there. We have just under 0.5 million acres kind of south of Dickinson and really to the Three Forks idea for us. And I suspect the western part of our acreage, which is kind of abuts where Whiting is operating, will probably work out fine. We drilled our initial wells more towards the south than the east. So disappointed to date in what we've seen in the Bakken, but have a huge acreage position there. We didn't spend a whole lot of money on it, so not too worried about that. And really, just moving our rigs over to the western side of the play and kind of cozy up a little bit more to what Whiting is doing there.","Bob Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. As a follow, on those 1,250 non-op wells from 2011, can you talk about where those are in the mix of horizontal-vertical, oil-gas and what the call-in capital of that non-op program might be?","Aubrey K. McClendon","Yes, we can answer that. They're probably -- I mean, virtually all horizontal. There's hardly anybody we do business with is drilling vertical wells. Steve, in our overall budget, are we 20% non-op? What's our...","Steven C. Dixon","It's up 15%.","Aubrey K. McClendon","So we're about 15% non-op, Bob.","Steven C. Dixon","And of course, Bob, that is included in our CapEx guidance.","Bob Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Sure, sure, sure. And where are those? Those mostly Mid-Continent?","Steven C. Dixon","Yes, Western Oklahoma.","Aubrey K. McClendon","Scattered, a lot in Marcellus. We have non-op positions there. Not so much in places like the Eagle Ford or the Utica, where we are the operator. But I'd say Permian, Mid-Continent and Marcellus are the main areas where we have the non-op interest.","Operator","And we'll go next to Joseph Allman at JPMorgan.","Joseph D. Allman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Aubrey, in terms of leasehold acquisitions. So I know you're budgeting to spend $1.4 billion net. Given that you're ramping up in the Mississippian, how much have you spent so far gross if you can give us that number? And when you say $1.4 billion net, is that net of just the existing JVs? Or are you factoring in future JVs as well?","Aubrey K. McClendon","Yes, good question, Joe. The net is from reimbursement from existing partners. So initial first-time down payments on leasehold are not included in that. So it's really not a gross number, it's just like there's no such thing as gross CapEx. You go drill a well and your partners reimburse you for their share of the CapEx cost and you report your net CapEx, and that's what we do on undeveloped leasehold. We do have partners who have obligations to buy leases alongside us. So $1.4 billion is what we spend and that does include some partner reimbursement, but does not include expected payments from first-time JVs or from just leasehold we will sell just in the ordinary course that may be superfluous to our core operations.","Joseph D. Allman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. So just to clarify. So you're going to spend $1.4 billion net on leasehold this year, that's your target. Now you've spent money late last year and early this year ramping up the Mississippian. So you don't have a Mississippian JV yet. So that $1.4 billion, that includes what you've spent so far in the Mississippian. But does it also make an estimate of not necessarily the upfront payment, but the reimbursements you get for the future Mississippian JV?","Aubrey K. McClendon","Okay. Let me try and clarify a couple of things. First of all, you commented that the $1.4 billion includes all we've spent to date on the Mississippian. No, it's our expected expenditure this year, of which some of it will be the Mississippian. And in that, we do anticipate that there will be, later in the year, some partner pickup of some of our leasehold. But it is not net of the initial down payment that a partner makes when they come into the Mississippian. So the primary driver of the $1.4 billion this year, I think, we've budgeted to spend more in the Utica than anywhere else. And then after that, it kind of falls down pretty rapidly into a wide variety of plays, where we continue to kind of square up positions. So that's -- I hope that makes sense to you.","Joseph D. Allman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes, it doesn't necessarily fill in the details, but -- so will the leasehold spending be concentrated in the first quarter versus the balance of the year?","Aubrey K. McClendon","No, I don't know it's going to be concentrated. It's going to be more front end-loaded because again, we project that we're spending less money in the third and fourth quarters in the Utica than we are in the first and second quarter. And the first quarter always has some spillover from the fourth quarter of the preceding year.","Joseph D. Allman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, okay. I think I understand. And then -- so a different topic. So in terms of working capital, one thing we noticed is that in the fourth quarter 2011, the change in working capital saw a big increase and it was bigger than we saw in prior quarters for a while. And we just want to get behind the numbers. I know we spoke to guys last night, and I know part of it is just prepays from partners. So could you guys actually explain that? And also, in terms of accounts payable, are you managing your accounts payable any differently than you had been?","Domenic J. Dell\u2019Osso","No, Joe, this is Nick. There's a lot of activity that occurred in the fourth quarter that resulted in higher total current liabilities. No difference of how we manage our AP. We do have partner prepays that resulted in higher accrued liabilities.The way that works is when we have significant partner relationships like we do in our JVs, we have the ability to prepay or to prebill them for CapEx. And when they pay that to us, it becomes an accrued liability until such time as we form the activity, and then that is reclassed into the full cost pool as an assets. So there's no change into how we're doing things. I do think that as we spend less on leasehold this year than we did on a run rate in the fourth quarter and for the year, you can see that number come down a little bit this year. Certainly, we will be growing our rig count not at all, in fact, for the first quarter, it will be dipped a little bit. So our activity levels in general will come down a little bit in the first quarter, and so we'll see where it all shakes out. There's always a lot of timing differences in that number. For example, we had some proven interest expense that just based on the timing of when 9\/30 hits versus 12\/31 hits, was a bigger number in the 12\/31 balance. So there's always some [indiscernible].","Aubrey K. McClendon","Okay, anything else? Joe, given the time, I'm going to let you call Jeff back on that and let everybody else get back to their business. Thanks for your questions today and appreciate everybody else's participation. If you have follow-up questions, please direct them to Jeff or to John. And we'll talk to you guys down the road. Thank you much.","Operator","And that does conclude today's conference. Again, thank you for your participation."],"5129":["Chesapeake Energy Corp.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Brad Sylvester. Please go ahead, sir.","Brad Sylvester - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Good morning, and thank you for joining our call today to discuss Chesapeake's financial and operational results for the 2018 first quarter. Hopefully, you've had a chance to review our press release and the updated investor presentation that we posted to our website this morning.","During this morning's call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which consist of statements that cannot be confirmed by reference to existing information, including statements regarding our beliefs, goals, expectations, forecasts, projections and future performance, and the assumptions underlying such statements. Please note that there are a number of factors that will cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements, including the factors identified and discussed in our earnings release today and in other SEC filings. Please recognize that, except as required by applicable law, we undertake no duty to update any forward-looking statement, and you should not place undue reliance on such statements.","We may also refer to some non-GAAP financial measures, which help facilitate comparisons across periods and with peers. For any non-GAAP measures we use, a reconciliation to the nearest corresponding GAAP measure can be found on our website and in our earnings release.","With me on the call today are Doug Lawler, Nick Dell'Osso, Frank Patterson, and Jason Pigott. Doug will begin the call, and then turn the call over to Nick for a review of our financial results, before we turn the teleconference over for Q&A.","So, with that, thank you, and I now turn the teleconference over to Doug.","Robert Douglas Lawler - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Thank you, Brad, and good morning. We're pleased to release our first quarter earnings and provide an update today on our financial and operational performance. Our strategic priorities remain unchanged in our foundational progress in transforming Chesapeake into a top quartile E&P company as evident in our systematic sequential improvements in all aspects of our business.","In the first quarter, we recognized material progress in enhancing our margins, achieving positive free cash flow and reducing our net debt. The underlying strength of our operations, coupled with higher realized prices, resulted in our best financial performance since before the downturn in 2014. For the second consecutive quarter, we posted stronger than expected results on production that grew 11% after adjusting for asset sales.","We reported adjusted EBITDA of $733 million or $14.70 per barrel oil equivalent. Importantly, this is a 33% improvement over our EBITDA per boe from the first quarter of 2017, despite only a 13% increase in oil and gas revenue per boe. I'm very excited about this greater rate of acceleration of EBITDA than revenue, as it demonstrates the greater trajectory of our value growth and not just increasing commodity prices.","As noted last quarter, much of the improvement in the underlying fundamentals of our business has not been able to accrue to equity holders over the last several periods due to the need to address a variety of financial obligations and other uses of cash. Those cash obligations have been dramatically reduced. As a result, we're showing higher margins and returns. We see this developing trend continuing on the strength of our talented employees, high-quality assets, capital efficiency, and cash cost discipline.","Our operating and technical expertise continues to yield positive results across all of our operating areas. We remain encouraged by our growing operating momentum in the Powder River Basin, where we recently added a fourth rig. All four rigs are concentrated on the Turner formation, where we are currently conducting spacing tests.","In April, we placed six new Turner wells on production, and we're excited about the initial results. After 18 days of production, flowing pressures and early flowback results from the first three-well 1,980-foot spacing tests are very encouraging. Flowing tubing pressure's ranging from 2,700 psi to 3,000 psi while the wells were still cleaning up. We will be sharing more information in the coming weeks as we anticipate peak rates will be achieved within 50 or 60 days of initial production.","Fuel development planning for the Turner sand is fairly conservative at this stage through well spacing and disciplined choke management. Our approach is unique compared to what you'll hear from other operators, as we seek to maximize ultimate recovery and capital efficiency, both of which drive greater profitability.","As a reminder, we drilled our first Turner test, the Sundquist 9, more than one year ago. Today, after roughly 400 days of production, the Sundquist 9 continues to deliver strong results, averaging more than 500 barrels of oil and 1.5 million cubic feet of gas per day for the month of April, 2018. This is important because there are very few wells in the United States that produce 500 barrels of oil one year after coming online.","Current cumulative gross production from this well is approximately 345,000 barrels of oil at 622 million cubic feet of gas or almost 500,000 barrels of oil equivalent, generating revenue to-date of approximately 122% compared to its total completed well cost. So as you'd expect, we plan to prudently develop this outstanding (5:33) marine sand. The Powder River Basin will continue to play a key role in our future oil growth.","In our gas plays, we continue to test new drilling and completion technologies in new and existing stratigraphic horizons. We placed an Upper Marcellus well online in January that has produced at an average 90-day rate of approximately 18 million cubic feet of gas per day. In the Bossier Shale, in Louisiana, our first 10,000-foot lateral has cumulative production of 4 billion cubic feet in its first 150 days of production, averaging more than 27 million cubic feet per day and making it the best Bossier well per foot of lateral drill. In the Haynesville, we successfully drilled and completed our first 15,000-foot lateral well and placed that well on production yesterday. In the Utica, we are also improving our results through improved completion designs.","We are pleased with the significant operational efficiency improvements achieved in recent years. Our relentless drive to be the most efficient operator continues to generate differential performance, as demonstrated by the fact that today a four-rig program in the Eagle Ford will maintain a flat production profile compared to the 7 to 10 rigs we historically needed to deploy. This progress is indicative of our capital discipline as we focus on increasing our margins.","To close, and prior to handing the call to Nick, the sequential improvements in our operational and financial performance are clear. And our shareholders will benefit from our foundational transformation and continued progress. Our commitment to our shareholders remains the same: To efficiently grow our cash flow; expand our margins; and further reduce our debt. We look forward to demonstrating further progress across all aspects of our business.","I'll now pass the call to Nick.","[0B432N-E Nick Dell'Osso]","Thank you, Doug; and good morning, everyone. This quarter's results are outstanding. And our confidence in delivering improved margins, greater cash flow from our operations, and increased return on capital is getting stronger with each quarter. We recorded free cash flow after capital spending of approximately $609 million, including net proceeds from asset sales for the quarter, again, the highest in over three years, allowing us to reduce the principal balance of our debt by $581 million from the end of 2017. Looking at the remainder of the year, we expect to be free cash flow positive in 2018 at current strip prices after our planned capital spending and net proceeds from asset sales.","Our results were primarily driven by stronger oil production and higher commodity prices with better differentials for both oil and gas. We continue to see these strong differentials in oil today, with average LLS differentials for our Eagle Ford volumes at a positive $2.32 per barrel for the month of April. We've also locked in approximately 80% of our summer and fall exposure to TGP Zone 4 in-basin Marcellus gas exposure at a differential of $0.73, which includes both financial, hedges, and firm sales contracts to end users. This represents a significant improvement to prices for this location compared to last year.","In total, for 2018, we currently have approximately 63% of our remaining projected gas production hedged at a NYMEX price of $2.96 per mcf and approximately 78% of our remaining projected oil production hedged at $53.78 per barrel using the midpoint of our production guidance. We've also taken advantage of the recent run up in oil and hedged over 11 million barrels of our 2019 oil production at over $57 per barrel. We have added to our oil hedges for 2019, and we'll continue to watch for opportunities to project additional gas and oil volumes throughout the year.","Our 2018 outlook, provided as Appendix A to our earnings release this morning, remains unchanged. Our guidance implies a modest total adjusted production growth for the year, driven by our investment in our oil properties. In previous discussions, we highlighted for investors that our low point for production for the year would be during Q2 following the stabilization of flush production from our significant Q4 2017 turn-in-line program in the Eagle Ford and the reduction in volumes from the Mid-Continent asset sales.","From this point forward, we forecast a modest decline in gas volumes, replaced in the total with oil volume growth, accelerating as we approach the end of the year. Again, as I noted before, our investments are focused on increased margins and returns. This production profile highlights that we're seeing our capital allocation process deliver the results intended in the current commodity price environment.","We are encouraged by our current oil volume growth. As noted previously, we've produced 92,000 barrels of oil per day in Q1 of 2018, including 5,000 barrels from assets sold at the end of the quarter, resulting in 87,000 barrels per day of Q1 production as a go-forward comparison point. Following the close of those asset sales, we averaged 90,000 barrels of oil per day in April or growth of 3.4% in the first month of the second quarter. We expect to turn in line 100 wells in the second quarter compared to less than 60 in the first quarter. Half of those wells will be in the Eagle Ford.","As a result of the Mid-Continent sales, we expect our LOE expense per boe to improve significantly for the remainder of the year. At this time, we are projecting our LOE expense per boe of production to fall toward the lower end of our guidance range for the remainder of year. Our efforts on A&D continue, and we remain in active discussions on multiple large and small transactions. The proceeds from asset sales when realized will be directed toward debt reduction as previously noted.","To close, we remain committed to generating greater returns and growing our cash flow. The performance track record we have established through our improved cost structure, capital efficiency, oil production, and margin growth was evident. We believe these improvements have not been recognized in our stock price to-date, and we're excited to build further upon this transformation to create value for our shareholders.","That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our first question from Neal Dingmann with SunTrust.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Good morning, guys. Very nice quarter. Say, Doug, my question is, you've obviously turned a nice corner with the free cash flow positive that you've shown, as well as the paydown in the debt. You're able to do nearly $600 million. I know without having sort of 2019 guidance, but looking at the broader picture, is this something now your confidence level as far as this free cash flow generation is something you've seen just on a go-forward basis?","Robert Douglas Lawler - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Hey. Good morning, Neal. Thank you for the question. And, yes, what we're really excited about, and this is what we've tried to highlight here just recently, is that the reduction in the financial obligations at Chesapeake has really put us in a very good position that operationally the quality of our assets, the talented employees that we have, the technologies that we're driving, we're very encouraged about what we're going to be able to deliver and how that will accrue to the common shareholder in the coming quarters and in the future looking out 2019 and beyond.","And while we have not provided the guidance yet for those outer years, what you can expect at this company is we're going to continue to deliver on this sequential performance that we've highlighted. And while we started in a different ditch, we continue to drive sequential improvements that have not been recognized. And we're excited about doing the right things at Chesapeake. And we are very motivated to capture that for our shareholders. So, I think that your question is very good, and that you can expect that trajectory to continue in the future.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","And then, just one last follow-up. The Powder River obviously continue to be very exciting for you all and a number of other companies there that are expanding. You mentioned all the Turner possibility, but I know there's a lot of stack potential. So, with the four rigs, I mean, I think on the slides you mentioned 35 to 40 Turner wells. Is that where you think the best prospectivity is, or are there other areas you're equally excited about? I'm just wondering maybe what you're going to focus on here by the end of this year, early next year. And when you look at \u2013 I guess the broader question I had there is, from overall production to PRB, I mean, can that rival what your Eagle Ford is here sooner rather than later?","Frank J. Patterson - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Neal, this is Frank Patterson. Yeah. Thanks for the question. I think we're pretty excited about Powder. Just to give you an idea of where we're headed, our initial thought was we might go to five rigs here for the Turner. We're kind of leaning towards four rigs as really a good rig count for the Turner, because we're drilling these wells much, much faster. The drilling team's knocking it out of the park. We're down in the low 20s from spud to rig release, and I think that's fantastic. Our completion teams are continuing to come up with faster and more cost-effective completion styles. So, we think maybe four rigs is the right number for the Turner. We still are anticipating thinking about a fifth rig later this year.","As we've been drilling these Turner wells, we've been going through the Parkman. We've taken Parkman course. Parkman looks really attractive to us. We're working up a Parkman program. The Nio completion styles that we adopted last year on some of the docks, some of those Nios that were completed with the new style are some of the best Nios in the basin. So, we think we will be moving forward with Parkman and the Nio program.","The Sussex is still good, but we just don't have a lot of Sussex locations. So, if we bring in a fifth rig, I think that's going to be focused on other zones outside the Turner. Four rigs focus very much on the Turner because it's the best economics in the basin. And once we get the spacing tests completed, we'll have a better handle on what our running room is in the Turner. It could expand substantially.","And to your last point, we told you at Analyst Day that we could be rivaling the production out of the Eagle Ford relatively quickly. And we're on track with that. Actually, we're just a tad ahead of where we said we were going to be, and we're pretty happy with that.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Great details. Thanks so much, guys. Nice job.","Frank J. Patterson - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Thanks, Neal.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Good morning, Doug, to you and your team there.","Robert Douglas Lawler - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Good morning. Hi, Charles.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Hey, if I could ask another question, picking up on Neal's point about the Turner. Frank, I think you already started to speak about this spacing test, but I wondered if you could add a little more detail about what you're seeing. You talked about that one bounded well in the middle of the Powder for the Turner, but what you're seeing across the other five wells in that of the six you've already completed. And what we should be looking for as you go through the year and we look at 2Q reporting, what success would look like from those six wells and the additional six that you're going to be completing?","Frank J. Patterson - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Yeah. Charles, thank you. So, let me just kind of walk you through our philosophy here. We've entered the Turner and looked at all the Turner data available within the entire basin. Our first pass said, it should be two wells per drilling section. Of course, we're basically tying up two sections with longer laterals, but basically, 2,300 to 2,600-foot spacing was our initial assessment. We have watched the industry test down to four. Our analysis of that data set is four is probably too tight, but we don't know if three will work. So, we put together this spacing test. It's basically a back-to-back pad, three wells to the north, three wells to the south. The three wells to the south are drilled at 2,300-foot spacing, which is kind of our standard. The wells to the north, the center well will be bounded on both sides by 1,980.","We also have adopted the philosophy here from all of our analysis of the fluids and the pressures in the wells that we are going to basically tube these wells up and not flow up casing, because we don't want to rip the reservoir apart and destroy value by trying to get a high IP, which these wells can get high IPs. There's no question. So, we're being very cautious on all of our wells, managing our chokes.","In this case, what we're doing is we've got all six wells on now. The wells are flowing at really nice flowing pressures on small chokes, 20\/64 to 22\/64 choke. And the flowing tubing pressures are between 2,750 and 3,000 pounds. We have downhole gauges. We've basically put tracers in the wells to look at how the wells are behaving against each other. And so, we are monitoring this. We will open these wells slowly and monitor the pressure as we go.","Going forward, I think the question would be, I don't want to get too excited with 90 days or 100 days of production. When we get out 200, 300 days on that 1,980, if it is behaving the way it is now, that tells us we can probably go to 1,980 feet spacing, that increases our footprint in the Turner substantially. So, we're just going to be prudent. We're going to manage this reservoir for the optimum economics for the life of the field.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Frank, that's really helpful operational detail. I appreciate all that. And then, Doug, if I could go back to something in your prepared comments. You talked about a Bossier well. I believe you said it did 4 bcf in 100 days and was averaging $27 million a day for that time period. Can you talk about where in your kind of Haynesville\/Bossier footprint that is, and how that result compares with your typical Haynesville, or perhaps your best Haynesville kind of results?","Robert Douglas Lawler - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","You bet. Yeah. We're excited about that opportunity. And as we highlight in many of our areas, the completion technologies and drilling technologies that have resulted in a lot of operational and profitability improvements, we want to make sure we highlight what other stratigraphic intervals also provide material upside to the company as we go forward in our development program. So, specific to the Bossier, I'll turn that to Frank and Jason to comment on some of the details there.","Jason M. Pigott - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Yeah. This is Jason. I mean, the Bossier wells in the south side of the field there, I mean, we go from Haynesville strong in the north to the Bossier picks up as we go towards the south there. So, that's a unique test there. We're just trying to prove up it. We pumped a very large frac on that. I think it was 4,000 pounds per foot or something. It was a big frac, just to try to get the maximum productivity out of the Bossier that we can. So, we're excited about that.","We're equally excited. We've just TD'd and about to put online our first 15,000-foot Haynesville well to the north. So, that's something that we're really proud of the technical capabilities of our teams and what they can accomplish there as some operators struggle to get to 10,000 feet. That's become the normal for us, and we've now tested, or are about to put online our first 15,000-foot well. So, lots of great things still going on in the Haynesville and trying to continue to optimize and improve our economics and the value of that asset every day.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Thank you, Jason.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Biju Perincheril with Susquehanna.","Biju Perincheril - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Going back to the Turner spacing test, are those wells are all landed in the same landing zone? And do you see potential for multiple benches in the Turner?","Frank J. Patterson - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Biju, this is Frank Patterson again. The Turner is a discrete reservoir. We landed kind of in the center of the reservoir, and we think we're effectively draining maybe 120, 150-foot thick interval. The Turner probably does not have benches like some of the other zones. We do see the potential in our acreage footprint of multiple benches in Niobrara being productive. And the industry is testing that concept for us now, and we will move out and test that concept later on.","The Parkman, we have four to five different discrete intervals that look to be productive in our area relative to the north, where the Parkman is really about two intervals. So, yeah, we see a lot of opportunity for stacking within the reservoir. But I think the big picture in our Powder footprint is that when you look at the stacking \u2013 and where the majority of our acreage resides and we basically are blocked up on our acreage. We have Parkman, Sussex, Turner, Niobrara, Mowry, all stacked on top of each other. So, the stacking potential of this basin is phenomenal, and we have a ton of it.","Biju Perincheril - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","That's really helpful. And then on slide 13 in the presentation, where you talked about some of the improvements that you're seeing in the Utica, can you give some additional color? Is that all on the completion side, or is there some component of where you're landing the lateral? And how far west do you think you can take this new design to, because it looks like some of these strong wells are on the western side of what you would consider the wet gas window? I'm wondering if there's any hope for the oil window.","Frank J. Patterson - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Yeah. Thanks for the question. I'll start it, and then I'll let Jason talk about the completion. We've gone back and basically reinvented the Utica. I mean, we were well into this program. Everything we've learned in Eagle Ford, Haynesville, and the other plays, we're moving all that knowledge to all of our plays as fast as we possibly can. We are looking, and we have changed some of the landing within the Utica. We are drilling longer laterals in the Utica. We have upspaced in the Utica, because we believe that we're effectively stimulating more rock and don't need the tight spacing. So, it's all of the above.","And yes, you're right, it is moving over towards the oilier portion of the field, and we think that is a real positive for our acreage position. That expands our available well count. And then, we are changing some of the completion styles. And I'll let Jason talk about that. But we're really excited about what it's doing. It's a substantial uptick to what we've seen historically. And I think it's going to bode well for the future.","Jason M. Pigott - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Yeah. Thanks, Frank. We're really excited on the completion side of what we're able to accomplish out there. And it's actually a good combination effort between our drilling and completion teams. We had to completely redesign the wells from the casing string onwards. But we've started changing the fluids that we pump, and we've also increased the sand concentrations, like it was successful in other place like the Haynesville. So, sand is up 33% per well. So, that's something again that's easy for us to do across the board going forward, but took some operational adjustments to get us there, to be able to make these high producing wells. So, we're really excited about the future in Utica as well.","Frank J. Patterson - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","And Biju, one of the things that we're looking at, is this a refract opportunity as well to go back into older portions of the field and maybe re-stimulate. So, there is expandable opportunity with technology.","Biju Perincheril - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay. And then I think at the last Analyst Day, you had talked about about 790 or so locations in the wet gas window. Any thoughts based on some of the new data points that you're seeing, where that could move to?","Frank J. Patterson - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","We are still in the process of re-evaluating how the wet and the dry window should behave. So, it's a little premature to say, because as I said, we've upspaced. With that upspacing comes also an increased EUR per given wellbore, So, we're not working necessarily locations in any of our field. That's not our driver. Our driver in every field is how do we maximize the value of every well we put in the ground. So, our well count could go down. It could go up in a given field, depending on spacing, but what we're trying to do is to get the economics at every single well that we drilled to the highest it can be.","Biju Perincheril - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Makes sense.","Robert Douglas Lawler - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","And, Biju, just on top of Frank's comments there, that keep in mind that one of the competitive positions that Chesapeake has today is that in essentially all of our fields, we still remain about 30% developed. So, when you start asking about specific well locations and the technical improvements in this company, the answer is we've got a bunch of them. We've got a bunch of opportunity and significant number of locations in every asset. It only gets better with the improvements we're recognizing.","Biju Perincheril - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","That's great. Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our final question from Marshall Carver with Heikkinen Energy Advisors.","Marshall Hampton Carver - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Yes. Thank you. You had a pretty significant drop in Haynesville production from Q4 to Q1. Do you have any color on that?","Frank J. Patterson - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","This is Frank again. What we've done is, basically in all the fields, one of the lessons learned is that trying to align the drilling rigs with the completion crews to create the most efficient logistics stream we can possibly create. So, that's just a situation where we're running three rigs. We're running basically a completion crew, two completion crews right now following those rigs. We've also tried to align in most of our gas fields, because the price of gas has dropped, as you're very aware, with our firm transportation. And so we're just lining that out. We will see the asset basically running at about our firm transportation rate. And that's an asset where if gas price reacts, that's where we can react and drive more gas into the system as needed.","Domenic J. Dell\u2019Osso - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","And, Marshall, this is Nick. Just to add on to that. We only turned in line four wells in the Haynesville in the quarter as we align those operational efforts and get our logistics revised to reduce costs as much as possible and be as efficient as possible. So, as we work through our capital allocation process, as I noted in my prepared notes for the call this morning, we are driving for an optimal allocation to gas, which in today's commodity price environment is not terribly high.","And we are going to be as efficient with our capital as possible. And so, again, a bit of lumpiness there in the turn-in-line schedule. There'll be more wells turned in line in the Haynesville as we move throughout the year. But it's about capital efficiency, and it's about allocating capital across the portfolio, where we frankly don't have a need to invest as much in gas with the gas strip where it is today.","Marshall Hampton Carver - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Okay. Makes sense. And as a follow up, the $319 million in asset sales, you talked about some of that being MidCon. It was almost all of it MidCon. And I think you gave the oil split. Do you have the gas associated with that, too?","Domenic J. Dell\u2019Osso - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Yeah. It was on MidCon, and then there was another $60 million sold on effectively the first day of April. So, it's all right at the end of the quarter. It's all Mid-Continent, and it aggregated 5,000 barrels of oil amount equivalent during the quarter. So, again, adjusting down our production for that in the first quarter would be 87,000 barrels. So, it's really why we're excited about our production trajectory going forward. We've replaced most of what was sold in the first quarter just with our turn-in-lines in April alone.","Marshall Hampton Carver - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Okay. Thank you. And I guess, since we're fairly early in the hour and nobody's left, I'll have one more. Could you give some color on CapEx in the second quarter? I know there's a big ramp in wells turned in line in the second quarter. Is there going to be a step up in CapEx, or how should we think about CapEx cadence through the year?","Frank J. Patterson - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","This is Frank. I think maybe you've looked at it in a different way. The first quarter was running a little bit high. We basically front-end loaded a lot of our capital. We've talked about we have five rigs in South Texas today. The reason we're doing that is we have one branch that's very congested. It's a very deep branch, and it has a 20-mile an hour speed limit. So, it's like an hour drive plus from the highway to the rig site. So, we basically put a rig in there to knock out all the wells. So, that rig is not contributing volume right now. We'll move that rig off the branch and drop to four rigs running forward, so we'll see a drop in capital associated with South Texas.","We're front-end loaded on quite a few of our completions, and that's why you're going to see a lot of tails going into the second quarter. So, what you're going to see is we're going to start dropping our capital slightly. And then towards the end of the year, we can always ramp up, ramp down depending on what we see the commodity curve, and how we want to manage 2019. So, now, I think first quarter is hot. I don't think you use that as the trajectory for the rest of the year.","Robert Douglas Lawler - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Yeah. We left our guidance range the same intentionally.","Marshall Hampton Carver - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And that concludes today's question-and-answer session.

Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Brad Sylvester. Please go ahead.","Bradley D. Sylvester - Vice President-Investor Relations & Communications","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today to discuss Chesapeake's financial and operational results for the 2015 second quarter. Hopefully, you've had a chance to review our press release and the updated Investor Presentation that we posted to the website this morning.","During this morning's call, we will be making forward-looking comments which consist of statements that cannot be confirmed by reference to existing information, including statements regarding our beliefs, goals, expectations, forecasts, projections and future performance and the assumptions underlying such statements.","Please note that there are a number of factors that will cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements, including the factors identified and discussed in our earnings release today and in other SEC documents. Please recognize that, except as required by applicable law, we undertake no duty to update any forward-looking statements, and you should not place any undue reliance on such statements.","With me on the call today Doug Lawler, our Chief Executive Officer; Nick Dell'Osso, our Chief Financial Officer; Chris Doyle, our Executive Vice President of the Northern Division; Jason Pigott, our Executive Vice President of the Southern Division; and Frank Patterson our Executive Vice President of Exploration.","Doug will begin the call, and then turn the call over to Chris and Jason for a review of our operations. Then Nick will wrap up the prepared remarks before we turn the teleconference over for Q&A.","We also have some new slides that we will be referencing and these can be found in the Investors section on our website at www.chesapeake.com.","So with that, thank you, and now I will turn the conference over to Doug.","Robert D. Lawler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Brad, and good morning. I trust you've had the opportunity to review our press release and for your reference we have the slides that Brad noted that will accompany this teleconference.","To begin, we successfully executed our program as planned in the second quarter and continued to make significant improvements as a company. During this challenging period of low commodity prices, Chesapeake is leading with our strengths, which include; low cost operations, capital efficiency, a diverse portfolio of high quality assets and talented employees.","These strengths provide the company flexibility and huge optionality today and in the future. I am confident in our ability to be competitive and we are focused on driving value for our shareholders regardless of commodity prices.","Moving to our quarterly performance, as shown on slide three, our daily production averaged 703,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day for the second quarter, which is a 13% increase year-over-year, adjusted for asset sales. As a result of our strong production, we are increasing our 2015 production guidance range to 667,000 to 677,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, or by 4% compared to our previous guidance.","The strong production performance in the first six months of the year positions the company to enter 2016 at a higher rate than previously forecasted. We currently expect our 2015 exit rate to be around 660,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which is outstanding when you consider our ramp down in activity across our portfolio and our present voluntary curtailment of approximately 50,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day on a net basis.","We have a track record of improving capital efficiency and our cost structure has improved as we demonstrate our low cost leadership. Second quarter LOE and G&A cost were $5.40 per barrel of oil equivalent, down approximately 8% year-over-year. In addition, our 2015 second quarter drilling and completion capital expenditures came in as planned, and we expect to stay within our full year CapEx guidance of $3.5 billion to $4 billion.","We understand that our debt structure and gathering commitments add to the challenges of the commodity price environment. There are several questions out there in the market such as can Chesapeake generate sufficient cash flow to weather this storm? And can the portfolio and operational strengths overcome these significant obstacles? The answer is definitively yes. We have tremendous flexibility and optionality given the breadth and diversity of our portfolio.","I came to Chesapeake two years ago because I considered it to be the biggest challenge and thus the biggest opportunity in the industry. We've made significant improvements in our capital efficiency, cost structure and balance sheet and I'm as determined and confident today as then that we will become a top-performing E&P company.","Our portfolio offers several strategic options to enhance our cash flow and liquidity through potential asset sales, joint venture agreements and\/or participation agreements. Some of which we expect to execute in 2015. Discussions have already begun with several parties and we are confident in our ability to maximize the value of our resources, both in the short-term and for the long-term.","The success we have had in improving our productivity and capital efficiency over the past two years has created the opportunity to bring additional value forward. Under any or all of these potential agreements, Chesapeake would be able to accelerate its drilling activity and production beginning in 2016 or use any potential proceeds to enhance our capital structure.","A quick note on our gas differentials, we are projecting these differentials, which include both basis and non-basis cost, to be relatively flat over the next 18 months. However, we have several initiatives underway to improve these costs. Positive discussions with Williams, our primary gas gathering provider are continuing and we are confident in finding mutually agreeable solutions that will benefit both companies. We will provide additional details regarding differentials later on this call.","We look forward to reporting more details to you as they come available but in the meantime, we are leading with our strengths, attacking our liabilities and driving for greater shareholder value. I'm excited to see what the leadership and talented employees of Chesapeake Energy are going to achieve in the remainder of 2015 and beyond.","I will now pass the call to Jason and Chris for an operational update, then to Nick for a review of our pricing and liquidity, and then we'll open the call for questions.","Christopher M. Doyle - Senior Vice President-Northern Division Operations","Thank you, Doug. Good morning. This is Chris Doyle. Let me start by highlighting some of the cool things going on in the Northeast. We'll start on slide four. Like many of our assets, the Marcellus and Utica teams just turned in the best operational quarter in their history. In the Marcellus during the first quarter of 2015, the drilling team averaged 12 days spud to rig release, that was a 35% improvement over 2014. We entered the second quarter never having drilled a sub 10-day well. Not only did the team do that right out of the gate, they averaged 10 days spud to rig release for the entire quarter.","Third quarter is off to a strong start as well. They released off their first pad just recently, it's a four-well pad averaging nine days a well, and they just set a new record of 7.9 days spud to rig release. Unbelievable performance.","Now, the drilling progress in the Utica reads the same way. We're drilling longer laterals in fewer days. As we said in the past, those efficiency gains are being reinvested not only in those longer laterals but also in optimizing completions. Improvement in our capital deployment along with the really stable base has allowed the Utica to grow 13% sequentially while only running four rigs.","Despite the asset's strong operational performance and the team's execution, beginning in July, we began curtailing in the Utica due to weak in-basin pricing. Currently curtailing 275 million cubic feet a day gross, that's up from about 100 million cubic feet a day last month. That effectively eliminates our in-basin sales. The current differential that we see between in-basin and out of basin is about $1.30 or representing about half of the gas price.","And we've got OPEN coming on, progressing very well. We have a planned start-up in early November. So, we made the appropriate decision to curtail but only for a few months. We are not going to grow for growth's sake as we've proven in the past. With OPEN, once OPEN is online, about 85% of our Utica gas will receive Gulf Coast pricing. And we believe this is a differentiator for Chesapeake.","While we love our takeaway position, slide six, we may find ourselves a bit asset long when you consider the emerging dry gas portion of the Utica. As we said in the past, we have about 300,000 net acres in the dry gas window. A little more than half of that position is outside of our JV area with Total, but also within the dry gas plan development fairway.","The position is well delineated. We've drilled 18 wells. We have a number of successful tests. Industry has a number of successful tests. Importantly, the position is concentrated; that means we can drill longer laterals. And it's also secured; 77% of our leases have options for five-year extensions. This has become yet another strong Northeast gas asset in our portfolio, one whose development could be accelerated.","Now turning to the Powder River Basin. As we said in the past, we have a highly concentrated acreage position here as well. We have multiple stacked plays, and the end result is a massive resource potential. We've quoted 2 billion barrels of resource available to us.","The Powder provides both stratigraphic and product diversity. That acreage position in the Powder is also the deepest and hottest part of the basin, highest energy. And as the map indicates in the upper right, much of our position has two, three or even four targets out there to be developed.","We continue to learn about each of these targets and they continue to expand. Recently, we have been surprised with even some of our Nio [Niobrara] results pushing out what could be a near-term development plan.","Current plans are focused on the Sussex as you know. We've drilled 20 wells now and continue to see really strong operational results. From the first half 2014 to the first half 2015, the team reduced cycle times by 40% and reduced cost by over 25%. Couple those operational efficiencies with the demonstrated well results that we note on the map and we continue to be really excited about what the Powder is going to deliver. This is yet another asset that could be accelerated in our portfolio.","Let me now turn the call over to Jason to share highlights from the Southern division.","Mikell J. Pigott - Executive Vice President-Operations, Southern Division","Thanks, Chris. Overall the Southern division had a very solid quarter as well. All areas continue to improve with respect to operational efficiency gains and we continue to push technological limits and test new formations which will drive value for Chesapeake for a long time to come.","This morning I would like to briefly cover a few operational highlights from each of the major operating areas. Starting with the Eagle Ford, the team continues to improve. Year-to-date well costs are down 12% from our 2014 average to $5.2 million per well. This is particularly impressive because we continue to drill longer laterals. When measured on a per foot completed lateral basis, our costs are down 20% from just over $1,000 per foot to $800 per foot. Key drivers behind this are improvements in cycle times, which have improved 8% from 2014 despite drilling 7% longer laterals.","Volumes were down quarter-over-quarter by 7% to 105,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. In large part this was due to a third-party treating facility which was down for 60 days, equating to an average of 14,000 barrels per day over that time period. This was unfortunate, as otherwise we would have realized a net gain in production for the quarter. We now have an alternate plan in place to prevent volume disruption should this happen again. The facility is now up and running and we actually experienced our all-time Eagle Ford production high of 127,000 BOE per day in July. We are currently at a rate of approximately 116,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.","On slide 10 of our investor deck, we have updated the production from our spacing tests which we highlighted on the last call. All three areas continue to perform well, with little to no degradation in our performance curves. This is very promising and supports the incremental development of 600 to 700 Eagle Ford locations that we highlighted last call.","We will continue to test spacing limits this year with additional spacing tests designed for 250 feet between wells. The team has also identified Upper Eagle Ford potential that we believe will be very competitive in our portfolio and plan to spud the first well test in the third quarter.","Finally in the Eagle Ford, we continue to push forward with prioritizing longer laterals as part of the development program. The first two 10,000 foot wells are on flowback and cleaned up from the stimulation work. We are also in the process of drilling our first 13,000 foot well, pushing the technological limits of the field, and the results are showing.","Very similar to the Eagle Ford, the Haynesville team continues to execute on a strategy to drill longer laterals with enhanced completion design. The fruit of their work is shown by our production growth of 9% for the quarter as we rose to 669 million cubic feet a day net.","On slide 12 of our published deck, we have an updated performance on our 7,500 foot extended laterals that also used our enhanced stimulation technique. These wells continue to perform at a rate 10 million cubic feet a day higher than the offsets, while maintaining a much shallower pressure decline. The team continues to optimize development in the field using these enhanced techniques with plans to drill the first 10,000 foot laterals in the fourth quarter.","We remain very positive on the base-enhancing potential of the Haynesville refrac program as well. We were able to participate in eight wells via our non-operator position. The average well increased 2.7 million cubic feet a day, and these tests have provided further verification that we have tremendous upside potential in the asset area. Over the last quarter, the teams have worked to optimize our candidate selection and will begin implementation of our operated Haynesville refrac program this quarter.","Now, I'd like to move on to the Mid-Continent. On slide 13, we show an expanded view of the STACK also known as the Sooner Trend Anadarko Basin, Canadian and Kingfisher Counties. What is unique to Chesapeake is the fact that we have a position in nearly all of the objectives, not just one or two.","In the past, we were taking advantage of our non-operator position to participate in many of these plays and gather information. This year, we have started to bring our first tests online in some of these plays. First off, I would like to highlight the Oswego formation where we have drilled three wells. The first two wells were geologic successes; however the completion technique we utilized caused the wells to produce sand, which initially damaged our submersible pumps.","We continue to work these wells and test alternative lift techniques. We changed our completion technique on a third well, which proved to be highly successful as the well came on at a peak oil rate of 1,955 barrels per day. We also brought online our first two wells in the Hoxbar formation; one produced at 1,515 barrels of oil per day and the other at 750 barrels of oil per day. These wells are just the first step in a development trend we believe will help change the production profile of the company.","We have also been working to quantify our development potential and update type curves with the various plays in the STACK. On slide 14, you'll see how meaningful this area is to Chesapeake's portfolio. By converting our acreage position from surface acres to developable acres, we have over 1.8 million net acres of running room. We currently estimate that there are almost 4,500 net locations that could be developed in this area with a resource that could be as large as 2.1 billion barrels on a net basis.","While current production from the area is gas-weighted, many of the new plays are weighted more toward oil and will help shift our product mix over time. We have a lot of confidence in the development of the Mid-Continent and want to do so prudently. We'll be moving our first full-time rig into the area in September to begin development of the Meramec. We believe this is the first rig of many as we come to anticipate the same sort of success here as we have experienced in our other business areas.","It's a really exciting time for us as a company operationally speaking. Lower prices are pushing us faster than ever to pioneer new technology, and I believe Chesapeake is a leader in driving down development cost. We are also testing new formations in many areas that will improve upon our already world-class portfolio.","I would like to now turn the call over to Mr. Nick Dell'Osso.","Domenic J. Dell'Osso, Jr. - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, Jason, and good morning, everyone. As Doug mentioned, we're doing very well in the areas within our control. Our production during the second quarter was extremely strong, driven by Utica and Haynesville productivity gains and base optimization across the portfolio. We also saw our production cost and G&A continue to move lower compared to a year ago. As a result, we've improved all three of these guidance ranges.","As we've been noting since the beginning of the year, our CapEx was front-end loaded, and we completed Q2 in line with our plan for the quarter and are reiterating our CapEx guidance range of $3.5 billion to $4 billion. We're very pleased to be outperforming on production, outperforming on operating expenses and on track with our reduced capital plan for the year.","Moving to our product prices, the decline in oil and natural gas compared to this time last year has been dramatic. At our second quarter earnings call last year, oil was trading around $97 a barrel and natural gas was over $3.90 an mcf. Today, they are about 50% and 30% lower respectively.","As shown on slide 16, our realized gas price in the second quarter was lower compared to a year ago, not only due to lower NYMEX prices but also quarter-over-quarter due to the seasonal increase in Northeast basis differentials, a trend that we've seen every summer now for the third year in a row. While still seasonally low, our regional basis dips were improved compared to last year \u2013 compared, sorry, with our second quarter 2015 basis of $0.49 compared to our second quarter 2014 basis of $0.61. However, we do expect low Northeast in-basin prices to continue through the third quarter and until heating demand returns.","Further, we're continuing to forecast production curtailment from our Pennsylvania Marcellus assets in recognition of this weak pricing environment through the end of 2015. We do expect a nice uplift in our realized Utica pricing due to an increase of 350 million gross cubic feet of gas per day being marketed on the Gulf Coast when the Spectra OPEN pipeline is placed in service in November.","As for our basis costs, which include our gathering, treating, transportation, compression and fuel charges and marketing fees, these costs have been fairly flat over the past few quarters and are actually improved when compared to last year. Due to continued success and strong production we are seeing in our Haynesville area and the outstanding work our Barnett Shale team has done to maintain its strong base production, we have also reduced our 2015 estimate for our MVC payment by around $20 million, thus reducing our overall commitment to be accrued in the fourth quarter.","When we take a preliminary look toward 2016, we see our total differentials inclusive of MVC obligations being flat to 2015. With the strong results from our Haynesville area and the majority of our Utica gas receiving better Gulf Coast pricing, we anticipate our basis differentials will improve in 2016 and offset a forecasted increase in MVC payments and transport associated with the OPEN project.","As for our realized NGL prices, we have seen much lower propane and butane pricing since the end of March due to very high storage levels. On top of that, approximately 40% of our NGL production is from the Utica where there is a natural seasonality between summer and winter pricing due to heating demand. As a result, we do not see improvements in the pricing of ethane, propane or butane until the fourth quarter. So, we expect our third quarter NGL pricing to be below even these levels.","Switching to our balance sheet, we had over $2 billion in cash and an undrawn credit facility with capacity of $4 billion at June 30. While our cash flow in the second quarter exceeded Street projections and our D&C capital spending was in line with our quarterly guidance, we continue to see negative changes in our working capital due to decreasing capital spending levels.","The impact was significantly less in Q2 compared to Q1 and we do see this slowing down over the next two quarters as we reach the low point of our expected decline in activity. We are driving to see even further improvements to our liquidity and we are making progress on a number of fronts to enhance our position.","As Doug previously mentioned, due to capital efficiencies and the depth of our portfolio, we have the potential through asset sales, joint ventures and participation agreements to further enhance our liquidity. Proceeds from any capital inflow will be directed to the most value accretive option to our shareholders, including an accelerated drilling program in 2016 or 2017 and\/or capital structure improvements.","To wrap up, as we look to 2016, we are confident and encouraged. We have the people and portfolio to continue improving our cost structure, generate additional cash flow and improve our financial position in this tough commodity price environment. I am looking forward to sharing our progress in all of these areas as the year end unfolds.","That concludes my comments, so I will turn the call over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. At this time, we will start the question-and-answer session. And we'll go first to Neal Dingmann with SunTrust.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Good morning, guys. Great details, Say, Doug, maybe just the first question, anything you can say more? You mentioned about potentially already starting to do some conversations. Anything about which areas you consider non-core when you consider the strategic asset sales or JVs or any farmouts? Is there a particular area that you could highlight or anything else you could say on that?","Robert D. Lawler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure, Neal. Thank you for the question. At this point in time, we have not provided which exact assets, although I will tell you we are working multiple options across the portfolio. We don't see any one solution necessarily. We see several that are possible for us. I also think it's important to drive your attention to a few things, the strength of the portfolio and current commodity prices and our current ability to reinvest in the portfolio points us towards evaluating where is the lower EBITDA assets at present? What is the forecasted funding level that we see with this prolonged period of depressed prices? And how can we \u2013 is the asset idle or can we accelerate some activity there which would accelerate value?","I personally am a fan of the JV structure if it's properly handled. And we would do exactly that. It builds underlying cash flow and accelerates value into the current term. But we also know that some of the assets, it may be better to just \u2013 to completely exit the asset just because we're not going to be investing there for some time.","When we have stated that we would do these things in the past, that's exactly how we performed and I expect that we will be sharing more in the coming months on how we plan to advance these initiatives and we'll be providing more color as the opportunities mature, Neal.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And then, Doug, maybe for you or Nick, just any further comments you can say. You mentioned that conversations have started with Williams. Anything, Nick, you could say about potential timing of something like this or when you guys are having these conversations, I guess, does this is factor in that forecasted funding level that Doug you just alluded to as well?","Robert D. Lawler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. We consider and when we look at the opportunities to improve liquidity, Neal, that not only includes the JV or asset sale type of structure or participation agreement but it also includes minimizing our liabilities and Nick has detailed a little bit on our differentials but it's important to note that we see our differentials as flat to improving before any transaction or any deal with Williams that we could potentially reach.","The important thing is we are continuing to work with Williams. We are pleased with the progress and we anticipate to come to some resolution there as we work across the portfolio very soon. So Nick may want to add a little more color to it but we are encouraged there and you'll be hearing more about that.","Domenic J. Dell'Osso, Jr. - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. All I'll add there, Neal, is just to underscore what Doug said, which is that we have not baked any improvement like that into our projections or into any of our commentary around what our differentials look like. We feel good about where we're headed from a differential perspective from all the things that we can control on our own and we continue to have discussions with Williams. But anything that changes on that front, like we've talked about all along, we're aiming for solutions that would be positive to Williams, positive to us. And none of that is baked into our forecast at this point in time. So, it'd represent future upside.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Great. Thanks for the details, guys.","Operator","And we'll go next to Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Yes. Good morning, gentlemen. Doug, I wonder if I could get you to just talk a little bit more about what the quarterly production progression looks like? And I want to make sure I'm making the right inferences, as we look at really with your guidance this morning, an exit rate and really a Q4 rate, significantly higher than what I and the rest of the Street is expecting. I see that you're going to have maybe an incremental net 35 mboe a day roughly from the Utica coming online with that with that Spectra line. But that 660,000 boe a day, does that reflect that?","And then going into Q1 2016, are we going to see a bump up from those Marcellus volumes as really as \u2013 if you expect the basis to tighten up there in the depth of the winter?","Robert D. Lawler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, first, Charles, just let me note that the productivity capacity of this company is amazing. And I continue to be impressed by the operational efficiencies and base optimization, and things that are taking place, the focus on delivering more for less. And specifically to your questions, that productivity and our confidence in raising that guidance at the year-end includes many things, one of which does include the OPEN line there in the Utica. That is in our forecast. And as we look forward to 2016, we definitely, as those basin differentials tighten up, have that potential for additional volumes from the Marcellus. And, Chris and Jason, may want to provide just a little more color on any specific assets that you guys see appropriate.","Christopher M. Doyle - Senior Vice President-Northern Division Operations","Yeah. I'd just reiterate \u2013 Charles, it's Chris Doyle. In the Utica, we are planning to fill up the open capacity as quickly as we can. That would be differentially a positive for us and that's baked into the forecast, very confident of the timing of that project, been doing a really good job. The Marcellus team has done a great job responding to daily market movements, up or down. This is a daily conversation that we have and we have one of the best operating groups out there ready to respond at a moment's notice.","And as you point out, that is likely going to be late this year, early next year, and we have right now, 500 million boe a day behind choke that we can get on very quickly and respond to. So, really pleased with the operating teams, their ability to react quickly. I will say in the Marcellus, none of that 500 million boe behind choke is in the forecast.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Got it. Thank you, Chris. That's good detail there. And then perhaps this question would be for Jason. I like the slide that you put into your presentation, showing the response in the Haynesville from the re-frac program, and I gather that most of that has been non-op to-date. But can you talk about what you've seen? How it's \u2013 I know it's been a surprise of some degree, but how big of a surprise it's been for you and what your appetite is for that on an operated basis going forward?","Mikell J. Pigott - Executive Vice President-Operations, Southern Division","Yeah, let me also finish on the volumes. We do have our Barnett VPP rolling off, too. So, that's a good jump for our production in the fourth quarter. Haynesville is doing really strong, as you could see from the profile we put out there, our increase. We will see a slight dip in Haynesville third quarter just because of timing of completions but expect it to rise again in the fourth quarter just to cover the volume comments.","Refracs, again, there's two ways to think about this. We have participated via non-op, seen very positive results there. I think a lot of the players in the Haynesville have just all around the board seen good positive results. We highlighted on our last call that when we drilled our initial well in the unit, we would come back and drill the second well in the unit maybe a couple of years later. And 100% of the time, we've seen that original well or parent well increase in production due to those wells. So we've seen the results on our own where we've enhanced the rock quality around the old wells. So very positive.","We have \u2013 we calculated 529 Haynesville wells that were drilled prior to 2012 with over 60 different completion types. So those are our inventory of candidates for the Haynesville. If you look at their productivity per foot, those wells averaged 1 million cubic foot per foot of lateral. The wells we complete today average almost 2 million cubic feet per foot of lateral that we drill. So that's really the upside that we see, just wells that were understimulated, those wells drilled before 2012. So our potential out here is very large.","Then the productivity gains you asked about on the 7,500 foot laterals. What's exciting there is it's just a combination of all the technology we've applied. And one of the great things that Chris and I are able to do is share what we're learning in these different fields. So that gets us up the learning curve very quickly. So both the completion techniques and the longer laterals have just been positive, especially because they were in these tests at a lower quality rock area where people had written it off, applying this technique has really doubled the area that we can drill in the Haynesville. Chesapeake also has a very large acreage position, so we think we're preferentially advantaged to be a company that can drill the longer laterals of the 7,500 foot and 10,000 foot variety. So, again, Haynesville is a really exciting play for us, and we've seen it in the production results that we highlighted today.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","That's great, Jason. So, we're going to see you guys getting after re-fracs on the operated side then in...?","Mikell J. Pigott - Executive Vice President-Operations, Southern Division","Our time is coming. Yeah. I mean, we've done, you saw highlighted in the Mid-Continent as well, as we've got large, non-op positions that are associated with our operated areas. We take that data that we get in, we analyze it. I mean, our teams are very proactive at looking at our competitors out there, but that prevents us from having to waste money always being the tip of the sword on some of these technologies. But it's there, and we'll be moving after it. The teams are just working through a rig program. I've got them thinking about how many of these re-fracs could we do that would equate to a rig line running? So, just a tremendous amount of potential up there, and the teams are all over it.","Christopher M. Doyle - Senior Vice President-Northern Division Operations","Yeah, I think \u2013 this is Chris Doyle again. I think the other thing to point out is that it's not just Haynesville. We have two years' track record showing that we can optimize these completions. We've done exactly that. So, going back to pre-2012 wells and re-fracking them, it's a massive lever for us and one that we'll get all over here pretty quick.","Mikell J. Pigott - Executive Vice President-Operations, Southern Division","Yeah. And of course, Barnett, we got the same program going on the Barnett as well. Tremendous potential to help in the Barnett and reduce some of these MVCs, et cetera, over time as well via that program.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks for that commentary.","Operator","And we'll go next to Bob Brackett with Sanford Bernstein.","Bob A. Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Yeah. A quick follow-up. What are the CapEx costs for those re-fracs?","Mikell J. Pigott - Executive Vice President-Operations, Southern Division","We're going through that now. I mean, what we're doing is looking at the different vendors out there. I mean, they've all kind of got their secret sauce that they use. And so, we're looking \u2013 it's not necessarily how much one costs, but who gets the most deliverability per dollar that you spend. They're typically in that $1 million range.","We've tried two techniques. One is just using diverter technology. That's a little bit easier and cheaper job. The other one that we do is we can put at a liner in place. That gives you pretty much a new wellbore to start with. It's incrementally more expensive, but we've seen better production results there. So, those are some of the things that we're looking at as we launch the re-frac program.","Bob A. Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks. And the other quick question was on your sort of marketing profit, that $209 million. You reiterated your full-year guidance on marketing, gathering compression net margin. Where did that come from? And it reverses out for the rest of the year, is that right?","Domenic J. Dell'Osso, Jr. - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","I'm sorry, Bob, I don't \u2013 your question is...?","Bob A. Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","The $209 million positive on marketing, gathering and compression?","Domenic J. Dell'Osso, Jr. - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yes. Yes. Sorry about that. That is basically a mark-to-market of a marketing contract we have which gets treated like a derivative because it's being priced on something other than the gas we're selling under the contract. And so, we basically \u2013 that contract began its operation this quarter. And so, we take a fair value measurement of the future contract just like you would a hedge on the books, and it's in a significant gain position today. There's a recognized portion of that gain that flows through our recurring earnings. The rest of it, we adjust out as non-recurring.","And if it stays in place, that'll flow through the income statement in the future. And if the gain increases or decreases, then the mark-to-market will change on that as well. It's just like a hedge.","Bob A. Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Great. That's clear. Thanks a lot.","Operator","And we'll go next to Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Good morning.","Robert D. Lawler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Brian.","Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Doug, in the commodity environment we're in at least today, the notion of selling assets and accelerated drilling is not always universally cheered. So, wanted to follow-up on your hope to use asset sales proceeds to either accelerate drilling next year or to enhance the corporate structure. If we assume this is used to accelerate drilling, what are the key metrics that you and the board are going to look to, to measure the efficacy of this use of proceeds at the corporate and\/or the well level? And then to the degree it's used for enhancing the corporate structure, can you talk about some of the options that you're considering?","Robert D. Lawler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. That's a great question, Brian. Thank you. To the first point around asset sales in this commodity price environment. One of the things that I firmly believe is that the value and quality of Chesapeake's assets are not recognized in the market. If you go back five, six, seven years ago when the whole shale revolution got started, you heard things like shale.com and manufacturing process and \u2013 coming to the energy industry and all that kind of stuff.","And in a high price environment, that's relatively true. When you get in a stressed commodity price environment, it's all about the rock. And this rock in this company is of the highest quality in most of our operating areas. And so, our confidence that those asset sales, it could be very strategic to another company. And to try to forecast what the strategic needs of another corporation may be regarding their drilling program or their holes in their program for longer term growth is difficult.","And so, we won't try to do that but we are going to test the market. And obviously, there will be price decks used that are significantly deflated, that can impact the value. But to offset that, we also know what we can do with our operating teams, and that's why we are talking about JVs or participation agreements because we'll knock it out of the park. As demonstrated and proven in all the different assets. If we fund it at a different level, there are other entities besides operators that are interested in deploying cash into the energy industry and they want to deploy it with an efficient, high-quality operator. And that's Chesapeake. So, I feel \u2013 I'm encouraged by that. That said, it definitely is market dependent and I look forward to sharing that progress in the future with you.","Regarding the key metrics around what we would do with the proceeds, it's very important to note that we have several options there; the strength and quality of the assets, the high-quality returns that we see in areas like Powder River Basin, the improvements in the Haynesville and the competitiveness there, and also the quality in the Utica. These are assets that based on current pricing levels, current strip levels attract capital.","And so, deploying proceeds back in our program is very attractive. We would not do that if it were not economic and if prices were depressed sufficiently that we wouldn't be making the returns that we would anticipate. We're not going to do anything dilutive to shareholder value. And so, then you start thinking, well, if the prices persist and we bring liquidity in, we will look at other capital structure opportunities, and that's whatever is the most accretive to the corporation and adds the most value.","It's really a question of, in this commodity price environment and with some of our challenges with respect to debt and the commitments, using our rock, our rock quality, using our operations and making sure that we have a comprehensive strategy to add the most value to the shareholders in the near term and the long-term. So from a corporate objective, we will be evaluating all the conventional metrics but also looking at what's most accretive for the long term for the company.","Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I guess to press you a little further on the specifics then, if we have this conversation or look out one year, two years from now and look back on the decision on potential use of proceeds from the asset sales, is there a corporate returns metric that you're targeting or looking for? Is there a net debt-to-EBITDA metric where you want to keep your balance sheet, or is it just at the well level you've got an inventory, the rates of return make sense at the well level in the current commodity price environment, go ahead and spend the capital?","Robert D. Lawler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Right. Well, we absolutely look at well level but we also look at the corporate level performance. And so return on capital is very important. Obviously, that \u2013 for all the companies that significantly impacted with the top line being affected the way it has been. But whether it's return on capital, the financial efficiency metrics, capital efficiency metrics. Those are all things that will weigh in in our discussions with the board.","So I'd hesitate to say it's one particular thing that we're trying to achieve. As Chris noted, when he was talking, we're not going to grow production for production's sake but we will be focused on all those metrics, which include operating metrics, efficiency metrics and financial metrics.","Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. And one other quick one, you're highlighting the STACK area a lot more. Obviously, that's an up and coming play. Is this an area you want to develop and operate, find a partner or sell entirely?","Robert D. Lawler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","That's a good question and the key there is that we have a huge position in the STACK and we've got some of the best areas we believe and we've got some of the best people to work on it. So, I'd point it back to we're not necessarily looking to sell anything, we're looking to capture the greatest value. And so, the options that are in front of us are open and we are just focused on driving the greatest value. So, however we can do that.","What's great about this company is we've got a ton of options, a ton of options. So, whether it's oil, whether it's gas, the rock quality and the operational improvements give us tremendous flexibility. And that's what makes me excited in this depressed commodity price environment and given our debt load.","Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you very much.","Robert D. Lawler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Brian.","Operator","And we'll go next to Jason Wangler with Wunderlich.","Jason A. Wangler - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.","Good morning. Was curious \u2013 you gave some good color about the Utica and kind of the plans of turning back that gas as you get your pipeline up and running. What are the thoughts in the Marcellus? Is it simply a price issue? Is there something that you're waiting for, or is it just watching the differentials and getting a return?","Christopher M. Doyle - Senior Vice President-Northern Division Operations","Hey, Jason. It's Chris Doyle. Like you said, we watch it daily. What we are keying in on, we have very, very low operating cost out there, but it becomes and has become a \u2013 we don't want to give this gas away for free. I would love to sit here and say that we will be able to hold 2 bcf a day flat with one rig for the rest of eternity, but that's not the case.","We have the opportunity and what we've done is ratchet back activity all the way back, so that any activity that we're doing is either there to protect the best acreage position in the play or to bring on incremental gas. And what we've seen to-date is just really weak in-basin pricing given the gas picture up in the Northeast. That changes, I believe, maybe not next month, but over the next 12 months, and we'll be prepared. And, again, we'll unlock just a fantastic asset for Chesapeake.","Jason A. Wangler - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.","That's really helpful. And then, maybe just down in the South with the Eagle Ford. Are you guys still building inventory down there and just kind of what's the plan around the completion schedules and things as we look forward in the Eagle Ford?","Mikell J. Pigott - Executive Vice President-Operations, Southern Division","This is Jason. Over the course of the year, we're actually drawing down our inventory. At the beginning of the year, we had a balance of 151 wells. By year-end, expect to be about 96 wells.","Jason A. Wangler - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.","Great. Thank you. I'll turn it back.","Operator","And we'll go next to Dan McSpirit with BMO Capital Markets.","Dan E. McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you and good morning. Where could or does the STACK rank among assets in the portfolio in terms of returns or economic limits? Just asking in an effort to get a better sense of how capital may shift to this operation over time.","Mikell J. Pigott - Executive Vice President-Operations, Southern Division","This is Jason. The returns, again, from some of the plays, Meramec, et cetera, are just stellar. They compete very favorably to anything in our portfolio, and there are some indications that they could preferentially start to draw capital. So, again, it's the reason we're moving a rig out there is to start developing that vast resource potential we've got out there. Again, it's \u2013 in my mind, this is something that could be as big as the Eagle Ford out there. I mean, it's just a huge amount of potential with wells that have huge IPs on those wells.","Dan E. McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Great. And as a follow-up, do any of the options to create value and\/or replenish liquidity include a VPP?","Domenic J. Dell'Osso, Jr. - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","This is Nick. No, we're not looking at VPPs at this time. I think we've \u2013 we're a little more focused on getting our portfolio right. So, when I think about getting our portfolio right, that to me says we want to own the assets that are going to be the most productive in the environment that we sit in and with the capital we have to invest. So, we have some areas that we're not investing capital. We have some areas that we could be investing capital quicker, and we could either sell the areas we're not investing or find partners to invest more quickly in some other areas.","So VPPs where we're selling out of current cash flow and retaining some of the cost structure doesn't really fit us as well today. And particularly at what I would consider a pretty low forward price deck, it's not a great time to sell VPP.","Dan E. McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Great. Got it. And maybe one last question here, just a housekeeping, maybe on the Utica itself. What is the transportation cost on the pipeline to take production out of the Appalachian Basin. I guess that's the Spectra pipeline?","Robert D. Lawler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, So Spectra is going to get us \u2013 the vast majority of our Utica to the Gulf Coast, and we're looking for \u2013 there's other pipeline projects coming online next year out of Pennsylvania. Our cost out of the Utica blended is about $0.38 an M. And so we feel really good about that transportation cost to get us to the Gulf Coast.","Out of Pennsylvania, we have some outstanding FT (45:40). We have quite a bit of volumes that we choose not to sell in basin today and leave curtailed as that basin \u2013 as more transportation comes out of that basin over the next one year to two years we look for that in-basin pricing to improve relative to the Hub.","But overall, we're looking to continue our transportation portfolio around projects that give us the right value. And so out of the Marcellus, our historic average transportation cost is about $0.55. Some of the newer projects that have been discussed lately are priced at a point that we haven't seen as attractive. And so, we've stayed away from those. But we are looking to see those benefit the overall market there.","So, as things come on that are priced competitively to a market that gets us a beneficial price like OPEN is doing, then we're all over it.","Dan E. McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Much appreciated. Have a great day. Thank you.","Robert D. Lawler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks.","Operator","And we'll go next to Matt Portillo with Tudor, Pickering, Holt.","Matthew M. Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Good morning, guys.","Domenic J. Dell'Osso, Jr. - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Good morning, Matt.","Robert D. Lawler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Matthew M. Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Just a quick follow-up question. You mentioned your working capital burden would lessen in the back half of the year. Is there any color that you could help provide just roughly on how we should think about kind of the cash balance as you look at year-end, where you hope to have kind of your cash balance assuming kind of your spending plans and strip pricing on a go-forward perspective?","Domenic J. Dell'Osso, Jr. - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Sure, Matt. So, as we think about our cash balance going through the rest of the year, we had forecasted earlier this year to be at $2 billion. That was before we saw some of the fall away in working capital in the first quarter and before we saw some fall away in pricing. If you think about where we were at that time and you look at the flow that occurred during the second quarter, we actually hit that spot on. And so, with the challenges of pricing and with the challenges of other things that come into play there, we're pretty pleased with what that flow during the second quarter looked like.","As for the end of the year, it's dependent on a lot of things. It's dependent on prices. It's dependent on a number of other pieces that we have moving now. So, at current prices, it would be a little less than $2 billion, and as to where exactly it ends up, we're going to continue to work on the things that improve that answer. So, it's a lot of variables there, but we feel good about what our \u2013 how we look at our flow for the second quarter, where it's positioned us for Q3 and Q4 with our reduced activity levels in this current pricing environment.","Matthew M. Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks for the color. And then, just a second follow-up question, just looking at your activity versus previous guidance, one of the areas where it looked like you were stepping up versus kind of the year-end expectations is the Haynesville, going to seven rigs versus, I think, what was previously a two rig to three rig count program you were expecting to exit at. Could you talk about kind of the decision process there and maybe how you're thinking about economics as they stand today, either breakevens or returns? Just trying to get a better sense of how the play's progressed with all the innovation that you've put forth in completions.","Domenic J. Dell'Osso, Jr. - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Sure. Let me give you a little bit of color on that, and then I'll have Jason add some more. So, in the Haynesville, we've seen just a tremendous performance out of that team in the first half of this year. And it's given us some flexibility to do a better job of meeting our commitments there. And that's important. As we think about the question Doug got earlier around how we direct capital and whether it's to well level economics or corporate level returns, this is a decision where we think about both. And it absolutely positively impacts our corporate level returns when we can meet our commitments with well level economics that are very strong. And that's what the Haynesville team has been able to deliver for us this year.","And so, I'll let Jason talk a little bit more about that. But we've been really pleased to be adding activity there and do it within what our budgeted capital for the year is, knowing that that's been beneficial to our overall corporate performance.","Mikell J. Pigott - Executive Vice President-Operations, Southern Division","Yeah. Nick hit most of the points there. The Haynesville team just continues to impress. We highlighted the performance improvements, productivity increases, but costs have also been just coming down. The team, as far as drilling went, used to drill wells for $4 million, just the drilling side, and wells that were 35 days.","This last few weeks, they've TD'd five wells under $3 million with the one they TD'd this week at $2.7 million. They've done it in 23 days. So they've shaved almost 10 days off the time to drill a well out there. So just fantastic improvement there. Again, as you drive these costs down, productivity up, economics just look favorable even in a $3 gas world.","Matthew M. Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Great. And just, I guess is there any kind of rough number we could think about on the return profile there as you guys think about the breakeven economics on kind of your leading edge wells or just kind of the return profile? Just trying to get a sense of how you guys are thinking about that.","Mikell J. Pigott - Executive Vice President-Operations, Southern Division","Yeah. There, again, wells as we push the longer laterals, again, they get 30% returns when you consider all-in cost, diffs (50:57), everything, up to 60% if these 10,000 foot wells are successful. Because we still have the MVCs, we consider those differentials sunk and as short term. Internally, they're 100% rate of return wells. So, again, that drives some of our activity there. But again, all-in, they're still very competitive wells and just getting better every single month.","Matthew M. Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Thank you very much.","Operator","And we'll go next to David Tameron with Wells Fargo.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning. Doug, can you just give some more, I'm going to go back to 2016. And I know you answered some of this with Brian, but like how are you thinking about 2016 today as it stands as far as level of spend, stay within cash flow, kind of your thoughts around that?","And then if you care to, can we get a maintenance CapEx number for 2016 that would \u2013 I know there's a lot of moving pieces with the Marcellus, but some type of number as far as CapEx goes that would allow production to stay flat?","Robert D. Lawler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. So, looking at 2016, Dave. We are not anticipating any significant recovery in pricing. As you look forward, the curve is pretty tough. And so, the complete evaluation of how we invest scarce cash flow is really, really important. And so our focus, the discussions with our board with our capital allocation plan, considering the operational improvements that we have across the portfolio, what we know is that because of the strength of the assets and the operations, we've got a lot of really good places to invest.","And so, saying to specifically that we're going to be investing at cash flow or we're going to be overspending, we just haven't provided that guidance at this time. And we'll continue to evaluate and look at our options because as you know, what \u2013 we get six months down the road, a year down the road, it will be different. And as it \u2013 it could be plus, it could be minus. So, I'm hesitant to be too specific about exactly what we're going to do. We just have great options, Dave. I mean, that's a simple fact. We've got great options because of a great portfolio and great operating teams.","So, and then, you had a second question. I'm sorry. What was the second part of it?","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","No. Just the maintenance CapEx?","Robert D. Lawler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Oh, maintenance CapEx. With this \u2013 where we sit today, we're ranging probably in the $2 billion range in maintenance CapEx. And that's \u2013 we can update that a little bit more specifically here in coming months. But it's going to be in that range somewhere.","Christopher M. Doyle - Senior Vice President-Northern Division Operations","The only thing I would add is we took a look at maintenance capital in the Marcellus last year at Analyst Day and we said four rigs to five rigs. And as Doug mentioned, that has completely changed. Sprinkle in 30 million boe a day wells that are drilled in 7.9 days and all of a sudden, hey, let's keep 2 bcf flat with two rigs. And I know it's going to be better a year from now.","Robert D. Lawler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. And I think that that comment that Chris made, Dave, is kind of key and I just want to emphasize, I think, from an unconventional gas and oil company perspective here in the United States that it's going to start focusing on the rock quality. We're going to see across the industry more and more focus on the rock quality. And the quality of the operations applied to that rock and that is something that we still consider to have a competitive advantage and whether it's improvements in the Marcellus, improvements in the Haynesville, you can count on Chesapeake continuing to lead that curve on the operations and the quality of the rock that we've got.","So, I think we have time for one more question.","Operator","And that concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back to our speakers for any closing remarks.","Robert D. Lawler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Thank you. I appreciate everyone dialing in today. I just would like to reiterate what I said at the beginning of the call. Chesapeake is leading with our strengths. We're attacking our liabilities and we are driving for greater shareholder value. Our portfolio offers several strategic options that provide opportunities to strengthen our cash flow and liquidity and I'm looking forward to sharing that progress with you in the coming months.","Please feel free to reach out to Brad with any other questions that you may have.

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jeff Mobley. Please go ahead, sir.","Jeffrey L. Mobley","Good morning, and thank you for joining our conference call today. I'd like to begin by introducing the members of the management team that are on the call today: Aubrey McClendon, our Chairman and CEO; Steve Dixon, our Chief Operating Officer; Nick Dell'Osso, our Chief Financial Officer; and from the Investor Relations Research team, John Kilgallon, joining us as the Senior Director. And we have a new person to the team I'd like to introduce to you, Gary Clark, who joined us from an investment firm in Tennessee. As usual, our call will last one hour. And so now I'll turn it over to Aubrey.","Aubrey K. McClendon","Thanks, Jeff. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. Let me begin by acknowledging what everyone is clearly aware of. This has been a very challenging 2 weeks for all of our shareholders, bondholders and other stakeholders and also for our friends and employees. There's been enormous and unprecedented scrutiny of our company and of me, personally, and a great deal of misinformation has been published and uncertainty created. ","Your mother told you not to believe everything you read or hear for a good reason, and that's certainly been the case for the past 2 weeks. I am deeply sorry for all the distractions of the past 2 weeks. Through all of this, I've learned that there was a desire for more information regarding the FWP Program, which, as a reminder, has been in place since 1993, the date that of company's IPO, was approved by shareholders in 2005 and, I believe, has always aligned my interest with the company's interest and ensured that I had skin in the game, uniquely among other CEOs. ","Consequently, last Thursday, I disclosed a substantial amount of personal financial information regarding my FWPP interest. Furthermore, Chesapeake's preliminary proxy filed on April 20 also includes enhanced disclosures regarding the FWPP and discloses a multitude of positive governance changes that you should take the time to review. Hopefully, those measures, along with the decision to split the role of CEO and Chairman and to terminate the FWPP 18 months early adequately address the questions and misunderstandings that have been bouncing around in the marketplace and the media. I would like to reiterate that as part of the agreement, I will not receive any compensation or any benefit for the 18 months of the FWPP rights that I have agreed to forego. The board and I are both very pleased that this compromise, which I would like to highlight, also has been supported by our largest shareholder, Southeastern Asset Management, which owns a 13% ownership position in the company. ","In addition, you have seen the Chesapeake's board has begun a search for and will name an independent nonexecutive Chairman of the Board in the near future, which is something that I enthusiastically support. The step reflects our determination to be proactive and uphold strong corporate governance standards. It will also allow me to have more time to concentrate my full time and attention on the execution of the company's strategy, the implementation of our substantial transformation to a major oil producer and the completion of our asset monetization and joint venture objectives. Despite all the noise of the past 2 weeks, my primary job as CEO has been and always will be to build long-term value, along with attractive short-term return for the company and all of its stakeholders. That is the task at hand and that is and has been my primary focus for the past 20 years. Those that know me know that I will work tirelessly to achieve that goal, and no, I will not allow myself or your management team to be distracted from that mission. ","I'd now like to shift our discussion to other important topics, including the results from the 2012 first quarter, a quarter in which we experienced both positives and negatives. The 4 most important positives for the quarter were: number one, our production growth was strong, especially in liquids growth, up 69% year-over-year and 7% sequentially; number two, our finding costs were only $7.14 per barrel of oil equivalent. Surely that's the lowest among the large-cap E&Ps, if not the entire industry. Number three, the amount of new reserves we found was 1.8 Tcfe or 300 million barrels of liquid equivalent. That was exceptional, and again, I suspect industry-leading for the quarter. Number four, all of our plays are working very well and we don't have any bad operational news to share. Quite simply, in the field, it's all good. ","However, we did experience 2 negatives for the quarter to offset some of the positives. Number one, because of extremely low natural gas prices and also NGL prices, combined with wider-than-expected basis differentials, slightly higher operating costs due to oil wells being more expensive to operate than gas wells and certain noncash losses on 2 of our equity investments in Frac Tech and Chaparral, we reported adjusted EPS of $0.18 per fully diluted share which is below the average analyst consensus of $0.29. That is our first significant earnings miss in many years, I believe, and hopefully our last. Number two, because our CapEx for drilling completion leasehold had been significantly front end-loaded this year, that, in combination with reduced cash flow from low gas prices, caused our net long-term debt levels, net of cash, to rise roughly $2 billion during the quarter. We had anticipated and planned for such an increase but possibly many others didn't. So I can imagine that some might think we have abandoned our $9.5 billion year-end net long-term debt target and our 25\/25 Plan for year-end 2012. The short answer is no, we certainly have not. It's just the 2012 CapEx will be more heavily skewed to the first quarter while operating cash flow and asset monetizations will spread out throughout the year. So we have to work a bit harder on the asset monetization front to counteract currently soft U.S. natural gas prices to hit our year-end targets. ","The good news is the positives for our company are enduring, and the negatives, we believe, are short-term in nature. Importantly, we expect the run rate of our CapEx spending to greatly decrease during the remainder of the year. So if one were to simply multiply our first quarter CapEx numbers by 4, they would arrive at a very wrong conclusion about our planned full year CapEx spending. Another point about CapEx that I would like to emphasize is that the levels we have budgeted for in 2012 and '13 are absolutely required if we are to escape the downward gravitational pull of natural gas prices and capitalize on the very attractive prices for oil and natural gas liquids available for us in the marketplace. The payoff for this corporate transition we have underway should be increasingly clear for all to see in our liquids production growth over the next year and in the years ahead. Please remember from a base of only 30,000 barrels a day of liquids production at the end of 2009, we are well on our way to delivering liquids production even after planned asset monetizations of more than 150,000 barrels per day in 2013, 200,000 barrels per day in '14 and 250,000 barrels per day in 2015. And this will all come from assets that we already own. We believe this could turn out to be the best liquids volume growth story in the U.S. industry and perhaps one of the best in the world as well. ","Returning to CapEx for a minute. Chesapeake's 2012 first quarter frontend-loaded CapEx levels were attributable to several items that will not persist through the year. Steve will have more to say on drilling CapEx as part of his prepared remarks. But my quick summary is that during the fourth quarter of 2011, we ran as many as 172 rigs because we were rapidly ramping up our liquids-focused drilling while at the same time we were deliberately but more slowly ramping down gas drilling. Because of the time requirements to execute this shift and the time lag of completions, the first quarter took the brunt of that elevated drilling level from the fourth quarter. I'm happy to report that today we have already dropped 18 operated rigs to reduce our total to 154 and our drilling during the year will decline further to around 125 rigs by the third quarter. So as the year moves along, we'll be drilling with about 25% fewer rigs than we used on our fourth quarter peak and CapEx on drilling and completion should move down sharply in tandem with this rig decline. ","Importantly, our gas drilling will drop even more significantly than our overall drilling levels. At the beginning of 2012, we were operating 50 gas rigs. But during the 2000 (sic) [2012] first quarter, we averaged 38. And within 90 days from now, will be down to only 12, so I'd like to emphasize that. 50 rigs in January of 2012 drilling gas wells; down to 12 rigs in just 90 days, a drop of more than 75%. Another way to look at the 2012 first quarter drilling CapEx is to analyze actual dollars spent on plays -- gas plays such as the Haynesville and the Barnett. On those 2 plays alone, we spent approximately $575 million during the 2012 first quarter. However, for the next 3 quarters, we plan to spend just about $100 million each quarter in these 2 plays or more than an 80% reduction per quarter. One final aspect of our drilling CapEx spend during the first quarter is that we still had a big backlog of uncompleted gas wells that we had to complete to finish the steps necessary to hold our valuable leasehold by production and make them permanent assets. In fact, we completed 57 more gas wells during the quarter than we spud. And so we already have completed more than 50% of the gas wells expected for the full year in just the first quarter of this year. ","Next, I'd like to address leasehold CapEx. It was also strategically and purposely frontend-loaded with about $525 million of the quarter's approximate $900 million leasehold spend focused on the Utica and Mississippi Lime plays. This plan was designed to complete our leasehold purposes -- purchases in conjunction with our completed or planned JVs in these areas. Now as the most important areas have been captured, these 2 areas, and in reality, all of our remaining plays will see greatly reduced leasehold spending during the remainder of 2012. We've built an exceptional portfolio of assets during the past 7 years of what I call the great unconventional resource revolution. And from here on, it's all about exploiting these assets to the maximum benefit of the company and its shareholders. As evidence of that strategic transaction -- transition, we have greatly reduced our leasehold CapEx budget in 2013 to $500 million, from -- down from a high of $1.25 billion. And that's a level that we believe will be on the high end of our typical out-year leasehold maintenance CapEx level. ","This is an important point and so I'd like to reiterate it. We are all set with our asset base, with the exception of the sale of the Permian and a few other minor odds and ends that we have left to sell later in '12 and in '13. Quite simply, as a result of our innovative approach to the business and hard work during the past 7 years, we now have a very focused and exceptionally high-quality asset base. In fact, we think it's the best in the industry. We've now established #1 position in the Utica, Mississippi Lime, Granite Wash, Cleveland, Tonkawa, Powder River in the Niobrara, Marcellus, Haynesville and Bossier plays. In addition, we have established #2 positions in the Eagle Ford and the Barnett. No one else in the industry has assembled anything close to this scale and quality of an asset portfolio. In short, we've built a very strong foundation of 11 #1 and #2 positions in the nation's best plays. And to make sure I'm crystal clear on this, we have no interest in going to Canada or anywhere else outside the U.S. With the very best asset base in the business, it's now time to transition our business from being an aggressive new play identifier, leasehold acquirer and play developer into a more deliberate but very high-quality manufacturing company that will focus on achieving exceptional returns on capital on the assets we already own. ","So what will all of our hard work actually do for our shareholders? And what will lead to future stock price performance they deserve? And why have we been willing to spend multiples of our cash flow on liquids-rich drilling at a time of low natural gas prices? Because it's in order to position the company to become cash flow positive in 2014 and beyond and to run a more balanced company as well. Having now captured and paid for decades of low-risk drilling opportunities that are now more evenly balanced between natural gas and liquid plays, we very much like the future path that we are on compared to the path we were on previously, which was essentially a 100% natural gas-focused company.  This transition to oil will enable us to deliver strong returns to our shareholders and an investment-grade balance sheet to our bondholders in the years to come. And our long-term goals will remain to increase Chesapeake's production and cash flow each year by at least 10% to 15% while generating exceptional returns along the way. ","I've never be more excited about the company's position in the industry, the strength of our assets and the coming improvements to our balance sheet. As a reminder, we have a total of $11.5 billion to $14 billion of asset monetizations planned for 2012, of which we've completed more than $2.5 billion to date. Throughout the year, we plan to bring in another $9.5 billion to $11.5 billion from asset monetizations including the sale of our Permian Basin assets and joint venture in the Mississippi Lime, a volumetric reduction payment in Eagle Ford shale, the sales of various noncore oil and gas assets and partial monetizations of the company's Oilfield Service and Midstream assets. We believe those actions will lower our debt by year-end 2012 to our $9.5 billion 25\/25 Plan target and will fully cover our capital expenditures plan for the year. ","Making this transition in just a few years during any time is hard work, but it's been exceptionally challenging during the time of $2 natural gas. And even though it's not been easy, it's been worth it. Consider where we would be had we not embarked on this transformation. Our operating cash flow for the year would likely have been half what it is now, including liquids. And based on these metrics, I'm convinced we would've had a single-digit stock price had we not started to make this shift to liquids 4 years ago and accelerated last year and early this year. We expect to be largely finished with this transformation by year-end 2013. ","I'll conclude by reminding you what 5 tasks we are focused on completing for the remainder of the year. First, we intend to meet both of our objectives on the 25\/25 Plan despite our large production curtailments on the gas side and despite low gas prices themselves. We expect to end the year at $9.5 billion in long-term debt and will have grown our production by at least 25% during '11 and '12. Second, we intend to monetize a total of $11.5 billion to $14 billion of assets this year to property sales, JVs and other asset monetization transactions. Third, we intend to continue to demonstrate that we can consistently find new proved reserves at an all-in cost of less than $10 per barrel of oil equivalent. In the first quarter, our finding costs were only around $7 per barrel of oil. And you can't go wrong in this industry if you can find oil and gas in the U.S. at $7 per barrel. Fourth, we'll remain focused on our goal of reaching 150,000 barrels per day of liquids production in 2013, 200,000 barrels per day in '14 and 250,000 barrels per day in '15. This is all net of planned asset monetizations. ","During the 2012 first quarter, our liquids production was up 46,000 barrels per day over the year-ago quarter to a level of almost 114,000 barrels per day. We believe this remains the second-best liquids volume growth story in the industry and in time could become the best. And if you look at where some of our oilier peers trade today, it appears that Chesapeake's value in the marketplace could be almost fully supported by our oil business when the nation's largest gas resource base is being valued at close to 0. Fifth, we believe that with a reasonable recovery in gas prices in 2014, along with growth of our liquids production, as modeled, our operating cash flow should match our drilling CapEx and the CapEx funding gap that we have experienced this year and next year and a couple of years in the past, will be an issue of the past. By 2014, we intend to be generating around $7 billion of operating cash flow to have around $4.5 billion barrels of oil equivalent proved reserves and will have completely transformed our company from being only an 8% liquids producer in 2009 to a producer with much greater balance and strength in the years ahead. ","These are 5 big goals to achieve, to be sure, particularly in this low gas price environment with 5 that we are confident we can achieve and 5 that should create significant levels of shareholder value as we complete them. We are eager to leave behind the controversies of the past few weeks and focus all of our energies on delivering on these key objectives during the remainder of the year. We appreciate you hanging tough with us. I'll now turn the call over to Nick.","Domenic J. Dell\u2019Osso","Thanks, Aubrey. I'll begin by reviewing our first quarter results in more detail. From an earnings perspective, this was a noisy quarter so I thought I would address a few of the most significant items right up front. Approximately $0.03 per share of our earnings miss related to lawsuits and investments accounted for under the equity method, specifically at Frac Tech and Chaparral. Another $0.03 was driven by higher than expected per unit production expenses before [ph] a function of increased costs associated with oil wells, which were more expensive to operate than gas wells, and the new Marcellus impact fee, which the state assessed retroactively on all operators. I'll further note that despite a big increase in the first quarter, going forward, we have only increased our budgeted production expenses per unit by $0.05 per Mcfe, as some of this was clearly one-time in nature. Beyond these 2 largest factors, gas prices and differentials, including NGL realizations, also played a fairly significant role. ","Moving on to liquidity. We had approximately $2.3 billion in cash availability at the end of the quarter versus $3.1 billion on December 31. I'll also note that our working capital deficit decreased from its peak level at December 31, 2011. As more of our production shifts to higher value liquids and activity levels decline this year, we expect this deficit to continue to decrease. We did enhance liquidity during the quarter with a senior notes offering that has a very advantageous feature, allowing us to call the notes at par later this year with the proceeds from asset sales. While $2 gas prices have, for sure, created headwinds for us, as evidenced in our lower operating cash flow projections for the year, we still anticipate monetizing sufficient assets to meet our 25\/25 Plan. Those monetizations are moving along as planned, with good success from the Granite Wash VPP and Cleveland Tonkawa subsidiary preferred, both completed in Q1. The next significant transactions planned are in Eagle Ford VPP and Miss Lime JV and the Permian Basin sale. Further, I'll point out that upon reaching our debt paydown target at the end of the year with proceeds from these asset sales, inclusive of calling the notes issued in February, we will have a nearly undrawn revolver, which has a capacity of $4 billion. ","As relates to our CapEx spend this quarter and over the last several periods, it's very important to note the glide path downward we are now firmly making. We did expect to see that start in Q1 of this year, but as Aubrey noted, lingering activity while ramping down and cost spillover from the fourth quarter held us up a bit. However, drilling and leasehold CapEx from here begin to dip, the latter fairly dramatically. This, of course, is due to having captured the assets needed to grow liquids production. And while the time lag from asset capture to cash flow generation will still take a bit more time and despite-ing the headwind of lower gas prices, I'd also like to point out that we have grown proved reserves 34% over the last 8 quarters and SEC PV-10 84%, with the latter growing much faster due to the higher-value assets we are adding today. ","Our PV-10 at SEC pricing at March 31 was over $20 billion. And at the 10-year NYMEX Strip, it was over $24 billion. That is nearly 2x our GAAP balance sheet debt and well covers the even more conservative analyst debt plus other obligations analyses. Proved reserves will continue to grow rapidly on the strength of nonproved reserves we already have the rights to develop. And the increase in our PV-10 is the proof that benefit of our spending programs of the past period. In addition, we also own substantial Midstream and services businesses, which -- Midstream and a service business, the latter -- sorry, the company retains an extraordinary collection of assets. We have lots of options going forward on how to best fund our continuing transition to liquids-focused company from our historical gas-only focus. ","We remain unhedged on the gas side and are hopeful some of the worst gas prices may be behind us. From a liquids perspective, we are 60% hedged for the remainder of 2012 at an average price of approximately $103 per barrel. I would like to mention that we removed our oil and natural gas hedges during the market swing caused by Greek debt worries early last fall. The plan was to put them both back on, but gas prices never recovered enough to do so, in large part due to the abnormally warm winter. However, on the oil side, we collected $46 million of cash last year for 2012 hedges that we lifted. And later in the year, were able to enter into new swaps with prices roughly $6.40 higher per barrel than the market price, when the hedges were removed. On the gas side, we collected $353 million of cash by lifting the 2012 hedges last fall, the gains of which will flow through our income statement this year and provide a $0.58 per Mcf of uplift this quarter. ","With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve to give an overview of some of our most recent operational achievements.","Steven C. Dixon","Thanks, Nick. First quarter 2012 was another very successful quarter in our transformation from an exclusively natural gas-focused driller and producer a few years ago to a more balanced liquids-focused driller and operator today. ","I'm pleased to report overall production for the quarter grew to nearly 3.66 Bcf a day, which is now 19% from oil and natural gas liquids. That's up from a 13% liquids mix a year ago. This tremendous organic liquids growth is quite an amazing feat for a company of our size. Our liquids production has increased from 30,000 barrels per day back in fourth quarter of '09, up to 67,500 barrels per day in the first quarter of 2011 to now approximately 113,600 barrels a day in this quarter. That's an increase of 46,400 barrels per day or 69% in just one year. Taken alone, that 46,400 barrels per day of growth would place Chesapeake's last 12 months of production growth as the 21st largest producer of liquids in the U.S. These results are a positive reflection of the great liquids assets that we've built, our flexibility to move quickly as a result of our vertical integration and the operational skill of our organization. Anyone who thinks we're still just a natural gas story, please take another look. In fact, we are one of the world's best oil growth stories. ","Our frontend-loaded CapEx spending in the first quarter on drilling completion activity includes a sizable lag for much higher drilling activities in the fourth quarter. This gas drilling and completion activity that's accounted for over half of this year's expected activity in just one quarter, as well as we had a considerable amount of non-op participations. Even though gas rig activity reductions are well underway from 50 operated rigs at the beginning of 2012 to an expected 12 gas rigs by the end of next quarter, the completions of previously drilled gas wells had to be performed in order to hold the leasehold by production. As Aubrey mentioned, we completed 57 more gas wells than we spud during the quarter. We are also reducing previously expected drilling CapEx on select liquids-rich plays, as in some of these plays -- as in many of our plays, we are moving into more of a development mode that will provide cost savings as well. We also expect to realize cost savings in the coming months from reduced service cost and improved operating efficiencies as our ramp-ups in key plays start to level off. We have negotiated new lower service agreements with key providers in each of our major plays on a broad range of services, the most significant being pressure pumping. And we expect these reductions will have more significant impact on our capital spending in second quarter and the rest of the year. ","Switching to specific operational performances. We'd like to start with our growth in the Eagle Ford Shale, which is setting company production records on a weekly basis. Just last week, we produced more than 55,000 barrels of gross operated crude. That's a gain of 30,000 barrels of oil since January 1 of this year, which is an increase of 120% in just 4 months. We are currently producing gross operated 75,000 BOE per day in this outstanding play. Our production gains will come from across an expansive acreage position. We have a collection of recent wells IP-ing at over 1,000 barrels a day. And we believe our 475,000 net acres of leasehold were very selectively chosen, and today, cover some of the most prolific portions of the entire trend. ","Our Eagle Ford operational teams have done a great job adding barrels. And now their further focus is on efficiency. We have made improvements in our stimulation and completion processes, resulting in higher production without added cost. In fact, we were able to lower per well costs by approximately 15% due to faster drilling times and lower stimulation costs. Infrastructure buildout is still a key within the Eagle Ford, and we expect to have future production growth fully connected to pipeline infrastructure by early 2013. And this will help price realizations greatly and lower our transport costs by about 2\/3. We are currently running 35 rigs in this play and we'll average approximately 30 for the year. ","In the Miss Lime play in Northern Oklahoma and Southern Kansas, we have a very active program. We have 133 horizontal producers and 22 rigs running in the play. Net production in the first quarter averaged almost 13,000 barrels of equivalent a day. In terms of liquids-rich play, we find the Miss Lime very attractive economically, given the shallow depths and the cheaper drilling and completion costs associated. We have data room currently active in pursuit of a JV partner, which we hope to wrap up in the coming few months. ","In the Powder River Niobrara play, we have 9 operated rigs currently running and our plans are to maintain that activity level throughout the rest of the year. We have experienced several recent drilling and completion successes in the play due to our growing understanding of the reservoir and focusing on higher pressure and optimally mature areas, recent IPs have been around 700 barrels of oil and 1.5 million per day. And please don't confuse this with the DJ Basin Niobrara, where we and others have struggled outside of the Greater Wattenberg Field to make this formation economic across a broader area. Up in the Powder River, the Niobrara is 5,000 feet deeper than in the DJ, and we have now identified an area of approximately 60,000 to 100,000 acres that is overpressured with super-rich liquids. We believe the returns in this area will be outstanding and no other public company owns leasehold in this particular super-rich area. ","Now in the Cleveland and Tonkawa tight sand plays in Roger Mills and Ellis Counties in Oklahoma and Hemphill County in the Texas Panhandle, we have 15 operated rigs running across both plays and plan to reduce that to 13 by year end. Production for the first quarter was 18,500 BOE per day. Initial rates for these wells routinely exceed 850 BOE per day. We are working with others to jointly get infrastructure enhancements in place to move our oil on to Cushing and to gain access to Mount Belvieu for our liquids. ","And lastly, the Utica Shale play in Ohio, where we are, by far, the leading leasehold holder and operator, with 10 operated rigs currently working to evaluate our 1.3 million net acres. We continue to delineate the wet gas window with our JV partner, Total, with outstanding results. The overall pace of delineation should increase now that other operators are starting to drill in the play. The dry gas window towards the east is highly productive and large portions will be HBP-ed by the overlap on our efforts in the wet gas window of the Marcellus. Marcellus, we are currently operating 6 rigs and recently tested several new wells with over 300 barrels a day of condensate. The Utica oil window still needs additional drilling and study, and we are not ready to disclose specific thoughts just yet, although we remain confident that we will have very positive results to share by mid-year. We are testing various completion techniques in oil window and want to see how they work for us before we release any public information. ","To wrap this up, our liquids-rich plays are working exceptionally well. Eagle Ford is our major force and is attracting 30% of our CapEx this year, followed by solid contributions from all across our key portfolio plays in the Miss Lime, Niobrara, Granite Wash and Cleveland Tonkawa. The Utica is our developing giant, where we will control all aspects of the development in the play because of our massive first-mover and discovery advantage. We've trued up our corporate production guidance to exclude all production from expected near-term monetizations and have tightened our belt on natural gas expenditures and even trend some liquids-rich activity. Our front end-loaded CapEx in the first quarter 2012 may be misunderstood by some. But even if so, it still produced excellent finding and development costs of around $7.15 a barrel and we added 180 million BOE of proved reserves from our liquids-rich play alone in the first quarter. We do expect lower rig counts and lower unit costs on all of our plays and as we move further down the development cycle. ","Operator, we'll now take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Scott Hanold with RBC Capital Markets.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","So obviously, there's a lot of focus on your free cash flow or the deficit that's out there over the next 18 months, excluding planned monetizations. But when you step back and look at it -- and obviously, there's a pretty call on you guys being successful due to the monetization. When you look at it, what is the minimum on the spending you all think you need to do in, like, 2012 to hold your acreage? I mean, could you cut a little bit more? Or are you basically running at bare minimum right now to hold your acreage?","Aubrey K. McClendon","From our perspective, it's not really the consideration that drives us. I mean, our goal is to get away from being this overweighted towards gas producer. And to do that, we have to spend money. The good news is we can spend more money than our cash flow quite significantly and yet still reduce our debt and not increase our share count. So to me, that should be the focus. Sure, we could cut our rig count significantly from here, but I think that does expose some of our leasehold to potential expiry. On the gas side, we're basically about done. I think when we get down to 2 rigs in the Haynesville, that's all we'll need. The Marcellus, we're actually in a lease renewal program to try and enable us to get down to that 12 rigs we talked about. So again, this is all a very deliberate plan, and we could -- today, the focus of the call could've been we're going to live within our cash flow, it's all going to come from gas. And frankly, I think that would be a pretty sad story. So our plan instead, starting over a year ago, was to make this transition. And we knew we had enough assets in the attic, so to speak, that we could sell them and yet still grow our production by 25%, still pay down debt by 25% and make that transition. And of course, to do so in a $2 gas world\u2019s tough. But we're up to it and that's what we intend to do. So back to the heart of your question, we have a lot of optionality with regard to rig counts. Right now, we're trying to find the optimum level that minimizes leasehold problems and minimizes firm transport problems and also accelerates the transition away from assets that don't produce much cash flow today, which are gas assets, to assets that produce a lot of cash flow, which are oil and natural gas liquids assets.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And so I mean, the bottom line is, I guess, I'm not questioning your ability to execute on the monetizations because you've got a pretty good track record. And can you sort of give us an update then with where you are with regards to, I guess, the next few important ones, like the Permian, Mississippi and as well as the Eagle Ford VPP?","Aubrey K. McClendon","Yes, sure. I'll let Nick speak to the VPP, but that's in the not-too-distant future, I think. And with regard to Permian, the data room opens next Monday, our physical data room. I think the virtual data room has been opened a little bit. We have a long line of people want to be in it. It's the hottest basin in the world in all likelihood. And from our perspective, it's just not a place we were ever going to be #1 or #2. And I think when all the dust settles here and you look at the company, what do we want to achieve, and we want to achieve the best returns in the business. And to do that, I think you've got to be the best at what you do. And for us, that's going to be, to be #1 and #2 in 11 of the most important plays in the nation after we sell the Permian. So the Permian will get bought either in 3 packages, a group of 3 packages, or individually in those 3 packages. And there will be companies that either want to establish a presence in that basin or who want to solidify that. So we hope to have an announcement there in the first part of the third quarter and to get it closed in the third quarter. The Miss Lime data rooms have been open now for several weeks. And I'm pleased with the interest that we see in that asset and look forward to announcing that as well. That will probably happen, I would think, before the Permian. Nick, do you want to add anything on the VPP?","Domenic J. Dell\u2019Osso","No. It's like you said, it's relatively near-term and we're working through that. Those are transactions, obviously, that we have a lot of confidence in. We've completed 10 before and we have a lot of confidence in this one, as well.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Fair enough. And one last question, on your Founders Well Program, if I'm not mistaken, I mean, that wasn't necessarily like a conveyance of wellbores. Do you hold, I guess, acreage when you sort of opt in to the wells, that right to. Any kind of like future downspacing opportunities which would you also be involved in?","Aubrey K. McClendon","Yes. I believe, Scott, the language is governmental spacing unit. And so yes, and I pay for that acreage and then I receive an assignment of the governmental spacing unit.","Operator","Next, we'll move to Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","My question is on the projected guidance, net of the asset sales, because clearly, it seems, I guess, you've got confidence in the line of sight now to give us an indication what happens when you monetize the assets. What I'm trying to understand is the longer-term guidance hasn't changed. And obviously, you're knocking out a fair amount of production on liquids next year. Can you help us with the moving parts? What are you assuming from the VPP, the Permian asset sale and the Miss Lime? And then looking longer-term, what's coming in extra that's making up a difference that allows you to stand by the 250,000 barrels in your target by 2015?","Aubrey K. McClendon","I\u2019ll take the longer-term target and let Nick talk about the shorter-term. Long term, Doug, is simply that we don't have to have all of the assets we have today to meet those targets. And so while selling the Permian or selling 25% of the Miss Lime certainly impacts 2012 and 2013 production, that's why we brought down our guidance. It doesn't do anything in terms of our ability to meet our out-year targets because we'll simply have drilled more Eagle Ford wells and more Utica wells and more Cleveland Tonkawa wells than we otherwise would have. Of course, remember, the Miss Lime JV also allows us to accelerate drilling on the asset. So not only does it save us CapEx, but it also drives our production higher from an asset after we do a JV. So the company has the ability through all of its liquids-rich asset plays to meet its out-year goals. It's simply the $2 gas that's required us to take a little bit of a step-back here and so more deeply into the portfolio. But it doesn't have anything -- any impact on '14 and '15. So I'll let...","Domenic J. Dell\u2019Osso","Yes. From a near-term perspective, Doug, we baked all of this into our guidance now, as you point out. And one of the changes is that from previous looks at this, we've moved our Eagle Ford VPP up in the year. And so that has a bigger impact on near-term cash flow as a result, near-term production as a result. VPPs, of course, are assets that we've transferred the rights to production but only in certain wellbores; those wellbores decline. So the impact of that VPP sale over time diminishes greatly. And so that's one of the reasons why you saw a lot of production upfront and that changes your near-term production guidance, but it doesn't change it as much in the out-years. And of course, we don't sell any rights or anything around those wellbores, and so we retain all of that growth prospectivity around the Eagle Ford. And that's really what drives some of that difference.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. I appreciate. My follow-up, Aubrey, is really more of a conceptual question. Clearly, the market doesn't really seem terribly receptive to what's been happening here recently. And looking at your share price now, you're basically lining out more than $15 billion of asset sales over the next 2 years. My understanding is some of your newer leases, the liquids-rich leases, have longer-dated expiries. So maybe you've got a little bit more flexibility there perhaps. But my question is why not redirect some of that capital back to buying back your stock at these levels?","Aubrey K. McClendon","We first have to get our debt down to where we want it, Doug, and then I think that's actually a legitimate portion of -- can be a legitimate portion of our strategy going forward. I mean, clearly, you get half of something for free here when you buy our stock, in my opinion. You buy our gas business and you get the oil business for free. Or you buy the oil business and you get the gas business for free. You buy -- Nick mentioned the PV-10 of our proved assets using just -- the 10-year strip is $24 billion. That doesn't include our Oilfield Services business, our Midstream business. So that means you get all the uncrude for free. So there's something free here that's substantial no matter how you look at it. And so we're trying to get to that promised land as quickly as possible. And maybe some people think you should just sit there and be stuck in the mud of $2 gas prices. But we don't believe that's the way to go. And so as a consequence, we're going to spend the capital needed to make that transition, but we're going to decrease our debt and not increase our share count to do that, and I think it's pretty extraordinary. If in 2013, we get to a point where our debt reduction targets have been met, we're satisfied that our funding has been met and the stock price still represents a compelling opportunity, there's no reason why we couldn't redirect capital towards that.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Aubrey, I don't want to labor the point, but let me be clear what I'm asking you. If you've got a lot of flexibility in your capital expenditure, why not just defer that and buy back your stock today?","Aubrey K. McClendon","Because the board and management's #1 goal is \u2013 twin #1 goals are to reduce our debt, as we've said we will, under the 25\/25 Plan and to make a transition from gas to oil. That's the best way to be -- have a long-term sustainable company. And to buy back our equity at this point, in our view, does not create the long-term sustainability that we want from a balance sheet perspective and from a corporate asset productivity perspective.","Operator","We'll hear next from Neal Dingmann with SunTrust.","Neal Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Just 2 questions. First, Aubrey, Just wondering in your comments on -- I noticed you tended to go nonconsent on a few more wells than typical; kind of your comments on that. Going forward, is that going to be kind of a routine pattern? Or how do you see that playing out?","Aubrey K. McClendon","Yes. But that's really only gas wells. And specifically, primarily, the Haynesville, we had a couple of operators there that still are more active there than we would care to be. And so we only lose a wellbore when we do that. And I'm not exactly sure on the nonconsent penalties, but they can be 300%, 300% or 400%, 400%, so you're back at it at some point. But we have now close to, I think, 6,000 wells left to drill in the Haynesville. So if we lose our wellbore rights to a few that are operated by others, that's okay. And we didn't do that in the first quarter because the election for those wells would have been made in the third and fourth quarters of 2011, when gas prices were projected obviously to be about double where they are here. So we're in a situation where gas prices have been halved from where we thought they would be at the beginning of the winter. And that doesn't halve your cash flow from those assets. It basically wipes it out because you have obviously fixed costs. So at any rate, as a consequence of where we are in the gas price world, we're obviously making lots of changes here, and not the least of which is to not elect in gas wells being drilled by others on a much more selective basis.","Neal Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just move onto maybe obviously either you or Steve, just wondering on 2 things here. First, either in the Utica or then look at the Eagle Ford. Obviously, I think in the Utica, because the state always wants that pre-peak [ph], I understand why you've put that out. It was just maybe seeing if you could help us understand behind either like the Shaw or the Burgett or, I mean, the 3 that were talked about, maybe what the typical sustained rate is today versus just that peak rate out there. And maybe if you could do the same thing in the Eagle Ford, around that McKenzie D 3H and as well as the Blakeway.","Steven C. Dixon","Well, I, Neil, don't have that with me on what those wells are making today. They're declining like most all of our shale plays. We're very pleased, the results, I mean, good IPs, it's oil, high liquids. So this is a great play. But the reality is we only have 9 producers, and so not much data yet.","Aubrey K. McClendon","That's all right. I was just going to point out that the Buell is really an important well. And the Buell was the well that was shut in for the longest before it came on. And so one of the approaches we've taken in here is that our wells are -- we're not bringing them on immediately after completion. Sometimes that's due to pipeline delay, but sometimes, it's due to certain engineering and production performance benefits that we get by leaving them shut in for a while. So if you look at the Buell, at least 575,000 barrels of liquids and 13 Bcf of gas, it may very well be our best shale well ever. And so I think that's a great indication of what's likely to come going forward in that play. But you're never going to get the information you probably desire from the state reports because it's never going to report liquids and it's always going to be at peak rate. So I think you'll just have to watch the play develop. And the good news is a lot of other producers are getting in the area and starting to talk about it more, I think you'll be able to triangulate in to what we see, which is how could we be more pleased with the play when in one of your first wells, you drilled your best shale well ever after having drilled thousands of shale wells. So I think it really bodes well for the play going forward.","Neal Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Aubrey, what's your sort of forecast, I guess, about the western flank of the Utica? I mean, what\u2019s your expectation, it\u2019s a little bit even further less than you've drilled.","Aubrey K. McClendon","Well, if you think about -- if you mean by western flank, if you meaning the oil window, I would probably characterize it a little bit differently. We would look at our oil window as not being on the flank but instead being right up against our wet gas window. And again, we've been careful not to say how much of our oil window acreage, which is around 400,000 acres, is likely to be prospective because we just don't know yet. We haven't drilled enough wells there. But obviously, we're very encouraged by the Anadarko wells that have been drilled down to the south in the oil window. And so I think we'll know a lot more in the next 60, 90, 120 days both from our own drilling but also that from others. So there were a lot of people who said we couldn't crack the code in the oil phase of the Eagle Ford as well. And we routinely bring in wells of 500 to 1,000 barrels a day there. So we remain confident about the oil window of the Utica. It's just our focus to date has been on something that we knew would work well, and that was the wet gas side of the play.","Operator","We'll hear next from Monroe Helm with Barrow, Hanley.","H. Monroe Helm - Barrow, Hanley, Mewhinney & Strauss, Inc.","I'd just like to follow up on the comment that you -- one of your colleagues made earlier about taking hedges off last year. Can you kind of walk us back through what precipitated you reducing your -- or taking off your hedges on the gas side?","Aubrey K. McClendon","Sure, be happy to, Monroe. So first of all, to give you some context, since 2006, I think our gains have been about $8.5 billion. I think that's, by far, the best in the industry. Our track record is not perfect, but I think that's pretty good. And so what happened last fall was in one of the Greek euro market swoons, oil prices dropped down to lower levels; gas prices dropped, we thought, without any regard to the fundamentals. And so we took them off and look to put them back on when things stabilize. In oil, we did. We got, I think, all of our oil hedges back on at I think it was $7 or $8, maybe higher than where we had put them on. So that created a lot of value for us. And gas, just we never got the chance again. And obviously, we are not happy with that decision. If we had to do it all over again with the hindsight of winter, we would've obviously done something different. But to me, it's a little bit like owning a stock and everybody's owned a stock. It's met 80% of your expectations and then you begin to think about is it time to sell, is this what I came for. And from us, we thought we had received a gift, a downdraft that was unrelated to fundamentals in the U.S. gas market. And we thought we would take advantage of that. We have routinely done this in the past and have been quite successful. This is the only time that I can remember that we took hedges off and then it just fell away from us. So we got most of what we came for. And honestly, we would've probably never kept them until today. And with gas prices, when they started to fall aggressively, December, January, we would've continued to probably lift for the reason that I stated, that we would've captured most of what we came for. And so today, we're in a gas market that looks bad, but at the same time, you've got the demand pickup from coal. You've got producers. I mean, look at us, we've gone from 100 gas rigs running at the start of 2010 and we're going to be at 12 in 90 days. And we haven\u2019t talked about this, but our gas production from a peak production capacity in 2012 to 2013 will decline 10% or 12%. This is a company that's single-handedly responsible for 25% of the gas production growth in the whole U.S. over the last 5 years, and our production goes down by 10% to 12%. So it guarantees that there will be a different gas market going forward, and you're well aware of all the demand initiatives underway. So I hope that gives you some further insight into the decision that we made.","H. Monroe Helm - Barrow, Hanley, Mewhinney & Strauss, Inc.","Okay. Could I ask a follow-up? Your gas wellhead realization seemed to be lower than what would be indicated by the futures market or the spot market. Are your wellhead prices been affected by the need to make payments to pipelines in your agreements for takeaway capacity? Or is there something else going on? Or am I totally wrong?","Aubrey K. McClendon","I don't think we've had to make any firm transport payments yet. But Nick, correct me, but...","Domenic J. Dell\u2019Osso","Yes. We've made -- as we discussed in our filings, we've made some payments to, under minimum volume commitments, Chesapeake Midstream Partners over the last couple years. If we've made any other FT payments thus far, they've been relatively small. It's been part of our calculation to determine how much gas we wanted to or we were comfortable with curtailing this year. And so there are optimal points where you might be willing to make some of those payments versus producing the gas. But in general, our transportation costs are just -- the transportation costs around the industry are relatively high. Getting gas out of the Barnett is quite expensive. All that infrastructure had to be built and it eats into our differentials considerably. Further, gas transportation out of the wet gas plays or the liquids-rich plays can be expensive because the volumes are not all that high, but the infrastructure still has to be built in order to get the oil supply.","Aubrey K. McClendon","And Monroe, we did increase our expected differentials, I think, in our outlook as well to try and account for that. And then in NGLs going forward right now, they're low, but we think plant turnaround season will bring them back up. So long-term, we see that we spend a lot of time studying NGL markets and believe that the growth in NGL demand will keep up with the supply generally. But there will be times perhaps when NGL prices can be weak for a couple of weeks.","Operator","And we'll move next to Jeff Robertson with Barclays.","Jeffrey W. Robertson - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Aubrey, in the oil part of the Utica play with the results you all anticipate later this year, is that a candidate for some sort of monetization in the future, either a joint venture or another one of these asset-level preferreds that you all have done?","Aubrey K. McClendon","Yes, definitely. Jeff, we really have 2 more JVs we could do in the Utica. One is on the dry gas side and the other is on the oil side. So I think, ultimately, we could do 3 there. And the question at this time, I don't think now is the time to do one on the dry gas side. If someone approached us with the right idea, we might look at it. But in terms of -- and then on the oil side, we just have to wait to be able to confirm that we've got a viable play there. And we think we do, but don't have enough wells yet to prove that. I think if you look into 2013 and say okay, well, you've got another funding gap in '13. As you continue to make this transition to liquids from gas, where is that going to come from? I think the Utica is certainly another area that you can look at for us to do JVs that would create quite a bit of value for us.","Jeffrey W. Robertson - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Would a monetization there, I guess, it would then probably impact the liquids progression that you laid out, which, I think -- or will it?","Aubrey K. McClendon","No. It wouldn't, Jeff. I mean, we really have very little contribution modeled from that area right now. So I wouldn't -- these out-year estimates really do assume that we continue to meet our obligations. For example, in '13, we've already accounted for the fact that we'll be selling some assets. So we think that we've got that all accounted for in both our short-term and our longer-term asset models.","Jeffrey W. Robertson - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Then secondly, do your asset sale targets for this year include any other acreage monetizations, like the Woodford deal you all announced a month or so ago? You've got acreage in, I think you said the Woodbine and you all have had acreage up in the Williston and probably other areas as well.","Aubrey K. McClendon","Yes. We're still working our Williston acreage. It doesn't look like it's going to work for the Bakken or the Three Forks, but we've got some other ideas there. So I haven't given up there. We're getting ready to complete a well in another formation. DJ Basin has not worked for us in the Niobrara, although the Powder River has worked quite well. So those are 2 areas, plus you mentioned the Woodbine, all of which we've accounted for in our go-forward plans. So again, we tried -- sometimes you try to get in plays and sometimes you're successful with where you want to be and sometimes you're not. So again, as we look at the company going forward, we want to be real simple about our goals, which is, if we own it, we're going to be #1 and #2 in it. If we can't get there, then we're going to sell it and let somebody else consolidate their position. We're big believers in the vertical integration and also to have scale in these plays because it\u2019s an important point. Going forward, the company is going to look dramatically different than what it's looked in the last 7 years. We've gone through a tumultuous time in our company's history and in the industry's history. The industry has been -- 100 years of history has been completely remade in 7 years, and we helped make some of that history and we participated in the rest of it. But going forward, we're not looking to take what we've learned and go overseas or go to Canada. All we want to do is drill wells on acreage that we already own and to turn this into a high-margin manufacturing business, and I think we can do that. And it's -- to go retool your factories while they're running and while they're running today, producing 84% gas, when the gas doesn't make much money, it's a daunting challenge. But the alternative of sitting there and doing nothing and just waiting for gas prices to recover, I know that's a losing strategy. And I think our strategy will be a very winning strategy going forward and we just got to get through what's going to be a tough year this year and a lot of concern about our asset monetizations. But of all things that we've done well over the years, I think to deliver those have been certainly one of the things we've done best. So looking forward to getting into a time of better gas prices, but more importantly, a more balanced strategy with regard to gas and oil and winnowing our asset base down to those things where we're only #1 or #2.","Operator","We'll take our next question from David Kistler with Simmons & Co.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Real quickly, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned being free cash flow positive in 2014. Can you give us a little bit more color around the assumptions that drive that? And would CapEx ultimately be the plug to achieve that commitment?","Aubrey K. McClendon","I'm sorry. Was what the plug, Dave?","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","CapEx maybe?","Aubrey K. McClendon","Well, sure. That, and if we had to sell an asset, that would be the plug. But right now, we are anticipating around $7 billion of cash flow. I think the oil price there is around $100 and I think gas prices are in the $5 range. So that's not much higher than where the strip would be, I think, particularly once we get through the summer and work off a lot of this balance. So you have prices today that are unsustainable. And the good news about unsustainable trends is that they're unsustainable. So this will get itself fixed in at least the next year, if not closer in. And so anyway, that's our goal in 2014 and we'll toggle CapEx to get there. If we have to have a little bit of an asset sale at some point, we can do that, as well.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Okay. And that's helpful. And then just maybe following up on that, in your forward guidance for 2013, gas price is now targeted around $3.50 an Mcf, down from $5. You talked a little bit about the 10% to 12% reduction and gas production between '12 and '13. It seems like that might be a little inconsistent with that $3.50 number that's obviously contributing to a larger cash flow deficit versus CapEx that year. Can you just give us color on why you think it's $3.50? Are you erring on the side of caution? Or is that firmly where you think you are?","Domenic J. Dell\u2019Osso","Yes. No, Dave, that's exactly right. We are erring a bit on the side of caution. We try to true up pretty close to the strip. I think actually now we're a little even below the strip for 2013. We give a range, of course, from $3 to $4 on 2013 and try to pick something where the strip was approximately in the middle. So we're pleased that, frankly, it's relatively conservative. And it's a good reminder that there's a lot of variables here at play and we continue to try and be flexible around those variables. And right now, we're certainly focused on the fact that gas has been weaker than the entire market expected it to be in 2012. And we're doing all the things that we think are prudent to aid in the recovery. And we don't want to be optimistic about what gas prices are going to be in an improving play. And so this is just being clear about what our expectations are and how we think about running the business from a flexibility standpoint.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Okay. And just building on that a little bit, Aubrey, you mentioned that the rig count cut had gone from 100 rigs on the gas side down to a projected level of 12, and that's driving a 10% to 12% reduction in gas -- indirect production for '13. Do you think that, that's the kind of cuts we need to see across the whole industry in order to balance this out? Obviously, we've seen 40-plus percent cuts at this point. But how much deeper do you think they have to go to true up to the same sort of experience you're having?","Aubrey K. McClendon","Well, I think the question is complicated, in the sense that you'd have to factor in a winter, where you didn't burn a Tcf of gas, which is 4% of all the gas consumption in the U.S. just didn't happen. So a lot of people, in my opinion, are looking at today's gas price and saying that, that is a function of where gas supply and demand are at this price when the reality is this has put a Tcf of extra production or less demand into the market. And as a consequence, you've got to get rid of it. And to do that, you've got to lower the price. And the good news is for producers, I mean, while this is a very painful year, we're going to incentivize decades' worth of increased gas consumption as a result of what's happening this year. So you just got to get through it, and we'll get through it. And my view is that we'll overcut on gas drilling and you'll probably be surprised by the rebound in pricing. It's one of the reasons why I'm so in favor of LNG exports because I think it provides a relief valve. I mean, this kind of yo-yo back and forth on gas drilling activity is hard on the industry. It's hard on its shareholders, it's hard on service companies. And ultimately, it doesn't help consumers to stay concerned about it as well. Whereas if you had an export capability, when you had a winter like this, you could just step up exports and have a balanced market. So I think we're headed there, and Shiner will get us there plus other facilities. And so we view that we're taking the proper steps by curtailing production and slashing our gas drilling to a minimum, and we're determined to be a big part of the solution to the gas market overhang that exists today as a result of the winter. And we'll see what the summer brings. Hopefully, it'll be 120 in Boston and 140 in Houston, and we'll get rid of this in the same way that it came to us.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Appreciate that. One last just quick one on the curtailments. Looking at the levels for Feb and January that you've done so far and then looking at what you're projecting for the balance of the year, it looks like at some point this year, you're going to be reducing those. Can you give us kind of a timing of that? Are you reducing them currently and then expecting you might have some more in the fall? Or how does that map out to true up to your guidance on that?","Aubrey K. McClendon","Yes. We're not going to disclose specifics on that. No need to telegraph our plans to the market. But clearly, if you look at our previous guidance to now, we anticipate the market cleaning itself up faster than maybe what we thought before we've seen pretty strong demand increase on the power side. And so we feel like we'll be able to reduce some of our curtailments going forward, but at this point, have no interest in being any more specific than that. I hope you'll understand that.","Domenic J. Dell\u2019Osso","To clarify one point you made though, we did not start curtailments until February.","Operator","We'll take our next question from David Wheeler with AllianceBernstein.","David Wheeler","Aubrey, on the finding and development costs, you talked about $10 going forward. I always think of the oil and liquids plays when I talk to companies and they give you the well costs and the EURs as something like a $15 to $20 F&D. Can you talk a little bit about why -- how you see the $10 F&Ds? Is that sort of a benefit of the JVs carrying some of your capital?","Aubrey K. McClendon","Yes. David, I think there are quite a few things embedded in that. First of all, we will go forward always be able to find gas. And so I think our Marcellus finding costs are less than $1. And Haynesville and Barnett, if we ever get going there again are solidly just above that range. So you always have contribution, and then we're in some low-cost plays. I mean, if you look at the Mississippi finding costs, you look at Eagle Ford finding costs, we think on a blended basis that we should be able to be in that $10 per barrel number. And remember, Dave, that's almost a 40% increase from where we are today, so we are modeling that as we go forward, those costs should jump up as more and more of our finding is related to liquids plays rather than gas plays.","David Wheeler","Yes, as well the margins. But you mentioned cash flow. I just wanted to ask you a couple questions on the long-term growth expectations. You mentioned cash flow positive in '14 and cash flow on the order of $7 billion. So is that also -- and you also mentioned a 10% to 15% growth rate for production and cash flow. I think that was a longer-term number. So is it the right way saying, what they\u2019re saying about this, $7 billion of spending-ish should get you 10% to 15% growth?","Aubrey K. McClendon","Yes. I think that's the right way to look at it, Dave. And of course, it is dependent on gas prices. If gas prices never get above $3 or $4, then we would continue to need to make asset sales. But in our models, at the $5 gas and at $100 oil, we're balanced in 2014, and that's our goal. And we've been trying to get to a point where we have a business model that we think what we have today is defendable and sustainable. But when it depends on selling part of what you find every year, people will never be comfortable with signing on for that. And so what people always want to do, and this is proper, is to look at what your operating cash flow is and your projected CapEx and look at whether you've got a deficit or if you've got a surplus at that point. And that's where we want to get to. But we could never get to that balance in 2014 if we were to remain a 90% natural gas producer. So that's why all the heavy lifting in 2011, '12 and '13 to take the nation's second-largest gas producer and turn it into a top 10 oil producer. Probably by the time we get done, we'll be close to a top 5 oil producer in the country. And I think people will be, frankly, astounded that we've been able to do it and been able to do it without increasing our share count and while still bringing our debt down.","David Wheeler","Okay, good. And one last one for you. Gas reserves, you guys -- given the slowdown in drilling for gas wells, you guys have, I think, 7 Tcf of 1P gas reserves that are undeveloped. Do you anticipate some reduction in the proven gas reserves because of the slowdown in drilling?","Aubrey K. McClendon","I don't think it will be slowdown. We'll probably lose reserves through this year as the impact of the SEC pricing rolls through. You remember we're now on a basically trailing last 4 quarters basis. And so some of those PUDs certainly will be exposed to lower gas prices, but they won't go away from a resource base and they will come back to us in 2013. So the 5-year rule is we're fine there because again we project to get back after it once gas prices recover. And we think the market will continue to need more gas as these demand initiatives kick in. So if you see us lose reserves through the year, it will be from the mandated SEC pricing, not from having no expectation of being able to drill the wells.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Following up on Dave Wheeler's question. If we look at your 2013 guidance for proved well costs, unproved well costs, midstream, capitalized interest and dividends, i.e. your ongoing cash outflows, we get to about $10 billion at the midpoint. And as you were just discussing, it seems like you're assuming a much lower ongoing rate of spending. Can you speak more specifically about where that flexibility is to reduce? And assuming that you do plan to maintain your 2013 rig count in future years, shouldn't we see some upward pressure as a result of carried interest from JV projects -- different joint ventures rolling off?","Aubrey K. McClendon","When you say pressure, you mean higher CapEx?","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes, exactly. One would assume that your 2012 and '13 spending is benefiting from some of the carries from joint ventures; of course, you're planning on consummating new ones. But wouldn't we see as sort of carries roll off and you don't reduce your account, that your CapEx pressure would rise?","Aubrey K. McClendon","Yes. Let's review where we are right now. Steve, help me on this. But obviously, our Haynesville carry is gone. Our Barnett carry is gone. Our Eagle Ford carry is gone. Our Marcellus -- where are we on the Marcellus? It's done. So we have no more left there. So really, the only carry we have left right now is the Utica and the Utica wet gas.","Steven C. Dixon","And the Niobrara.","Aubrey K. McClendon","And sorry, we do have CNOOC carrying us in the Niobrara. So actually, as those continue to roll, we'll actually be rolling on new ones, I think, for the Utica dry gas, Utica wet oil -- not wet oil, Utica oil, and then also, the Mississippian as well. So actually, we've calculated all that in. Steve, you might just hit us with some percentages. I think in 2013, our budget is 30% Eagle Ford. Is that right?","Steven C. Dixon","Yes. But that's actually greater than that. It\u2019s almost 40%.","Aubrey K. McClendon","30% in 2012, about 40% in 2013.","Steven C. Dixon","39%.","Aubrey K. McClendon","And just to get through some -- glancing at our schedule for 2013, we're going to average -- I think we've got 11 rigs on the gas side, and then just in plays like the Mississippi, we're at 22. The Utica, all-in, around 22. And then if I add up the -- back up to around 33 in the Eagle Ford. And then if I add up the Anadarko Basin, you are at around 23 to 25 or so. So basically, when you look at the company in 2013, the Eagle Ford, Anadarko Basin, Utica will be the prime drivers of it. So again, a focus on almost all oil. And based on what oil prices do, based on gas prices do, we'll modulate around that. But the goal is to be at 2\/3 in '13 and have our CapEx be right line with where our cash flow is. I'm sorry, that's 2014.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Right. So I guess, going from kind of a $10 billion number to a $7 billion number, is there anything specific beyond potential rig count reductions where that one could then -- people might not be focusing on as one-offs aspects of the 2013 budget?","Aubrey K. McClendon","I mean, the major thing, Brian, is just rig count. In the fourth quarter, we were running 172 rigs. In the third quarter this year, we're running 125. That's almost a 1\/3 decline. So I think it should be pretty obvious where it's coming from, on rig count. And then we do think we'll see lower costs, and the first quarter took the brunt of third and fourth quarter 2011 per unit cost. And Steve, frac costs and all that are down, sometimes 25%, 30% or more.","Steven C. Dixon","Yes. I mean, per unit costs are way down; efficiencies are going up because we've done some ramp-up. But like in Eagle Ford, we're just getting better every week. And as you said on cost, I mean, we did have some overhang. We had 20 frac crews running in gas plays at the end of the year and we have 6 today. So it\u2019s just, that spend is just way down.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. Okay. And separately, as you move more into development mode and as your lease acquisitions are reduced, do you anticipate needing any meaningful human capital shifts away from those focused on land acquisition? Or are there meaningful land and title-related issues that remain? Do you see any G&A savings\u2026","Aubrey K. McClendon","Yes. Those numbers will continue to go down as they have. We probably, at our peak, had over 5,000 people in the field, some -- obviously, most leasing, but a lot doing work getting wells ready. And so \u2013 and that's why you make them contract employee \u2013 or not employees but why they are contractors. And we're continuing to shed in the field and will going forward because we'll be down in maintenance CapEx levels of, I think, not more than $500 million a year in 2013 and beyond. You'll still need people in the field to make final deals with holdouts and to get damages settled and get abstracts built for title opinions and so forth. But in terms of having the massive army, it's not needed anymore because from my perspective, and I think the rest of the management team shares this, is we embarked on a journey 7 years ago to participate in the remaking of the industry. And I think after this year, it will have been remade. And if you stayed with conventional assets, you completely lost out. If you started late to unconventional assets, you're probably now forced to go buy them in the form of a company or in the form of an asset collection. And I think going forward, companies like us will be incredibly favored as we have these #1 and #2 positions in 11 plays and all we do is focus on driving returns higher from our existing assets. And that's -- 95% of the people who have ever heard of us, who have ever followed us have never known us in that kind of a mode. And it's going to be a big surprise for people. But it's going to be the absolute, inevitable transition from this participating in the 7-year unconventional resource revolution. And we're excited to turn the page. This has obviously been stressful. It's hard work. It's not easy. But the prize that we're after is to have the best asset base in the industry, and I think we've achieved that. And now from that best asset base in the industry, our goal is to achieve the best returns in the industry. And if we can do that, I think that we are likely to be a company that will be a great performer for investors going forward.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","One last very quick one, did the increase in your 2013 liquids differential reflect a more cautious view on NGL prices or a greater percentage of NGLs in your mix?","Aubrey K. McClendon","Mix stays the same, just all about the problem with ethane prices that we're going to encounter from time to time.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Matt Portillo with Tudor, Pickering, Holt.","Matthew Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Just 2 quick questions for me. In terms of the infrastructure side of the equation, could you first provide some color on the possible volumetric commitments for takeaway from your dry gas plays? And does your current guidance for 2012 and 2013 ensure that you'll meet those commitments? And then the second question, just along the lines of the VPP and the Eagle Ford, could you provide any detail on how much production you may actually put into that VPP?","Domenic J. Dell\u2019Osso","No. We're not ready to provide exact guidance on a VPP that hasn't yet closed. So I'll just hold off on that until we have a completed transaction to talk about. But I will just reiterate that it is baked into our guidance that we've provided today. On the commitments related to minimum volumes, et cetera, those are detailed in our filings. And we take all of that into account when we set our drilling schedule and expectations around how much we want to spend in wells that we want to bring online. So at end of the day, it can all be a part of a financial analysis. We think that we will potentially have some payments to some of our midstream partners under those agreements. But at this point, we do our best to minimize them and timing will affect some of that. And we'll continue to try to optimize that analysis as much as possible.","Steven C. Dixon","Very little in 2012; it would not come into effect really until our gas starts dropping in 2013.","Domenic J. Dell\u2019Osso","And we'll do our best to keep those as close to 0 as possible.","Matthew Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","And is that included in your LOE guidance, just so that from a modeling perspective, we can take that into account?","Domenic J. Dell\u2019Osso","It would come in, in our differentials.","Operator","Next, we'll go to Charles Meade, Johnson Rice.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","Two things. I guess, maybe this first one for Nick, just the nuts and bolts of the guidance on liquids for 2012. As far as I appreciate it, the liquid being guided down versus what we had for February 21, that's -- new in the Eagle Ford VPP. Am I correct?","Domenic J. Dell\u2019Osso","We had a VPP in there, but we had it later in the year. So one of the big changes is the timing, and it was smaller. So we brought a lot of wells online there this year, and so we've expanded the size of it as well.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","And is the kind of the composition of the Permian transaction the same in both of those books?","Domenic J. Dell\u2019Osso","Well, we did not have the Permian transaction baked into our forecast in our previous outlook, so that's new in this outlook and it's a big driver in the change downward, as the Mississippi Lime was not baked into our outlook the last time either.","Aubrey K. McClendon","Plus the Texoma sale of Exxon was not in it, as well.","Domenic J. Dell\u2019Osso","Right. So there's really a lot more monetizations in there this time. And at the last time we provided outlook, we tried to be clear about what was not in there. Even though it was announced intentions, they were relatively early in their process and we did not yet have enough feel for exactly how those transactions would come together. So we provided guidance without them and just tried to indicate how we thought you might think about framing those transactions in your analysis.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","Got it. Great. That's exactly what I was after. And the second piece, looking at the presentation you guys put out today, there's a lot of, I guess, really good, new interesting detail on a lot of your plays, but particularly on the Eagle Ford. I was wondering if you guys could talk a little bit about what you're seeing across your pretty wide acreage spread there, if there's any parts of it that you're more excited about or parts that you're still left to be figured out and what you're seeing in well costs there.","Steven C. Dixon","This is Steve. We're very excited about results really across our whole play. Our science and engineering teams have done a good job on picking our acreage. As we got into the play kind of late, so we had a little better understanding when we bought our leasehold. And so really, it's working across our whole play. So we're very excited about it. We've had excellent results now, and we run on 60 wells this quarter. So certainly, our knowledge base and history is growing and it's all looking good. And now that we've kind of leveled off on rig count, not ramping up, our teams are really performing well. And so as I mentioned, our cycle times, our drilling times are down about 20% already. We've had some excellent service cost reductions, like our stimulation, pumping services, latest bids there are down almost 25%. So really good things are happening in the Eagle Ford. And that's where we're putting our money. Like I say, next year, it's almost 40% of our capital. So it's performing quite well and we're very excited about it.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","Got it. And I guess, what I was after there was that this is shallower than a lot of the other Eagle Ford. And I know that, for example, in your Dimmit County acreages, Anadarko has had some really great success there, not so much with the eye-popping IPs, but more just because the shallower and lower well costs or drilling complete costs. But I guess you guys kind of don't want to disclose that at this point.","Steven C. Dixon","No. And this is in Texas and on some big ranches. And so we're drilling a lot of 6,000, 7000-foot laterals there also. So good wells but not necessarily super cheap because they're long laterals with lots of frac stages.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Michael Hall with Robert W. Baird.","Jeffrey L. Mobley","We'll take your call, Michael, and we'd like to just kind of just wrap up the call with your call. I know that there's probably several other questions left. But please call John or myself later today. But we'll go ahead and take your call, Michael -- or your question.","Michael A. Hall - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I appreciate that. Just one for me. Given the increased, I guess, dependency on NGLs, consistent with the wider differential there, there seems to be -- my understanding is there's a less robust hedging market around NGLs. I guess are you seeing any developments in that market? Or does that fact kind of increase the risk profile of your growth plan in your perspective?","Aubrey K. McClendon","Well, I guess -- well, first of all, there's not a good way to hedge natural gas liquids so I agree with you there. There's not much you can do except just kind of go with the market. But we do spend a lot of time talking to fractionators and crackers, and we believe that those folks are making the requisite investments that are needed to keep up with the supply growth. And remember, those are things that can be, for the most part, exported either in a liquid form or in a solid form. So we're pretty confident that NGL values at the end of the day in the U.S. will be supported by what's happening around the world. But people need to recognize that, for example, in Conway, Kansas, NGL -- ethane prices are only 20% of what they are at Belvieu. But that's going to get fixed. And just like WTI to Brent is going to get fixed, with the Seaway Pipeline and additional pipelines, you're going to see the Belvieu to -- or Conway to Belvieu discount get fixed as well. So that will happen in time. And the U.S. has the lowest feedstock for the petrochemical industry in the world. And as a consequence of that, you'll see plenty of demand pick up over time as well. It would be delightful if there was a forward liquid market that we could hedge NGLs into, but we can't. So we'll continue to look at hedging opportunities for oil and natural gas when the time is right. Jeff, back to you.","Jeffrey L. Mobley","Yes. I think we'll go ahead and wrap up the call. And if you have any questions, please contact myself, Jeff Mobley or John Kilgallon. And our contact information is at the bottom of yesterday's earnings release.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Jeff Mobley. Please go ahead, sir.","Jeffrey L. Mobley","Good morning, and thank you for joining our conference call today. I'd like to introduce the members of the management team that are on the call this morning. We have Aubrey McClendon, our Chief Executive Officer; Nick Dell'Osso, our Chief Financial Officer; Steve Dixon, our Chief Operating Officer; John Kilgallon, and Gary Clark from the Investor Relations team, and this is Jeff Mobley speaking.","Following the comments of the management team, we will take your questions this morning. And as I\u2019m sure you can understand, we are not going to be able to comment on matters that are subject to litigation or other enquiries. As usual, our call will last one hour. And now I'll turn the call over to Aubrey.","Aubrey K. McClendon","Good morning and thank you for joining us today. Despite experiencing the lowest natural gas prices in over 10 years during the 2012 second quarter, we're pleased with the company's performance during this challenging time for our industry. For example, our production surged ahead by 25% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. However, had it not been for our 330 million per day gas curtailment during the quarter, Chesapeake's production would have actually been up a remarkable 36% year-over-year.","These production increases are obviously impressive, but they are especially so for a company as large as ours. Most importantly, our oil production growth has really taken off. Starting from a base of 26,700 barrels per day in January 2010, in the past 10 quarters we have increased our oil production by 201% to 80,500 barrels per day.","Our natural gas liquids production growth has been very strong too, growing from 10,600 barrels per day in January 2010 to nearly 50,000 barrels per day in the second quarter, an increase of 370%. Taken together, Chesapeake\u2019s total liquids production over 130,200 barrels per day has now risen to 21% of our total production mix and we expect this percentage to continue trending upward to 35% of total production by 2015.","In addition, our second quarter liquids production was up 65% year-over-year and 15% sequentially. Looking across the industry, our year-over-year liquids production growth is the third best in the industry on an absolute basis, and on a percentage basis, it is the second best. Chesapeake is now the 11th largest liquids producer in the U.S. and we hope by 2015 to be knocking on the door of the top five liquids producers in the U.S.","You may recall that in 2010, when we had a very modest liquids production of about 30,000 barrels per day, we set a goal of reaching an exit rate of 250,000 barrels per day of liquids production in 2015. In 2011, we accelerated that goal to be an average of 250,000 barrels per day during all of 2015 rather than just an exit rate. Given that Chesapeake\u2019s production already exceeds 50% of our objective, it appears our ambitious target can likely be exceeded if present trends continue.","Turning to gas production, I hope you noticed that we are now projecting a decline in Chesapeake\u2019s gas production of approximately 7% in 2013. This will bring to an end our likely unprecedented public company record of 23 consecutive years of gas production growth, which has taken Chesapeake\u2019s gas production from 10 million cubic feet per day in 1993 to more than 300 times that level currently and in the process has helped transform U.S. gas market.","Moreover, Chesapeake\u2019s projected 7% downward trend in gas production for 2013 will likely continue beyond that year and till such time that gas prices rise to levels that make returns from drilling in our gas plays competitive with returns available from drilling in our liquids plays. In fact, by year-end 2013, we expect Chesapeake\u2019s gas production rate to have declined by 430 million cubic feet per day or 14% from our peak rate of 3.4 Bcf per day in 2012.","Including the production of our non-operating working interest owners and our royalty owners, the total decline in Chesapeake operated U.S. gas production is likely to be around 800 million to 900 million cubic feet of gas per day. And based on the substantial gas drilling rig count decline, last week reached the 12 year low in the embedded high decline rate in the country's existing natural gas production base.","We believe it won't be long until the EIA-914 data shows U.S. gas production on a confirmed downward trend. We believe this trend of declining gas production could continue as long as gas prices do not permit gas producers to earn an attractive return on the investments necessary to finish developing the big new unconventional gas fields that led to America's greatly increased gas production over the past five years. In addition, the gas storage overhang is decreasing by an average of 2 to 4 Bcf per day each week. If this trend continues and we experience a normal winter, the U.S. gas market could reverse its 900 Bcf year-over-year storage surplus established in April 2012 and lead to potential gas storage deficit in April 2013 of up to 900 Bcf.","As a result of this potential storage reversal, rising demand for natural gas across the economy and likely production declines from many gas producers as they continue shifting their CapEx towards more profitable liquids production, we expect gas markets to look very different during the next few years than they have looked during the past six months.","Chesapeake's management believes that based on the foregoing, the U.S. is likely in the very early stages of a multi-year up cycle in gas markets fundamentals and clear evidence of this new up cycle is readily apparent. Gas prices have bounced strongly upward, from $1.84 level set on April 19, which we believe marks the low in the four year down cycle that started in 2008.","Now I\u2019d like to return to Chesapeake's operational performance during the first half of 2012, we added proved reserves of 4.2 Tcfe through the drillbit or the equivalent of about 700 million barrels of oil equivalent at a very attractive finding and development costs of only $1.14 per Mcfe or [$6.84](ph) per boe. Using current NYMEX strip pricing these added proved reserves at $10.2 billion of PV-10 value.","So to drive this important point home, I\u2019d like to reiterate that in first half of 2012, we invested $4.7 billion in our drilling programs. And from that drilling, we created $10.2 billion of future PV-10 proved reserve value. That means that for every one dollar that we invested in drilling in the first half of the year, we found $2.17 of PV-10 proved reserve value. In total that's a margin between finding costs and PV-10 value of $5.5 billion, or about $7 per share of net asset value creation for our shareholders, and that $7 per share value creation in just the first six months of 2012. We believe that's an exceptional performance especially during the six-month period of very low gas prices.","I believe it is this metric above all others that showcases the effectiveness of Chesapeake\u2019s drilling machine at converting large blocks of undeveloped leasehold into very large quantities of proved reserves. And we believe Chesapeake\u2019s performance can improve even further from this very high level as we progress from operations, designs for new asset identification and capture to more manufacturing like operations approach designed to maximize efficiency and returns as we shift more fully into harvest mode.","We are now able to increasingly focus on developing just the core of the core areas of our plays taking advantage of first well infrastructure, benefiting from economies of scale and development mode drilling efficiencies and also capitalizating on our substantial investments in human resources experience and technology.","In doing so, we're now projecting to reduce our capital expenditures from 2012 to 2013 by $6 billion, or about 45%. Clearly we have listened to investor feedback on this important topic.","We also enjoyed a very successful quarter in advancing our asset sale. As you know, our planned asset sales for the year are designed to help us afford to increase our liquids production, tighten the focus on our core assets, while also reducing our long-term debt by 25% from year end 2010. To achieve this important shift to a closer balance of liquids and natural gas production, we have invested billions of dollars over the few years.","While low gas prices have made this shift to liquids focused production more difficult to achieve, those falling gas prices also made the shift more urgent. However we've now captured what we set out to capture in terms of our resource base, this will now permit Chesapeake to be in asset harvest mode for a very long time.","As a result, we anticipate much higher returns from our portfolio than you\u2019ve seen in the past. With regard to specific asset sale information during the second quarter, we closed on $2.7 billion of asset sales, bringing our total for the first-half of the year to $4.7 billion. During the third quarter, we anticipate entering an asset sales agreements of approximately $7 billion, which would bring our asset sales to approximately $11.7 billion year-to-date. We continue to identify additional assets to sell, during the fourth quarter that will help meet our updated goal of $13 billion to $14 billion in asset sales for 2012.","In addition, we are planning $4 billion to $5 billion of asset sales in 2013. So, by year-end 2013, I believe we will have completed sufficient asset sales to have met our objectives and to have transformed Chesapeake by shifting our production mix to more profitable liquids, tightening the focus on areas where we have industry-leading scale and expertise, reducing our debt by 25%, reducing our total CapEx by $6 billion, slashing leasehold spending and at the same time increasing our returns, while continuing to generate production growth.","When we have completed our asset sales, we anticipate Chesapeake will still retain core positions in 10 plays, which we believe will be 10 of the 15 best plays in the country. In each of those 10 plays, Chesapeake will be either the number one or number two producer. We are not aware of another company that will be number one or number two in more than three of these 15 best plays.","It has certainly been a long and arduous journey during the past seven years to build an asset base of this uniquely high quality. But it was a very important and worthwhile endeavor to pursue at a pivotal time in the history of our industry. We have appreciated investor support and their capital during this time, which enabled us to complete this important phase in our company\u2019s history and position Chesapeake very favorably for the years ahead.","I\u2019d also like to express appreciation to my 13,000 Chesapeake colleagues, who have continued to work hard and meet all of the challenges over the past few months. Their talent and dedication will certainly be critical in helping Chesapeake reach its goals in the years ahead.","Finally, as you know, a lot has changed since our 2012 first quarter conference call three months ago. I would like to especially thank our new independent Board Chairman, Mr. Archie Dunham and our newly reconstituted Board of Directors for jumping right in to get up to speed about our strategy and operations. Their involvement should enable us to further sharpen our focus on driving higher returns from Chesapeake\u2019s assets while maintaining a strong balance sheet. without a doubt, these efforts should lead to improved operational and financial performance for years to come.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Nick.","Domenic J. Dell'Osso, Jr.","Thanks, Aubrey. ","It was a very good quarter operationally, and I\u2019m particularly pleased to highlight our strong production results. we produced 3.8 Bcfe per day, an overall sequential increase of 4%. but more importantly, we achieved a 15% sequential increase in liquids production. this quarter, we began reporting oil and NGL separately, now that our NGL production reserves have increased to a material level. I\u2019d like to highlight the liquids production volumes for the second quarter was about 62% oil and 38% NGLs, and also that our rate of growth in oil production has substantially outpaced our growth in NGL production over the past year.","We\u2019re also very pleased with the continued strength in our oil price realizations, which were 96% of NYMEX before the effects of hedging this quarter. These high realizations are a direct result of the hard work by our subsidiary, Oilfield Trucking Solutions in the Eagle Ford as well as enhanced pipeline connectivity out of the basin, both of which contribute greatly to robust overall pricing. Thanks to strong growth in the Eagle Ford, 45% of our companywide net oil production during the quarter is now sold at a Louisiana light sweet correlated price versus 0% in the year-ago quarter.","looking ahead to 2013, we are currently forecasting flat year-over-year oil differentials, but we do see potential for these to improve further. You will see in our results that like many of our peers, we reported challenging NGL price realizations. however, we believe these realizations are bottoming and expect them to improve moderately for a couple of reasons.","First, we currently sell 50% of our NGL to Conway. in 2013, we will access Mont Belvieu pricing for a portion of those volumes based on new pipelines and resulting basis compression. Second, industry wide rejection of ethane has kicked in which should begin to ease the ethane oversupply situation and prompt a modest increase in pricing.","Finally, more propane export capacity is being developed along the Gulf Coast and East Coast, which should begin to ease the supply overhang before year-end. Coupled with the traditional seasonal balance associated with the onset of colder weather, these factors should lead to better propane prices in the fourth quarter. So we expect one more quarter of very weak NGL realization and then some relief in the fourth quarter, both of which we have built into our guidance.","As a result of our strong production performance in Q2, we are increasing our production guidance for both 2012 and 2013 by approximately 110 Bcfe and 90 Bcfe in each year respectively. After adjusting for the changes in expected production decreases associated with asset sales, which are detailed in our outlook, and adjusting for reduced 2012 curtailments, our organic production guidance has been increased by approximately 75 Bcfe or 6% in 2012 and approximately 140 Bcfe or 10% in 2013.","On the CapEx front, we are increasing our 2012 drilling and completion CapEx guidance by about 6.5% to $8 billion to $8.5 billion. This is purely related to the high activity levels from year-end 2011 and the first half of 2012 that is still working through this system as we ramp down in most of our plays. However, as expected, we have seen our month-over-month spending begin to decline in both June and July as our rig count has dropped pretty dramatically, which Steve will detail for you shortly.","On the leasehold side, we are increasing our 2012 estimated spend to $2 billion, lowering our 2013 estimated spend to $400 million. Given that about $1.3 billion leasehold spend year-to-date, you can see that second half of 2012 spend is considerably less than the first half and the ramp down in activity is complete.","I might also add that approximately 50% of this leasehold spend was wrapping up our Utica leasehold acquisition efforts and the Mid-Continent contributed another 25% of the leasehold spend this year. Even more importantly, our 2013 drilling and completion CapEx has been reduced by $750 million to a range of $5.75 billion to $6.25 billion reflecting rig count reductions and efficiency gains from our core of the core strategy.","I\u2019m very pleased to point out that even with drilling CapEx about $2 billion lower in 2013 than in 2012, we are actually raising our 2013 production guidance by 7% due to strong performance in our liquids plays. Also very notable in our 2013 CapEx spending forecast is the significant decrease from our prior outlook of $1.275 billion as a result of the sale of our Midstream business. Total decrease in 2013 spending relative to our May 1 outlook is over $2.1 billion and again we\u2019ve been able to increase our production guidance despite the significant CapEx reduction.","Our adjusted EPS for the quarter of $0.06 per share was negatively impacted by approximately $0.06 per share due to the effect of higher DD&A related to price related revisions primarily from Barnett and Haynesville PUD eliminations. If gas prices follow the current NYMEX Strip, these reserves may be eligible to come back on our books in 2013 subject to our forecasted pace of drilling in those areas.","I\u2019d like to point out that we did not have a ceiling test write-down this quarter, as we have built a full cost pool cushion as a result of our low finding costs and profitable asset sales in recent years. As a full cost company, we are not able to recognize gains in our income statement when we sell E&P assets and are instead required to apply the asset sale proceeds and decrease of our full cost pool resulting in lower DD&A rates over time.","We do expect to have a ceiling test write-down in Q3 as we substitute three more months of low 2012 gas prices to the trailing 12 month SEC calculation. I\u2019d like to note however that as the 10 year average strip pricing our PV-10 is $5.2 billion higher than under the SEC methodology as shown on page five of our earnings release. You\u2019ll also see in our release that we\u2019ve added significant GAAP hedges for the second half of 2012, at an average price of $3.03 per Mmbtu. While we don\u2019t view the current natural gas price strip as long-term sustainable, we did see that there is an opportunity to take a significant amount of fall shoulder season risk off the table.","We remain quite bullish on gas prices in 2013 and beyond, and accordingly have begun to reduce some of our previously written half year natural gas call positions. We are making great progress on our asset sales and are looking forward to having more share of investors in the next month or so. We will use the proceeds from our Permian and midstream sales to retire $4 billion term loan put in place in May, and plan to apply the remaining proceeds from these sales and others to any outstanding balances on our $4 billion corporate revolver, which was 100% undrawn at June 30. We also have a very favorable call feature on the $1.3 billion notes we issued in February of this year, which allows us to call the notes at par between November 15 of this year and March 15 of 2013.","Our goal is to exit 2012 no more than $9.5 billion in long-term debt, which implies having nothing drawn under our $4 billion corporate revolving credit facility. Going into 2013, this revolver liquidity plus the discretionary liquidity associated with the $1.3 billion of callable notes, would give us $5.3 billion of available liquidity, irrespective of the amount of our 2013 assets sales. To be clear, we intend to complete our 2013 projected asset sales of $4.25 billion to $5 billion, and finish 2013 with no incremental net debt. However, we did not expect to be dependent on the 2013 asset sales program to meet our liquidity needs.","Lastly before turning to call over to Steve, I want to point out that few weeks ago, we posted an appendix to our investor presentation that included more detail on our VPP\u2019s midstream commitments and drilling and compression sale leasebacks. There isn\u2019t much written about these items in the past few months and we wanted to make sure that facts were disclosed and available for all to analyze. Please let us know if you have any questions regarding these new slides. Steve?","Steven C. Dixon","Thanks, Nick. I am very pleased and impressed with our operational performance, and I am very proud of the efforts and the results that our team at Chesapeake has been able to deliver for our shareholders this year. As Nick just outlined, our strong liquids production growth during the second quarter has prompted us to raise our forward liquids production guidance outlook for the remainder of 2012 and 2013, to an average of 135,000 barrels per day to 170,000 barrels per day respectively. These are increases of 12% and 9% respectively and are net of volumes associated with projected asset sales.","I\u2019d also like to point out that the majority of this growth will be in our oil production versus our NGL production. We mentioned in our last quarterly call that in response to low natural gas prices we would reduce drilling in our dry gas plays from 47 rigs at the beginning of 2012, to just 11 rigs by year-end. We have accomplished this goal and now plan to further reduce this amount to eight rigs at year-end.","At our high-water mark back in March 2010, we were drilling with 104 gas rigs. As you might imagine, this will have profound impact on our gas production. In 2013, we are now projecting a 7% decline in gas production.","Moving on to the cost side of our business, we are beginning to realize significant benefits from lower service costs and rising drilling efficiencies as we optimize our activity levels and move more fully into harvest mode. Consequently, we plan to drill the same number of net wells with fewer rigs operating and have accordingly reduced our projected yearend 2012 liquids rig count from 115 down to 93.","In the second half of 2012 and in 2013, we plan to spend approximately 85% of our drilling completion capital in oil and liquids plays.","I\u2019d also like to point out that I'm especially proud of our operating cost control efforts as we have ramped up our liquids production, but yet we still expect per unit production expenses to remain relatively flat at approximately $1 per Mcfe for 2013.","Moving on to specific plays, I\u2019d like to start with the Eagle Ford Shale. It's attracting 28% of our capital in 2012 and 33% in 2013. Second quarter net production from Eagle Ford was 36,300 boe per day, which is a 58% increase over the first quarter and 615% year-over-year.","During the quarter we connected 121 wells or nearly one-third of our 337 total producing wells in Eagle Ford. Importantly at June 30, we had 220 wells at various stages of completion and pipeline connection. This provides a foundation for strong liquids growth runway into the quarters ahead.","In addition to rapid growth and robust activity levels, the Eagle Ford is particularly exciting as we have experienced higher per well initial production rates, an oilier production mix and lower well cost. During the second quarter, 31% of the wells we placed on production had peak rates in excess of 1,000 boe per day. And furthermore 91% of our wells placed in production at peak rates in excess of 500 barrels per day and that\u2019s up from 81% in the year ago quarter.","Approximately 66% of our Eagle Ford production volumes during the quarter were oil as compared to 57% in the first quarter. This is an important increase given the much higher margins associated with oil production relative to gas and NGLs.","These metrics help demonstrate that Chesapeake\u2019s Eagle Ford acreage is located in the core of the very best oil acreage in the western portion of the play. With regard to cost control, our completed well cost in the Eagle Ford are tracking 15% lower than a year ago and we expect further reductions in the months ahead. This will enable us to target year end exit rate of only 25 rigs, down from 28 currently and from a peak of 35 rigs, three months ago.","Turning to the Anadarko Basin, we have 4 key plays that provide a very strong base for continued liquids growth production, the Miss Lime, the Granite Wash, the Cleveland and the Tonkawa. At June 30, we had 51 rigs running in these plays and combined second-quarter net production of 88,100 boe per day. Production mix in these four plays consist of 34% oil, 23% NGLs, and 43% gas.","Looking ahead to 2013, we anticipate these plays will comprise approximately, 19% of our total production and that oil will continue to rise as a percentage of the production strength.","As Nick mentioned in his remarks, we are working with others to jointly obtain infrastructure enhancements, such that our NGL production from these areas will access more favorable Mont Belvieu pricing.","Also in the Anadarko Basin, I would like to highlight our emerging Hogshooter Wash play, which could become a meaningful contributor to our oil volumes over the next few years.","Our Thurman Horn 406H well which we first announced on June 1 has produced nearly 330,000 boe in its first 60 days on production, almost 80% which is oil. We are pleased to report this well has already generated over $16 million of gross revenue that paid out in one month. We believe this has been the best onshore well in America in the past two months and may continue to grow even though as production starts to decline from extraordinary levels in the past few months.","And off-set well, the Thurman Horn 4010H is now drilling ahead and will provide valuable information from this immediate area and its ultimate recoverability. Just recall, it\u2019s approximately 30,000 acres perspective in the Hogshooter Wash and has identified 60 potential drilling locations. 11 wells are scheduled to spud in the play before the end of '12, so stay tuned for more updates. In addition we believe the liquids rich Missouri Wash, will also emerge as a key play for us down in the Texas Panhandle later this year and 2013.","In the Powder River Niobrara play we\u2019ve finally cracked the code with numerous recent wells drilled in our newly identified over pressured liquids rich core area of 100,000 net acres, delivering outstanding flow rates of more than 1,500 boe per day. However due to limited gas takeaway infrastructure and processing facilities, production growth in the Powder River Basin has not yet begun in earnest, but we expect to see this area take off in 2013 and beyond as we\u2019ve identified over 1,000 potential locations in the Niobrara core.","In addition, we believe a significant portion of our overall 350,000 net acres of Powder River lease hold will be prospective for other formations such as the Teapot, Parkman, Sussex, Shannon and Frontier formations. We\u2019ve eight operated rigs currently running and plan to ramp this up to 11 by year-end. I might add that CNOOC is paying for 67% of our drilling costs in the Powder River Basin and we project that that will remain to the end of 2014, as we earn our remaining drilling carried, which was approximately 520 million as of June 30.","I\u2019ll now turn to the Utica Shale in Ohio, where we are the leading leasehold owner, driller and producer with 12 operated rigs currently working to evaluate our 1 million plus net acres. We continue to delineate the wet gas window as well as HBP some acreage in the highly productive dry gas window towards the east. The Utica oil window is being tested by Chesapeake on both an operated and non-operated basis as well as by other industry competitors that are beginning to report results. Well completions are progressing at a quickening pace in the Utica as much needed midstream infrastructure begins to come into service. We\u2019ve recently submitted the number of new wells to the Ohio DNR which will soon be posted on their website. We remain very pleased with our results to date in the Utica.","To conclude my remarks, I hope our report today makes it abundantly clear that we believe liquids rich plays are working exceptionally well and we expect drilling and completion cost to come down further or per well operating costs remain constant. The Eagle Ford is our most active play, continues to attract the largest amount of our capital, while our bread-and-butter liquids plays in the Anadarko Basin, the Miss Lime, Granite Wash, Cleveland and Tonkawa contribute to a steady upward trend.","In addition, the Niobrara in the Powder River Basin should become a significant contributor to our liquids growth and we are looking forward to strong contributions from the Utica in 2013 and beyond. and of course, we retain exceptional upside optionality and leverage to potential 2013 rebound in natural gas prices that Aubrey outlined in his opening remarks.","As Nick detailed in the outset, our corporate production guidance takes into account oil production losses from our expected 2012 and 2013 asset sales, and also reflects our substantially lower capital budget for 2013, which is predicated on the reduction in average rig count from a 131 down to just 100. despite these adjustments, our strong underlying property base and enviable leasehold position still enables us to project positive production growth for 2013.","Operator, we\u2019ll now take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And we\u2019ll go first to Brian Singer of Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Good morning.","Aubrey K. McClendon","Good morning, Brian.","Brian Singer \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Wonder if you could connect a few dots with regards to the production and asset sales guidance that you\u2019ve revised. It seems like you expect less proceeds from asset sales in aggregate in 2012 to 2013, a greater negative impact on ongoing production resulting from these asset sales. But as you highlighted both oil and gas production guidance was taken higher, in the interest of trying to determine how much of this change in guidance is driven by performance versus restructuring. can you just add a little bit of color on the moving pieces please?","Domenic J. Dell'Osso, Jr.","Hi, Brian. When you talked about less asset sales proceeds, I think what you are really pointing to is that we took VPP off a while ago. The increase in production relative to performance and unrelated to asset sales is about 140 Bcfe in 2013. Does that answer your question?","Brian Singer \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Yeah. And I guess can you break, since both oil and gas was impacted, can you break that down or I know you highlighted Eagle Ford in Steve comments, but are there major drivers on the oil side versus the gas side?","Domenic J. Dell'Osso, Jr.","There are, and so it\u2019s approximately 50-50 of that would be gas versus liquids and then the oil and NGL split would be as related to our base production, so a little better than 60-40 to the oil.","Brian Singer \u2013 Goldman Sachs","","Okay. And then, you highlighted your Eagle Ford backlog, you\u2019ve got a big backlog in the Marcellus, what are your expectations for how this backlog will change and what\u2019s baked into that guidance for 2013?","Steven C. Dixon","Brian, this is Steve. We are working part of that off and part of that was our overspend on capital running quite a few frac crews in the Eagle Ford to catch that up as well as Marcellus.","Brian Singer \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Got it. I\u2019m sorry, so do you expect that backlog to be eliminated by the end of next year or is that what\u2019s baked in?","Domenic J. Dell'Osso, Jr.","A big portion of our Eagle Ford backlog is normal course.","Brian Singer \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay.","Domenic J. Dell'Osso, Jr.","So we don\u2019t expect it to be eliminated. And the Marcellus backlog will stay with us for some time, as we are doing some appropriate backlog reduction there but we are not exactly raising.","Brian Singer \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Thanks. And if I could ask one more, you highlighted in the release an expectation for may be a greater strategic update with the third quarter results, can you just talk to whether you think that will be dramatically different versus this latest change in 2013?","Aubrey K. McClendon","I do not expect it to be dramatically different, no.","Brian Singer \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Thank you","Aubrey K. McClendon","Okay. Thank you, Brian.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Dave Kistler of Simmons & Company.","David Kistler \u2013 Simmons & Company International","Good morning guys.","Aubrey K. McClendon","","Hi, Dave.","David Kistler \u2013 Simmons & Company International","","Just following up on Brian\u2019s real quick, can you break out just specifically the Eagle Ford, VPP and the implications that had on production guidance for 2012 and for 2013.","Domenic J. Dell'Osso, Jr.","Well, the VPP in and of itself was projected into our 2012 and 2013 production guidance. When we pulled it out, we had a reduction or an add back of about 30 Bcfe in 2012. And again about 50% of that is \u2013 sorry, I misspoke really when I gave the number to Brian \u2013 about 50% of that is oil, 25% NGL, and 25% gas of the Eagle Ford. Of what we are adding back in the 140 Bcfe to 2013 that is performance related, that's about 50-50.","David Kistler \u2013 Simmons & Company International","Okay, that's helpful. I appreciate that and\u2026","Domenic J. Dell'Osso, Jr.","In 2013, the VPP impact was about 35 Bcfe.","David Kistler \u2013 Simmons & Company International","Okay, great. I appreciate that and then, are we to come to the assumption though that VPP for the Eagle Ford is completely off the table or is that something that comes back on the table as perhaps crude prices get a little bit better, NGL prices get a little bit better, any color on that would be helpful as we think about divestiture plans into 2013.","Domenic J. Dell'Osso, Jr.","For now, it's off the table.","David Kistler \u2013 Simmons & Company International","Okay, appreciate that. And then one last one just on the Niobrara as you guys talked about cracking the code there, can you talk a little bit about what's your thinking? The initial rates of return on those wells look like and maybe anything around well cost, well design et cetera.","Steven C. Dixon","Yeah, Dave, this is Steve. It\u2019s still pretty early there. I think we have improvements that we want to make on our well cost, but we\u2019ve certainly found a sweet spot with this over pressured high in liquids basin center that we\u2019re really hoping to get some production history and improve on.","David Kistler \u2013 Simmons & Company International","Okay, so to be determined over time is the best way to think of it?","Steven C. Dixon","It\u2019s still early. We\u2019ve got some, I think some big improvements to make on the cost side. We\u2019ve been still doing a lot of science in defining this sweet spot.","Aubrey K. McClendon","David, I\u2019d just say that, anytime when we\u2019re in a liquids play, the goal is to have greater than 50% rate of returns. So if we\u2019re for some reason not there yet on these production rates we intend to get our cost to that point. So these are big wells and they can come in at 1,000, 1,500 boe per day. We\u2019ve got some gas production takeaway issues that are going to take a little bit of time to resolve, we probably have some flaring issues associated with that, but we really like where we are and of course we\u2019ve got CNOOC paying most of the cost there. So if you take into consideration the carry, our returns from the Niobrara basically- well, through the stratosphere when you\u2019re only paying for a quarter of your cost.","David Kistler \u2013 Simmons & Company International","Great, I appreciate the added color there. Thanks guys.","Aubrey K. McClendon","David, thank you.","Operator","","We will go next to Doug Leggate of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\t","","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you, good morning everybody. I am going to try just a few quick ones, if I may. I don\u2019t know how much you can share about the assets sales at Aubrey, but obviously you talked about 1.5 million acres in the Permian and you\u2019ve give a range of values around that. It looks like you\u2019ve spilt into more than three packages. Could you give any colors to, order of magnitude, what\u2019s still left on the table and I guess level of confidence that these are going to get done in the third quarter? I\u2019ve got a few follow-ups, please.","Aubrey K. McClendon","","Okay, sure. Doug, when we started out, we operated in both one entire package, but also in the data room there were three packages, there was the Midland Basin package, which was the smallest and then there was the New Mexico Delaware Basin, and the Texas Delaware Basin. So we\u2019ve mentioned, we've signed a purchase and sale agreement with EnerVest, we\u2019ve mentioned that we have two acceptable bids on the other packages, and we are negotiating purchase and sale agreements there. So we would have loved to have been able to have all three come across the finish line by the end of the quarter, but just weren\u2019t able to get there, but as Nick mentioned in his remarks, we expect to get those completed in the next 30 days or so.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So Aubrey you are very clear in the release that you sold the producing assets in the Midland, does that mean that there are still bunch of acreage, undeveloped acreage, still on the table?","Aubrey K. McClendon","Yeah, sure, Doug. we will have our remaining acreage in the Midland Basin to either develop ourselves or more likely to go through another process and look for a home for it, there are lots of different ideas there, private equity ideas, there are other producers who were maybe intimidated by the size of the package and now when you take the production out of it, I think we'll get some more kind of growth to the drill bit companies to come back and take a look at the acreage. So we\u2019ve got a lot of options there, and it\u2019s just kind of emerged in the last few weeks that we\u2019ll go through frankly a fourth process to finish up basinal exit from the Midland side of the Permian.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, I don\u2019t suppose you\u2019d care to comment on the $4 billion to $6 billion original range you gave relative to your, what you think you're going to realize?","Aubrey K. McClendon","Doug, no, we will continue to just let the process play out and as we have final numbers we will certainly share them with everybody.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. My only other one is really on the activity levels particularly in the Mississippi Lime. I guess similar kind of issue on the joint venture there, any update you can share there. But it also looks like you\u2019ve lowered the rig count from the original planned to 18 versus I think it was 22 originally, so is it just better well results and if so are you prepared to take the type curve up. And just a general update on the Miss would be appreciated and I\u2019ll leave it there. Thanks.","Aubrey K. McClendon","Okay, couple of things there. First of all, we have reduced the rig count in the Miss Lime but we haven\u2019t done so in all of our plays. That\u2019s just basically the scale down of our enterprise from \u2013 at the start of the year we were planning to run 200 rigs in 2013 and now we are planning to run 100. So we certainly needed to scale down.","In addition in the Miss Lime, we have decided to pursue [less just] (ph) pure HBP drilling and go into some core and some infill drilling there to help our returns and also to not get too far ahead of our infrastructure. You can spend a lot of money on infrastructure across a big area there.","With regard to EURs, last time I checked we haven\u2019t taken them up although I noticed in what we call JV 1 area I think we are pushing 600,000 boe on the numbers that I saw, but I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve taken our pro forma up across the whole area. ","Let\u2019s see JV is still continuing our discussions, there is obviously private equity interest there, there is international interest. And we\u2019ve also been approached for 100% exit some parts of the Mississippi as well.","So we will have lots of options there during the couple of months as we sort out what we want to do in that area. But we\u2019re certainly pleased with our results and obviously watching EURs creep up from other players in the area as well.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks, Aubrey.","Aubrey K. McClendon","Okay. Doug, thank you.","Operator","We will go next to David Tameron of Wells Fargo.","David Tameron \u2013 Wells Fargo","Hi, good morning. Asset sales, let\u2019s go back to that. 2013 or two questions, one, the third quarter, does that include any assumptions for Mississippi Lime JV or is that pushed off for the time being?","Aubrey K. McClendon","I don\u2019t believe that\u2019s in our third quarter. That\u2019s more of a fourth quarter expectation.","David Tameron \u2013 Wells Fargo","Okay. So then if I think about 2013, what packages, I mean what - the numbers you threw out for your asset sale target, what do you have, what would that be? Would that be \u2013 obviously, Chaparral is still out there, some of the services business, but can you talk about big picture, what would be included in that package?","Aubrey K. McClendon","First of all, it\u2019s a much smaller number than we\u2019ve been looking at this year. So you are right that Chaparral is out there, we\u2019ve announced that we intend to sell a non-core asset like that, we\u2019ve mentioned that we\u2019d like to exit our investment in Frac Tech or FTS International at some point at well, and then we have our service company IPO that we have put-off to 2013. Beyond that I\u2019m not going to say, but we have plenty of other bits and pieces of assets that we have that we\u2019ll be shaving off to reach the goal of $4 billion or $5 billion in 2013.","I would like to emphasize as Nick mentioned that from a liquidity perspective, we don\u2019t have to sell anything next year, but we certainly want to be able to continue to keep an undrawn revolver and associated with keeping our debt at the $9.5 billion level.","David Tameron \u2013 Wells Fargo","Okay. And then one more question, if I just look at what you did on the hedging side, it looks like you are kind of implying the 3, somewhere in the 3 to 3.25 is kind of where you think gas topped out at least for the remainder of this year. can you talk about, is that the right read on what you did based on your hedging and if so can you talk about your projections for the second half of the year, where you guys think gas\u2026?","Aubrey K. McClendon","Sure. Yeah obviously, we had a nice run from the lows of late April to the above the $3 level. And I think we just wanted to be careful and conservative about our budget in the second half of the year, knowing that even with hot weather, we were going to be working off a lot of storage overhang, but there were obviously potential issues in September and October if storage got full, it looks like we\u2019re probably going to avoid the storage box now. So we\u2019re not intending to hedge anything at this point for 2013. At today\u2019s levels, we don\u2019t think there\u2019s any chance that you have a 2013 strip that stays where it is today, if you have a complete reversal of the 900 Bcf overhanging it\u2019s had in April of 2012, if you get the 900 Bcf storage deficits in April of 2013. But clearly you\u2019re going to have to have higher prices in the $3 in 2013 to incentivize producers to come back. So for us, it\u2019s got to be a pretty healthy price to pry our rigs away from our liquids production, our liquids focused areas. Steve, remind me, in 2013, how many rigs did we have allocated for dry gas?","Steven C. Dixon","Looks like eight.","Aubrey K. McClendon","So I think yeah, eight rigs out of the 100 in 2013 for dry gas. So this has been a four-year down cycle, and a lot of headwinds in the last four years. but we think a multiyear up-cycle is now underway, and frankly, all the die has been cast, Chesapeake\u2019s is on the table, have been played and now it\u2019s just a matter of physics and time for them to play out.","David Tameron \u2013 Wells Fargo","And just following up on those comments, do you have any feel for and I realize it\u2019s play specific, but do you have any feel for where gas would have to get back to before you start to allocate away from liquids into - back to gas?","Aubrey K. McClendon","No, we\u2019re not going to give out those kind of numbers, it\u2019s different from play to play. But it\u2019s a number, and I think the industry has said that the number is probably a north of $5 before gas plays generate the same kind of returns, which you can get from oil around $90. The Marcellus may be a little bit lower than that, but gas prices have a way to go to catch up to levels that equal the returns we get from our liquids-focused plays. And we\u2019ll just wait for it to play out, and we\u2019ve got enormous backlog of gas drilling opportunities, and we\u2019ll take advantage of those when the gas market pays us to do so.","David Tameron \u2013 Wells Fargo","All right, thanks for the color.","Aubrey K. McClendon","Okay, David, thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Biju Perincheril of Jefferies.","Biju Perincheril \u2013 Jefferies","Hi, good morning. A couple of questions, first in the Utica, in the oil window can you give us some color, how many wells you have now completed? And Aubrey, in the past you\u2019ve said, Utica, it\u2019s at least it\u2019s as good as the Eagle Ford. Can you make that statement about if you\u2019re only looking at the oil window of the two plays?","Aubrey K. McClendon","I don\u2019t think I would make that statement comparing the oil plays, it\u2019s just way too early on the Utica side, and we\u2019ve not focused much of our efforts in that area, most of our acreage is in the wet gas and the dry gas side. So, we\u2019re basically allowing other companies to work on the oil side; we\u2019ve got plenty of acreage over there. But right now we love what we see on the wet gas side and frankly the dry gas side is just as good as the Marcellus. So we\u2019re only drilling there, though where we kind of have to for acreage exploration issues. So we think when it's all said and done, the wet gas in the Utica, and the wet gas in the Eagle Ford are likely to be competitive. But I'm not willing to compare oil and oil yet because I just don't have enough information out of Utica. It goes without saying that we love what we\u2019re doing on the oil side in the Eagle Ford.","Biju Perincheril \u2013 Jefferies","Got it. And the Eagle Ford, you\u2019ve mentioned, I think 15% decline in cost, can you say what costs are running currently?","Domenic J. Dell'Osso, Jr.","Little over $7 million, right around $7 million per well.","Aubrey K. McClendon","Biju, did you hear that $7 million?","Biju Perincheril \u2013 Jefferies","Yeah.","","Aubrey K. McClendon","Okay.","Biju Perincheril \u2013 Jefferies","Yeah, that's all I have for now. Thanks.","Aubrey K. McClendon","That's great, thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Charles Meade of Johnson Rice","Charles Meade \u2013 Johnson Rice","Good morning gentlemen. Couple of questions, if I could go back to that divestiture question for 3Q, you guys put in your headline for that section in the press release, a target of $7 billion. Am I right in that the two biggest pieces of that are number one, the Midstream, the remaining $2 billion Midstream sale to GIP and then the Permian sale, I guess the question really is, is there another big piece that\u2019s going add up to that $7 billion?","Aubrey K. McClendon","","Just to clarify, Charles, the $2 billion sale to GIP, that actually occurred in the second quarter, so it's done. What is projected in the third quarter is the remaining part of our midstream business, which is housed in an entity called CMD, that's our 100% owned Midstream. What got sold in the second quarter was CHKM now remain a CMP I think, access. So those are the two headline events in the third quarter and of course we will have some miscellaneous assets to sell off.","Charles Meade \u2013 Johnson Rice","Okay. Great, and then going back to the Utica, could you tell us what the lateral links were for those 28 wells that you highlighted in your focus area?","Aubrey K. McClendon","I don\u2019t know if we\u2019ve got it exactly but we can go ahead and tell him, what on average we do there.","Steven C. Dixon","Little over 5,000.","Charles Meade \u2013 Johnson Rice","Got it. And the TVD I know it kind of \u2013 it goes down as you descend into that gas window. But in general what\u2019s the kind of that TVD range for the wet gas down to now?","Steven C. Dixon","6,500 to 7,000.","Charles Meade \u2013 Johnson Rice","Got it.","Aubrey K. McClendon","One of the attractive parts of that of course is we are now seeing wells get down to TD in 15 to 18 days something like that, so one could all the way drill the horizontal out. So as we really move into manufacturing mode there one of the advantages that the Utica will have over the Eagle Ford and some other plays will be that it\u2019s a shallower and a bit cheaper.","Charles Meade \u2013 Johnson Rice","Well, and that\u2019s exactly, you knew exactly what I was trying get to \u2013 are you prepared or do you have anything you\u2019d share for what you think a development mode will cost you there?","Aubrey K. McClendon","That Steve can make a core estimate.","Steven C. Dixon","[It\u2019s more like] (ph) down to about 6.","Charles Meade \u2013 Johnson Rice","Got it, got it. And then one other question for you Aubrey, is there anything that you can share about what the focus of some of the new Board members has been or what area is their attention has been drawn to or what questions that are top of mind for them?","Aubrey K. McClendon","","Sure. We\u2019ve only had one meeting to date. We just finished it last week. So it was a \u2013 we decided to have a mid-cycle meeting to get everybody acquainted with each other and they are looking at the things that you\u2019d expect them to look at, the big topics for us, which are asset sales and CapEx, and efficiency of our operations. So that\u2019s where the needle get\u2019s moved and that\u2019s obviously where their level of interest is.","Charles Meade \u2013 Johnson Rice","Great, thank you very much guys.","Aubrey K. McClendon","Okay, Charles, thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Neal Dingmann of SunTrust.","Neal Dingmann \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","So a quick follow-up Aubrey, just on the Utica, maybe for you or Steve, just wondering on those wells now, are you still I guess in that kind of wet window that you're drilling in letting most of those wells still rest after you complete those or what are you doing on that front?","Aubrey K. McClendon","Yes, sir, we are - most to these will come on - have been waiting on pipeline really for the most part, but yes, there have been having some set time.","Neal Dingmann \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","So you still believe, I mean \u2013 and is that kind of really going on - on a go forward basis, Steve you\u2019ll continue to do that even if you have the takeaway you\u2019ll continue to do that to a degree?","Steven C. Dixon","Neal, it ranges from dry towards liquids in the heavier oil and liquids, we think more benefit from it. So it will be a variable.","Neal Dingmann \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Got it, got it. And then just wondering on the Marcellus, you mentioned about the gas rigs you are going to let go. I think in the press release, so you talked about in the Marcellus having at least still six rigs going for dry gas, the reminder of \u201812. So would you let some of those go after \u201812, is that what that is implying or what will you do in that dry gas Marcellus window?","Steven C. Dixon","","Yes, we think we can get down to four rigs there and hold our key acreage.","Neal Dingmann \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay, okay. And then just lastly, you just had a small increase, I noticed on the acquisition of unproved properties. Just wondering is that just bolt-ons or what was just the small add-in guidance on that part?","Aubrey K. McClendon","Yes, it's basically just accounting for the fact that we had to clean up a number of transactions in the Utica. I think Nick may have mentioned that about half of our leasehold spend for the 2012 is targeted for the Utica, I think another 25% for the Anadarko Basin including the Miss Lime and 25% spread everywhere else. so it\u2019s dropping very dramatically. in fact, I think our first quarter\u2019s leasehold spend was about $955 million, and dropped to $375 million or so in the second quarter, and we\u2019ll continue to drop off quite remarkably dramatically rather, which I guess will be remarkable. But we\u2019re targeting for 2013 a $100 million a quarter. and we think that maintenance mode will be even lower than that. I\u2019d love to say, we could get to a lower number than that in 2013, we\u2019ll certainly try to, but there\u2019s still a lot of little holes out there, particularly in the Utica and often in the Marcellus as well, and it jeopardizes a much bigger investment when you fail to go out and kind of complete your unit. but in the Eagle Ford and most of our other plays really down to almost zero in terms of additional leasehold buys.","Neal Dingmann \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay, thanks guys. Solid quarter, and great progress.","Aubrey K. McClendon","Okay, great, thank you Neal, I appreciate the support.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Bob Morris with Citi.","Robert S. Morris \u2013 Citigroup","Good morning. Steve, a question on the rigs, you\u2019re going to drop down to 100 rigs at year-end and that\u2019s what you\u2019re planning to hold that for next year. as I recall, 100 rigs is what Chesapeake own [at Ryder] (ph) under sale leaseback. So at that point, do you expect you\u2019d just be running your own rigs and to drop out third-party leased rigs then by year-end?","Steven C. Dixon","We\u2019ll still have some third-party rigs. and so we\u2019ll have to stack some of our older mechanical rigs.","Robert S. Morris \u2013 Citigroup","Has Nomac tried to lease some of your rigs to third parties at this point or do you think you might be able to do that in the future?","Steven C. Dixon","Yes, sir. We have, I think 10 or 12 lease to others right now.","Robert S. Morris \u2013 Citigroup","Okay, all right. Thank you.","Aubrey K. McClendon","Bob, thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Jason Gilbert of Goldman Sachs.","Jason Gilbert \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Hey, good morning, guys. Most of mine have been asked already. I was wondering, I think you had mentioned in the past your desire to do a couple more JVs in the Utica, just wanted to hear what your latest thinking was there?","","Aubrey K. McClendon","Certainly, Jason, we\u2019ll do at least one in the dry gas part of the play, and we\u2019ll wait till 2013 though to do that when we\u2019ve got better gas prices. So that is certainly one of the assets sales that we have in mind for 2013.","On the oil side, it just remains to be seen, if the results allow us to do that and we also have a couple of other JV ideas out there. So we think the JV market is still strong, and it's been supplemented by the interest of private equity players during the past year or so. It\u2019s probably been the biggest change in the market out there in the past year, which is the arrival of frankly several tens of billions of dollars of assets that private equity players have brought to the table."," ","Jason Gilbert \u2013 Goldman Sachs","","Thanks. And then my second one was, on the spending guidance increase you mentioned in the comments that were just spillover from late '11 and early '12? ","Just sounds like inertia, really. But if I remember correctly, you had reiterated your guidance as recently as July in the investor presentation, which maybe suggests to me that you don't always have a lot of visibility with this. And I was just wondering if you can say with confidence that these spillover costs are now behind you and that we\u2019re over the hump on the CapEx increases.","Aubrey K. McClendon","","We really think they are, and in terms of affirmation in July, I don\u2019t remember that so much other than we only change our guidance once a quarter. So in July it would have been what we put out in April, and so we kind of just live with it till we have a earning into the quarter earnings release like we have now. So this is obviously something that we scrub very hard, we\u2019re not happy about the increase, and really determined that with our new numbers that they are numbers that we can not only meet but to live with them.","Jason Gilbert \u2013 Goldman Sachs","","Great, thanks. I\u2019ll turn it back.","Operator","","And we\u2019ll go next to Scott Hanold of RBC Capital Markets.","","Scott Hanold \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","","Good morning.","Douglas J. Jacobson","","Hi, Scott.","Scott Hanold \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","","So on the 100 rigs you\u2019re going to be running in 2013, how many of those do you think are going to be HBP versus drilling for economics?","Aubrey K. McClendon","","First of all, I\u2019d say that even if it\u2019s drilling to HBP acreage, I mean it will be an economic activity, but I think I understand your question, certainly well that \u2013 is the second or third well in the unit and is likely to be better than the first well. So, Steve do you have an estimate of that or not?","Steven C. Dixon","","Fairly small percentage, we are focusing in the core, like you said HBP-ing within the core, but not necessarily multiple wells within the unit.","Scott Hanold \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","","So as most of your, I guess \u2013 if you look at your leasehold, how much do you think with the reduced rig count is, I guess the term would be at-risk for exploration or is some of the stuff that could expire in that stuff that could be potentially up for an asset sale and\/or you may not want it anyway?","Aubrey K. McClendon","","I think that\u2019s really the right way to think about it. Scott, one of things we\u2019re doing is not only selling assets that are not core, but also looking at our 10 core areas, and determining what we just don\u2019t have the capital to get to, and what we don\u2019t have the time to get to.","So I think you will see us sell some of our leasehold in plays that are absolutely core to us, and over the next six months or so as we recognize that, we have acreage that may fit other companies better or we have acreage that would expire unless we went and drilled it.","So as we pull in our horns and focus and concentrate our drilling in areas that are going to generate the highest returns, it\u2019s a very different strategy than what we viewed for last few years, which is to lock down this asset base that we\u2019ve taken from being a temporary asset base subject to exploration to a permanent asset base.","And so for example nobody today thinks a whole lot about value from the Haynesville but we\u2019ve had something like 7,000 wells to drill in the Haynesville that are HBP, so that are future drilling opportunities on acreage that\u2019s been HBP. So that\u2019s - I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fully baked in our forecast going forward, the increases in efficiency that are going to be generated, and certainly the increases and returns on investment as we continually move towards a program of drilling wells that will be on acreage that\u2019s already HBP rather than on acreages that\u2019s just sitting out there to be drilled at some point.","So stay tuned for other areas or parts of our core areas that we might be willing to let the rest of the industry take a look at rather than spend our own capital chasing those opportunities to HBP further acreage.","Scott Hanold \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay, I appreciate that. And one follow-up, just so I understand that\u2019s right. So when you look at your drilling CapEx in 2013 being down $750 million, I mean when I look at that, how much is related to just better drilling efficiencies, versus a planned further reduction to rig count versus I guess changes in planned asset sales or divestitures?","","Aubrey K. McClendon","And there is certainly some associated with efficiency and hopefully some cost savings as well as obviously the price of fracs have come down in other parts of the drilling and completion operation, but mostly it just drop of rigs as we move down to 100 rigs for 2013.","Scott Hanold \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay, so most of the stuff you directly could control in theory?","Aubrey K. McClendon","We\u2019re not saying that we\u2019re going to assume there is a 15% efficiency factor and that allows us to drop our CapEx by 15% or something like that; it\u2019s really related to rigs and if we\u2019re able to drive efficiencies higher, if we are able to drive cost lower than that hopefully will be icing on the cake for us.","Scott Hanold \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Thanks guys.","Aubrey K. McClendon","Thank you. Scott, one other thing I might \u2013 mentioned, as you lower your cycle time, you can drill more wells, with the lower number of rigs, so for example in the Eagle Ford as we drop I think, Steve, we\u2019re scheduled for 25 in 2013. Is that right?","Steven C. Dixon","No.","Aubrey K. McClendon","22, sorry.","Steven C. Dixon","22, and we are already seeing lots of wells in the teens and so I hope that that can go down even more, 22 rigs (inaudible).","Aubrey K. McClendon","22 rigs. [Ultimate] (ph) number of rigs [rather than] (ph) days, so the point is that as our efficiencies get higher, we can reduce the number of rigs and our CapEx may not go down, but your return on that investment will go up as you get more wells drilled with the same number of inputs.","Scott Hanold \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Got it, thanks, guys.","Aubrey K. McClendon","Okay, thank you, Scott.","Operator","We will go next to Matt Portillo of Tudor, Pickering, Holt.","Matthew Portillo \u2013 Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Good morning, guys. Just a couple quick questions from me, just a quick follow-up on the Eagle Ford question. Could you give us an idea, I think in the second quarter you guys drilled around 121 wells in the Eagle Ford versus the first quarter of 62. What\u2019s the \u2013 I guess the expected run rate over the next few quarters in terms of completions in the Eagle Ford? And then I guess kind of once you get down to 22 rigs in 2013, what would be a normalized quarterly well count for you there?","Steven C. Dixon","Matt, this is Steve. It should be similar to this, low 30s per month [turn] (ph) in line base.","Aubrey K. McClendon","The way I\u2019d like to think about, Matt, during the last quarter we completed a Eagle Ford well every 18 hours and going forward, I think we can probably do better than that.","Matthew Portillo \u2013 Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Perfect. And then just in terms of the wells you put in the release, obviously a lot of detail on kind of the larger category of wells here, with I think peak IPs of around 500 barrels a day equivalent. Could you give us an idea of roughly what the 30 day rates look like there, and maybe just your new expectations around what the EUR would be?","Aubrey K. McClendon","I think Steve can help you with both of those. Matt, while he is looking do you have anything else?","Matthew Portillo \u2013 Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Yes, sure, just two final questions from me. On the CapEx side, just curious on 2013 if you were to, at high enough gas price, desire to flat line your gas production next year what sort of capital increase would we need to see on your development budget to get to that level of flat production?","Aubrey K. McClendon","That\u2019s a good question Matt. I don\u2019t have that right now, but we can certainly dial it up for you. Again, it would take quite a bit stronger price than what\u2019s in the forward curve right now for us to be interested in doing that, but clearly, we have the assets to do it now and have the capability to do it. ","And remember, this is a issue where I think a lot of investors and analysts perhaps think about it in the abstract or in a vacuum which is what\u2019s a gas price that gives you a reasonable rate of return on a well in the Marcellus or Haynesville or Barnett. and that\u2019s only part of the equation. The other part of the equation is capital is finite obviously. and so you have to not only generate an attractive return, but you have to generate return as competitive with your other returns.","So it\u2019s not do we make money at $4 gas or $5 gas, it\u2019s do we make as much money drilling the gas well at that price compared to what we make drilling an oil well at $90 a barrel. And so that\u2019s I think a part of the equation that\u2019s missing for most people\u2019s analysis of the gas market going forward. Steve, do you have anything to follow-up with on?","Steven C. Dixon","Yeah, I mean we actually break the Eagle Ford in multiple pro formas because we\u2019re wet gas, [oil and the shale oil] (ph) but the blend is about 9,000 barrels for first month.","Aubrey K. McClendon","Anything on NGLs or gas? we don\u2019t produce a whole lot of gas out there. I let him continue to look, and we can come back, and given that we\u2019re kind of over our hour I don't know how many folks are left to answer your questions, but we\u2019re - in courtesy to everybody, we\u2019re going to take two more questions and then if for some reason, you didn\u2019t get a question asked and answered, please dial it in to Jeff, John, or Gary and they\u2019ll get back to you. Operator, we\u2019ll take two more please.","Operator","Yes sir. We\u2019ll go next to Bob Brackett of Bernstein Research","Bob Brackett \u2013 Bernstein Research","I had a question on the Utica, two-part, one is that it looks like you had a well producing in the Tuscarawas County, which is pretty oily. any color on that would be appreciated. And also ignoring land retention, where would you put that last rig, in the Miss Lime or in the Utica?","Aubrey K. McClendon","That\u2019s tough man. First of all, good morning to you, let\u2019s see I would say right now, Carroll and Columbiana counties are tough to beat. On the Utica, Alfalfa and Woods are tough to beat in the Miss Lime. So I\u2019m not going to declare a winner between those two, but I would say that each of them has a little bit of HBP work to be done in those counties probably more to be done in Carroll and Columbiana, than in Alfalfa and Woods. But that\u2019s a \u2013 we will go back and play with that a little bit, but both of those are very, very attractive areas and hopefully we\u2019d end up being very competitive with any \u2013 for any incremental capital.","Bob Brackett \u2013 Bernstein Research","And that Tuscarawas county well.","Aubrey K. McClendon","Yeah, I\u2019m not \u2013 do you have a name for it?","Steven C. Dixon","Yeah, I\u2019ve got that, they came on about 227 barrels of oil a day and 1.3 million.","Aubrey K. McClendon","What\u2019s the name of the well?","Steven C. Dixon","Gribi.","Aubrey K. McClendon","Yeah.","Bob Brackett \u2013 Bernstein Research","Okay. And are you guys looking to get any new plays or is that pretty much done?","Aubrey K. McClendon","We\u2019re pretty much done. We have an acreage position in an area that we\u2019ve not talked about. Probably that I\u2019ve mentioned a little bit about a year ago. We still continue to poke around there. It\u2019s pretty cheap area there and we will get some wells drilled or tested in the next three to six months and see if it\u2019s something worthwhile or not. But we haven\u2019t spent much money there to-date and if it becomes a core area for us, great, if not, we will be happy with the 10 that we have.","Bob Brackett \u2013 Bernstein Research","Thank you.","Aubrey K. McClendon","Okay. Bob, thank you.","Operator","And we will take our final question from Joe Magner of Macquarie Capital.","Joseph Magner \u2013 Macquarie Capital Markets","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just any update on the divestiture efforts for the DJ and Utica properties that were announced over the last couple of months?","Aubrey K. McClendon","I don\u2019t think so, but those would both be pretty \u2013 well, DJ would be modest I think given our lack of success in that area and the industry hasn\u2019t done well outside of Wattenberg. So we\u2019ll get what we can there and move on.","Utica [French] (ph) process is underway. We\u2019ll have something to say there in the next couple of months as we definitely will have successful leasehold sales in that area. And the Utica is clearly an area of intense interest for the industry. Given our first mover status there, a lot of people who want to establish positions come to see us. So we look forward to sharing some good news there later.","Joseph Magner \u2013 Macquarie Capital Markets","Okay. And along the lines of Utica, can you update us just on takeaway capacity, what we might expect to see some of those \u2013 I guess, wells could turn to sales and production start to ramp up there?","Aubrey K. McClendon","Mostly in 2013, but Nick, if you want to address that or Steve, you want to address that, we\u2019ve got a big program there underway and kind of lost track with all the different entities involved but you want to try and put that up?","Domenic J. Dell'Osso, Jr.","","Well, I don\u2019t have any real specific dates other than there is one big infrastructure project underway and we\u2019re have it all mapped out and looking forward to bringing on more wells. We\u2019ve been trying to focus our drilling as close to existing pipelines as we can, and so we are doing our best to minimize it in the meantime, but there is lot of infrastructure added to the Utica.","Aubrey K. McClendon","Yeah, processing, there is going to be NGL takeaway adds in their projects, one that go to Philadelphia projects, one that go to Belvieu. So we are going to be a foundational shipper likely in any project that originates from the Utica. So there is going to be plenty of liquids there and we think plenty of opportunities to get the Belvieu pricing or Belvieu equivalent pricing over time.","Joseph Magner \u2013 Macquarie Capital Markets","","Okay. And just one last one. Nick, any anticipated amount for the ceiling test write down in the third quarter and could you provide us with what I guess where the cushion sits (inaudible)?","Domenic J. Dell'Osso, Jr.","No anticipated amount, there is too many in and outs between now and then to give a number even within a range. So I\u2019d like to hold off on doing that right now. And the cushion is pretty significant in my view, but I don't think we\u2019re prepared to disclose what that is today.","Joseph Magner \u2013 Macquarie Capital Markets","All right, that's all I have, thanks.","Aubrey K.

Hopefully, you've had a chance to review our press release and updated investor presentation that we have posted to our website.","During the course of this call, our commentary will include forward-looking statements regarding our beliefs, goals, expectations, forecasts, projections, and future performance and the assumptions underlying such statements. Please note that there are a number of factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from such forward-looking statements.","Additional information concerning these factors is available in our earnings release and the Company\u2019s SEC filings.

We are pleased with these results, which are a testament to the dedication and focus that has been demonstrated by the entire employee base during a period of transition.","Once I\u2019ve discussed our performance on this call, I will spend some time briefly outlining some fundamental tenets underlying our approach to achieving key financial and strategic priorities for Chesapeake, as well as some specific goals for us going forward, but first let\u2019s look at the quarter.","Chesapeake reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.51, which compares to $0.06 in the year ago quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $1.42 billion, up 26% sequentially and 77% year over year. Total production growth was also strong, up 2% sequentially and 7% year over year.","Oil production was the primary driver of our growth this quarter. It was up more than 35,000 barrels per day, or 44% year over year, to approximately 116,000 barrels per day. This growth was once again led by the Eagle Ford Shale play, where oil production grew 8,200 barrels per day sequentially and 32,700 barrels per day year over year to 57,000 barrels per day. I\u2019d also like to highlight that our percentage of production from liquids plays increased again this quarter to 25%, and also accounts for 60% of our realized oil and gas revenue. ","Given the better than expected results we are seeing primarily in the Eagle Ford, from both well performance and improved cycle times on both drilling and completions, we are raising the midpoint of our 2013 full year oil production guidance by 1 million barrels.","Importantly, during the second quarter, Chesapeake generated this strong production growth through greater capital discipline, resulting in significantly lower capital spending compared to last year. ","In the second quarter, we spent approximately $1.6 billion on drilling and completion activities, which was down approximately 35% year over year. Our total lease hold and other capital expenditures during the second quarter were $245 million, which was down approximately 75% versus the year ago quarter. As the result of substantial anticipated efficiency gains and continued focus, we see further opportunities to reduce capex going forward. ","On the expense side, we did a good job of reducing production expenses despite our increasing liquids mix. Per-unit production expenses were $0.78 per Mcfe, which was down 20% from the year ago quarter, driven by cost leadership from our field personnel and reduced saltwater disposal costs as infrastructure projects have been placed into service.","G&A was a similar story, as per-unit costs, excluding stock based compensation, were $0.25 per Mcfe, which was down 36% from the year ago quarter. ","From a balance sheet and liquidity perspective, I\u2019m pleased with the accomplishments of the company year to date. We ended the quarter $4.7 billion of liquidity and net long term debt was essentially flat compared to year-end 2012.","The company\u2019s financial position has strengthened considerably over the past 9 months, and as a result, we recently elected to terminate our bank covenant amendment early. In return, our maximum long term debt to EBITDA ratio limit is back to 4.0 times from the 4.5 times ratio that would have applied in the amendment for June 30, 2013. I would note that at June 30, our long term debt to EBITDA ratio had improved to approximately 3.0 times. ","During the first half of 2013, the company received proceeds of approximately $2.4 billion from asset sales. During the 2013 third quarter to date, the company has completed the sale of additional assets for total consideration of approximately $1 billion, including the sale of assets in the Haynesville Shale and Eagle Ford Shale, and we also anticipate to complete the sale today of certain midstream assets in the Mississippi Lime play, for a total consideration of approximately $300 million.","These asset sales, combined with forecasted net operating cash flow, enable Chesapeake to fully fund its 2013 capital expenditure budget. Additional asset sales are contemplated for later this year, which may be used to reduce long term debt and further enhance our financial liquidity.","Moving beyond the quarterly results, I\u2019d like to take a few minutes and highlight Chesapeake\u2019s key strategic priorities. In order to deliver near and long term returns, increase our competitiveness, and improve our relative stock price performance, our go-forward strategic priorities will consist of two fundamental tenets. The first is financial discipline, and the second is profitable and efficient growth from captured resources. I want to share with you exactly what these two strategic priorities mean. ","Regarding financial discipline, our capital expenditures will be balanced with our cash flow from operations. We\u2019re implementing a new competitive capital allocation process to ensure the highest quality projects are funded. We will continue to divest our noncore assets and noncore affiliates. We will reduce our financial and operational risk and complexity, and we will achieve investment-grade credit metrics.","Profitable and efficient growth from captured resources is a continuation of our focus on developing the highest-quality core of the core properties. Chesapeake has a world-class inventory with significant growth potential and multiple bases. This inventory will provide competitive production reserve growth for years to come. ","We will target top quartile operating and financial metrics and aggressively benchmark and post-appraise our performance. We will pursue continuous improvement in all aspects of our business and will drive value leakage out of our operations.","In my initial discussions with Archie Dunham, the company\u2019s board, and some of Chesapeake\u2019s largest shareholders, I had a great opportunity to see and understand their commitment and confidence in the company. This confidence is underpinned by the quality of the people and the quality of the assets at Chesapeake. Seeing that level of conviction and how they view the future of the company was very important to me. ","I chose to come to Chesapeake and lead a new strategic direction because of the abundance of opportunity and the strong foundation that has been built for future success. I believe I have picked the right company and I share the board\u2019s view regarding the quality of the people and the assets.","I\u2019ve been impressed by many aspects of Chesapeake. It\u2019s an organization that is very nimble for its size. It\u2019s good at adapting and making decisions, and it\u2019s especially good at responding with speed to clear directives and objectives. It is no accident that this company grew to be one of the largest domestic energy producers in a very short period of time.","There are also, however, many areas where I see opportunity and room for improvement, including capital efficiency, capital allocation, cost control, organizational process, and strategic focus. ","During the past six weeks, I\u2019ve launched a comprehensive review of our assets in the organization. As part of this review, I\u2019m working with the senior management team to determine our best path forward for driving meaningful shareholder value and realizing our full potential.","This path will be designed to execute a strategy of becoming a more focused and efficient E&P company, and it is critical, I repeat, that we balance our capital expenditures with our cash flow from operations. Chesapeake is at a key juncture in its history, and we have a laser focus on positioning the company to execute more competitively.","Going forward, we are targeting to deliver top-quartile performance in several key metrics, including absolute and per-[unintelligible] adjusted share reserve growth, production, and cash flow growth, returns on capital deployed, returns on equity, as well as lease operating, overhead, and drilling and completion costs. ","While I cannot give you an exact timeframe today for when we will achieve the top-quartile results in these metrics, we intend to get there as quick as possible and we will pursue it with a high sense of urgency.","In closing, I\u2019d like to thank the Chesapeake employees for their dedication and their hard work. Transition and change are not easy, and I know the collective effort of our employees focused on this new strategy will drive improved performance for our shareholders.","And with that, Steve, Nick, and I would be happy to take any of your questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions.] We\u2019ll take our first question from Dave Kistler with Simmons & Company.","Dave Kistler - Simmons & Company ","Real quickly, Doug, you\u2019d mentioned, I believe I heard this correctly, that on the financial discipline commitment, that it would be supported by trying to live within cash flow. Did I hear that correctly?","Doug Lawler ","Yes, you did.","Dave Kistler - Simmons & Company ","Okay, and so just thinking about that, obviously that rate count reduction that you guys put in place is driving down the [E&D] capex spending, production growth, higher and pretty impressive from that perspective. Can you share what that means for \u201914? I would just roughly guess that production would be coming down, i.e. bringing cash flows down a little bit. And then just trying to think for modeling, trying to tie capex to whatever we\u2019re projecting for cash flow as analysts.","Doug Lawler ","It\u2019s a good question. First, I\u2019d like to note that in 2013 we\u2019ve demonstrated the ability to grow production while reducing the capital. We\u2019re not at this point providing any guidance towards 2014, but what I would ask you to do is to look at the quality of the assets. As I highlighted, and the team\u2019s highlighted in the past, the core of the core has tremendous growth potential. ","And so if you look at our capital efficiency, how we can reduce our costs, as we\u2019re already seeing efficiencies result in more wells being drilled despite a lower rig count, living within our cash flow and targeting that financial discipline is a key priority to me and the team. And you know, we\u2019ll be providing information on 2014 later this year. ","Dave Kistler - Simmons & Company ","And then just thinking about the impressive production growth on the quarter, yet seeing a slight slippage in the initial production rates for the Eagle Ford, Utica, and Anadarko Basin, could you guys change maybe the well design, or are you more aggressively managing initial production rates to kind of manage declines? Just trying to think about what the impact of that is going forward.","Steve Dixon ","Really it\u2019s just that quarter\u2019s well set. We have not seen any back off in the performance of our wells in any of the areas. So I think that will just come and flow with the well set that\u2019s being turned online. In some areas, the older wells are just getting hooked up. So I think it\u2019s more of a function of the well set and not an overall decay in any of our areas.","Dave Kistler - Simmons & Company ","And one last one. Just looking at the transport costs, they look like they crept up a little bit for your forward guidance. Can you talk about what the main driver of that is?","Nick Dell\u2019Osso ","A couple of key drivers there. The biggest is the basis differential widening in the Marcellus. So I think you\u2019ve seen, with other producers in the market [unintelligible] well where there\u2019s a lot of infrastructure being constructed there this summer, and some things have been offline, and there\u2019s been some backup in the basin. So that\u2019s a big driver of it. We\u2019ve been pretty conservative in projecting that out through the rest of the year. And then in the Anadarko Basin, we\u2019ve seen some [basis] as well. On the oil side, I\u2019ll add that we\u2019ve also taken into account the consolidation of WTI and [LLS]. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs ","Just following up on the point on balancing capex and cash flow, I think you mentioned some of the metrics you expect to be in the top quartile on, and that you didn\u2019t really have a time period for when you\u2019d achieve that. But in terms of when you balance capex and cash flow is something that you can control. When do you see that happening? Is that something that you expect would be immediate? Is that something we should look for for 2014? And as maybe a follow up to the earlier question, are there one or two key levers you think you can pull to get the bulk of the way there from where Chesapeake\u2019s been historically?","Doug Lawler ","It is our target in 2014 to achieve that. So directionally, just so you know, we look at the different metrics and how we proceed forward. Establishing criteria and goals to achieve those top-quartile metrics to live within that cash flow is all targeted towards 2014 performance.","Just a few of the primary factors that will help contribute to that is that when you look at the company\u2019s history and how we have grown to this point in time, and basically all the production growth is taking place from single-well pads. ","And as we focus and concentrate on our capital efficiencies, synergies that can be achieved, learning from the land capture to the [held-by] production drilling program and concentrating on the best areas, those efficiencies and that production growth we believe will come from those primary areas that we\u2019ll be investing in. ","So part of that capital allocation process that I described and how projects compete will give us that ability to optimize our cash flow growth, our production growth, and with that target of being within the cash flow from operations.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs ","And then as a follow up, as we look at your plans to reduce rig count in some of these areas, and then given the efficiency points that you\u2019ve mentioned, should we expect that your well count will fall, rise, or stay flat in these areas? And I assume there\u2019s a big difference, but how are you thinking about core of core in the Eagle Ford and Marcellus and other areas versus the rest of your positions?","Doug Lawler ","That\u2019s a good question. I think what you\u2019ll see is that it should be relatively flat in balance, because of the efficiency we expect to achieve. Seeing reduced cycle times not only on the drilling side, on the completion side, also compressing with the more focused tension in the core areas that infrastructure costs and getting the overall cycle times reduced is a primary target of ours. So I believe that without giving guidance for 2014 yet, that it will be fairly balanced, and the way that we\u2019re going to get there is through efficiencies and the concentration in those core of core assets. ","Operator","Our next question comes from David Heikkinen with Heikkinen Energy Advisors. ","David Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors ","Just want to be clear that you\u2019re balancing cash flow and capex, versus cash flow from operations and your balance sheet improvement comes from non-core asset affiliate sales?","Doug Lawler ","That is what we\u2019re targeting, yes.","David Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors ","And can you talk about what you would consider noncore affiliates?","Doug Lawler ","Well, this is part of the process. We\u2019re in this comprehensive review. We\u2019re looking at all of the assets. We\u2019re looking at all of the affiliates that the company has ownership in, and determining what is the return that we\u2019re generating from those assets and affiliates and going forward, what is the best strategic positioning for us to be more competitive, should we be continuing to own and invest in. ","So at this point, I\u2019m not going to share with you on it, but that\u2019s something that we\u2019re really focused on, because if it\u2019s not adding value and not return-centric, that adds to our competitive position, we\u2019ll look to divest of it. ","David Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors ","And then to get into detail on defining top-quartile, who are the peers that you\u2019re going to be measuring yourself against?","Doug Lawler ","Well, I think it\u2019s the standard group that you\u2019d expect, that have similar footprints as Chesapeake. I can name them, but you know who they are. Basically we\u2019re looking at the strong competitors in North America and those that have achieved good performance, and we\u2019re going to be focused on elevating our performance to be more competitive.","David Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors ","And then just one very detailed question. Can you talk about back half of the year, your completion plans for third quarter in your 4PS at Eagle Ford, Utica, Anadarko, and Marcellus? We can get to drilling plans, but want to just get some details on completion plans and activity.","Steve Dixon ","It will be down slightly. We did quite a bit of catch up here in the first half of the year, and so our pace of bringing those on will be slow in the second half. And part of that will be a little less drilling activity, but most of it was kind of acceleration more in the first half, on catching up on excess inventory. ","David Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors ","Maybe another way to ask the question is, with your planned exit rate for activity level, what\u2019s the normal backlog of wells waiting on pipeline and completions, just to establish a baseline. Say, with a 10-rig program in the Eagle Ford you\u2019d normally have 120 wells, or whatever the number would be. That would be helpful. ","Steve Dixon ","You\u2019re right. You do have a working inventory that will always be there. So yeah, I think of it more as excess inventory and working inventory. We made big strides in reducing that excess here in the first half. And part of that is always moving with pipeline and compression and processing, also, by play to play. So we have rightsized the second half of the year to match up with infrastructure availability.","David Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors ","So no specific numbers?","Steve Dixon ","That\u2019s correct, David.","Operator","Our next question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch ","You mentioned in your prepared remarks about balancing cash flow, but you also mentioned about addressing the complexity of the organization. Can you elaborate on what you\u2019re talking about there? Because I\u2019m guessing you\u2019re relating to things like your [unintelligible] structure, the myriad of joint ventures that you have, and if you could just elaborate as to what you\u2019re really getting at there.","Doug Lawler ","I think you nailed it. Part of this procedure is looking at all the different affiliates, all the different structures that we have. Are they adding the proper returns to Chesapeake? Are they getting us competitive advantage? And without getting into exact detail on it, at this point in time, and really I can\u2019t because the process is underway, and we\u2019re evaluating it. ","But I think that as you know well, the company is involved in many different activities. Vertical integration has proven to be efficient and enable some very distinct competitive advantages for us in the past. And as we look at all the different affiliates, we want to make sure that we\u2019re getting the long term value creation and the focus we need to be as competitive as we can with our peers.","So I guess the best way to answer it is that it\u2019s a comprehensive review, and each of those will be evaluated.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch ","The joint ventures, I\u2019m guessing their kind of set in stone, and the [preference] shares similarly. I\u2019m just curious as to how would you, if you decided they weren\u2019t appropriate, what kind of steps would you envision taking to address those?","Doug Lawler ","Well, I think some of those JVs, some of those commitments, are we getting the best returns out of them? And looking for ways to improve, either with our capital program in those JVs, how we can demonstrate better performance. Or just simply looking at all the different options that exist. It\u2019s early in that process, and so I think it\u2019s important to note that you can expect that our goal - and I\u2019d ask you to look more at the goal - is to reduce the complexity and to provide better clarity on where we\u2019re getting our best returns from.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch ","Two quick followups if I may. One operationally: the Utica volume is still pretty low. Are you guys still thinking in the low 330s for an exit rate?","Steve Dixon ","Yes, as more processing and compression come online, we should be able to get to that.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch ","And finally on [unintelligible] cash flow, are you talking about drilling and completion costs matching operating cash flow? Or are you also including the other spending, unit lease hold and I guess the other oil service capex and so on? And just on that last one, if you could maybe talk to guidance on the 2014 non-E&P capex, that would be great.","Doug Lawler ","We are targeting the drilling and completion, and will be looking at the other capital expenditures as well as we follow up. So the focus is on all of our capital expenditures with specific focus in the near term on the drilling and completion. And it\u2019s just early for us to provide anything else on 2014.","Nick Dell\u2019Osso ","I\u2019d just add that on the other capex, remember that in the first half of this year we still had some midstream assets that we just completed the sale of today, that we were spending some money on, and we\u2019re taking delivery of some rigs [unintelligible] that have been ordered in some cases more than 12 months in advance. And so we do expect that that other capex line will be materially lower in 2014. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Hanold with RBC.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets ","Can you guys just answer one thing? I\u2019m looking at the piece where you\u2019re reducing complexity. You\u2019re looking at your assets, the various structures. What kind of timing do you have? Is this something that we should hear about in the coming quarter? By year end? Can you give us a flavor of when you\u2019re going to have that wrapped up, and the plan to go forward?","Doug Lawler ","I think it\u2019s going to be an ongoing process. As you know, some of those arrangements have fairly long terms and commitments associated with them. So I think what you\u2019ll see is that it\u2019s not necessarily a one day we\u2019re going to make an announcement on how we deal with it, but over time, improvements we\u2019ll be announcing and sharing that with you as we progress.","Nick Dell\u2019Osso ","I think that\u2019s exactly right. We have cash flow and liquidity freed up from the improved capital programs, improved cash flow from our business, as well as noncore asset sales. We\u2019re determining the best places to put that capital to work, and that\u2019s a process that will yield different results based on the opportunities that are in front of us at the time.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets ","So no specific time [unintelligible] progress on that. Is that right?","Nick Dell\u2019Osso ","You\u2019ll see continual progress over a period of time. There\u2019s no one day.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets ","And then relative to your current plan of reducing the rig count in the second half of the year, can you remind me what the plan had been in terms of rig count and well counts compared to what you\u2019d planned at this point?","Steve Dixon ","I\u2019m trying to think back to the first of the year. I\u2019m guessing it was around the low 80s, and now we\u2019re down to 64. So a pretty significant reduction. And as you can see from the cycle times that we released, significant improvements in our cycle times to be able to do that.","Doug Lawler ","From a well count perspective, it has not decreased nearly as much as the rig count, is the point there.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets ","And then one last question, in the Utica, can you give a sense of what you\u2019re seeing on the well performance in terms of the oil and gas splits out there? Has it trended a little bit more gassy relative to some of the initial expectations. I guess that\u2019s been our sense. Can you give us a little color and elaborate on that?","Steve Dixon ","I would say from when we entered the play it certainly had been gassier, but not quarter over quarter this year. The well set is performing well. We\u2019re very pleased with the results and anxious to get more of it on this year as we get compression and processing in place.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets ","Okay. And specifically what I was referring to is if you look in your little Utica write-up, it gives some of the gas production in Mcfe per day, where I think BOE per day was something you spoke [unintelligible] before. So I didn\u2019t know if that was sort of a signal we should think about.","Steve Dixon ","No, I don\u2019t think so. I think it\u2019s still early until we get a bigger well set on, which, again, is going to happen here in the second half of this year. So more to come.","Operator","Our next question comes from Arun Jayaram with Credit Suisse.","Arun Jayaram - Credit Suisse ","Doug, I just wanted to talk to you a little bit about, you\u2019re thinking about putting in a new blueprint for Chesapeake. You know, one of the recent challenges given the pullback in gas has been the balance sheet and the funding gap. The shares have done really well year to date. And I was just wondering what your thoughts would be on doing potentially a significant equity raise so you can get away from needing to do the asset sales and things like that and perhaps give you some flexibility as you look towards a newer strategy. Thoughts on that, Doug?","Doug Lawler ","Those options are out there, and could always be a possibility that we would consider. I will tell you, though, that the focus right now is on being the most efficient with our capital as we possibly can, and targeting that capital toward the very best projects that we have, which, compared to our peers and compared to some other operators, we just have some outstanding assets. ","And so prior to looking to do something like that, we need to really focus on our operations and focus very, very intently on how we can improve our capital efficiency. And right now we\u2019re just basically going to be looking at asset sales to get the portfolio right. And the focus with the capital and the asset sales is not to solve for a funding gap, it\u2019s to get the discipline in our program, get the best projects, get the multiple wells per pad, and some of the best assets in the country.","And so raising equity at this time is not a primary driver. I think it always exists as an option, but that\u2019s not something we\u2019re focused on.","Arun Jayaram - Credit Suisse ","And my final one is just trying to think about the Utica and the overall macro potential regarding gas. What are your thoughts, Doug? You have a couple hundred wells that you plan to put on later this year, early next year. Does this change the way you think about the gas market, where you have potentially a resource which has a lot of potential similar to the Marcellus?","Doug Lawler ","First let me say that I really am encouraged by what I\u2019ve seen in the Utica. As Steve noted, we\u2019ve got a lot of wells that we\u2019re getting ready to bring online. And I think the options there, we have a ton of options available to us. And focusing on the best areas there, and getting our capital in line, is part of the program, as we see the Utica to be a very strong asset going forward.","So as it compares to Marcellus, I hate to get into some of those comparisons at this point, because we still have several wells to bring online to evaluate and determine the right amount of capital to be investing in that program in the years to come. But I will tell you that I\u2019m very encouraged by it, and with my experience in all the other shale plays, I think it\u2019s an exciting area for the company.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bob Morris with Citigroup. ","Robert Morris - Citigroup ","One operating question on the increase in the oil guidance for the year. You mentioned part of that was the timing of asset sales. Can you tell me what proportion of that increase in the midpoint guidance was, the timing of asset sales?","Steve Dixon ","It was roughly two-thirds created by the delays in the asset sales. And one third of that is just performance increase.","Robert Morris - Citigroup ","You talked about matching capex with cash flow and allocation, and focusing on the best projects. Does this mean that you\u2019re contemplating a lot of expiration of leases or acreage? I know you\u2019d rather sell acreage. But in this market, it\u2019s tough to sell nonproducing acreage. So do you anticipate that in this program, in this new strategy, that there will be materially significant lease expirations that will occur here?","Doug Lawler ","There might be. And you know, our focus in the past has been to not let any lease hold expire. As a result, of that, and as a result of the aggressive land capture strategy, we\u2019ve got a tremendous opportunity to high grade within that. And as you look at where we start investing and where we start improving our efficiencies, we\u2019re not going to ramp up the rigs to hold leases. ","And our rig count, while we haven\u2019t given any particular guidance, and one area may increase and in another area it might decrease, but it\u2019s all centered on how we can drive the greatest capital discipline and the greatest returns for our shareholders. ","And so as a result of that, we may lose a little bit of acreage. We obviously will look at opportunities to monetize that acreage. We don\u2019t see us focusing in the near term on it, so we don\u2019t have stranded capital that has been invested, but the company\u2019s just tremendously blessed with a huge land resource base. ","And obviously as we go forward, we\u2019re not going to be able to develop all of it. But what we are going to develop is going to be very competitive, and we\u2019ll be looking for continuous improvement and capturing the growth metrics for it to be more competitive.","Operator","Our next question comes from Neal Dingmann with SunTrust.","Neal Dingmann - SunTrust ","Just looking at the Eagle Ford, obviously tremendous continued results, especially on those spud to spud cycle times. So I\u2019m just wondering, is this going from the 15 to 10 rigs just because of the efficiency? I\u2019m just wondering if you had decided to stay with the same amount of rigs if you had been able to take production up just that much more.","Steve Dixon ","A little bit more. We have some constraints there that are continuing to be improved. But yeah, we would have been restricted, couldn\u2019t have stayed at that same pace. Part of it was, though, we had to have that pace to HBP all of our lease hold first half of this year. We\u2019re basically done there now in the Eagle Ford, so you haven\u2019t seen all that we can do once we\u2019re now in a pure pad drilling mode going forward the second half of the year and into \u201914. So we\u2019re going to get a lot done with those 10 rigs. ","Doug Lawler ","And to add to what Steve said, when you think about some of the strengths that reside in Chesapeake, one of those is the speed at which we can ramp up our operations and ramp down those operations. So as we are pursuing value, and our competitiveness, and how we improve that, that rig number, we may go from 10 to 12 to 15, and maybe more than that. But we may pull it back based on efficiencies and how we develop our portfolio to be more competitive. So I think it\u2019s important to not note our focus too intently on the rig count, but to focus on the efficiency, the cycle times, the capital discipline, that we\u2019re building into the program.","Neal Dingmann - SunTrust ","And then maybe Steve, back to your HBP comment, where do you sit now with that in the Utica? You guys have, like you did in the Eagle Ford in the first half, is most of that held as well?","Steve Dixon ","Oh, no. The Utica is a long ways from being HBP. But we\u2019ve got long term leases there, so we have done some pad drilling and tried to be in a more focused area in the Utica to get started along pipelines. But no, we\u2019ll have a lot of work to do in \u201914 and \u201915 to HBP our excellent lease hold position in the Utica.","Neal Dingmann - SunTrust ","And just lastly, I noticed on the guidance for the oil field services net margin just was taken down slightly. Is that just a result of less rigs running? What should we attribute that to? ","Doug Lawler ","That\u2019s a result of less rigs running and it\u2019s also a result of just general pricing pressure across the oil field services segment. Our services are market priced, and they follow the market. So margins in that industry have been tight all year. That\u2019s a good thing for us from a cost perspective at the end of the day, and it ends up just coming out in that margin number.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt Portillo with Tudor, Pickering, and Holt. ","Matt Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, and Holt ","Just a few quick questions for me. In terms of the Eagle Ford backlog, can you give us an idea of where that stands today? And specifically, I guess with the 10 rigs that you have running in the play, how many wells do you roughly think you could drill next year? Just looking at the second quarter it looks like you completed about 140 wells, which was up quite a bit. So just trying to understand kind of the rate of change.","Steve Dixon ","Well, as Doug had just mentioned, we can ramp up and down pretty quickly. So 2014, we really have no guidance for you there yet on that, because it could be a pretty big spread. You saw the numbers that we turned on in the second quarter. We did a lot of catch up in the Eagle Ford. So I guess your question was more what our kind of excess inventory is left in the Eagle Ford. It\u2019s not a great number. We\u2019re trying to get those wells completed and online here in the second half. So I don\u2019t think we will exit with a big excess inventory in the Eagle Ford.","Doug Lawler ","I think just adding to what Steve said, we\u2019re not going to park capital on the ground that\u2019s not going to give us a return. And so if the infrastructure and the ability to get the wells online, there\u2019s some limit to it, we\u2019ll direct that capital elsewhere, direct the rig activity elsewhere, so that we can optimize our efficiencies and our returns. ","So I think it\u2019s still just a little bit early to say. I would expect that that inventory, with our rig activity, will fluctuate, and fluctuate for a couple of reasons. With the dependency of the infrastructure, and also with the efficiencies that we expect to achieve there. ","And so I\u2019m excited about it. I think it\u2019s a great time to focus on this backlog with oil at $107 a barrel, and we\u2019ll be doing as much as we can to bring it on as quickly as possible, and as efficiently as possible. ","Matt Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, and Holt ","And just on the back of that, looking at your full year oil guidance, if you look at the first half of the year you\u2019ve done about 20 million barrels. It would imply kind of the midpoint of the range, I guess post-asset sales, that oil growth is slowing or maybe decelerating a little bit in the back half. Is that a fair assumption, just given the completions that you guys are looking at? How should we think about the trajectory of growth going forward from here?","Steve Dixon ","We\u2019ll slow a little bit, because of that inventory we worked off during the first half, and then we just sold some oil in these asset sales. So that was all pretty much in full second quarter or first half, and it\u2019s just come out now.","Matt Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, and Holt ","And just last question for me, on the NGL front, it looks like on a run rate basis there\u2019s going to be a huge uplift in the back half of the year to get to guidance. I was hoping we could get a little more color on the plan going forward in terms of ramping your NGL volumes to meet the guidance range. ","And then a second follow up question, just in regards to the Utica, as you bring on additional NGL capacity, how do you guys think about dealing with ethane in that market and moving those volumes in terms of the liquids component? ","Doug Lawler ","Well, in terms of the NGL production, we have the Kensington plant that just started in the Utica. We have additional plant coming online later this year. So that ramp is significantly driven by that infrastructure in the Utica, as well as in [unintelligible] and some other plays as well. And so that\u2019s really the driver there.","As far as ethane, the Apex Pipeline is scheduled to come online around the beginning of 2014, and that\u2019s a significant assistance to us in moving ethane out of the basin. We\u2019re an anchor shipper in that line, and we think that\u2019s a good advantage to us.","Matt Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, and Holt ","Just a follow up there. So in regards to ethane for the back half of this year, is the guidance assuming a rejection out of the Utica? Or should we basically model in ethane rejection until Apex comes on?","Doug Lawler ","We\u2019re able to do some blending with our ethane in the Utica. What we\u2019ve modeled in the way of rejection is rejection for July and August. Beyond that, we have not modeled any rejection, but as you know, it\u2019s possible. We\u2019ve had some rejections this year as well. So hard to predict. The pricing has been right around breakeven on a lot of our contracts for several months now, one month ahead, one month below. And we monitor that very closely, and make the most economic decision each month.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research.","Bob Brackett - Sanford Bernstein ","Quick question around the divestment of noncore affiliate. Could you just give us a list of your affiliates, just for our information?","Doug Lawler ","I think most of that information is available if you will look at our 10-Q and public information we have, rather than going into that at this point in time. Key focus there is that we\u2019re looking to drive the greatest returns from any affiliate that we\u2019re associated with. And that\u2019s what I would just ask you to know and that strategically it\u2019s an important part of our program going forward.","Bob Brackett - Sanford Bernstein ","Okay, I\u2019ll try a different\u2026 This competitive capital allocation procedure, could you contrast that to what Chesapeake had been doing?","Doug Lawler ","Certainly. The key there is that our previous strategy was focused largely on preserving the lease hold. I\u2019ve been very, very impressed with the geoscientists within Chesapeake, and the team\u2019s ability to rapidly - not only from an external perspective prior to joining the company but also internally now that I\u2019ve been here - I\u2019ve been very impressed with the company\u2019s ability to identify and rapidly move in and acquire significant core positions, simply some of the best rock in the country.","And the focus has been to not lose any of that acreage, and the shift in the strategy today, and the capital required to do that previous strategy, had put us in a very difficult position. And as we go forward, that capital and that focus is on driving the greatest value out of that acreage and being the most competitive we can be against our peer group. ","And so by using that focus and that speed and that technical ability that resides and is very strong inside the company, we\u2019re focusing that speed and that strength on value. And so I\u2019m very excited about it. We have a lot of work to do, but we\u2019re shifting that strategy from preservation of the land to capturing the most value from the land in the core areas that we\u2019ve identified.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Kelly with Global Hunter Securities. ","Michael Kelly - Global Hunter Securities","Obviously there\u2019s a lot of variables to consider as it pertains to 2014 growth, and I\u2019d just like to touch on a couple of specifics there. First, on the midstream takeaway additions that you would potentially be adding here at the end of the year and into 2014, hopefully you can direct our attention there to what\u2019s meaningful. I know you\u2019re constrained in a number of these basins. Obviously the Utica, but also in the Marcellus and Powder River Basin. And just talk about how their coming [slow] to capacity there could also play an important factor in 2014\u2019s growth.","And then the other thing I wanted to ask you about is just the baseline decline on your natural gas assets here. How\u2019s it been faring? What\u2019s your model so far in \u201913, and what\u2019s a good number to dial in for \u201914?","Steve Dixon ","We do have a number of projects coming online in the next 12 months that will help significantly in the Utica, I guess to begin with. We\u2019ve got 200 million in processing coming on now, another 200 million towards the end of the year there, and capacity for another 200 million in probably second quarter of \u201914. So lots of ramp up room there in the Utica.","In the Marcellus, those pipes, additional takeaway there, come on at the end of the year, November-December timeframe. It will allow more capacity in the Marcellus. The Eagle Ford is kind of a number of things, pipeline, treating, and compression, that will continue to help throughout the year to improve it.","Niobrara, that\u2019s probably \u201914 on it, before we have any really meaningful, big step rate change there. We\u2019ve got a little bit of incremental, but that\u2019s when that gets relieved.","And so again, that\u2019s all factored in our \u201913 guidance. And we are not giving any \u201914 guidance yet. But we will factor all those in when we provide \u201914. ","Michael Kelly - Global Hunter Securities ","And I just want to make sure I\u2019m characterizing this correctly. Did you say that you think you could have a very similar completion count in \u201914 versus\u201913 while getting capex to come in line with cash flow?","Steve Dixon ","We did not say that, because we have not provided \u201914 guidance. What we said was that we are getting more efficient and our completions per capex will be improved, but we have not provided that capex number yet.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Allman with JPMorgan.","Joe Allman - JPMorgan ","Let me clarify, for 2014, your expectation is that your all-in capex is going to be at or below operating cash flow? Am I understanding that correctly?","Doug Lawler ","Our target is our drilling and completion capex will be within cash flow with the overall target that we continue to pull all the capex within our operating cash flow. So the messaging there, and what I would like for you to focus on, and I want to convey, is that it\u2019s a very strong strategic element in this company going forward to live within our cash flow.","Joe Allman - JPMorgan ","Again, just to clarify, the DNC capex plus other capex, you\u2019re targeted to have it at or below operating cash flow?","Doug Lawler ","We\u2019re going to focus intently on balancing our capex program to be within cash flow, yes.","Joe Allman - JPMorgan ","And what are the dynamics that allow you to do that now? Because Chesapeake in the past has been in a very tight situation and probably wanted to spend less, but was precluded from doing so. So obviously one of the things you mentioned in the call was Eagle Ford Shale is largely HBP at this point, but what are some other dynamics that enable Chesapeake to live within cash flow?","Doug Lawler ","Well, there\u2019s two or three central elements to accomplish that. And the first, you highlighted, in that we\u2019re not going to preserve every acre. And we are going to focus on the very best areas. And inside those best areas, you can expect to see greater efficiencies from our drilling and completion program. As I mentioned, the production growth that\u2019s been realized by the company is from single well pads. ","And as you look at our percentages of multi-well pads, we\u2019ll be significantly improving as we focus on those key areas. And as a result from that, we\u2019ll see likely fewer rigs, greater capital efficiency, and continued growth. ","So that\u2019s a huge element as a part of it. And then as we also look to reduce the complexity in the program, the things that are not getting us the returns that we\u2019re targeting, we\u2019re looking to eliminate that waste, or that\u2019s not providing the greatest return for us. ","So looking to drive the greatest value to drive the leakage out of the program, to identify waste where it exists in our operations and is not getting us the competitive return. That all rolls up, is going to create a much more competitive program. ","Joe Allman - JPMorgan ","Are there any commitments, whether it\u2019s acreage commitments or pipeline commitments, that might preclude you from doing what you want to do?","Doug Lawler ","We\u2019re in the process of evaluating all that. I think there are going to be some that we have to evaluate and scrutinize really closely, but my observation at this point in time is that we\u2019re going to be able to accomplish that, and we\u2019re going to be targeting working as quickly as we can. And so I\u2019ll reiterate the issue around providing 2014 guidance, that this is the strategic tenets that we\u2019re trying to accomplish, and we\u2019re very focused on trying to get there as quickly as possible.","Joe Allman - JPMorgan ","And then is debt paydown also still a big goal for Chesapeake?","Nick Dell\u2019Osso ","Absolutely. It\u2019s still a major goal of ours. We expect to have a simplified and improved balance sheet in the coming years. In the coming months, as well as years.","Joe Allman - JPMorgan ","So does that mean that your intention is to pay down at least a few billion dollars of long term debt?","Nick Dell\u2019Osso ","I\u2019m going to stay away from an exact number, because it\u2019s going to depend on the opportunity set that\u2019s in front of us when we are at a point of excess liquidity and we make that decision. But we are continuing to target investment grade metrics. It\u2019s a goal of the company to be investment grade. ","We have been making good progress on improving our liquidity, and the next step will be to apply that excess liquidity towards our balance sheet when we\u2019re ready to do so, which we will do at some point in the relatively near future, especially as we consider a noncore asset sale program.","We have significant liquidity today. Remember, it\u2019s in the release that we ended the quarter with an undrawn revolver. We\u2019ve closed a couple of very large asset sales since then, so we have quite a bit of liquidity today.","Joe Allman - JPMorgan ","And then lastly, Doug, I know it\u2019s relatively new for you, but when you look at the portfolio, what would you identify as the top three plays that you likely are not willing to sell or touch in terms of any monetization?","Doug Lawler ","I hesitate to say that. I would ask you just to focus on the strategic things we\u2019re driving, and capturing the greatest value and being the most [competitive] to the company. So there may be some noncore positions in the best assets that we\u2019ve got that we\u2019d look to monetize to accelerate the value. And we may consider asset sales across the whole portfolio. ","But the driver here is where we can capture the greatest value, and where we can be more competitive, and so I just would prefer to stay away from saying any one particular asset is untouchable or that we wouldn\u2019t focus on. ","But I will also comment that I\u2019m really excited about our strong portfolio. I think the Eagle Ford assets, the Marcellus assets, Haynesville although it\u2019s hurt a little bit by gas prices. The position there is outstanding. The Utica is outstanding, and we have several other emerging areas that are in the evaluation process that we\u2019ll be looking at. ","I think that it\u2019s important to note that as we allocate our capital in creating this competitive process for funding in 2014 and beyond, that there will be opportunities for other areas that we\u2019ll invest in. But those other areas will be invested in based on substitution, not addition. ","So the competitiveness within the portfolio to make sure that we\u2019re doing the best things for our shareholders is our focus, and if we\u2019ve got new opportunities in a new place that we can run with, that will add to the value of the company, we\u2019ll be looking to do that, but the overarching statement there is that the financial discipline is very, very critical to the company going forward. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Amir Avif with Stifel.","Amir Avif - Stifel Nicolaus ","Just a couple of quick questions. First, once you finish your review of capital allocation, can you give us a sense of when you\u2019d be ready to provide \u201914 guidance or color? ","Doug Lawler ","I hesitate to give that at this point. Obviously our capex program will be reviewed with our board, and so I\u2019m just not going to provide any information about that. But we\u2019re working it very hard and very diligently, and you guys will be hearing more from us soon.","Amir Avif - Stifel Nicolaus ","But in terms of timing, though, when you\u2019d be willing to provide that.","Doug Lawler ","What\u2019s critical there is making sure that we do the comprehensive analysis and determine the best opportunity set for us to invest in. So I don\u2019t want to put a time limit on it, simply because we want to make sure we evaluate it properly.","Amir Avif - Stifel Nicolaus ","And you had great sequential growth this quarter. But as you cut your rig count here in the second half, and based on your guidance, there\u2019s no sequential growth showing up in the second half on an absolute production basis. Is that basically a conservative reflection in your guidance? Or should I look at the second half run rate capex as a good reflection of what you need to maintain your production?","Steve Dixon ","It\u2019s a function of the sales that we just had. You know, we sold quite a bit of production in the Miss Lime JV, Haynesville, and north Eagle Ford. So it\u2019s a reduction of that that we\u2019re seeing now in the second half that wasn\u2019t in the first half. But there is a reduction in capex spending, and a reduction in wells turned online also, 20% less in the second half than in the first half. So all those factors, and hopefully conservatism also.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason Gilbert with Goldman Sachs.","Jason Gilbert - Goldman Sachs ","I wanted to put a finer point on one of the strategic questions earlier, which is so far it appears you\u2019ve been pruning and optimizing within your legacy plays with your divestiture program, for the most part. I was just wondering how you thought about complete exits from plays. And I guess where I\u2019m coming from is that if you think there\u2019s a real strategic benefit to being in eight major plays, and there might be fewer distractions if the company was able to focus on a smaller number, and furthermore with a larger sale you might be able to accelerate the repair of the balance sheet. So I just wanted to hear your thoughts on that.","Doug Lawler ","Your question is very good, and I guess the way I\u2019d answer it is yes. We\u2019ve exited plays before, including Fayetteville, Permian, and we potentially, for those that are noncore, will have complete exits. So I think it\u2019s all a part of the portfolio evaluation that\u2019s underway.","Jason Gilbert - Goldman Sachs ","And then the last question would be, you mentioned you want to reach IG metrics, and I think I know what your answer\u2019s going to be here, but I was just wondering if you could put any sort of timeframe around that.","Nick Dell\u2019Osso ","No, we really can\u2019t put any timeframe around that. We are focused on it. We have a number of things that we\u2019re looking at that will help us to get there, but it\u2019s going to be a combination of improved operational performance, taking the proceeds from noncore asset sales, applying them to our balance sheet, etc. So it\u2019s a process that will take some period of time, and we don\u2019t have an exact timeframe for it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brad Karp with Wells Fargo. ","Brad Karp - Wells Fargo","Regarding IG metrics, Doug, you mentioned it in your prepared remarks. Just curious, is that a standalone strategic goal? Or is that more or less a byproduct of other strategic goals such as efficient capital allocation and balancing capex and [unintelligible] and so on?","Doug Lawler ","It\u2019s a part of the financial discipline. So I think in terms of those things that I mentioned, they\u2019re all A priorities. But it falls under that financial discipline umbrella. ","Brad Karp - Wells Fargo ","And then are there any specific metrics associated with that? Is it just kind of debt per BOE and so on? Any specific numbers surrounding those?","Nick Dell\u2019Osso ","There\u2019s obviously a number of metrics that we look at, the agencies look at, and you all look at. We could go through the list, but different companies rank stronger in some metrics than others when they get to investment grade. And we\u2019re looking at the entire suite. We know what our strengths are, and we know what our weaknesses are, and we\u2019re focused on having our entire set of metrics look investment grade over time.","Brad Karp - Wells Fargo ","And then final one just on asset sales. Just based on where you\u2019re at year to date, it seems like you\u2019re right around that lower end of the $4-7 billion guidance. Do you see yourselves falling into the lower half of that for the full year? Or basically what would it take you to get to that upper half that you\u2019ve kind of touched on throughout the call?","Doug Lawler ","I think the key there is that we\u2019re very pleased with what we\u2019ve accomplished to date, and as we look for other assets that don\u2019t meet the criteria for the portfolio going forward, we may have more asset sales. ","And the key there is how we continue to build the portfolio to be the most competitive as possible. So in some cases it may be accelerate value and in some cases it may be hanging on to the assets for longer term. ","But at this point in time, I think the range that we\u2019ve provided is good, and we\u2019ll continue to look for opportunities to improve our balance sheet, improve our liquidity, and a component of that is definitely asset sales.","I think out of respect for the other calls today, I think we\u2019ll go ahead and bring it to closure. A couple of key things I just would like to note. One is that I\u2019m extremely excited. I\u2019m very pleased to be a part of Chesapeake, and as I review the portfolio and the quality of the assets and the people, I see a tremendous amount of potential. ","And I think the key there is that we rebuild that financial discipline into the program, that we focus on the profitable and efficient growth from our captured resources. And I also note that we have a lot of work to do. But the focus is there, the strategic discipline is there, and we\u2019re excited about the future.","So if you have any additional questions, please follow up with Jeff and Gary. They\u2019ll be available to answer those questions and we appreciate your time today. Thank you.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Gary Clark. Please go ahead, sir.","Gary Clark","Thank you, Lauren and good morning and thank you all for joining our call today to discuss Chesapeake's financial and operational results for the 2014 first quarter.","Hopefully, you've had a chance to review our press release and the updated investor presentation that we posted to our website this morning. During this morning's call, we will be making forward-looking statements which consists of statements that cannot to be confirmed by reference to existing information. Including statements regarding our beliefs, goals, expectations, forecasts, projections and future performance and the assumptions underlying such statements. Please note that there are a number of factors that will cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements, including the factors identified and discussed in our earnings release today and at Pages 23 to 31 of our February 27, 2014, 10-K and in the Company's other SEC filings.","Please recognize that except as required by applicable law, we undertake no duty to update any forward-looking statements, and you should not place undue reliance on such statements.","I would next like to introduce the members of management who are on the call with me today: Doug Lawler, our Chief Executive Officer; Nick Dell'Osso, our Chief Financial Officer; Chris Doyle, our Senior Vice President of Operations, Northern Division; Jason Pigott, our Senior Vice President of Operations, Southern Division; and John Reinhart, our Senior Vice President of Operations and Technical Services.","As a reminder, we will be hosting our 2014 Analyst Day in Oklahoma City on Friday, May 16. This event will be webcasted and details can be found on our website. We will next turn to prepared commentary from Doug and Nick, and then we will move to Q&A. Doug?","Doug Lawler","Thank you, Gary, and good morning. I hope that everyone's had the opportunity to review our 2014 first quarter results issued earlier this morning. It was an excellent growth quarter for Chesapeake. We reported year-over-year adjusted net productions growth of 11%, adjusted EBITDA growth of 34% and adjusted earnings per share growth of 97%.","I'm particularly proud that we've achieved this growth, while running a disciplined capital expenditure program that is approximately 50% less than a year ago. This morning, we're also very pleased to note that we've raised our 2014 full year operating cash flow guidance by $700 million to $5.8 billion to $6 billion.","We've increased our production growth guidance to 9% to 12% up from 8% to 10% on an adjusted basis and we've maintained our capital guidance to $5.2 billion to $5.6 billion. The ability to provide this growth and capital efficiency demonstrates the power of Chesapeake portfolio as the industry is beginning emerge from a prolonged period of depressed natural gas prices and as we focus our efforts on generating incremental shareholder value out of every $1 spent.","Our cash flow increase is prompted by a number of factors including better than expected first quarter operating cash flow performance and increase in our production outlook, a decrease in our expense outlook for the remainder of the year and an increase in our benchmark oil and natural gas price deck to $95 and $4.50 respectively, which is more reflective to the current pricing.","Nick, will cover the rest of our outlook changes in more detail later in the call. As noted in our press release this morning, overall production that quarter was impacted by approximately 7,600 barrels of oil equivalent per day of weather related down time. Mainly affecting our mid-continent assets but still within our forecasted weather related downtime that's in our guidance.","In the Eagle Ford, production was down slightly on a sequential basis due to a combination of factors including gas gathering and processing facility down time. Operator and competitor offset activity related shut-ins and weather related activity reductions.","April production trends in both the Mid-Continent and the Eagle Ford give us a high degree of confidence that most of these issues are now behind us and we believe the production growth particularly on the oil side, is poised to grow sequentially for the remainder of the year.","Notably, our average daily production rate in the Eagle Ford is currently 95,000 barrels of oil equivalent which is roughly 8% above the daily average rate in the first quarter and I'd like to note, that we plan to exist the year in the Eagle Ford at a substantially higher rate than December of 2013.","In the Utica and Southern Marcellus, the startup of our ATEX pipeline shipments ahead of forecast combined with stronger first quarter production from these areas has resulted in a very robust NGL growth profile. These are primary factors behind the increase in our 2014 adjusted production growth outlook to 10% to 12% as the lowest cost anchored ship are on ATEX.","Chesapeake is well positioned to maximize its margins and its region via our valuable ownership of firm transportation on the ATEX pipeline. Chesapeake has and will continue to evaluate opportunities to utilize third-party ethane volumes to fulfill capacity commitments and reject the portion of our own ethane.","Given the rapidly growing regional production profile and the potential for BTU related pipeline restrictions we are very pleased with our transportation on ATEX and we intend to use this asset strategically to maximize our margins and maintain ethane recovery flexibility.","Turning to capital expenditures, despite a very low level of spending in the first quarter. We still anticipate total CapEx within our previously stated range of $5.2 billion to $5.6 billion for the full year 2014. Total capital expenditures in the 2014 first quarter were approximately $850 million of which drilling and completion capital were approximately $729 million.","We invested cash of $882 million during the first quarter and drilling and completion activities which was partially offset by lower than estimated drilling and completion costs and other adjustments related to prior period of approximately $153 million. Net expenditures for the acquisition of unproved properties were approximately $24 million and other capital expenditures were approximately $97 million.","In the first quarter, our drilling and completion CapEx decreased 37% sequentially from the 2013, fourth quarter in part because we completed approximately 15% fewer well. This decrease in completions is largely due to the timing impact of increased pad drilling, which can delay the completion and connection of new level until an entire pad is drilled out. We expect many of the pads drilled during the first quarter will be completed and connected during the second quarter and the E&P CapEx will rise accordingly.","Additionally and given the severe weather experienced during the first quarter. We voluntarily delayed some completion activity from the first quarter to the second quarter. Improved capital efficiency was also an important driver of our lower spending during the first quarter. We reduced our average capital cost per well by several $100,000 in the first quarter of 2014 compared to our 2013 average well cost.","Consequently, we are spending substantially fewer capital dollars year-over-year while still achieving or exceeding our production growth targets. As part of the strategic initiative to reduce future corporate obligations and complexity. We chose to utilize a portion of the excess cash we generated during the quarter, to purchase a number of rigs and compressors subject to long-term lease agreements.","These transactions will reduce future cash commitments and help facilitate asset sales in the possible spin-off or sale or our Chesapeake oil filled services unit. Chesapeake has undergone a remarkable transformation. Our strategies and financial discipline and profitable and efficient growth from captured resources are becoming readily apparent in our results and are generating foundational improvements across the business.","I'm extremely proud of the Chesapeake team and the rapid pace in which we had embraced our challenges and opportunities. We will relentlessly pursue continuous improvement and drive towards our goal of becoming a top performing E&P Company. This concludes my prepared remarks. I'll now turn the call over to Nick Dell'Osso, our Chief Financial Officer. Nick?","Nick Dell'Osso","Thanks, Doug and good morning. I'm very pleased with our financial performance this quarter and the progress we continue to make in simplifying our balance sheet and reducing leverage cost. In our updated investor presentation posted at chk.com this morning. We've included slides to provide more detail in some of the topics that I'm going to discuss on this call including changes to our 2014 outlook, natural gas differentials and basis hedging and balance sheet improvements.","As Doug mentioned in his opening remarks. We increased our 2014 operating cash flow outlook to the range of $5.8 billion to $6 billion. Which is an increase to $700 million from the prior outlook midpoint. The drivers of this increase are attributable to the following. First, approximately $340 million is associated with an increase in our benchmark oil and gas price forecast for the remainder of 2014.","Net of hedging impacts and increases in oil and NGL differential. Note that, our new oil and gas price deck per second quarter through fourth quarter is $95 per barrel and $4.50 per Mcf that from our previous assumptions of $90 per barrel and $4 per Mcf.","Second; approximately $190 million of our operating cash flow increase is associated with a change in the hedging presentation assumptions embedded in our outlook. Previously our outlook guidance treated all realized hedging gains and losses as cash and all unrealized gains and losses as non-cash.","However, a portion of our realized hedging gains and losses actually consists of non-cash amortization from previously closed our hedges. The new outlook guidance presentation we've adopted includes only cash related to hedging, gains and losses and excludes non-cash amortization which we believe more accurately aligns with reported cash flow.","Please note that, cash flow from operating activities on a GAAP basis is unaffected by this presentation change, they only effect our outlook and improves the accuracy of our estimated cash flow. Lastly, approximately $117 million of the operating cash flow increased projected for 2014 is associated with our increased production outlook for 2014 coupled with Chesapeake oil field services net margin improvements as well as the various other expense improvement that I'll cover shortly.","Next I would like to discuss the positive impact that strong Northeast natural gas price realizations had on our first quarter results and I would also like to provide some detail in our natural gas basis hedges for the months of April through October of 2014.","On a companywide basis, our natural gas price differential decrease to a $1.08 per Mcf in the first quarter from a $1.76 per Mcf in the fourth quarter; very cold winter temperatures and increased heating demand in the first quarter coupled with Chesapeake's beneficial firm gas transportation positioned in the Northeast was the primary driver of the quarter-over-quarter improvement in differentials.","As a reminder, in November 2013 Chesapeake began delivering natural gas from its Northern Marcellus play into the Spectra pipeline which receives pricing at the TETCO-M3 hub and accesses the Manhattan market.","During the 2014 first quarter, the company delivered approximately $425 million a day to the TETCO-M3 hub where we received an average premium to Nymex Henry Hub prices in excess of $5 per Mcf.","These volumes represented approximately 30% at Chesapeake net northern Marcellus production during the first quarter. The company estimates at this firm transportation commitment on the Spectra line enabled it to generate $210 million of incremental operating cash flow over sales and the Basin during the first quarter.","It is important to point out that the positive effects of the premium pricing in the Northeast I just described were largely known at the time we issued our 2014 outlook guidance on February 6 and as a result our full year 2014 natural gas price outlook remains unchanged at a $1.60 to $1.70 per Mcf.","Looking ahead, Chesapeake expect the TETCO-M3 natural gas prices will revert to a discount to Nymex Henry Hub in the months of May through October and as accordingly entered into basis hedges on a significant portion of its 2014 gas to be delivered at TETCO-M3 as well as other sales points related to its northern Marcellus production.","Please refer to Slides 12 and 13 of our updated investor presentation on chk.com which includes new disclosure on our natural gas sales points, basis hedges and associated volumes in the Northeast Marcellus, the Utica and the Southern Marcellus.","To wrap up, I'd like to walk you through a few of our other outlook changes and key elements that drove the quarterly results on the cost of margin side. We are pleased to increase our projected oil field services operations, net margin by $25 million for 2014 which reflect the general impact of improving industry trends and increase third-party utilization of our services equipment.","On the cost side, we are reducing the high-end of our G&A expense range to a $1.30 per boe from $1.40 per boe as we continue to achieve cost savings to discipline spending. Production cost during the first quarter came in at $4.73 per boe.","Our full year 2014 outlook range anticipate decrease in unit production cost as we realized additional volume growth throughout the year. However, so we are leading our production cost range of $4.25 to $4.75 per Mboe unchanged.","Turning to interest expense, we are reducing the expect to grant by $0.20 per boe to reflect the impact of our recently completed $3 billion debt refinancing, which reduces our weighted average interest cost from 5.9% to 5.1% and its projected to generate an estimated annual cash interest cost saving of $115 million.","We are also beginning to see the benefit of our capital efficiency programs in our DD&A rate and accordingly have produced our DD&A outlook by $0.50 per boe. That concludes my remarks, thank you for your time this morning and we will now open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. At this time, we will start the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Mike Kelly with Global Hunter Securities. Please go ahead.","Mike Kelly \u2013 Global Hunter Securities","Nick, you had some comments on the differential outlook going forward. Just hoping, you take this one step further and for modeling purposes what should we dial in for 2Q and 3Q, if you kind of give us a head start there?","Nick Dell'Osso","Well to avoid getting into too much granularity on the call, Mike. I'll just remind you that we did keep our range at a $1.60 to $1.70 and also I'll point out that in the first quarter we did bank in our expectations of cold weather as we presented our outlook in February. However, when we did so we still did see incremental high prices through the remainder of the quarter.","What that ends up doing in certain contracts where we have basically a value component to the transportation price is that, when you have the spikes in prices there are some contracts we pay higher transportation cost and so actually even though our realized prices came in even higher than expected at that time in February, so did our transportation cost as a result.","So while we bank in a big portion of that improvement there was an incremental transaction cost in the first quarter that we couldn't predict at that time. So relative to where we were then, the $1.60 to $1.70 for the remainder of this year takes into account that incremental cost at first quarter stood it's actually the better than it was in February.","Mike Kelly \u2013 Global Hunter Securities","Okay, appreciate that and if I look at your guidance in terms of the real drivers of the increased here in the production side. It looks like it is NGL driven primarily and we certainly could talk about the composition of that. Is this mostly, more ethane stripping which is the driver of that and if it is \u2013 maybe can you just talk about the fact there's that would potentially take oil production guidance higher as you go throughout the year here, given comments that the Eagle Ford looks fairly south going into Q1 here. Thanks","Chris Doyle","Hi, Mike this is Chris Doyle. Let me touch on the NGL's, the big driver there is really in our at south business unit, which includes the Marcellus South and Utica and thus ATEX came online in January. We started recovering NGL's shipping ethane down ATEX through January Marcellus South and we brought in Utica in March.","Haynesville came in a little bit ahead of schedule which is great. The team's on the field executing on a significant production ramp that we had risked down in our forecast and that we should start seeing plans saying thus, we get very comfortable with the ethane and NGL reserves from those stream and so that gives us the confidence looking forward to go ahead and range that guidance.","Already a very stout NGL growth guidance we put out in February. In terms of oil, I'll just touch on the Rocky's. As we know we are hard to constrain until the fourth quarter. We are moving ahead with [indiscernible] there's a big chunk in oil volumes in the fourth quarter. I'll get you to Jason to touch on Eagle Ford and Mid-Con and the other two oil [indiscernible].","Jason Pigott","As far as Eagle Ford again, we had a transition with a rig fleet. So we've moved from of high enough 32 rigs in 2012 to low of 10 in 2013. So we've ramped back up during this first quarter up to 20 rigs with two stutters and we've also transitioned the pad drilling. So we've had a little bit low down this first quarter but that was totally anticipated so looking forward to grow oil volumes out of that.","Eagle Ford and those first set pad could drills and then the wells start to come online and looking forward to the growth there and Mid-Cons is really spanning storage for especially in our mid mine plays. We hit out record rate down there at 30 pounds in barrels a day in Mid-Con north.","So very excited about the progress we are seeing Mid-Con as far as our big oil growth engine there. So again, I think we're going to look probably well by a year end, as far as oil growth in part.","Mike Kelly \u2013 Global Hunter Securities","Appreciate that, if I [speak] one more just on the capital efficiency front here. Doug, I was hoping you would -- could quantify just give us your thoughts on how far along we are in the goal to get well cost down to $1 million across the board in each one of your basins, per well. Thanks.","Doug Lawler","Sure, Mike excuse me. I'm glad you asked that question. As everyone is aware, we set out a goal at the end of 2013, fourth quarter. As part of our capital efficiency improvements in the company we are going to drive $1 million per well of our capital program. And we have made substantial progress in every single area in which we are investing.","Our outlook for the year that was a program that we were looking to achieve and accomplish over the course of 2014. We essentially have captured good amount of that, if not all of it in several areas and we still have more opportunities through efficiencies and synergies that we anticipate that we can capture and so excellent progress with that respect.","We'll be providing more detail on an asset basis at the Analyst Day next week and provide more color around how all those capital efficiencies are getting captured and where we anticipate further capital efficiency to be recognized in our program going forward.","Mike Kelly \u2013 Global Hunter Securities","Good deal, great quarter and look forward to the update next week. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I appreciate the detailed explanation on the basis differential, but obviously some things that's never enough. So if you comment, I'm just trying to dig thought a little bit more in to this. What I'm curious about is, as per Haynesville production kicks back in towards the back end of the year in terms of growth that is an obvious with the big ramp you have in the Utica.","What is the mix change due to the basis outlook because I'm guessing you've got a bit more flexibility then perhaps beyond your current mid-stream commitments to be able to see improvements perhaps you're not making for numbers right now. So I'm just wondering if that was part of what we saw in Q1 or if I'm just completely off base and appreciate that color.","Nick Dell'Osso","Sure, Doug this is Nick. I'll take that. So we are expecting an increase in our Haynesville production this year, as we ramp a rig activity there, as we previously noted. The timing on that of course to key to figuring out exactly how many volumes come in this year versus next year and determining what the MBC impact will be, so as you think about what I said earlier about the $1.60 to $1.70 staying where it is for the remainder of the year and that being actually an improvement on where we thought it would be in February for the remaining three quarters.","The Haynesville MBC as we are getting ramped up there is probably a bit higher than we thought it would be then and the Barnett is lower as we have seen better production come out of our Barnett wells than we anticipated beginning of the year and as we see some opportunities to bring on some low cost completions and things like that in the second half of the year.","So we continue to stay on top of the forecast of that overall MBC impact and our second half of the year is lower than we anticipated originally and we'll always continue to try to optimize our capital program around this types of items that we can take advantage of opportunities where they'd be basis like we saw in the Northeast or whether they'd be transportation related to optimize the contracts we have in place.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Forgive me for pushing this, but if you look into 2015 and beyond. Can you \u2013 just given the rough start is to how you would expect that basis differential to evolve?","Nick Dell'Osso","You know, there's so many components to it there, Doug when you talk about transportation as well as basis. So it's a bit hard for me to do that until we get into really giving the streaks and detail on our capital allocation across our assets and where we see the best return coming out for shareholders and how we go about prosecuting the program for 2015.","I'll say you that, it certainly would not be in our forecast to have the same strength of winter that we had this year. We'd all love to forecast that, but that's probably not realistic so we wouldn't necessarily have that basis improvement there and from a transportation side. We will have some of the same types of challenges around, where our firm transportation and MBC's are but we think its manageable was this year, where we optimize our capital program around that.","And we think potentially there is opportunities to continue to do that and improve what we see.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks, my follow-up maybe a little bit more philosophical and Doug I guess this one would be for you, but there's been a little bit of speculation that perhaps you would be prepared to look outside the US strategically as you move forward. Now obviously other than from analyst update but I just wonder if there was really any substance to that or obviously you've got lot of winter chop to-date but how do you feel about the overall direction and the company going forward, now I'll leave it there. Thanks.","Doug Lawler","Thanks, Doug that's a great question and I really appreciate you asking it. I think you categorize it properly that we've got a lot of wood to chop. I think we've making a lot of progress on several fronts. The efficiency in our programs, our cash costs, our capital program, the synergies, operationally that we are capturing. I just \u2013 I cannot be more excited about the progress that we are making.","What we see with our high quality assets is great growth potential and excellent running room and as the company continues to grow. The strength of our assets provide us live flexibility, I think we have an outstanding portfolio highly competitive portfolio compared to our peers. So I'm very pleased with that and I want to highlight and point to our strategy which is the financial discipline, which were making great progress on.","And the second point, profitable and efficient growth from capturing resources and the emphasis there, is that the captured word is there for a specific reason, Doug. It is there because we are focused on driving the greatest value from these assets unless said, I think that it's important to note and I've shared in an few external presentations that the Chesapeake [indiscernible] besides talent, the company's speed, the operational capability and expertise is outstanding.","And as the world and countries around the world look for opportunities to develop their own unconventional or shale resources. Chesapeake has that expertise and could potentially be part of it. I believe it's something that we should evaluate, we have not made any commitments to enter into the international arena, but I do believe that in the company's future that could be a possibility, we just have to be very careful that we do not comprise the value creation story from our current assets and it has to be very prudent value accretive to our shareholders.","So as everyone is aware, there's different risk profile international and the last thing we are going to do is, in anyway what so ever sacrifice any value for our shareholders in our growth stories. So that's, we'll leave it in response to your question, but there is extremely good growth opportunities in our current assets and for the size of the company there's an optional lever there that can potentially be pulled but it has to make good sense for our shareholders and the company's growth progress going forward.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I appreciate the answer, Doug. I'll see you next week. Thank you.","Doug Lawler","Great. Thanks. Doug.","Operator","Our next question is from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice Brokerage. Please go ahead.","Charles Meade \u2013 Johnson Rice Brokerage","Good morning, thanks for taking my question. Doug, I want to go back to a kind of discrete comment you made in your prepared remarks about the ATEX line. It sounds like, what you're considering is perhaps not doing just doing partial ethane recover to get down to pipelines back and then using your extra capacity on the ATEX line to buy heavily discounted ethane that other people have to strip out to meet, pipelines back. Have it got the right read on that?","Doug Lawler","Yes, that's a fairer look at of what we're trying to describe. The ATEX pipeline, gives us a tremendous amount of flexibility and strength there with our production.","Charles Meade \u2013 Johnson Rice Brokerage","And I guess what I'm really after is, what is \u2013 so you're able to where is that going to be show up, I'm guessing it will be in the marketing midstream line and what kind of order magnitude are you up, are we talking about as far as the value capture opportunity there?","Doug Lawler","Well, we haven't put that exactly level of detail out in our guidance yet. The key in my mind is the flexibility that it offer too much with the production growth area and it's optionality how we can capture the greatest value for our shareholders, given that assets and that those that capacity that we have available to us.","Charles Meade \u2013 Johnson Rice Brokerage","Got it, so several birds and the bush just none in the hand yet and then shifting back over to the Utica. I'm wondering, you guys had some midstream challenges with the Natrium plant fire and but that's in the past. You now got the ATEX line up, can you talk about how that play whether more interested in the well performance and the takeaway that kind of thing, how that is performing versus your expectations of maybe three or six months ago.","Chris Doyle","Hi, Charles this is Chris Doyle. I'm exceptionally pleased with the continue performance and honestly our performance of the team that we have working the Utica. When I came on six months ago, I had many of the same questions. I think some of you guys have, I've spend six months looking at the results of this team has executed upon really looking forward to sharing that with you guys next week at Analyst Day.","I can tell you everything is lined up. As you've said, we've had some challenges, had some challenges late last year and we came back taking, we were set in production records probably two or three a week as we continue up this aggressive production ramp.","As the press release indicated, we average about 50,000 barrels a day equivalent net from that asset and we are significant higher than that today. Just an update, the next tranche, the next bump up will come in the form of Kensington, the third train in Kensington. Now they're $100 million a day.","We are on track for June startup which is reflected in our forecast. We tied in that third train a couple weeks ago; we are finishing sort of final adjustments. Electrical and should be commissioned in couple weeks. This is the team that continues to out execute just starting volume in that play and you'll see that in black and white next week and couldn't be proud of anything.","Charles Meade \u2013 Johnson Rice Brokerage","Thank you. I'll be tuned in, when we see you next week. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question is from David Heikkinen with Heikkinen Energy Advisors. Please go ahead.","David Heikkinen \u2013 Heikkinen Energy Advisors","I just wanted to check my math on differential first, with a $1.08 in the first quarter in guidance does that basically mean second quarter guess will be a $1.85 to $1.90 for in third quarter and fourth quarter?","Nick Dell'Osso","Didn't calculate that out in front me, Dave but was a $1.08 in the first quarter and $1.70 for the end of the year, that's the math.","Unidentified Company Representative","Fourth quarter should be radically be the highest, Dave because you've got the MBC coming back in.","David Heikkinen \u2013 Heikkinen Energy Advisors","And then the on the NGL realizations and NGL growth. You basically added 10,000 barrels to 15,000 barrels a day of NGL volumes to increase your guidance. As I look at the differential increase for the NGL's and just kind of attribute the volume increase and the differential increase to the same out, that would be like a $99 a barrel differential on the incremental NGL's, is that just tied to those incremental NGL's being primarily ethane?","Nick Dell'Osso","A lot of those NGL's are ethane, Dave you're right at that, but I would also remind you that when you look at the NGL differential as it suggested here keep in mind that we increased our oil price by $5 and so if you look at the projected realized price for NGL's, they're actually a little bit higher than they were previously.","So what we've really done as we've said, NGL prices that we expect to receive our flat to a little bit higher and the delve set to Nymex oil is wider as we've continued to see that NGL pricing is challenged in a way that oil is more volatile.","So what we are really projecting there is less volatility in the NGL price this year, than we've seen short-term in the oil price as we've gone from $90 to $95 barrel.","David Heikkinen \u2013 Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Okay and then, Doug you talked about first quarter CapEx being down and 15% reduction completions, can you give us your outlook for second quarter CapEx and 1% increase in completions as those pads come online?","Doug Lawler","We'll share more of that detail with you, next week Dave. The key there's noting that, the strength of the portfolio, the capital efficiency; things that we are driving forward towards that were maintaining that CapEx were projected for the full year and very confident on production profile.","So we will get into more details there on the asset side.","David Heikkinen \u2013 Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Just take the full year minus first quarter and divide by three for second quarter, third quarter and fourth quarter is that fair?","Doug Lawler","Well, the key to remind the comments that we shared about some of the timing of the first quarter completion activity. It probably a rough approximation is okay, but there will be some volatility around the quarter just based on the pad drilling and the activity.","David Heikkinen \u2013 Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Okay. See you next week.","Operator","Our next question is from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Brian Singer \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Going back to the Utica. Can you just talk about the trajectory of your production mix in terms of oil gases versus NGL's? Both based the various midstream be bottlenecking, but also as you contemplate doing more or looking more to dry gas window versus the liquids rich window?","Chris Doyle","Hi, Brian this is Chris Doyle. I think we'll probably get into that kind of detail next week. What I'll say is that, our trajectory has not changed. You look at our total gross process in capacity. We've laid out back in February. We said we're going to ride that capacity all the way up through the end of the year. We are definitely in line to do exactly that.","I'd say right now, just rough approximation the components splits probably 10% oil, 30% NGL and 60% gas plus or minus. You mentioned the dry gas and we're excited about some of the test that we've seen, we have some of our own dry gas test but honestly there's probably two or three generations of completions to go.","So we are out there, we will be out there testing that dry gas window and excited about hundreds of thousands of acres we've got in it, but when I also say it's not just about dry gas window. We are testing every part of that play and just have a tremendous amount of excitement about what we are seeing and we'll share a lot more next week.","Brian Singer \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Great, thank you and then shifting to the Haynesville, you talked about production bottoming here starting to return a sequential growth in the third quarter. How you're thinking about that, as you look in the 59 annual basis. I think you said flattish and in the past, is that still the case. Do you expect a more secular trend in growth?","Jason Pigott","Right, now we're trying. Sorry this is Jason. We are still kind of working on the 15 rig allocation is going to be, we are looking at a steady kind of eight rigs probably again, we're factoring in as a portfolio just MBC again. First of all, we've got great economics in there. We had our first quarter, post-appraisal but we just finished last week in those wells average about over 50% rate of returns, so real excited about the economics and results that we are seeing from that program, but again the Haynesville program is designed to optimize the cash flow at a corporate level.","So we are kind of avoid our 15 discussions, right now and kind of touch on those maybe more at Analyst Day, but for this year. We are planning on eight rig program that will get us up above our MBC by the end of \u2013 post that, by the end of the year.","Operator","Our next question is from David Tameron at Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","David Tameron \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","All my questions have already been asked, but if we look at back at the Eagle Ford looks like that oil, the percentage coming from oil, went down in the quarter from 4Q to 1Q. Was that infrastructure, can you just talk about anything changing out there?","Jason Pigott","The only thing, I could point to again I hadn't looked at that actually from percentage going forward, but then we did have some downtime issue that impacted oil more than the gas, so that could be influencing. We lost about 120,000 barrels just again gas and stuff just due to some processing problems and gathering problems.","So again, I don't think about overall fluid composition out of Eagle Ford is going to change long-term, it's a pretty steady profile. So I just made -- have been kind of something that happened during the quarter.","David Tameron \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","Okay, so no change to what you're drilling or you're?","Jason Pigott","No, we're 75% liquids pretty much out of the program and 25% gas. So nothing, again there may be minor fluctuations here and there but I don't think it's anything major or long-term.","David Tameron \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","Okay and then Nick or Doug whoever wants to take this? The natural gas side, you know I think I asked you about this before but as far as hedging for 2015, you're not that hedged and just given the focus on debt repayment and in a little more conservative approach on financials, why not go ahead and just lock some of that gas in rather than pick that bet that gas move higher, can you guys just talk about that?","Doug Lawler","Yes, Dave it's a good question. One which we continue to look at and what would be the hedging program to be very important and critical to protect our cash flows and we look at it very often and we will continue to look at it, so I think that there is opportunity there and that the way look at it right now, I think there is we've got a lot of strength in the pricing and as you're well aware. We're focused on protecting our cash flows and improving our balance sheet, their key elements and what you can expect that we'll continue to hedge and too opportunistic time and we think it's the best for the portfolio.","David Tameron \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","All right. Let me slip in more and hear this. You guys have put this capital discipline slide in here, cash flow versus the CapEx and you're finally I guess for the first time at least 5 years on that chart here above CapEx.","If we maintain a positive, let's say we maintain current prices, should we see that GAAP widen in 2015 and 2016.","Nick Dell'Osso","Doug, I'm sure will want to have something to say here too, but Dave we held off on given any kind of guidance on what we're going to do for 2015 because we're going to continue to assess our opportunities there. All things equal, if prices stay high relative to how we have things planned, yet that guidance that GAAP would widen, but I'd just remind the strength of the portfolio and the places we have to invest capital at a very high rate of return, when you think about that question.","Doug Lawler","And I think, just to add there that everything we do, we tied back to our strategy and that strategy is to provide top quartile, growth metrics from a operating perspective and capital perspective and a financial perspective and so we are not looking for one quarter win or one year win, we are looking for the long haul steady, repeatable performance that's in the top quartile category.","We are making great strides in that way and as we look forward to 2015 and we'll be sharing some additional color by that next week. We just \u2013 we have a lot of opportunity.","David Tameron \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","Okay, thanks for the color. Good luck, next week. We'll see you out there.","Operator","Our next question is from Jason Wangler with Wunderlich Securities. Please go ahead.","Jason Wangler \u2013 Wunderlich Securities","I'm curious on just with obvious reason the commodity prices in what we've seen in just general. Whether it's within individual basis or just across the entire portfolio, are you seeing much of change in just the activity plans for the year or even as you look even further out?","Doug Lawler","Well, the portfolio that we have give us a lot of flexibility and as we look at our capital program and we plan going forward looking to capture the greatest margins. We have a considerable amount of flexibility and being able to average in certain area, pull rigs from another area and we will do that as we see necessary.","I don't expect that you're going to see major deviations in our program but because we have the strength like in Haynesville, you could see say increase a rig there, but it is not like you're going to see this ramp up to 15 rigs or something like that.","So we really are trying to take a very discipline approach to it, but the strength and the prices, the strength and realizations. We will opportunistically look to capture that value, but it will not be significant deviation from our planned programs.","Jason Wangler \u2013 Wunderlich Securities","I'm sure that's helpful and then maybe just on a high level, I'm sure we will get into this more next week, but from the asset sale perspective just non-core side, it seems like you're just kind of keep peeling things off. I mean, do you have an idea at least on the high level, how far along that process you're is there much left to do, have you kind of gotten through that portion of that last year or so?","Nick Dell'Osso","You know there's still a fair amount to do there, it will come in pieces, it won't be a big wave necessarily like we've had in the past of as many kind of volume of deals, but we do have a large portfolios, we continue to note there's a number of things in the portfolio that others look at and feel they would [covet] more highly than we do and therefore put more capital into and therefore be worth more to them, then would to us.","So things that we are not investing in, that become non-core to us overtime. We will either determine if there is ways to improve them and make them more competitive in our portfolio or we will look at divesting them, so that's an active process that this company will be in perpetuity as given the breadth of the portfolio.","Doug Lawler","So just to add to what Nick said there, I think that our target about that financial disciple in improving the balance sheet and the strength of our balance sheet is something that we're actively working and we will continue to work.","Operator","Our next question is from Neal Dingmann with SunTrust Financial Services. Please go ahead.","Neal Dingmann \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Say just two questions, first just on, I noticed that obviously the CapEx for the acquisitions of unproved properties, you know you've got that down now and I think it was $24 million or so for the last quarter. your thoughts as, are you continuing to add just some bolt on things to block up some acreage or Doug, is it fair to say that especially in your Eagle Ford and Utica most of that now is pretty blocked up?","Doug Lawler","You described it perfectly, we will have some small incremental acquisition cost in there for bolt on type of stuff filling in acreage, but it's not a significant part of our program and you won't see any major deviations from that?","Neal Dingmann \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Okay, I'm sure you'll probably get this next week definitely more detailed in the Utica, but just questions on, I think you said for the 47 wells as in release that the average was about 1,180 boe per day, just went an on now on the for the wells that you're doing, you know existing what does the completions look like, I mean are you extending the laterals and so I guess, two questions there just on that overall cost of these wells and then, how you're seeing the laterals sort of developed?","Chris Doyle","Hi, Neal this is Chris as you and I discussed probably couple months ago, our focus for this year is capital efficiency and what that means for us in Utica is extending those laterals out and actually optimizing our completions and so we are seeing quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year increase in EURs and performance.","We are as you know, not aggressive when it comes to the choke. We think the long-term performance of these wells and it's interesting to see some of our competitors come out and now do the same thing. We think long-term performance is not driven by the first month production, it's driven from the first year, two years production and how you bring these wells on.","As we've said, we're exceptionally pleased with the performance. We'll get into heck lot more detailed next week, but for the discussion you and I had earlier this year is still on track and longer laterals and optimized completions and well cost, we were talking was, we could drive well cost into the sixes.","We are staying right around the low sevens, but reallocating some of the efficiency gains that we are seeing some of the cost reductions that we are seeing into better wells.","Operator","Our next question is from Arun Jayaram with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Arun Jayaram \u2013 Credit Suisse","Doug, I just wanted to see if you could maybe highlight maybe your opportunity set regarding, Powder River Basin oil as well as the Niobrara, haven't gotten an update from me guys on that in a while?","Doug Lawler","We are going to give you good review in that, within next week. We are excited about, what we see up there. We think there is good opportunity. I view it as a another strong asset this will be important in our future and for our oil growth strategy. So we'll be sharing a little more detail with that view, next week on that.","Arun Jayaram \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay, fair enough. Doug, as you think about as we look at the big-cap pierced to-date and earning season. We have been seeing really any of the large-caps putting incremental dollars in the gas. So I just wanted to get your thoughts on, what it will take for CHK, obviously it had summer rigs in the Haynesville but to get, more capital allocation towards dry gas.","Is there a gas price, what are you looking towards to do that?","Doug Lawler","It's not really driven by gas price, Arun it's more focused on how we can drive the greatest value of our program and how can we continue to sustain that overtime. So we have tremendous flexibility in our rig fleet and how we can move our rigs around, I don't see as materially changing as I've commented on our previous question.","Materially changing our program as gas and the current gas price environment, but keeping mind with four assets it can produce greater than 1 Bcf a day several of those can produce greater than 2 Bcf a day, we have a tremendous value lever there that, as proven in the past this company's ability to ramp production very quickly and take advantage of strong opportunity, we can do that.","The key in my mind is that we are going to do at a prudent pace; we are going to do it at a value capture pace and not do anything to comprise the long-term growth profile of a company. So that said, you can see few rigs move around to capture value, greater value and we will do that and just react in a more opportunistic way, but we are certainly pleased with the gas prices and looking to capture greater value there.","Operator","Our next question is from Subash Chandra with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Subash Chandra \u2013 Jefferies & Company","I'm trying to understand, I guess I might struggle in asking this question but should we think about these cost goals per well and sort of initial stage of cost reduction that is heading towards best practices or is it sort of phase I of cutting the fat and best practices might involve putting more horsepower into completion there or stages etc to weigh your maximizing output.","I mean, it doesn't seem at all like your stocks pricing output, while you're reducing cost but trying to understand, if I \u2013 as you \u2013 if this is the best practice completion you're looking for based in the basin, in the current program?","Doug Lawler","That's a great question and I appreciate you asking and I would answer it in a, the way I would describe it as that issues that are in place are driven and how do we capture the greatest value and my mission is that few times in different presentations but, there's a difference between cost management and cost leadership and what you're seeing take place in Chesapeake's program is somewhat both.","We are managing cost in my mind the differentiation between the two, is managing cost is driving the things out of our program, out of our expenditures that we know, the efficiency gains that we know exist, cost leadership is how we continue to deliver the same results in driving further value and cost reductions into our program.","The teams have done a fantastic job, we made significant progress. I think we still have a long way to go, the excitement in our teams and on campus here is very strong. The asset reviews, the opportunities for further synergies, further cost reductions are just are fantastic, so I think we've got lot more opportunity on the cost leadership side and the focus that we have there is great.","And so you'll continue to see improvements on the cost, but as Chris was highlighting a little bit there, we also are very mindful, how do we capture the greatest value. So as we look for ways to reduce our cost and to be more efficient in some cases, that maybe adding additional frac stages to give greater recovery or to optimize on a rate, that optimize a program.","So the key there is, drive the cost out, cost leadership but also, I would capture the greatest value.","Subash Chandra \u2013 Jefferies & Company","Okay, thanks and I'll probably more about that next week, as well. Along the same lines, you're talking about optionality in the portfolios wondering, if you had a limited dollars, if you can put in context what more you'd rather be doing and if you, given the competitive hiring environment out there. Are you currently staffed to pursue these options?","Doug Lawler","We \u2013 but with respect to the staffing question, we are. And we've got a great group of talented employees that are doing fantastic job in our strategy. As we look to grow the program, it's all really focused on, where -- how can we drive the most competitive metrics for the company and the greatest profitability for the company and we're just ever mindful, it's not one metric, it's several metrics.","Its several things that we need to be competitive and driving towards, top quartile performance. So as we look at that, we are not going to sacrifice value and we will staff accordingly and we will maintain the discipline in our programs, that we'll perform not only this year, but we will perform in the subsequent year.","So it's a little hard to answer that question and if we had \u2013 if we allocated some additional capital or we have some additional money to spend, we are building the programs. Where we know, when you capture the next value opportunity for our shareholders.","Operator","Your next question comes from Dave Kistler with Simmons & Company. Please go ahead.","Dave Kistler \u2013 Simmons & Company International","Really quickly looking at your full year CapEx budget and then reflecting back on Q1, Doug you mentioned $850 million in the release and on the call, but that obviously had some nuanced adjustments to it, was that $850 million factored into the budget.","In other words, were you anticipating these accounting adjustments divestitures that sort of balanced it out to $850 million?","Doug Lawler","In general yes, keeping mind that is we had some weather related issue, we deferred some of the completion activity to the second quarter, Dave there is some variances across all of the different areas there, but in general yes, it's all accounted for.","Dave Kistler \u2013 Simmons & Company International","Okay and should we expect similar things going forward, I mean DNC budget?","Doug Lawler","Yes, absolutely. The recognition of the capital efficiency is also very, very significant and how we continue to capture cost savings on our accountable program and that's a huge driver for us.","Nick Dell'Osso","Dave, just though when you say significant things, I just want to be clear, we would not expect those types of adjustments to be recurred.","Dave Kistler \u2013 Simmons & Company International","Okay, that's exactly what I was trying to understand. So then switching over back operationally real quick on the Haynesville, well cost have got down to $7 million as you highlight in your presentation, you highlighted that 50% rate of returns has there been any incremental productivity of wells or is that $7 million just the benefit of going back to existing pads, any kind of color you can give us on, how those have been driven down, so aggressively versus the rest of the industry?","Jason Pigott","Well, this is Jason. We've done a little bit of everything there; we've been really playing with different completion techniques to get our cost down. So it's been over reduction and sand or anything like that, that we would accomplish is reducing chemicals that we use, just testing some slick water fracs etc, so those are really, a lot of the savings is driven by the completion side.","The drillings doing, a phenomenal job as well. So we've seen almost $2 million come off those cost in a year, we are very excited about that program going forward. As far as productivity again, we clock the performance of these wells on these test to see if there's been any negative impact, so far we haven't see anything, so time will tell for that, but we are really encouraged by what we've seen so far, we do follow these back on our restricted rate choke, just like they do in the Utica.","So you won't see big IP performance changes in those wells because we restrict, well on restricted rate every well that we bring on, so they're performing exactly [indiscernible] expect from those wells. We monitor pressure and rate to make sure that we are not seeing performance degradations but again it's just been a great program, great turnaround for us in a short amount of time, so really excited about the Haynesville program overall and just, putting value to the company over, as a whole.","Dave Kistler \u2013 Simmons & Company International","Great, I appreciate that, one last one and maybe this is going to be held off to the Analyst Day, but when you look at what you're doing, you're driving down the cost dramatically and you've given us some examples that, can you give us the examples that correspond with also increasing recoveries, while those cost have come down?","Doug Lawler","Yes, we'll re-point to the Analyst Day on that, Dave.","Operator","Your next question is from Matt Portillo with Tudor, Pickering & Holt. Please go ahead.","Matt Portillo \u2013 Tudor, Pickering & Holt","Just a quick question from me, in regards to your inventory across a number of basins, could you give us a little bit of color as to how you think about working that down overtime in particular just trying to get a better sense of, how we should think about finding your Marcellus growth trajectory over the year.","And then just a second quick follow-up question in regards to service cost trends, just curious if you can provide some color on how you're seeing the service market evolved, as we've seen some uptick in activity from the industry?","Doug Lawler","I'll comment real quick, Matt and then Chris may want to throw some additional comments in as we talk about few of the areas, the inventory has come down significantly and compared to previous years, we've made huge progress on that, keeping mind that as we made this big shift, this efficiency shift to the pad drilling that you'll have some inventory build associated with the timing of the wells coming online just by virtue of drilling four or six wells on a pad.","The one area that we still have some inventories in the Utica and we will be working that down over the years as well, but we anticipate that throughout 2014 that we will be in a steady state or a state type of inventory based on the capital program and the timing of the pad drilling and bringing the wells online and then Chris, do you want to add any comments up for one?","Chris Doyle","Yes, Matt the question of balance for Marcellus growth and how we should we think about that through the end of the year, I'll add some color there. I'll say, what we're forecasting is not requiring any growth out of that asset honestly, what we have is a tremendous position in one of the greatest dry gas basins known and our wells continue to outperform our expectations and industry's expectation and so what we are focused on is capital efficiency and we've got a lot of optionality and we'll share that, with you next week, where we could ramp up and potentially grow the asset, but we are not, we don't need that growth to grow the company and we are fantastic position and lock the flexibility, when it comes our expectations for Marcellus.","Doug Lawler","On the service comp side, Matt this is comment real quick on that John Reinhart and his team are focused on supply changes in capturing part of our savings on our put forward basis have been heavily driven by focused on supply chain capturing the greater [average] purchasing power of the company and so in general, there is some sort of price pressure, but we are addressing that through various energies and greater cost management through our supply chain and John, you want to comment on that?","John Reinhart","Yes, I think we've been really pleased with the supply chain group. This is an organization started up in Q4 and just in a very short period of time has really driven a lot of value throughout the organization and as Doug said, we are very early on in our capital improvements, but this is certainly been a big part of the improvements we've seen year-to-date and look forward to further success throughout the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Magner with Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Joe Magner \u2013 Macquarie Capital","And thanks for taking my question, just curios some accounting adjustments that were made and there was a comment in the release about capital interest has gone down as the unevaluated pool has been reduced, how should we think about the management of that? we don't have the detailed balance sheet in the release, but how's that come down and meaningfully recently or is there more to come and how should we think about that in the context of your DD&A guidance has come down, but how will that be accounted for going forward, a lot of moving questions maybe I'll follow-up offline, but just curios on the high level, what's driving some of these changes and how should we think about as role through?","Doug Lawler","Sure, Joe. We'll file our 10-Q later today, so you can follow-up or those of you have any further detail after that, but just to comment at a high level, as we decreased our leasehold spending and we continue to evaluate properties to the drilling program and other evaluations that we perform from time-to-time, you'll see unevaluated pool decrease, just by nature of our activity level.","So as a result of that, you'll just see cash. Here you'll see interest expense, be recognized in the income statement more than it was in the cash flow statement in the past. I'll remind you though, that when you think about modeling this company from evaluation standpoint that we did decrease our cash interest expense on analyzed basis by $115 million through our recent refinancing.","So what you're seeing there is a geography change from the cash flow statement to the income statement and certainly is important to modeling EPS correctly, but overall the trends on interest expense are decreasing.","Joe Magner \u2013 Macquarie Capital","Okay, I guess I'll just follow-up afterwards once we've chance to take a closer look. I'll leave it there. Thanks.","Doug Lawler","Okay, we're going to cease taking calls now. We have over our time just a little bit, just for a highlight if you have any questions that weren't answered today in the call and please follow-up with Gary Clark, he'll be happy to help. With that and then also in addition, we are really excited about the Analyst Day next week and continue to share further detail in Chesapeake growth program as we go forward and additional asset detail.","So we look forward to seeing you next week, thank you operator.

[Operator instructions.]  At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jeff Mobley. Please go ahead, sir.","Jeff Mobley","Good morning and thank you for joining our call today to discuss Chesapeake\u2019s financial and operational results for the 2012 fourth quarter and full year.  Hopefully you\u2019ve had a chance to review our press release and updated investor presentation that we have posted to our website.","During the course of this call, our commentary will include forward looking statements regarding our beliefs, goals, expectations, objectives, forecasts, projections, and future performance and the assumptions underlying such statements.  Please note that there are a number of factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from such forward looking statements.","Additional information concerning these factors is available on our earnings release and the company\u2019s SEC filings.  Additionally, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, so we encourage you to read the full disclosure and GAAP reconciliations located on our website and in this morning\u2019s press release.","I would next like to introduce the other members of our management team, who are with me on the call today: Steve Dixon, our chief operating officer Nick Dell\u2019Osso, our chief financial officer; and Gary Clark, our vice president of investor relations and research.  ","Before I turn the conference over to Steve, however, I would like to share with you a few comments on a leadership change at Chesapeake.  As you know, Aubrey McClendon, the company\u2019s co-founder and CEO will retire from the company on April 1, 2013, and after leading the company during our first 80 conference calls, he is now stepping aside to Steve and Nick to lead this call.","In addition, a search is currently underway for a new CEO, and the board plans to complete this search by that time.  Aubrey has had a remarkable career founding and leading Chesapeake, and has created one of the most valuable and innovative companies in the global energy industry.  ","Two of Aubrey\u2019s most important accomplishments are the tremendous asset base that has been amassed by the company and the talented and dedicated organization he built to develop these assets.  The culture and capabilities of the company Aubrey created, and the standards of excellence he championed, have been distinctive and inspiring, resulting in a company with extraordinary potential.  ","But his legacy will ultimately be the realization of that potential through the success and value that we all help deliver after his tenure as CEO concludes.  With those thoughts in mind, and on behalf of nearly 12,000 employees at Chesapeake, we want to sincerely thank Aubrey for his visionary leadership and for his 24 years of tireless service to the company, the shareholders, the employees, and to the industry.","With that, I\u2019m going to turn the call over to Steve Dixon, who is working with Nick Dell\u2019Osso to guide the company through this period.  I thank them, and all of my Chesapeake colleagues, for their continued dedication and focus as we work collectively to develop Chesapeake\u2019s world-class asset for our shareholders.  Steve?","Steve Dixon","Thanks, Jeff.  I\u2019m pleased to report substantial progress at Chesapeake this quarter, on three key objectives: improving our production mix towards more liquids, reducing per-unit production cost, and achieving our targeted capital budget reductions.  Nick will talk more in depth about both the capital budget achievements and our cost discipline in a few minutes, but suffice it to say, I\u2019m proud of what our operational teams have achieved and the path that we are on.","Clearly we have amassed an enviable collection of assets across 10 of the top 15 key onshore plays in the U.S., and now the task at hand is to convert a decade of industry-leading new play investments into improved shareholder returns.  And we are well-positioned to do this, even more efficiently and effectively than ever before.  ","Over the past three quarters, Chesapeake has demonstrated that we have the people, properties, and processes in place to drive liquids production higher while also containing per-unit expenses.  Furthermore, I\u2019m energized by the opportunity to greatly improve our capital efficiency in the quarters ahead.  ","To this end, during the past year, all of our asset teams have been retasked and incentivized to shift their focus from acreage capture mode to meeting budgets and delivering higher returns on capital.  Focusing our operations on the core of the core enables our drilling program to increasingly target the best parts of each play, which should translate into better well results and very impactful capital efficiency improvements.","Through focused pad drilling, our equipment mobilization times will compress, water handling logistics will be simplified, road and pad construction costs will decline, pipeline connection times will shorten, and many other economies of scale will be realized.  We are targeting capital efficiency improvements of at least 15-20% as we transition to pad drilling.  ","Before I get to the operations, I\u2019d like to take a minute to discuss our reserve changes during this past year.  2012 was a noisy year for reserve bookings, as low gas prices resulted in the removal of nearly 5.4 Tcf of reserves, primarily in the Barnett and Haynesville shales.  We look forward to the return of these reserves when gas prices recover.","Additionally, we removed 1.4 Tcfb of reserves for non-price related factors.  This is primarily as a result of the SEC five-year rule, given our change in rig allocations and the high grading of [spud] locations into our shift from natural gas to liquids.  Importantly, production revisions to our crude reserves were positive, 131 Bcfb, as our individual well performance in aggregate exceeded our prior estimates.  ","With regard to the commodity mix, at year end 2011 our crude reserves were approximately 17% liquids and 83% natural gas.  At year end 2012, this mix improved to 30% liquids and 70% natural gas.  ","Turning now to our asset base, I will highlight two plays that best illustrate the operational excellence being achieved at Chesapeake.  First, the Eagle Ford Shale, which was once again the growth engine for our liquids production.  Fourth quarter liquids production averaged 50,800 barrels per day.  That\u2019s up 38,500 barrels per day, or 314% year over year, and up 8,000 barrels per day, or 19% sequentially, versus the third quarter.","This was in spite of outages at Regency\u2019s Tilden processing plant and barge delays for pipeline loading in Corpus Christi that impacted fourth quarter production by approximately 2,500 barrels per day.  And as a reminder, approximately 82% of our liquids mix in this play is oil, and only 18% NGLs."," ","Looking forward, we have budgeted our outlook a year-end exit rate of approximately 70,000 barrels of liquids per day from the Eagle Ford.  Achieving this near-40% growth target is subject to several factors, most notably the operational performance of certain midstream processing plants and the addition of natural gas gathering and compression systems, which have restrained our growth in each of the last two quarters.","That said, we are highly confident in the productive capacity of our Eagle Ford play, and believe that intermittent midstream issues would only impact the timing, not the ultimate delivery, of our production targets.","During the 2012 fourth quarter, we connected 98 wells in the Eagle Ford.  Looking ahead, our goal is to connect approximately 400 wells in 2013, which is roughly the same quantity as we did in 2012.  This is while running 14 fewer rigs than last year.","We were able to achieve this by connecting wells currently in inventory as infrastructure catches up, and also by benefitting from reduced spud-to-spud cycle times.  We continue to make very meaningful progress in driving cycle times and well costs lower.  Our average spud-to-spud time during the fourth quarter was 18 days.  That\u2019s down more than 30% from 26 days in the 2011 fourth quarter, and over this same time period, average per-well drilling and completion cost also fell roughly 30%.","And cycle times have continued further to decrease in 2013.  Notably, we just recently drilled our fastest Eagle Ford Shale well to date in just under eight days.  The asset team had done an outstanding job in this region, and I look forward to accelerating capital efficiency gains in 2014 when the percentage of our wells drilled on existing well pads is expected to increase over threefold from this year.","Moving on to the Utica Shale, we continue to focus our drilling efforts in the wet gas window of the play inside our joint venture with Total, where we hold more than 450,000 net acres.  I\u2019m pleased to announce that within this area, we are projecting average EURs per well to range from 5-10 Bcf depending on the area and the phase of the play targeted.","To date, we have drilled 184 wells in the Utica, 45 of which are currently producing.  Production in the Utica was fairly minimal in the year in 2012 due to infrastructure constraints, but we are anticipating a significant ramp up during 2013, perhaps reaching 55,000 BOEs per day by the end of the year.  ","Helping us to achieve this goal will be gas processing infrastructure additions at Dominion\u2019s natrium processing plant in Marshall County, West Virginia, which is scheduled to go online in April, followed by the first of three processing trains at Momentum\u2019s Kensington plant in Columbiana County, Ohio, which is scheduled to go online midyear \u201913, with the second train operational before year end.","Like the Eagle Ford, Chesapeake is generating significant efficiency gains in the Utica.  Spud-to-spud cycle times have decreased 37% year over year from 35 days down to just 22 days.  Average per-well drilling and completion costs have followed a similar path, and were down 27% year over year.","In terms of drilling results, I would particularly like to highlight a well we recently drilled in Carroll County.  It\u2019s the [Co 34-12-41H].  This well experienced 24-hour IP of over 2,200 BOE per day, with a liquids cut of approximately 33%, assuming full ethane recovery.  We believe we\u2019ve captured the industry\u2019s largest position in the Utica, and look forward to solid results in this play for years to come.  ","Additionally, I\u2019d like to summarize our results in the Anadarko Basin, where we are focusing on five plays: the Mississippi Lime, the Cleveland, the Tonkawa, Granite Wash, and Hog Shooter.  These plays continue to provide steady liquids production growth.  At December 31, we had 29 rigs running in these plays, and combined fourth quarter net production averaged 104,500 BOE per day, which is up 7,500 BOE per day in the third quarter, or 8% sequentially.","The production mix from these five plays combined continues to get oilier, with 39% coming from oil in the fourth quarter as compared to 36% in the third quarter.  ","To characterize the year ahead company-wide, the shift to liquids is progressing in line with expectations and we continue to anticipate 27% liquids growth in 2013.  As planned, our natural gas production is now in decline, and our current guidance implies a 7% year over year decrease in reported natural gas production.","When adjusted for voluntary curtailments and the impact of our 2012 and projected 2013 asset sales, we believe the organic decline in our natural gas production will be closer to 9% year over year, assuming midpoint of our current guidance.","As we look at the balance of 2013, there are two major objectives we plan to accomplish.  First is to continue to execute and build on the strong liquids production growth and cost discipline trends that are already firmly in place.  Second is to complete two-year asset divestiture program that we have previously laid out to fund our capital investment program, reduce our financial leverage, and focus our operational efforts on our best plays to enhance returns on capital.","Along these lines, my operational teams have been fully engaged in the asset sales program since the outset, and I am confident they will not miss a beat in executing the program that has been set before them.","Lastly, I would like to thank all the employees of Chesapeake for their hard work, loyalty, and determination as we move through this challenging period of low gas prices and a leadership transition.  Our employees have always been, and will remain, our best asset, and I look forward to sharing their success in many years to come.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Nick.   ","Nick Dell\u2019Osso","Good morning, and thanks, Steve.  We are pleased with our 2012 fourth quarter results, and the substantial headway we made in terms of growing oil production, refining our focus, and reducing costs.  Adjusted earnings per share of $0.26 exceeded consensus estimates of $0.14 per share, and our production and EBITDA topped consensus estimates by a substantial margin as well.","Our strong performance was driven primarily by oil production volumes, improved oil price differentials, and solid execution on the cost side of our business.  We produced 8.9 million barrels of oil in the quarter.  Only 0.3 million barrels, or about 3% of which, was attributable to the stop of production from the portion of the Permian sale that closed in October.","Quarter over quarter, our significant growth areas were in the Eagle Ford and mid-continent regions, where we continue to generate high-quality oil growth, which is reflected in our strong oil price realizations.","During the fourth quarter, our company-wide differential to WTI was a positive $0.26 per barrel, which is greatly improved from our third quarter differential of WTI minus $4.15 per barrel.  Our outstanding marketing team warrants recognition for helping us achieve these favorable prices through securing access to premium pricing markets via pipeline, opportunistic entry into oil trucking in certain areas, and favorable lending arrangements.","Importantly, less than 10% of our oil production is considered condensate, as defined by an API gravity of 50 degrees and above.  Condensate oversupply concerns have been raised in the marketplace recently, and I believe Chesapeake has a good plan in place to successfully navigate this issue.","It\u2019s also worth noting that our total liquid stream by volume for the quarter consisted of 66% oil, 34% NGLs, a favorable mix that further strengthened realized revenue.  We achieved this mix in spite of the sale of our Permian assets, which continued a much higher percentage of oil than NGLs.","On the cost front, the fourth quarter was the first full quarter of the year where our decline in activity began to show up materially in our reported results, with our drilling and completion costs down approximately 30% year over year.  ","We averaged 88 operated rigs for the quarter, and spent $1.596 billion on drilling and completion costs compared to 122 operated rigs and $2.275 billion in the third quarter of 2012.  By December, our monthly drilling and completion capex run rate was down to approximately $500 million, and we expect our drilling and completion spend to remain roughly in line with this rate throughout 2013.","Further, we came in on budget for January 2013 as well.  This puts us on track to spend approximately $6 billion for the full year 2013, net of drilling and completion carries from joint venture partners, as compared to $8.8 billion in 2012.","I\u2019m also pleased to note that production expenses came in at $0.83 per Mcfe, down $0.01 per Mcfe from the prior quarter and down $0.05 per Mcfe year over year.","G&A came in at $0.23 per Mcfe, down $0.10 per Mcfe from the prior quarter, and down $0.12 per Mcfe year over year.  This decline included the impact of filling a portion of our additional overhead to the full cost pool due to changes in the [copus] rules, so while we do not expect G&A to remain at these very low levels going forward, our cost structure initiatives are clearly starting to bear fruit as demonstrated by the significant reduction we\u2019ve made to forecasted G&A as well as other cost items in our outlook on schedule A of the earnings release.","I\u2019d now like to quickly review some of the significant events of 2012, a year that was heavily impacted by continuing low natural gas prices.  Chesapeake entered the year focused on continued rapid growth of our oil and NGL production to provide a more balanced source of cash flow generation going forward.","We were running a total of 164 rigs in January of 2012, when the extremely warm winter and resulting rapid and severe drop in first quarter natural gas prices prompted us to further reduce our activity levels.  As a result, we ramped down our drilling program to just 85 rigs by the end of 2012.  ","Fortunately, we were able to rely on our liquids-rich portfolio to buffer the significant impact to 2012 cash flows created by the natural gas price decline and were also able to close on the sale of nearly $12 billion of asset sales during the year.  ","At the end of the year, we were still able to achieve an 84% increase in oil production and a 54% increase in total liquids growth, setting us up for a more balanced 2013 and beyond production profile, and importantly, holding production on some very valuable oil leases in the process.","To recap the year, our biggest asset sales consisted of exits from the midstream business and the Permian Basin.  Our midstream exit enabled us to redirect the company\u2019s strategic focus and capital resources into our upstream oil and gas operations.  ","As a reminder, we originally entered the midstream business at a time when the midstream industry\u2019s knowledge and appetite for capital growth and unconventional assets was limited.  Entering midstream proved to be profitable and strategically important.  However, given the changing dynamics of the NLP space and the increasing maturity of our operations in unconventional resource plays, we concluded that it made strategic sense to exit this business in 2012.   ","I\u2019m pleased to report that we recorded a total pretax gain on our midstream sales, including our gain on the sale of our equity interest in CHKM, or ACMP, earlier this year, of approximately $1.3 billion.  The Permian sales also represented a significant basin exit for us, but one that again helped to strategically and financially refine our focus.  While the Permian is a liquids-rich basin, it was not going to be allocated a significant enough amount of capital within our broader portfolio in the coming years relative to our other assets.","With respect to 2013, I\u2019m pleased to report that we are in a completely different position from a liquidity and funding perspective than one year ago.  We began 2013 with an undrawn revolver with $4 billion of availability, which, if necessary, could cover our approximate $4 billion funding gap in 2013, which is derived from our updated outlook in this morning\u2019s press release.","We look forward to soon announcing progress on our Mississippi Lime transaction, which will further reduce the funding gap previously mentioned, and have closed on, or have under PSA, more than $200 million in aggregated other asset sales so far this year.  Importantly, the company and the board of directors remain committed to reducing Chesapeake\u2019s financial leverage.","Let me now walk you through some highlights from our outlook, on schedule A of our press release.  First, we are reiterating our liquids production growth for 2013 and are very pleased with our results to date.  For 2013, we forecast our oil production and differentials to remain strong.  We now project that our oil production will account for more than 51% of our 2013 oil and gas revenue.","Turning to NGLs, I would like to note that we are not forecasting any ethane rejection in our production numbers this year, but certainly acknowledge that some could occur.  Additionally, our NGL growth will be highly contingent on the timing of processing infrastructure in the Utica.  Therefore, our line of sight on NGL production is less clear than that of our oil production.","That said, NGLs are projected to account for less than 10% of our oil and gas revenue stream in 2013.  Therefore, our exposure to soft NGL markets and potential processing delays is not particularly material.","Next, I would like to address something that our organization is very proud of, given the work put into it.  We are lowering our cost per unit expectations across the board: production expenses, production taxes, and G&A.  We remain focused on these metrics and believe that our increased operational emphasis and diligence in this area will help us deliver further reductions ahead.","These cost changes, combined with unchanged production from previous guidance, have allowed us to increase the bottom end of our range of cash flow expectations, despite a reduction in expected average 2013 natural gas prices.  ","In our revised outlook, we are reiterating our $6 billion drilling and completion, and our $400 million lease hold budgets for 2013.  Last quarter, we removed our guidance around oilfield service and other capex spending following the midstream operations.  However, to provide a little color there, we expect our field services capex to be lower in 2013 than in 2012, and we are not looking to add any new capacity to that business, beyond orders for equipment placed earlier last year.","Finally, I\u2019ll address our hedge position for 2013.  You\u2019ve no doubt noticed that we put on a significant amount of gas hedges for 2013, and feel good about being 50% hedged on the gas side for 2013 at an average price of $3.62 per Mcfe.  We are almost fully hedged on the oil side at $95.45 per barrel for 85% of our 2013 production, and have also added a material amount of oil hedges in 2014 at an average price of $93.67 per barrel.","We believe these incremental hedges go a long way toward derisking our 2013 and 2014 cash flow expectations, despite the fact that we are somewhat bullish on gas markets from this point forward.","With that, operator, we\u2019ll now open up the call for questions.  ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions.]  We\u2019ll go first to Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.  ","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch ","I\u2019ll start off with Nick, or whoever wants to take this one, on the asset sales.  Nick, it sounds like you\u2019re pretty close to the the Mississippi Lime disposal.  Could you share with us any color in terms of whether this is solely an acreage deal or the format in terms of joint venture or whatever?  Or particularly, if there\u2019s any production associated with your likely transaction?  ","Nick Dell\u2019Osso","I\u2019m going to hold back on giving you any specifics on the transaction given we\u2019re in the throes of working on it.  But I would say that there is some production associated with it, and we have included the impact of that in our outlook.  ","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch ","Maybe a follow on related, then.  One of the biggest criticisms, perhaps, of the company is still the outspend, or the overspend.  And you highlighted the liquidity position since the beginning of the year, at least the end of last year.  However, if you don\u2019t achieve the $5-7 billion of asset sales, it wouldn\u2019t really help you.  So can you help, or provide any kind of color, as to how the board is influencing the spending decision versus the potential ultimate scale of disposals, and any comfort you can give us on the line of sight as to how you get to such big numbers, $5-7 billion this year? ","Nick Dell\u2019Osso","Well, we and the board are very focused on our budget for the year, which as you noted has multiple elements.  It has our spend.  It also has asset sales and other costs associated with it.  We\u2019re focused on the end game of where we will come out.  We\u2019re focused on deleveraging.  And all of those things have to work together.","We\u2019re also focused on the fact that through this year we continue to hold [by] production some very valuable liquids [acreage].  With every well we drill, with every acre that we hold, we become more flexible in our drilling program, and that\u2019s a great thing in the short term.  And we are happy and would consider using that flexibility if needed.","Now, that being said, we have great confidence in our asset sale program.  We have good line of sight into what we plan to accomplish, and we think the outlook that is in front of you all today, with the $6 billion drilling program, and completing of asset sales in 2013, is something that is achievable, and that we believe we will achieve this year.  ","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch ","Last one is for Steve.  You have not changed your liquids guidance now for quite a while, but it seems that the oil piece of the liquids growth is running at least ahead of what we were expecting.  Can you just help us understand, what is drilling to core to the core mean in terms of type curves, because you really have not updated us there since 2010.  And if you could just speak to how you see the risks through your liquids in particular, your oil growth, as we move through the next 12 months?  ","Steve Dixon","We are focusing our capital program on liquids, and drilling our very best locations, and that\u2019s starting to [gin] those results.  Probably the Eagle Ford is certainly the biggest driver, where most of our capital is, and where we\u2019ve had the greatest success.  And it continues to impress and improve.  And hopefully we\u2019ll get some more results quarter over quarter going forward.  ","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch ","No change to the type curve?  In the Eagle Ford in particular?  ","Nick Dell\u2019Osso","We haven\u2019t provided the type curve since 2010.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch ","That\u2019s what I mean.  It seems to be pretty out of date.","Nick Dell\u2019Osso","Our results we think show great growth there, and great performance.  [talkover] continue to deliver to you guys out of the Eagle Ford, and out of all our liquids plays.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Arun Jayaram with Credit Suisse.  "," ","Arun Jayaram - Credit Suisse","Nick, I wanted to ask you, obviously you have a $4 billion outspend this year.  Wanted to see how the Marcellus could tie in to the deleveraging of your balance sheet.  Obviously you have a big acreage position here.  I\u2019d argue it\u2019s probably the highest multiple business in the U.S. E&P.  The company\u2019s obviously focused on liquids.  Why not think about monetizing a piece of the Marcellus?  ","Nick Dell\u2019Osso","We\u2019re looking at a number of alternatives on the A&D front for this year.  We have a pretty good plan in front of us.  We have had a couple of non-core acreage packages in the Marcellus out of the market that we had said we were going to do in our third quarter.  ","And we continue to do that across the board, look for the places within our portfolio where we are going to be the most efficient, given the footprint that we have, and where we have the best results, and know that we have acreage that would be more valuable to someone else.  Very good acreage that can be drilled for a great return, but within our portfolio, as we\u2019re going to allocate capital, can be delivered to someone else for a better return in up-front cash to Chesapeake.  So we\u2019re doing that in the Marcellus, and we\u2019re doing that across all of our plays.  ","Arun Jayaram - Credit Suisse","And in terms of what we have line of sight on today, it\u2019s the Mississippi Lime and an acreage package in the Eagle Ford, in terms of upstream asset sales?  Is that fair?  ","Nick Dell\u2019Osso","Those are the two biggest that we\u2019ve talked about publicly.  That\u2019s correct.  ","Arun Jayaram - Credit Suisse","And switching gears a little bit, you guys recently talked about a 10-year agreement on the methanol front.  I just wanted to get some details on that, and perhaps are you seeing more industrial customers looking to do similar kinds of things?  ","Nick Dell\u2019Osso","We are seeing a lot of interest from industrial customers.  There\u2019s been a really big increase over the last couple of years, but recently it\u2019s been even probably a more concerted effort by industrial customers to talk to us about some creative ideas.  ","And we\u2019ve found the methanol transaction to be very attractive for us.  It links our ultimate delivery to a price of a commodity that\u2019s closer tied to crude, so we can take some gas exposure and tie it in a way that correlates it more to a crude price.  And it\u2019s something that brings additional demand onto the U.S. market for natural gas.  ","So we think that we have a great price structure locked in there, one that achieves a very favorable price for Chesapeake and still provides us with enough exposure to upside to make it interesting beyond the price at the outset of the deal.  ","Arun Jayaram - Credit Suisse","And one quick one for Steve.  Where is your Haynesville production today versus at the peak?  ","Steve Dixon","I know it was down pretty hard quarter over quarter.  Gross, we\u2019re down to 1.3 from 2 Bcf a day.  ","Arun Jayaram - Credit Suisse","Down by about a third.  Okay, that\u2019s helpful.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.  ","Brian Singer \u2013 Goldman Sachs","First, on the oil mix, can you just talk about how, if at all, you expect your oil mix to evolve and change in three areas: the Mississippi Lime, Eagle Ford, and in Utica?  I noticed that the Mississippi Lime, that oil as a percentage of the total ticked up during the quarter.  In the Eagle Ford, it ticked down a little bit.  And just also wondering when you talk about 5-10 [Bcfe] whereas in Utica, what percentage oil versus NGLs versus gas you would expect?  ","Steve Dixon","I\u2019ll start with the Utica.  That\u2019s still pretty early and results change pretty quickly across the play.  Yields have a pretty wide range, and so that\u2019s why we gave a wide range.  So I don\u2019t really have a number to give you on that.","Nick Dell\u2019Osso","The Mississippi Lime and the Eagle Ford, we don\u2019t really expect the mix to change there over time.  We have pretty good insight now with those basins having pretty material amount of production.  So we feel good about that production mix being reasonably constant over time.  There will be fluctuations of course, as you bring on different packages of wells, but we don\u2019t expect any material differences.  ","Brian Singer \u2013 Goldman Sachs","And those, in places like the Mississippi Lime, would be consistent with the 40-45% that you saw in the third and fourth quarter?  Or do you expect some sort of degradation over time as wells decline?  ","Nick Dell\u2019Osso","We had 46% gas in the fourth quarter in the Mississippi Lime, so then 45% oil and the rest being NGLs.  And again, we don\u2019t anticipate any trend difference there over time.  ","Brian Singer \u2013 Goldman Sachs","And then just strategically, to the degree that gas prices surprise to the down side, can we expect that Chesapeake would sell more assets than it would be presently expected, or reduce capital?  Or borrow against the revolver?  ","Nick Dell\u2019Osso","I\u2019m sorry, could you repeat the question?  ","Brian Singer \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Yeah, if gas prices surprise to the downside, should we expect that Chesapeake would reduce capex from current guidance, sell more assets than expected, or just utilize the revolver and increase debt?","Nick Dell\u2019Osso","You know, the first answer there is that 72% of our revenue is hedged for 2013.  So short term impacts to commodity prices won\u2019t have the impact that it did have on us last year.  The second answer is that, again, we\u2019re very focused on deleveraging over time.  So I\u2019ll just probably leave it at that.  We have a lot of leverage we can pull to get there, and we\u2019ll continue to be focused on delivering on asset sales, be focused on staying within our budgets and reducing our leverage.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to  Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.","Charles Meade \u2013 Johnson Rice","I recognize that you guys are still in process on a Mississippian sale, but could you give some parameters on the deals that you\u2019re looking for, both in terms of scope, whether it\u2019s over your whole 2 million acres, or timing?  ","Steve Dixon","Charles, I just would really like to not take questions on a pending transaction this morning.  ","Charles Meade \u2013 Johnson Rice","That\u2019s certainly understandable.  The other thing I wanted to ask you guys about, maybe this is better for Steve.  I really liked the slides you guys put together on the takeaway in the Marcellus and Utica.  I think you mentioned that the Marcellus takeaway is going to be limited through year end \u201913, where there\u2019s going to be incremental capacity come along, but do you view this as more of the last significant hump to get over as far as takeaway, or do you view this as the first of many hurdles that you\u2019re going to have, or that the industry\u2019s going to have in the coming years, as far as takeaway?   ","Steve Dixon","You know, there\u2019s a number of projects, as you\u2019re well aware.  Some of those projects are more focused on getting us premium market access versus just capacity and then some, of course, do provide important capacity relief.  Today, there\u2019s planned a total of additional 3 Bcf of capacity additions, as we\u2019ve noted in that slide.  And some of them have just come on pretty recently.  ","There will be periods of time where capacity will get ahead of the deliverability of the basin, and there will be periods of time where the industry catches up with it.  It\u2019s going to be an evolving push and pull that will continue over time.  ","But I think pretty quickly here, particularly with gas prices where they are, and rig count where it is, you would get to a point where you wouldn\u2019t have long term capacity constraints before too terribly long in the basin.  ","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Neal Dingmann with SunTrust.  ","Neal Dingmann \u2013 SunTrust","Just wondering, on the Utica that you mentioned, looking at that 5-10 Bcf that you gave, could you give a little bit on what type of type curve you\u2019re expecting there?  Or I guess what I\u2019m looking at more specifically is what kind of first-year depletion, or if you can give us any depletion levels around those 45 wells that are producing?  ","Steve Dixon","We are constrained there, and really haven\u2019t been able to produce these wells as we would like.  So that\u2019s why we gave a big range in Bcfe.  So I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s just too early to tell.  ","Neal Dingmann \u2013 SunTrust","And the 55,000, is that just for later this year, assuming that you have most of this midstream tied in?  Can you maybe walk through it a little bit as far as kind of what you\u2019re expecting on the takeaway there, how to see that progress in the Utica?   ","Steve Dixon","Yes, to reach that, we need all three of those plants up and running before year end, which they are on target and expect that to happen.","Neal Dingmann \u2013 SunTrust","And then just lastly, you mentioned about how good your Eagle Ford results certainly have been.  Just wondering, is it just the result of trying to contain the cash flow outspend as far as why cut those rigs there?  To go from 34 to 17 rigs on such a great area, just want to hear your comment about if that looks like expectation would be to run kind of run around that going forward?  ","Steve Dixon","Fortunately, most of that is in efficiency gains.  We are still able to produce the same amount of net wells.  And it\u2019s also not to outrun our infrastructure.  So this is just the right well count to both hold our acreage and be more efficient with our capital.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Dave Kistler with Simmons & Company.  ","Dave Kistler \u2013 Simmons & Company","Just looking at your \u201913 capex, can you kind of break out what percent of that is dedicated to maybe four drilling commitments?  Or asked differently, what percentage is fixed obligations, [HBP] drilling, etc., and what percentage is flexible?  ","Nick Dell\u2019Osso","You know, we don\u2019t generally provide that breakout.  Suffice it to say, we are focused on holding by production our Eagle Ford and other liquids plays that still have some work to do there.  Those also happen to be our highest return plays.  So that\u2019s really why we don\u2019t focus on looking at it that way.  ","We\u2019re really more focused on what Steve described a few minutes ago, which is allocating our rigs to make sure that we\u2019re focused on returns, both near term and longer term returns.  We don\u2019t want to get in front of infrastructure.  We want to focus on the efficiencies that we\u2019re creating.  And we want to try to drill the best wells.  ","So there are a couple of places where we\u2019re going to go hold some leases, and take care of some commitments, but that\u2019s really not what\u2019s driving our rig allocation this year as much as it is trying to be most effective and efficient at growing our liquids production and focusing on returns.   ","Dave Kistler \u2013 Simmons & Company","And then you mentioned in your comments that you achieved about $12 billion in divestitures in \u201912.  When I\u2019m looking at the cash flow statement, it\u2019s highlighting about $10 billion.  Can you walk me through the disconnect, or what\u2019s rolling over into \u201913, just based on announcement dates and closure dates, etc., just so we can get a sense of how that feeds into your guidance of $4-7 billion for \u201913?  ","Nick Dell\u2019Osso","Just to reconcile the 2012 number, remember that one of the things we included in that \u201912 is the sale of the preferred interest in our Cleveland Tonkawa asset, which shows up in the financing section.  So there\u2019s no rollover into \u201913 of that \u201912, and the \u201913 number is focused on new projects that we\u2019ll be talking to you guys about.  ","Dave Kistler \u2013 Simmons & Company","And then one last one.  If you could kind of give us an update in terms of maybe drilled uncompleted wells or drilled and completed but not tied in in sort of the Marcellus and I guess the Rockies as two potential large growth areas for this next year, that would be great.   ","Steve Dixon","In the North Marcellus, there\u2019s still a couple hundred wells to be turned on that we want to get in line this year.  ","Nick Dell\u2019Osso","One of the things I would point you to, Dave, is on page 14 of our release we break out our well costs and we had broken out last year the costs on unproved properties, which would be basically dollars that we had spent on wells that were not yet put into the pool, because they were not yet proven.  ","That becomes effectively a balance over time, and so you\u2019ve seen the last two quarters that\u2019s a negative number.  So net-net, we are decreasing the number of inventory wells in the company at this point, and we\u2019ve done that in the Marcellus and we\u2019ll continue to do that across the company with a few instances where we\u2019re adding to it into our plays.

","Nick Dell\u2019Osso","We have taken out a pretty good bit of capacity on ATEX, and so we\u2019re feeling good about our ability to move it out of the basin to the Gulf Coast, which should get us to the best market available for ethane in the U.S.  We do also have a small amount of [FT] going up to [Sarnia] as well.  ","David Tameron \u2013 Wells Fargo","Jumping over to the Utica, the EURs you put in the press release, that 5-10 Bcf, could you maybe just talk about what production mix is assumed in that number, and then how variable it is across the acreage position?  Just an update overall on the Utica?  ","Steve Dixon","It is pretty early, and a very limited well set, so that\u2019s why we gave such a big range.

Last question, Nick, you commented on the condensate oversupply.  Can you just expand on that a little bit, and what you\u2019re alluding to there?

It\u2019s just early, and the results are so variable on the product mix, that it\u2019s difficult to give.   ","Nick Dell\u2019Osso","We did give a couple of specific well results in our release today, so you guys can look at that, and probably draw some conclusions from there.  There\u2019s a lot to learn about this basin still.  Our number of penetrations relative to the number of wells that we\u2019d ultimately drill is very small.  And we don\u2019t yet have the processing capacity to flow things at full rate yet, and there\u2019s just a lot to learn.  So that\u2019s the reason we\u2019re being a little bit less informative here, just because we feel like we need to learn more before we can say more.  But so far, we\u2019re very, very pleased with the play.  ","Scott Hanold \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","What if this does turn out to be a little bit gassier?  Do you see the economics of Utica being a little bit better than the Marcellus?  And would there be a lot of excess gas coming out of the basin?  And you did previously, I think, Nick, in your comments, indicate that you all are pretty bullish on gas prices.  And certainly when you step back and look at you guys locking in a lot of your hedging and your production in 2013, it kind of sends a different message.  Can you kind of square the circle around that one?  ","Nick Dell\u2019Osso","Sure, I\u2019d be happy to.  When I say we\u2019re bullish on gas prices from here, I\u2019m thinking not just about the next couple of months, and just 2013, but really thinking further out on the curve as well.  There\u2019s very little contango in the curve, and we don\u2019t think that accurately reflects the amount of development being put into natural gas today.  ","Nor does it reflect the potential increases in demand that are becoming less potential and more real around export and around other industrial uses.  Our 50% hedging program for 2013 is really about derisking our plans.  We saw some prices that were respectable within our 2013 plan.  Know that we have a plan that exceeds cash flow and want to make sure that we protect as much of that cash flow as we can.  So I don\u2019t think they\u2019re inconsistent, and just to be short term protective while still being long term bullish, I think, makes sense.  ","As far as the volumes for the Utica, Steve will probably have more color there, but it\u2019s a good basin, and when markets tell the industry to produce gas, there will be some gas that we can look to the Utica to deliver.  ","Scott Hanold \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","So then I would assume your bullishness, more on the forward-looking, on gas prices, is more of a demand-driven than a supply-driven story?  Because certainly there\u2019s ample opportunities to ramp up gas pretty quickly in several areas.   ","Nick Dell\u2019Osso","We certainly have the ability to ramp up gas when we desire.  I think ramping down and ramping up always takes a little bit longer than the financial markets would like, but we have a lot of wells you could go drill in the Haynesville that are on existing pads.  You have a lot of wells you could go drill in the Marcellus on existing pads.  And then certainly in the Barnett as well.  And many in the industry have the same dynamic.  ","So the industry can respond to demand here for a long period of time, and we\u2019ve got a lot of capacity to do that, and the Utica will be another leg to that stool.  But the industry also is doing a pretty good job of giving itself the flexibility of how to respond and when to respond to that demand by holding its acreage by production.   ","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Joe Magner with Macquarie Capital.  ","Joe Magner - Macquarie Capital","Just maybe one more attempt at Mississippi Lime.  I realize you don\u2019t want to discuss the details, but there have been some different structures talked about in the past, through this plan to pursue a lump sum JV.  And then that changed to maybe breaking it down into smaller packages.  Any direction on where you\u2019re headed with the just kind of overall concept there?  ","Nick Dell\u2019Osso","I think I\u2019m just going to say again, we don\u2019t really want to discuss a pending transaction.  But we hope to be able to discuss it in great detail with you guys soon.  ","Joe Magner - Macquarie Capital","Okay.  And then in terms of your overall position there, can you provide any breakdown between Kansas and Oklahoma?  On the acreage side as well as on the number of wells that have been drilled and the production split between the two states?  ","Nick Dell\u2019Osso","There is a map in our slide deck, so you can see the breakout, at least visually, by acreage in the play.  But you can also see that all of our rigs are in Oklahoma at the moment, as we continue to learn more about the Kansas part.  Page 28 of our investor deck.  ","Joe Magner - Macquarie Capital","And then any anticipated charges or impacts related to firm midstream transportation and processing agreements that are in place given the sale of your midstream interests?  ","Nick Dell\u2019Osso","We reiterated our guidance around gas differentials, and that takes into account the revised structure of those contracts.  Those contracts are basically similar to what we did internally.  It\u2019s basically a cost of service approach.  So we can work with [Access] to direct and tell them the capacity we need, and there\u2019s a cost of capital approach to setting the fees over time.  So we were doing that internally, and that\u2019s really how our contract has been codified with them to do it externally.  So based on those fees, we reiterated our guidance.  We had planned for that when we set this guidance up initially, and it\u2019s still the same.  ","Joe Magner - Macquarie Capital","Any insight into the search process?  Level of interest?  Or any expectations on timing of when a candidate might be identified?  ","Nick Dell\u2019Osso","No, I think I\u2019ll have to let the previous comments by the company and the board stand there for now.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research.  ","Bob Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein ","I had a question on asset sales.  What are you assuming for the timing of these dispositions in your production guidance?   ","Nick Dell\u2019Osso","They\u2019re layered in throughout the year, as we expect the sales to occur.  So they\u2019re all timed as we think the sales will occur, and the impacts will hit our financials.  ","Bob Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein ","So you\u2019re assuming half of them are done by the middle of the year?  ","Nick Dell\u2019Osso","I really don\u2019t want to get that specific this morning.  Again, we\u2019ve lined them out with the processes that we\u2019re running, some of which are underway now, some of which will be underway soon.  And that\u2019s just how we have it layered in.  And the Mississippi Lime is, of course, the nearest term, and it is forecasted into our outlook to be the nearest-term impact.  ","Bob Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein ","And of the $200 million that you\u2019ve either closed or have PSAs for, what are those?  Can you give us basins or packages that those might be?  ","Nick Dell\u2019Osso","Mostly acreage.  There\u2019s not a lot of production in that.  And it\u2019s just packages and non-core acreage.  ","Bob Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein ","Any color on which packages?  ","Nick Dell\u2019Osso","There was a little bit of DJ Basin in there, and a little bit of Marcellus and a few other things.  It\u2019s a gathering of a few different ones.  ","Bob Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein ","And on the working capital, I noticed it ticked up a bit.  What\u2019s your long term plan for that working capital going forward?  ","Nick Dell\u2019Osso","Our working capital tick up, a lot of it was driven by the fact that we used a current tax asset attribute to offset some gains from our midstream sale.  That was in excess of $600 million in the quarter.  One thing I would point you to is that our payables were down pretty materially. "," Our working capital is a microcosm of our company, as I\u2019ve noted before.  As activity levels come down, our payables will come down.  As commodity prices go up, our receivables will go up.  We do, of course, have partners in a lot of our wells, and so you have offsetting effects of as commodity prices go up, we have greater revenue payable, and as our activity levels come down, we have less receivables from partners on operating capex.  But overall, it\u2019s really actually trending in the right direction when you consider the movements for taxes, etc. ","Bob Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein ","And the Utica 5-10 Bcf equivalent, what\u2019s the well cost and lateral link stages on that sort of well?  ","Steve Dixon","Well costs have come down significantly this last year.  We\u2019re down to low to mid-$7 billion per well.  The lateral links are over 5,000.  Don\u2019t have that average with me, but they\u2019re long laterals.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Matt Portillo with Tudor, Pickering, and Holt.  ","Matt Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, and Holt","I was curious if you could provide us with your current rig count and specifically how we should think about your rig averages in the PRB, Haynesville, and Barnett for 2013?  ","Nick Dell\u2019Osso","We detail our current rig count on page eight of our slide deck, and so you can see that we have just about 82 operated rigs.  That\u2019s adjusted for Permian.  So from there, you asked about which basins again?  ","Matt Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, and Holt","The PRB, Barnett, and Haynesville.  I\u2019m just looking on slide 15.  You guys have that as about 16% of your drilling and completion capex, and I think the PRB was accelerating as of Q3.  So I\u2019m curious where the rig count is there.  And then just curious on your Haynesville and Barnett rig count.  I know you guys were at two rigs.  Is that going to pick up in the back half of this year?   ","Steve Dixon","No, we\u2019ve got both the Barnett and the Haynesville flat at two rigs, and the Powder River is at 10.  ","Matt Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, and Holt","And then just a couple of other quick questions from me.  In terms of the Eagle Ford, can you give us an update on the uncompleted well count?  ","Nick Dell\u2019Osso","We don\u2019t have that number with us this morning.  It\u2019s a very dynamic count, as we are running a number of rigs there, bringing on a lot of infrastructure every day.  But we\u2019ll continue to have a decent number of wells in inventory, in the Eagle Ford, making lumpy but good progress all year.  There will be times where we bring on a piece of infrastructure that will allow us to connect a bunch of wells at once, and so again, it\u2019s pretty lumpy, but it will be a challenge throughout this year, one which we think we have forecasted appropriately in our plan.  ","Matt Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, and Holt","And my final question, just on the spending side, could you give us any color on a specific number for your spending on OFS midstream and other for 2013?  ","Nick Dell\u2019Osso","It is down a good bit from last year.  The only growth on oilfield services that we have in this year is a couple of rigs we had ordered early last year that are being delivered.  These are really high-value rigs that are going to be used primarily in the east that are very efficient and great assets for us.  And we have our last two frack spreads that I think are both already now delivered.  So the vast majority of our COS spending is down.  It\u2019s significantly lower than last year.  ","Matt Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, and Holt","Is there any color on the magnitude of that reduction?  Is it 50%?  Is it 75%?  Is it 25%?  Just trying to get an idea of the magnitude.  ","Nick Dell\u2019Osso","More than 50%.  ","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Michael Hall with Baird.  ","Michael Hall \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Just wanted to dive in a little deeper on the Eagle Ford.  Just first on the efficiency gain, cycle time improvements you\u2019ve been seeing, just curious how much further you think you can take that.  And then what percentage of activity is currently on pads versus [unintelligible] capture in 2013 versus 2012?   ","Steve Dixon","In 2013, we are not able to do a lot of pad drilling, because we\u2019re still in HBP mode.  That will be completed really in the second half of the year.  So that will change throughout the year, so we may be as little as 15% now, to really by the end of this year, once we\u2019re complete, it will basically be at 100%.  And so we do anticipate for 2014 to have pretty significant additional improvements in our efficiency.  ","Michael Hall \u2013 Robert W. Baird","And then on the proposed acreage sales in the Eagle Ford, were there any lease-hold expiration issues that might be considered in evaluating that deal?  ","Steve Dixon","No, the core part of it can all be easily held by production.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Marshall Carver with Capital One Southcoast.  ","Marshall Carver - Capital One Southcoast","On the Utica, you talked about the 5-10 Bcf per well.  Across what percentage of your million net acres do you think you can get those recoveries?  How much has been derisked at this point?  ","Steve Dixon","Were you referring to the Total JV box, which is about 450 net?  We think there is a lot of gas, but mostly dry in the remainder of it, and so there\u2019s been very few tests in it, but our geologists think there\u2019s a significant amount of gas in place.  But would probably be on the high side of that on a Bcf basis.  ","Marshall Carver - Capital One Southcoast","On the production mix in the Utica, could you at least give us the production mix for the year-end target that you mentioned?  And is that a gross or a net number that you mentioned?  ","Steve Dixon","That is a net number.  But it\u2019s a function of wells that we get hooked up on, because there\u2019s such a variable on the mix.  But you can look at the wells in our press release and get kind of an idea from those IPs what we\u2019re seeing.  ","Nick Dell\u2019Osso","We are attempting to drill as close to infrastructure through the year as we can, and so I\u2019d like to think that the wells that we showed you there are going to be representative of at least a good bit of the wells we drill this year.  They won\u2019t be all like that, but there\u2019ll be a lot.  ","Marshall Carver - Capital One Southcoast","And do you have the expected number of wells to be put on production over the year?  ","Nick Dell\u2019Osso","Don\u2019t have that with us this morning.  ","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Joe Allman - JPMorgan.  ","Joe Allman - JPMorgan","A question on the funding gap.  So if you just look at your total spending, not just the items you give guidance for, but total spending, and you compare that to your expected cash flow, what\u2019s your estimate of the funding gap for 2013?  ","Nick Dell\u2019Osso","About $4 billion.  ","Joe Allman - JPMorgan","So then, on the low end of what you\u2019re going to sell, you\u2019ll hit your capex, and on the high end, you\u2019ll hit your capex plus you would pay down debt?  ","Nick Dell\u2019Osso","That\u2019s correct.  ","Joe Allman - JPMorgan","And is it still the company\u2019s goal to get long term debt down to $9.5 billion?  ","Nick Dell\u2019Osso","Yeah, I think we\u2019re absolutely focused on getting the company deleveraged financially, and we\u2019re very intent on getting to investment grade metrics, getting to a much stronger balance sheet.  We picked $9.5 billion a couple of years ago.  That\u2019s still a pretty good number when you look at it from an investment grade metrics standpoint.  But we\u2019re two years more now from when we set that goal and we\u2019ll always probably look at it on a pretty fluid basis.  It could ultimately go lower than that, could be a bit different.  But in general, significant deleveraging is absolutely the plan and won\u2019t change.  ","Joe Allman - JPMorgan","And the two big assets that you\u2019ve got out there, that you\u2019ve identified, are the Mississippian, which you\u2019re close to, it sounds like, and then the Eagle Ford Shale North.  Will those two get you pretty darn close to the $4 billion?  ","Nick Dell\u2019Osso","I\u2019m going to let those deals speak for themselves as they happen, but we have a number of things that we\u2019ll do this year.  ","Joe Allman - JPMorgan","Is it your goal, even though you haven\u2019t disclosed it, to sell other significant assets of the size of, say, the Mississippian or Eagle Ford Shale North, that you just simply haven\u2019t disclosed, to enable you to cover your capex plus pay down a significant portion of debt?  ","Nick Dell\u2019Osso","I think it\u2019s fair to say that some of the things we plan to sell are bigger than others, and there\u2019s, again, a number of projects that will get us to that ultimate number.  ","Joe Allman - JPMorgan","And is the goal to sell as much non-cash flow generating stuff?  Can you get there?  Or do you need to really get into some cash flow generating assets to raise the money you want to raise?  ","Nick Dell\u2019Osso","It\u2019s a balance, but of course from a strategic perspective, you always like the idea of selling assets that are not producing cash flow today, and are going to be more valuable to someone else than they are to us, which by definition would mean that they have less cash associated with them.  ","Joe Allman - JPMorgan","And what\u2019s the status of the Eagle Ford Shale North sale?  ","Nick Dell\u2019Osso","We\u2019ll be speaking to you guys about that when the time comes, and just don\u2019t really want to discuss pending transactions today.  ","Joe Allman - JPMorgan","When I look at your 2013 product guidance, in the note that you have underneath, toward the top of the guidance, now you\u2019re including about 35 Bcfe of asset sales in your current guidance.  Previous it was at 140 Bcfe.  You kept your guidance the same.  So does that mean that the non for sale production is actually lower than what you previously thought?  And if so, why would that be?  ","Jeff Mobley","The prior guidance really reflected the asset sales that we were expecting to complete in the last half of 2012, and reflected the production that those assets would have in 2013.  Specifically, the Permian Basin sale.  Our current guidance really just reflects the incremental transactions that we have for 2013.  ","Joe Allman - JPMorgan","I\u2019m not sure if I fully understand.  Is there kind of a reduction in your non for sale assets?  ","Jeff Mobley","There\u2019s no change.  It\u2019s just reflecting that we\u2019ve already closed certain transactions that were part of the production associated with our guidance.  There\u2019s no change.  ","Joe Allman - JPMorgan","Okay.  So I guess you\u2019re referring to the Permian for the most part?  ","Jeff Mobley","Yes.  ","Joe Allman - JPMorgan","So in your prior guidance, the fact that the Permian was going to be gone was already in your prior guidance, right?  Schedule B?  ","Jeff Mobley","That\u2019s correct.  ","Joe Allman - JPMorgan","So that difference between the 140 Bcfe and 35, you\u2019re saying that\u2019s Permian?  ","Jeff Mobley","Primarily. Great.  Well, I think that\u2019s about all the time that we have.  We\u2019ve gone past the top of the hour.

Good day. And welcome to the Chesapeake Energy Corporation Second Quarter 2014 Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Gary Clark. Please go ahead.","Gary Clark","Thank you, Doug. Good morning. And thank you all for joining our call today to discuss Chesapeake's financial and operational results for the 2014 second quarter. Hopefully, you've had a chance to review our press release and the updated investor presentation that we posted to our website this morning.","During this morning's call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which consist of statements that cannot to be confirmed by reference to existing information, including statements regarding our beliefs, goals, expectations, forecasts, projections and future performance, and the assumptions underlying such statements.","Please note that there are a number of factors that will cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements, including the factors identified and discussed in our earnings release today and on Pages 86 of our August 6, 2014 10-Q and in the company's other filings -- SEC filings.","Please recognize that except as required by applicable law, we undertake no duty to update any forward-looking statements, and you should not place undue reliance on such statements.","I would next like to introduce the members of management who are on the call with me today, Doug Lawler, our Chief Executive Officer; Nick Dell'Osso, our Chief Financial Officer; Chris Doyle, our Senior Vice President of Operations, Northern Division; and Jason Pigott, our Senior Vice President of Operations, Southern Division.","We will next turn to prepared commentary from Doug and Nick, and then we will move to Q&A. Doug?","Doug Lawler","Thank you, Gary, and good morning. As Gary noted, I hope you have got an opportunity to review our 2014 second quarter results they were issued earlier this morning. Chesapeake had another strong quarter of production growth and operating performance. We continue to make foundational progress on our strategies of financial discipline and profitable and efficient growth from our high-quality assets. I am very pleased with our continued improvements in operating efficiencies, measured by cycle time improvements, capital spending reductions and cash cost leadership.","Production for the second quarter averaged 695,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This represents an increase of 30% year-over-year after adjusting for asset sales. Our crude oil production was up 12%, NGL production was up 72% and natural gas production was up 7% all adjusted for asset sales. Once again we delivered a strong production growth while employing a very efficient capital expenditure program it was nearly 3% less than the year ago quarter.","I am pleased to highlighted that we are increasing the midpoint of our 2014 production growth outlook by 10,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day or about 1.5%. The production increase is a result of our focus on base production, 35% increase in planned well connections during the second half of the year, as well as anticipated transaction timing of some of our previously announced A&D activity.","Looking ahead, based on current performance and anticipated completion of new infrastructure, we are confident that our year end 2014 daily production exit rate will exceed 730,000 barrels of oil equivalent.","Turning to capital expenditures, total spending during the second quarter was $1.3 billion before capitalized interest of which approximately $1.1 billion was for drilling and completion activities, approximately $50 million was for leasehold acquisition and approximately $130 million was for other capital expenditures.","Importantly, we spent only 42% of our projected 2014 capital budget during the first half of the year and as I noted before, we expect a significant increase in well connections during the second half of 2014. Consequently, we're on track to stay well within our previously stated full year 2014 CapEx range of $5 billion to $5.4 billion before capitalized interest.","I\u2019d like to conclude with a few remarks about our two recently announced strategic transactions. First, the repurchase of all outstanding preferred shares from third-party holders of our Chesapeake Utica, L.L.C. subsidiary and second, the acreage swap with RKI in the Powder River Basin.","The purchase of the Utica preferred shares is another important step in our strategy to simplify the company's balance sheet, while reducing high cost leverage instruments. Importantly, we were able to fund the $1.26 billion repurchase price of these securities entirely through unrestricted cash on hand as of June 30th.","I am very excited about the Powder River Basin acquisition. When this transaction closes it will effectively double our average working interest in the Powder River Basin to approximate 79%, concentrating our acreage in the southern part of the play where we currently operate.","We see tremendous future stacked oil potential on this acreage in addition to our core Niobrara development. This acquisition officially leverages our overhead in geologic expertise in the Powder River Basin and we expected to substantially increase our oil gross rate, our margins and our oil mix as a percentage of total company production.","This transaction is an excellent example of the calculated strategic steps we're taking to reduce our leverage to near-term natural gas prices by deploying our capital into areas with higher margin oil.","This concludes my prepared remarks and I'll now turn it over to Nick.","Nick Dell'Osso","Thanks, Doug, and good morning. We are very proud of our operational and financial performance year-to-date, as well as the significant progress we have made towards our strategic objective of leverage reduction and balance sheet simplification.","As a reminder, we are reducing debt and commitments by over $6 billion in two years and recently further simplified our capital structure with the repurchase of the CHK Utica preferred. During the second quarter the rating agencies raise our credit rating two notches such that we are now positioned just below investment grade.","Turning to second quarter results, production growth was strong up 4% sequentially on an absolute basis versus the first quarter, while production expenses plus G&A expenses were down sequentially coming in at 589 per Boe in Q2 compared to 603 per Boe in Q1.","Chesapeake reported adjusted earnings of $0.36 per share in the second quarter with adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1.3 billion. The primary driver of our sequential decreases in quarterly earnings and EBITDA with lower commodity price realizations specifically for natural gas, which we previously discussed in our press release dated July 29th.","I\u2019d like to take a few minutes to talk about our natural gas price realizations during the quarter and our expected -- expectations for the remainder of the year. I will also discuss some of the changes to our 2014 outlook.","As previously announced on a company-wide basis, our natural gas price differential increased to a $1.91 per Mcf during the second quarter, which was up from a $1.08 per Mcf in the first quarter.","Chesapeake\u2019s differentials consisted two key components, basis, which is the discount to Henry Hub pricing that reflects various physical sales points at which Chesapeake sales its gas and non-basis, which includes gathering, transportation, processing and other marketing costs.","I will note that many of our peers report the non-basis component as a separate expense line item on their income statement, whereas Chesapeake reports non-basis as a deduct to his realized pricing. This can make it more difficult to direct comparisons with our peers.","During the second quarter Chesapeake non-basis gas price differential was $1.30 per Mcf, a moderate increase from our first quarter non-basis differential of $1.19 per Mcf due to the mix shift towards some higher cost production areas.","The basis component of our differential was the key delta between the two quarters and primarily reflects a large seasonal demand and pricing swing from a very cold winter to a very mild spring in early summer.","For example, in the first quarter Chesapeake corporate basis differential was a positive $0.11 per Mcf to Henry Hub. In the second quarter basis widened to a negative $0.61 per Mcf.","As noted in our press release last week, the Marcellus region where there is an oversupply of gas and insufficient demand in the non-winter months accounted for the majority of the basis widened during the second quarter. The basis differentials in the Marcellus have generally deteriorated during the month of July.","Looking ahead, we expect them to remain weak for the remainder of the third quarter before improving in the fourth quarter a seasonal weather demand should begin to take hold.","As a result, we have increased our company-wide natural gas price differential outlook to $2.10 per Mcf implied midpoint for the second half of 2014, of which an estimated $0.20 per Mcf can be attributed to our expected minimum volume commitment short-fall payment during the fourth quarter, which is consistent with our previous guidance on this expected expense.","When average with first half actuals, this increase yields our new full year 2014 gas differential outlook of $1.75 to $1.85 per Mcf, which is up $0.15 per Mcf from our outlook.","Looking forward to 2015, we expect basis particularly in the Northeast to remain challenged but we expect our non-basis which again is primarily gathering, transportation and processing costs to improve as our less mature plays see increased gas production, particularly the Eagle Ford and Utica.","Please also note that we're increasing our projected 2014 full year oil price differential range by $1.75 per barrel, which reflects the compression in the LLS\/WTI spread, along with lower realized pricing for our Utica and Southern Marcellus condensate.","We're currently working on stabilization in alternate customer solutions for our Utica and Southern Marcellus condensate, which may create an opportunity to improve our differentials overtime.","For NGLs we are increasing our projected 2014 price differential to Nymex by $4.50 per barrel, which primarily reflects the weaker overall NGL prices we experienced during the second quarter, driven by weakness in ethane prices and lower seasonal demand for propane and butane.","Overall, ethane also represented a higher percentage of our NGL barrel in certain key region like the Utica and Southern Marcellus, which pressured our average price realization per barrel.","One final point in our outlook, please note that we are no longer providing forward guidance for oil field service net margin given that the spinoff of this business into publicly traded entity Seventy Seven Energy became effective June 30th.","I\u2019d like to conclude by addressing our funding plans for the RKI acreage swap and the Utica preferred share repurchase that we announced last week. The cost to fund these transactions totaled $1.7 billion.","As of June 30th, we had approximate $1.46 billion of unrestricted cash on hand and pro forma for expected non-core asset sales proceeds of approximately $700 million during the second half of 2014.","Our cash balance is expected to exceed $450 million after funding the RKI acreage swap and the Chesapeake Utica preferred share repurchase. I am very pleased that we have the ability using our existing capital resources to pursue this type of accretive high value transaction that will materially improve our net asset value.","Please see a reconciliation of our pro forma cash movements on slide six of the presentation we published on chk.com this morning in conjunction with earnings release.","That concludes my remarks and now I\u2019ll turn it back over to Doug before we begin the Q&A.","Doug Lawler","Thanks, Nick. I just like to reiterate the Chesapeake is standing strong on four pillars today. We are growing production at a double-digit annual rate, we are demonstrating excellent capital efficiency and cost leadership, we are reducing our financial complexity and we are laser focused on creating shareholder value through a variety of strategic initiatives.","Chesapeake is a growth company. We have the strategy, high quality assets and talented employees to deliver growth quarter-after-quarter. We are still targeting non-core divestures in 2014 and also evaluating other value creation opportunities within our portfolio.","We will continue to look for these value creation opportunities such as the Powder River Basin acquisition, where we can focus our expertise and talent on further growth for our shareholders.","We\u2019ll now open the call up for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And we will take our first question from David Tameron with Wells Fargo.","David Tameron - Wells Fargo","Hi. Good morning, Doug.","Doug Lawler","Good morning, Dave.","David Tameron - Wells Fargo","Let me jump in the detail. Utica, with Kensington plant coming on, I mean, you have 200 -- I think the number you put in press release, 210 wells, that are waiting on completion. Does that -- can you just talk about the infrastructure out there and obviously, the Kensington plant helps, but how quickly can you get down that backlog, how should we think about that over the next six months?","Doug Lawler","Yeah. Sure, Dave. Chris Doyle will have some additional comments on it. But as we look towards the year end we expect that inventory to continue to reduce as we build into the capacity we have available. Chris, do you want to provided any color?","Chris Doyle","Yeah. Sure. Hey, Dave, this is Chris Doyle. As you mentioned, Kensington 3 did come online as scheduled, actually a couple weeks ahead. It allowed us to ramp beginning at July and into this month. We've got one additional, as we laid out, actually a couple of additional projects coming online in the fourth quarter. Expansion of the Cardinal system with compression and then additional processing capacity at UEO Haynesville and that will get us to that target about 100,000 net barrels of production by the end of the year as we laid out at Analyst Day.","As you correctly said, our beginning inventory this year is about 200 wells. By the end we see that around 150 to 160. The additional capacity will obviously allow us to bring those wells on throughout the remainder of this year. And I\u2019ll also point out we probably have about 50 million a day of gas behind shale currently, it\u2019s down a little bit from what we have talked about previously and Kensington 3 big part of giving that gas online.","David Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities","Okay. That's helpful. And then just one more before I let somebody else jump on. If I just think about the Utica, I know you guys covered this at Analyst Day? But you are drilling a couple tests, I guess, you are drilling at Wetzel County, you're drilling the drygas test and then you're messing around with the oil window? Doug, can you remind me like what's your snapshot or whoever, or Chris, can you remind me of where you think this play heads over the next six months, I mean, obviously the drygas is attractive but can you just give me your snapshot?","Doug Lawler","Let me start with oil test, the oil window. We brought online the well we mentioned it at Analyst Day is called Parker well. Brought it online this quarter, last quarter I should say, it\u2019s been on production for a couple of months. We continue to be encouraged with what we are seeing. It\u2019s a highest IP that we have seen to-date.","We saw an area that we were expecting about zero or very marginal return on investments is now in mid-20s and pushing higher, plan is we will continue to delineate that area, which I characterize be about 80,000 or 100,000 net acres to Chesapeake continued to delineate that over the next six months with probably two to four wells, some of those in moderate risk areas and continues to push out into what we currently characterize as higher risk as we continue to derisk this part of the play.","The idea that we can take a forgotten part of the Utica and drive value for this company is really exciting for me. I\u2019ll reiterate what I said at the Analyst Day the only company that can do that has to have cost leadership, has to demonstrate cost leadership and I stand behind what I think is the strongest operations team in the basin, really excited about what we are seeing there. And generally that would be a little bit slower build just because of the infrastructure but continue to like what we see.","On the drygas Utica test that's the messenger well in Wetzel County, West Virginia. It will be completed later this month. Startup 6,-foot lateral, obviously we push the timing of that well back a couple weeks to give us additional capacity to flow the higher rates than we initially planned. And the reason for that what we saw in the pilot hole, what we saw in the logs and what we experienced during drilling. We are very excited to get this well online and continued to be very encouraged that the drygas play does not stop at the river.","David Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities","Okay. And just to clarify, you mentioned the oil test, you said that the well you're referencing when you said 20% rates of return and headed higher?","Doug Lawler","Yes.","David Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities","Okay. All right.","Doug Lawler","And there is as we\u2019ve done and continue to do throughout the company is we are going to push laterals longer, we are going to optimize completions and drive returns higher.","David Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities","Okay. Sounds good. Thanks.","Doug Lawler","Thanks, David.","Operator","And our nest question is from Mike Kelly with Global Hunter Securities.","Mike Kelly - Global Hunter Securities","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Doug Lawler","Hi, Mike. Good morning.","Nick Dell'Osso","Good morning, Mike.","Mike Kelly - Global Hunter Securities","Got two questions for you, one on the PRB and one on Southwest Marcellus. In the PRB, just hoping you could give a little bit more color on the stack pay potential here? And really if you could define the opportunity set there and compare the potential IRR prospects there versus the 40% you've laid out for the Niobrara to-date?","Doug Lawler","Mike, this is -- thanks for question. This transactions up there really to me is an example of the whole company of all our assets of the exciting things going on and the of return opportunities where we are just driving additional value, seeing lower cycle times, seeing reductions in our cost and better return for our shareholders. It\u2019s a really, really exciting incremental opportunities for us and I am going to ask, Chris, to just kind of run through a little bit more of that detail for you.","Chris Doyle","Yeah. Mike, as you know we have been very open about how excited we have been about the Powder River Basin assets that we have, especially on the sub-surface but honestly we had work to do. The first issue that we had to address was one of materiality, transitions we laid out last week, doubles our exposure to what, Doug, characterize is multiple stack pays, what I\u2019ll tell you is, it\u2019s the single largest concentration of stack pay potentials that we see in the basin.","What we saw is little over a billion barrels of potentially recovery resource is now over 2 and that\u2019s really being driven by a number things. One is the continued successful delineation of Sussex. As we laid out in those materials we have a play that stretches about 20 miles north to south that we fully delineated north to south with the most recent Sussex test. We are going back to work drilling longer laterals, currently drilling a 9,000-foot lateral in the Sussex and driving returns there. That Sussex 1 well is at Hoss the 9,000-foot lateral, 90,000-foot lateral is adjacent to it.","So we are really excited about the Sussex. We continue to be excited about the Parkman and what I\u2019ll point you to is what we look at, what John Kapchinske and his team is pushing towards the end of the year for additional Parkman test, Teapot test and Shannon test.","I think the true story here, though is excited as we get on the Upper Cretaceous and some of the other potential out there is what is happen with the Niobrara. And course of a year a teams saw their rig count drop from 10 rigs to three had essentially rethink absolutely everything they were doing and all they\u2019ve done in the first half is out execute any expectation I had them.","They have delivered what was a 40 days spudder rig release well now in the Niobrara is 26 and added a 1000-foot lateral link. That\u2019s a 35% reduction in cycle time and a 17% increases in lateral link. And that\u2019s allowed us as a team to re-establish, this asset is a really important part of our portfolio going forward. I couldn\u2019t be more excited about what they\u2019ve done and excited to see what they will do in the next six months.","Mike Kelly - Global Hunter Securities","Great. Thanks, Chris. And maybe I\u2019ll ask you as well just over to the Southwest Marcellus. Could you refresh me on the takeaway capacity there to get gas out of that portion of the basin and then what the prices, what do you expect in terms of realization up there and then really for you, Doug, just kind of being blunt here why or why not spin this asset out eventually?","Doug Lawler","Yeah. We talk about our takeaway in that area, that\u2019s one thing that we look at is, is not only just our gas takeaway but also our ATEX commitment and ethane takeaway. We feel good of what we have established and our ability to execute on that asset as we continue to expand capacity.","When we think about spinning this asset out and talk about it internally what we see is, is an asset that has really strong return but honestly, does not quite yet compete within our portfolio which is more testament to shrink the remainder of our portfolio than it is the underlying assets.","It\u2019s an asset that we look at every quarter and continually outperforms our expectations both in terms of reserve and well delivery, and just a phenomenal asset and we -- I get excited when thinking about putting that asset out on its own being able to fund its own growth especially capacity increases, what it could do and putting that team in competition with some of the other players in the area.","Mike Kelly - Global Hunter Securities","All right. Thanks guys.","Operator","And our next question is from David Heikkinen with Heikkinen Energy.","David Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy","Good morning. Just a quick follow-up on a Powder River. You\u2019ll talked about well cost of $8.9 million at the Analyst Day and roughly 30%, 40% rates of return and had these improvements? With the longer laterals and the shorter days, what do you see those returns more specifically?","Nick Dell'Osso","So, we laid our in the materials last week and I think again today is very clearly where we see our 2014 program averaging about 5,800-foot lateral going into the year that\u2019s a $8.9 million. So cycle time improvements get those returns back up over 20%, extending our lateral link where we see in the second half of this year about 6,800-foot laterals will increase capital little bit but drive returns over 30% and then as we\u2019ve done in multiple plays reinvesting those capital savings into enhanced completions will drive our returns to 40% we see we get there fairly quickly.","David Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy","Okay. And then just on the overall corporate cash flow guidance with the higher differential you brought that cash flow for \u201814 down and Nick, you talked about \u201915? As you think about the CapEx of $5 to $5.4, that includes the acquisitions, just wanted to be clear on that?","Nick Dell'Osso","No. $5 to $5.4 would not include the amount\u2026","David Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy","Okay.","Nick Dell'Osso","\u2026 we plan to use to complete the RKI exchange?","David Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy","Okay. And so\u2026","Nick Dell'Osso","Nor is it offset by asset sales either, Dave.","David Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy","Right. But so on apples-to-apples basis you bought about 4,500 barrels a day and you are now growing 5,500 barrels equivalent a day more than what you expected previously, is that a fair number?","Nick Dell'Osso","Yeah. Just the 4,500 barrels a day\u2026","David Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy","I guess, it\u2019s only for the last couple of months.","Nick Dell'Osso","Yeah. Just for the last couple of months of the year, it\u2019s not even for the full second half.","David Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy","And then as go through cash flow and CapEx balance, looking at the next three-year plan? How does that flow given what you just talk about from a differential headwind?","Nick Dell'Osso","Well, we go through a pretty competitive capital allocation process every year and we are in the middle of that right now for 2015 looking at where the best investments can be made to maximize return for shareholders. And so we take into account all those things and as Chris noted in his Analyst Day presentation, an asset like the Marcellus North, which has the ability to produce incredible returns might stay flat for a period of time and be a cash flow -- free cash flow generator given the pricing dynamics we expect we will face coming into next year.","Now, that being said, we look at opportunities all the time to try and improve those things and each team feels the pressure of wanting to have more capital and fights to find ways to increase the expected return.","So it's a constantly evolving analysis as we think about that. But we feel very confident in our ability to continue to invest at this level and continue to achieve these growth rates. One of the things that, Doug, about at the beginning just before Q&A are the things on which this company is focused and a pricing differentials in the short-term around a cool summer and waiting some long-haul takeaway in the northeast don\u2019t impact the way we think about those targets and our ability to achieve them.","Doug Lawler","I think just adding to that, the idea of the competitive nature of capital allocation. You think about it a year ago we probably couldn\u2019t run away from out of there fast enough. These are wells that we were excited about but generally weren\u2019t making money and now when we look ahead to next year we probably can\u2019t put enough capital there.","David Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy","Yeah.","Doug Lawler","So this is a process that drives competition among teams is very, very healthy for the company and for our shareholders.","David Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy","I think that the oil acquisition makes a lot of sense. How many more of those type of in that size acquisitions, do you think you can do as you look at the next couple of years?","Doug Lawler","Well, we\u2019ll be very focused on it, David.","Chris Doyle","As I noted in the prepared comments, we are presently evaluating a number of strategic initiatives, some of which we\u2019ve discussed and some we\u2019re working on that are in early stages. And the key for us going forward is that we execute on this financial discipline and look for differential ways to add value to our shareholders.","So I think it\u2019s important to note that why we\u2019re not providing any color on it. So any specifics of any other transaction today that the company is looking at other opportunities and we\u2019ll continue to look for other opportunities, where we can enhance those returns and get away from some of those high differentials volatility that we see around gas market and continue to grow the company.","Doug Lawler","And Dave, I\u2019ll just jump back in here and at the risk of restating the obvious, the financial position the company finds itself in today where we can effectively struck a chat for that acquisition gets us pretty excited about looking at other opportunities. We certainly are in a place now where we can think about our portfolio in the right way.","There is other things in our portfolio that need to be managed. And we talked about some of those things. We haven\u2019t highlighted all of them. But there's lot of portfolio optimization to do and in doing that it left us very flexible to go out and seek new opportunities. So we feel really good about where we stand in our ability to go out and execute on opportunities that that we seek or they present themselves to us.","David Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy","Yes, increase, nets anywhere you can guys. That\u2019s a good deal. All right. Thanks guys.","Doug Lawler","Okay.","Operator","Our next question is from Neal Dingmann with SunTrust.","Neal Dingmann - SunTrust","Good morning guys. Doug, my first question really just to stay on our differentials a little bit, I\u2019m just wondering if you and Nick can, I guess, either operationally or financially are you trying to manage this around, obviously, the current weak NGL and natural gas prices in near term, maybe prove to have some new rig locations or if Nick is looking at hedges or is it just something you think kind of temporary we just have the ebb and flow of the seasons, kind of, return as we normally do in the winter?","Nick Dell'Osso","Sure. Great question, Neal. I think it\u2019s really good to highlight based on your question the fact that we built considerable flexibility into our program, reacting to current market conditions and providing competitive metrics versus our peers is what our focus is all about. And as we\u2019ve said a number of times, how we highlight or how we grow value for our shareholders, based on that flexibility we built into our capital programs.","So when you look at the present dynamic that\u2019s taken place, we anticipate that we'll see an improved realizations as we go into the winter. But the key for us really, Neal, is we\u2019re not running the company based on any particular forecast on gas or oil prices. We\u2019re going to run this company on good prudent operations and sound financial discipline and that nuts and bolts approach with the quality of our assets and the talent of our employees will pay off large shareholders as we pursue this low-cost leadership and greater capital efficiency.","So yes we will look at the opportunities for hedging to protect our cash flows, not on speculative basis but on capital preservation or capital -- ensure our capital program can be executed upon to provide that growth in competitive metrics. But we have to be competitive regardless of what the gas prices are and that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re going to do.","Neal Dingmann - SunTrust","That makes a lot of sense. And then building on that -- and just looking obviously at your slide, it\u2019s pretty clear that you guys have some of the dominant acreage positions by looking at Eagle Ford and around some of the Utica. So my question around this is, are you continuing to sort of, do some trades, blocking this up, you certainly have cut, obviously just what you're spending in leases overall. But is there still a bunch of this going on or how do you kind of look at that on the acreage side?","Nick Dell'Osso","I think there's significant opportunities for coring up in our high quality assets in the areas that we see future growth from. And when I say coring up, that may be increasing our net interest. It might be bolt-on acquisitions. It might be infill acreage in the areas that we see to have the greatest potential and opportunities. So I think you can expect to see a continued focus on that for the company.","Neal Dingmann - SunTrust","Okay. And then just last one, just looking at dialing into the Utica, probably a question for Chris, just looking at slides 20 and 21. I know as you all mentioned on -- at the Analyst Day talking about being the most efficient and you guys do a good job of showing kind of what you\u2019re spending per lateral foot. But maybe just walk me through on slide 20, I know you have brought out now on this slide a number of your -- and some of your newer dry gas wells. And obviously the headlines we hear are from some of the peers a little bit further south, some of these big number.","So Chris, I guess, what I\u2019m looking at just maybe, how you\u2019re looking at that, how much lower I know like some of those in the south, I think are costing $10 million or $12 million per well. So I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of how much yours are costing if they\u2019re, obviously, coming a little bit less. How much less is the cost behind those?","Chris Doyle","That\u2019s a good question, Neal. I wouldn't say that we have a large enough sample set when we look at our position to dry gas Utica in West Virginia to give you an affirmative answer. All I can tell you is that while we have established ourselves as cost leaders in the rest of Utica play, I\u2019m very confident that we\u2019ll continue to do that in West Virginia.","Obviously, these wells are going to be more expensive as they are a little bit deeper. Some may improve requiring an additional casing string and that\u2019s fine. But I\u2019ll put my chips behind, again, what I think is a really, really strong operation state.","We try to highlight on slide 20 some of those $30 million a day IP. It\u2019s really just to get a sense of what we\u2019re expecting as we cross the river in West Virginia. And just to reiterate what I mentioned earlier in the call, we\u2019re very excited about what we saw in the Wetzel County messenger well and really excited to get that online and excited to, to further delineate as we approach the end of the year up into the Panhandle and really unlock significant value for our shareholders with dry gas test in West Virginia.","Neal Dingmann - SunTrust","Chris, are you drilling -- and then lastly, are you drilling anything even further south than Wetzel anytime soon?","Chris Doyle","I have to check, get back with you on that Neal. I don\u2019t believe so. When we look at, ultimately we will but when we look at where we\u2019re focusing, it\u2019s probably Wetzel Count, north into the Panhandle, just where the concentration of our acreage is. But we will definitely continue to push not only a little bit south but also further east.","Neal Dingmann - SunTrust","Makes a lot of sense. Thank you.","Chris Doyle","Our next question is from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.","Charles Meade - Johnson Rice","Good morning to everyone. I could ask a question about the northern Marcellus. You guys have a slide in your presentation you put out today. Talks about the new completion sign and it looks like it\u2019s pretty attractive nonexistent decline. I wonder if you could talk about what you are doing differently and maybe where you're doing that. And if that\u2019s perhaps a function of where geographically it is, like, I know that Wyoming County is relatively untested but highly prospective and just give us a sense of how applicable across the whole position this kind of completion might be?","Chris Doyle","Charles, this is Chris Doyle. It\u2019s very applicable across the entire position, not just in Marcellus but we see it across the entire north and southern division of entire company. What we\u2019re doing here is optimizing value equation. What that means to the northern Marcellus and the slide that you are pointing to is additional sand being comped, stage facing being contracted, pumping more efficient completion design. And it cost us about an initial $1 million but results in over a Bcf of incremental production as this example alludes to, in the first year.","The key point of this slide is that these two wells are in the same exact area. This is not a difference of being in the core area versus a non-core area. These are two core wells in the same exact area. The only difference is really the completion. And so we get really excited as I'm sure you would be seeing the results here. We\u2019ll continue to push more and more sand tighter spacing not only here but in other assets as well.","In the Northern Marcellus, what that has allowed us to do is keep production flat and we\u2019re running four rigs right now. And I would say going into the year we would've projected probably running about six or seven but the completion optimization of the capital efficiency gains that we\u2019ve seen in the first half of the year, it gives clarity to reduce rig count there. And so we\u2019re excited about that.","Charles Meade - Johnson Rice","Got it, Chris. That\u2019s good detail. And just to clarify that, so these wells are both producing against the same kind of gathering pressure with the same sort of compression and all that other stuff?","Chris Doyle","Same system, same area.","Charles Meade - Johnson Rice","Got it, thank you. And then transition over to be Powder River Basin. I know going back 18 or 18-plus months ago, one of the big constraints was takeaway. I guess it\u2019s processing but also just oil takeaway. And I know that you guys said that you got this, you expect a gas processing plan to come on in Q4, that\u2019s going to give you guys a boost there. But can you talk more generally about what other above-ground bottleneck you might be dealing with there whether it\u2019s on the processing or permitting side?","Chris Doyle","Sure. Our biggest constraint right now is gas processing as you allude to. And Buckinghorse coming on at the end of the year is going to open that up, that\u2019s $120 million a day that we anticipate being on line at the end of the year. I continue to be excited as we see that capacity expand. We will build into that capacity and probably hit capacity at Buckinghorse in the first, early second quarter of 2015 and then continue to grow into tallgrass capacity we currently have.","That\u2019s our biggest surface production constraint. You alluded to permitting and got a lot of questions about how quickly can you ramp up with permitting issues in Wyoming. I can tell you this company and his team has a lot of history dealing with a longer protracted permitting timing and it\u2019s up there, we work into our plans.","And so you won't see us go to 30 rigs next month. What you\u2019ll see is a nice steady build towards the end of the year and into 2015 as we fill up capacity and get that permit machine go on. So those are -- you hit on, I would say two above-ground pressure points that we\u2019re attacking aggressively all over.","Charles Meade - Johnson Rice","Great. Thanks for the detail.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) And our next question comes from Jason Wangler with Wunderlich Securities.","Jason Wangler - Wunderlich Securities","Good morning, guys. Up in the Utica or even Southwest Marcellus, is there an ability to kind of try and get some of that gas out of the basin? I know some other operators are starting to look at pushing it to Midcon or Gulf Coast, just your thoughts around that opportunity, if there is any?","Doug Lawler","Yes. So we are looking at some of those opportunities. We\u2019ve had a number of good conversations with the takeaway partners, looking at building new project out of basin and those are all pretty active discussions. So I\u2019ll kind of leave it at just saying that we\u2019re looking at ways to further increase our takeaway in other parts of the country.","Jason Wangler - Wunderlich Securities","Okay. And then, just curious on the Utica as you\u2019re looking at kind of the reemergence of the different windows if you will. You\u2019ve got eight rigs up there now. How do you see that rig count as far as just within that. Is that mostly just in the condensate or wet gas area and then anything in the dry gas or even oil would be incremental at least in the near term or maybe even in the \u201815?","Doug Lawler","I think that\u2019s a fair way to look at it. As we look at the pace of our drilling activity up there, one thing that\u2019s just absolutely critical to their company as we\u2019re not going to part capital on the ground and not get a cash on cash return as quick as possible. So strategically, as we look at our capital allocation with the areas where we can ramp up rigs and be flexible on our program and capture the greatest returns.","It is where we\u2019re going to be focused versus parking capital on the ground and waiting for infrastructure in six months or a year or longer to allow us to sell our product. So as we look at -- we\u2019ll be continuing to drill in the gas windows and doing some of our limited testing to prove up the other areas. And as Nick noted looking for opportunities to secure addition takeaway, as we see the economic support.","Chris Doyle","The only think I would add there, this is Chris Doyle, is we will be seven to nine rigs next year. But in a fact, what we\u2019ll be doing is adding more wells because of continued cycle time reductions. Point two, what they've been able to accomplish in the Utica, but also at North, this is an area that we had drilled going into this year 800 wells and year-to-date we\u2019ve seen a 20% reduction in cycle times.","What that means is I can peel a rig back and effectively have not lost any delivery of this asset. And so, we\u2019ll think more in terms of well delivery than we will rigs. And it\u2019s one of the great value drivers for this company as we continue to see the cycle times coming down.","Jason Wangler - Wunderlich Securities","I appreciate you guys. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Matt Portillo with Tudor, Pickering, Holt.","Matt Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt","Good morning, guys.","Doug Lawler","Hey, Matt.","Matt Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt","Just two quick questions for me. I wanted to ask first on the completion side, particularly in the Eagle Ford, I was wondering if you could provide maybe a little bit of color on kind of where you are in completion optimization, and how you think about, I guess, industry moving towards bigger profit, longer laterals and tighter stages, and the opportunity set you guys see on your Eagle Ford assets.","Jason Pigott","This is Jason. We are looking at that with all across the company and we\u2019ve got a completions team that spun off as part of our transformation initiative. We\u2019re looking at it. They\u2019ve got 50 initiatives as far as completions going on across the company. We\u2019re very excited about it. So all the things that you mentioned, we\u2019re in the process of testing right now.","We\u2019ve really seen some cost leadership from that team. They\u2019ve been able to drive costs down in every single asset that we operate with the Eagle Ford being no exception. At our Analyst Day, we highlighted $6.4 million. Wells were our year-end target, but they\u2019re already achieving that today. So we\u2019re very excited of the progress we\u2019re going to make. Another big change for us as we\u2019ve transition to some of these interventionalists completions.","These are sliding sleeves, dissolvable plug systems that we've tested in the Haynesville successfully, We\u2019re going to be moving those to the Eagle Ford. Those systems are safer, faster and cheaper for us. We\u2019re very excited to tell you about the results in the Eagle Ford as we progress those systems moving forward. We\u2019ve also tried similar to they have in the North.","We have been very successful tighter per cluster spacing test, more sand. Some of our cost savings have come from reducing the amount of gel and being able to get same profit concentrations away with water .So really expecting to make some big moves on our completion costs side and the Eagle Ford going forward. We\u2019re also going to be testing some 330 foot spacing test out there. Those will be going down in the third and fourth quarter. That can hopefully optimize the ultimate recovery from our asset in the future spell, so lots of great things going on in the Eagle Ford overall.","Matt Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt","Great. And I guess, just specifically to the Eagle Ford, we've seen recently, particularly in an area where you guys are developing pretty significant increases in the amount of sand content in the well, is that something you guys are testing at the moment? And is there any context you could just provide as to kind of where you are today on a profit per foot or profit per stage perspective, and maybe where that could trend to?","Doug Lawler","I do not have the pounds per foot with me right now, but I guess -- its something that as you go to these increased density clusters, we\u2019re not diluting our sand over that interval. So every -- by testing tighter intervals, we by default pump more sand and more fluid into the well. So we\u2019re testing up to 20% to 50% increases in some of our sand out there. It\u2019s really just looking at and maximizing the MPV of these test cost you more money, so do you get incremental EUR from them.","Those are the things we\u2019re looking at. And they just take time to really see the impact in EUR. But we have observed some of our offset operators are pumping more sand out there but we\u2019ve got a system that works for us. We\u2019re just looking to tweak in.","Matt Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt","Great. Last question for me, just on the completion front you mentioned accelerating completions into the back half of \u201814 by 35%, or wells on line. Could you give us some context of where those will primarily be? Is that primarily in the Utica and the Eagle Ford or just any incremental color, you could provide on those completion accelerations?","Doug Lawler","Sure. Matt, that\u2019s principally the main areas. Utica is a big component of it, Eagle Ford as well. But really across the whole portfolio, our focus and drive towards capturing greater value, it\u2019s just consistent with all of our planning.","Chris Doyle","Already I\u2019d mentioned is the Powder where we strategically deferred some completion in the first half of the year because of weather and because of capacity constraints. We are back at it right now and completing wells and accelerating completions in the second half of this year as we get ready for Buckinghorse at the end of this year.","Matt Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question is from Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Good morning, everybody. I apologize, I was a little late jumping on the call, Doug, so maybe I missed a couple of these things. My question is, kind of, on the portfolio simplification, to kick us off here. The asset sales that you've announced on the outlay, I guess, of the Utica preferred, kind of, balance, I guess, if you add it up.","And I'm just kind of wondering, is that how we should think about this simplification effort going forward that's going to be self funding, if you like? And what kind of -- where would you say we are in that process in terms of getting where you want the portfolio to be and I've got a follow-up, please.","Doug Lawler","Sure. It\u2019s a good question. So we\u2019ve covered a lot of ground in the past 18 months. And as Nick noted, we\u2019ve had a significant number of asset sales or non-core divestitures. And as we look forward into the remainder of 2014, I see a number of other opportunities. It will be looking to execute upon and there will be some in 2015 as well.","And the key there is really that we\u2019re going to continue to mold and shape and optimize this portfolio around what I consider to be some of the absolute highest quality assets in the United States. And as we look for core-up opportunities or divesting of non-core affiliates or things that we\u2019re not getting competitive returns on, you could absolutely expect to see more of it. And we've got other things that we\u2019re presently are evaluating in looking at for 2014.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","As part of that process, Doug, I know it's a long time ago since we talked about debt targets, but are you comfortable with the balance sheet as of now, or do you see any urgency in bringing that down? I'm not so much thinking about the credit issues and so on. I'm thinking more just about the interest rate burden that you have relative to the rest of the operating cash flow generally. So what's the priority for trying to bring the debt down?","Doug Lawler","Yeah. So Doug you know that I\u2019m a huge capital efficiency guy. And you know that I'm a huge cash cost leadership guy. And part of that whole cash situation with the balance sheet where we have obligations that consumer cash flow or consume cash. We are focused on continuing to improve. And when you look at the portfolio, when you look at our product mix, I'm not happy with where we are. And we\u2019re going to continue to make improvements into it.","As you noted, it\u2019s not specifically that we are targeting investment grade. Investment grade is a byproduct of running our business right. And so we expect to reach investment grade because we\u2019re going to clean up the excessive debt that can be a burden on our capital program in higher price environment or low price environments. ","But the financial stability of the company as Nick had noted, this is -- we're in a position today of really a very good strength. And it creates optionality for when we can either pay off debt, payoff of other obligations, and continue to mold and improve the portfolio to capture the greatest value we can from these high quality assets.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Appreciate the answer, Doug. My last one is hopefully a very quick one. Over the course of the last year, I guess, and particularly the last six months, we've seen a number of your competitors talk about signing long-term gas contracts or at least signing up for that. The most recent one, which was a little bit of a surprise, was Southwestern in the Fayetteville. They didn't disclose details but they did say they had signed a contract for LNG. So where are you guys in that? And obviously how would it impact your Haynesville, assuming the back end of the curve did come up in this one for that? And I will leave it there. Thanks.","Doug Lawler","Yeah. So, that\u2019s a good question as well. I think, if I were a purchaser of LNG, I\u2019d want to go to the company that had the best assets in the country and that\u2019s Chesapeake. And so for long-term deliverability and capturing the greatest price opportunity for our gas, we will continue to look at opportunities to secure LNG contracts at pricing that we would consider to be favorable.","And we\u2019ve not signed anything yet but we have had a number of discussions. And we\u2019ll continue to discuss with those purchasers that offtake capacity from the new liquefaction facilities being built on the Gulf Coast. And there's a direct line of site to the Haynesville and part of the reason we went into the Haynesville is we believed -- went back to the Haynesville rather as we believe that huge value in that asset have been captured in applying the teams the way they\u2019re reducing cost and adding value there as significant.","And there was a second part of that that we also believe that the competitiveness of the asset would be a fantastic source for LNG purchasers if we could be more competitive. So we\u2019re recognizing that and seeing outstanding result in the Haynesville. Our team is doing a fantastic job and we\u2019re in great position to move forward, provided we capture the value from an LNG contract or any other sales contract that we might pursue.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Appreciate it, Doug. Thank you.","Doug Lawler","Thank you.","Operator","And that concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session. At this time, I will turn the conference back to our speakers for any additional remarks.","Doug Lawler","Thank you very much. We appreciate everyone\u2019s time. Just to encourage if there is subsequent follow-up questions, please contact Gary. And what you are going to expect with the company like Chesapeake, it will continue to drive towards greater value. And just want to reiterate one more time the year-end exit growth rate of 730,000 barrels equivalent per day is a very realistic expectation for us. We\u2019re really excited about our programs. So thanks everyone.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation."],"5149":["Chesapeake Energy Corp.

Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Brad Sylvester. Please go ahead.","Bradley D. Sylvester - Vice President-Investor Relations & Communications","Thank you and good morning, and thank you for joining our call today to discuss Chesapeake's financial and operational results for the 2016 first quarter. Hopefully you've had a chance to review our press release and the updated slides that we posted to our website this morning.","During this morning's call we will be making forward-looking statements, which consist of statements that cannot be confirmed by reference to existing information, including statements regarding our beliefs, goals, expectations, forecasts and projections and future performance and the assumptions underlying such statements.","Please note that there are a number of factors that will cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements, including the factors identified and discussed in our earnings release today and in other SEC filings. Please note that except as required by applicable law we undertake no duty to update any forward-looking statements and you should not place undue reliance on such statements.","With me this morning on the call are Doug Lawler, our Chief Executive Officer; Nick Dell'Osso, our Chief Financial Officer; Jason Pigott, our Executive Vice President over the Southern Division; and Frank Patterson, our Executive Vice President of Exploration in the Northern Division.","Doug will begin the call and then turn the call over to Nick for a review of our financial results before we turn the teleconference over for Q&A.","So with that, thank you. And I now turn the teleconference over to Doug.","Robert Douglas Lawler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Brad, and good morning, everyone. I trust everyone's had an opportunity to review our press release from this morning. We continue to make solid progress in reducing our cost, strengthening our balance sheet and optimizing our portfolio. Starting with the portfolio, year-to-date we've closed or have under signed purchase and sale agreements approximately $1.2 billion of gross sales proceeds. This is up approximately $500 million from our earnings call in February.","As previously discussed, certain of these transactions are contingent upon the repurchase of VPPs. So net proceeds from these property sales will be approximately $950 million. On the February earnings call, we guided to an additional $500 million to $1 billion in gross proceeds by year-end 2016. With our announcement this morning, we have already achieved the lower end of that range.","In February we stated that the closed sales and signed purchase and sale agreements targeted smaller, non-core, non-operated properties. As noted in today's press release, we're divesting to Newfield Exploration a portion of our STACK acreage position in Northern Oklahoma for approximately $470 million, maintaining the objective of divesting smaller, non-core assets, and in this case principally non-operated acreage.","While we believe the play is highly economic at today's prices, the value acceleration from this currently undeveloped, principally non-operated acreage position is highly accretive and allows us to direct cash to our balance sheet, creating greater value for our shareholders.","The year-to-date asset sale agreements have minimal impact on 2016 and 2017 production and EBITDA. For 2016, total production is projected to be reduced by roughly 5% due to the announced sales, or approximately 35,000 barrels of oil equivalent production per day, of which roughly 60% of that represents gas production.","The 2016 EBITDA impact is also minimal, currently estimated to be approximately $20 million using today's strip pricing. We continue to focus on improving our margins, not only by addressing the cost side of our business, but also working to reduce our operational leverage in midstream commitments. Our operating and G&A costs continue to fall and together were 28% lower in the first quarter on a per-barrel of oil equivalent basis compared to the first quarter of 2015.","We intend to further expand our margins through continued discussions with our midstream and downstream partners on several fronts to find mutually-beneficial solutions that will increase EBITDA. These efforts are ongoing as we speak, and we believe we will have more to share as the year progresses.","Nick will speak more about our balance sheet and liquidity in a moment, but I wanted to note that we successfully reduced debt that matures in 2017 or that can be put to us in 2017 by $282 million in the first quarter. With the potential for additional debt exchanges, open market repurchases and the capability to issue additional secured debt, in addition to our sufficient liquidity, we have several tools, as you can see, at our disposal to handle our 2017 maturity obligations.","In closing, Chesapeake continues the ground game progress, working hard to advance our strategies while improving our financial and operational strength. This process and journey begins with each highly-motivated Chesapeake employee. Our employees have worked exceptionally hard over the past three years to improve our company, both operationally and financially. We are actively working on liability management initiatives, and our balance sheet is getting leaner and less complex. Asset sales are progressing and are providing additional fuel for our collective efforts.","I want to thank all of our shareholders who have stayed with us during these difficult and tough times, and I encourage other investors to keep your eye on Chesapeake. Our outstanding employees combined with high-quality assets, industry-leading capital efficiency, cash cost leadership and further balance sheet improvements will drive further value creation. We look forward to discussing further progress on all these fronts throughout the year as we prepare for operating in a time of greater commodity price stability.","I'll now pass the call to Nick, and then we will open the call up for a few questions.","Domenic J. Dell\u2019Osso - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Doug, and good morning, everyone. As Doug has stated, our priority is to continue the refinancing, exchanging and reduction of debt from our balance sheet, specifically debt maturing in the next 18 months to 24 months.","We continue to look at all of our options, including the use of additional secured debt, private transactions with bond holders and other types of exchange offers and open market purchases to manage these maturities.","As you're aware, in April, we amended our revolving credit facility to receive significant relief on our covenants and expand our flexibility with respect to issuing new secured debt while reaffirming the $4 billion borrowing base through at least March of 2017. In return, we pledged additional properties.","As of March 31 we had approximately $619 million of revolver capacity utilized for letters of credit, the majority of which was supporting the surety bond related to our 2019 notes litigation. So while we are pleased to have shored up our current liquidity position, we're squarely focused on utilizing the flexibility granted under our credit facility amendment to refinance or exchange our pending 2017 and 2018 debt maturities.","On the expense side, we expect our cash costs in aggregate to continue to decline throughout the year. You may have seen in our outlook that we lowered our production expense guidance due to additional cost savings. We have also adjusted our total gathering, processing and transportation expense estimate down due to lower costs we are seeing for both gas and NGL partially offset by higher stabilization fees for our Utica oil.","The reduced cost on gas and NGLs are the result of closer alignment with our midstream partners on future capital expenditures as well as optimizing usage of contracts and negotiations. The oil stabilization fees will allow us to reduce vapor pressure and improve API, providing more marketing options to downstream pipes and access to better prices. As a result, we expect to see our basis for oil improve throughout the year.","As Doug mentioned, we continue to have meaningful dialogue with our midstream and downstream partners to further reduce and optimize our gathering, processing and transportation agreements. We will keep you posted on any new announcements as they happen.","We also increased our interest expense guidance recognized on the income statement due to a decrease in expected capitalized interest. So that change will have no cash impact.","Since we last spoke to you in February, we've layered on additional hedges for 2016 to help increase our cash flow. We have approximately 476 Bcf of our remaining 2016 gas production hedged at $2.71 and approximately 18.2 million barrels of our remaining 2016 oil production hedged at $46.32 per barrel, representing 64% and 69% of our Q2 through Q4 2016 gas and oil volumes respectively. We have also started to add some 2017 hedges at recent prices.","So to close, we're continuing to deliver on our 2016 plan as we outlined in February to maximize liquidity, optimize our portfolio, increase EBITDA and reduce our debt. We have achieved a bit more success in the A&D market with our announcement this morning and that has no impact on our borrowing base and our revolving credit facility.","We are attacking the challenges of our financial and operational leverage and continue to work on many fronts to make Chesapeake a stronger company regardless of commodity prices. We look forward to being able to talk with you about those later this year.","That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","At this time, we will start the question-and-answer session. We'll take our first question from Neal Dingmann with SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Morning, guys, and congratulations on the sale. So Doug, your thoughts, reasoning for just I'm wondering on the piece you did sell and the piece you kept, is it just positioning as far as \u2013 any I guess color you can add on sort of the piece you sold versus why you kept the other piece?","Robert Douglas Lawler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Sure, Neal. We really like the STACK. We've talked about it in the past, and we feel very confident in our position. This transaction with Newfield we think is mutually beneficial to both companies. We still have approximately half of our STACK acreage in the play with other significant opportunities, as noted in the past, in particular like the Oswego that we still really like and are encouraged by.","What we know here is that this position, for Chesapeake, the amount of funding that we're going to put towards it in the near term and the value acceleration opportunity was just compelling for us at this point in time. And so bringing those proceeds in versus investing the capital over a multi-year period for Chesapeake, it was in our best interest to divest of the property.","So as we evaluate other assets, the non-core areas that in many cases are non-operated properties, we'll continue to look for those to continue to apply proceeds towards our capital structure or other corporate investments. So I think it was a good thing for the company and a mutually beneficial transaction.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Doug, are you saying that mostly further sales, to get to that $1.2 billion or so, or I guess you're already there, but beyond that would be more likely to be more non-core? I'm just wondering if things like parts of the Eagle Ford or parts of the Utica, which obviously are great asset positions, I mean how do you view things like that or are you just looking at more non-core sales going forward?","Robert Douglas Lawler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","At this point in time, it's really more non-core that we're looking at. And just highlight that in February, Neal, we said $500 million to $1 billion for the remainder of the year. Having accomplished the lower end of that range, we'll continue to look for those incremental non-core sales that are not going to materially impact our production or our EBITDA position.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Got it. And one last one, just looking again at that slide 13 where you show about the amounts that turned in line versus the spud. Obviously it looks like the activity, no surprise, was focused in the Mid-Con and the Haynesville. Is it fair to say kind of for the remainder of the year that will continue to be the focal as far as spud versus the TIL?","Robert Douglas Lawler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. I think that's fair.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. Thank you very much. Congrats again.","Operator","Next we'll hear from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Good morning.","Robert Douglas Lawler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Brian.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I wanted to just get some updates on how you're thinking about capital allocation and backlog in a couple of the natural gas plays. First, where you stand with curtailed wells and \u2013 or curtailed production as well as uncompleted wells in the Marcellus. And then in the Haynesville, can you just talk to plans for the year and how that could change, if at all, based on natural gas prices?","Frank J. Patterson - EVP-Exploration, Land & Subsurface Technology","Hey, Brian. This is Frank Patterson. In the Marcellus, we're making about 1.8 Bcf a day. We've seen a little bit of uptick in price recently, so we're doing well there. We have about 350 million cubic feet a day curtailed. These are wells that we can ratchet up as the market allows. And we have about 200 million cubic feet a day on wells that need minor repairs to bring back on line. So a substantial amount of gas available to us at a very, very minimal cost associated with that. And we'll manage that as the market allows.","We have about 100 wells sitting back waiting to be fracked. So that would give us another 450 million cubic feet a day. So we have a little bit over a Bcf a day available to us at a pretty reasonable cost.","Jason M. Pigott - Senior Vice President-Southern Operations","This is Jason. I'll give you a little update on the Haynesville. We've got some really exciting stuff going on in the Haynesville. We've brought on our first two 10,000-foot wells. They're doing fantastic. They're both coming on at 22 million cubic feet a day and nearly 8,000 pounds. So we've had some really positive results in the Haynesville. These wells we expect to get the cost down to about $8.5 million.","What's great about that for me is that a couple of years ago when I came into the role the teams were making 5,000 foot laterals at $8.5 million a well. So we've seen wells that are twice as productive at the same cost we were two years ago, so it's been a huge efficiency gain for us. Because of our agreement with Williams, we'll continue to run three rigs there this year. We're also pulling down our inventory. We had 31 wells in inventory at the beginning of the year and expect to be at eight wells by the end of the year.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thank you. And then on the topic of midstream, can you just talk about any updates as applicable on some of the midstream commitments and whether there's anything that we should expect in terms of renegotiations or update? Thank you.","Domenic J. Dell\u2019Osso - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure, Brian. I'll take that. It's Nick. We remain in constant dialogue with Williams on a number of fronts as well as some of our other downstream partners. And you've seen us have a variety of success across a number of fronts this year to align our current operating activity, the current market environment with the contracts that we have in place. And we've had very good receptivity from all of our partners to do that.","With respect to Williams, you did see that we lowered our gas gathering outlook by a nickel, and that really just comes down to as we set the cost of service for the year in alignment around what our activity plans are, where to spend money, how much to spend, and how that rolls through the calculation. So that's minor evidence, although it does generate a pretty reasonable amount of cash flow for us, minor evidence of how we can continue to work together to optimize around existing structures.","Negotiations on new structures, like I said, do continue and we are making good progress there and we'll just have to ask you to hang with us. Obviously we've had good success over the last year there and are confident that we will continue to have more in the coming months.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Matt Portillo with TPH. Please go ahead.","Matthew Merrel Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Good morning, guys.","Robert Douglas Lawler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Matt.","Matthew Merrel Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Just an additional follow-up question on the Marcellus. I guess as we think about capital allocation decisions for the next few years, you guys obviously have a lot of productive capacity behind pipe, but the market remains fairly dynamic in terms of takeaway capacity with some delays that have been announced recently","I guess as you guys look at that asset and compare it to maybe the Utica and the Haynesville from a rate-of-return perspective over the next few years, how does that fit into the STACK in terms of capital allocation? And I guess longer-term, does this still fit in terms of the core strategy from a development perspective going forward or are there potentially opportunities to extract additional value from an asset sale perspective in plays like the Marcellus where you've seen an uptick in A&D activity as of late?","Frank J. Patterson - EVP-Exploration, Land & Subsurface Technology","Yeah. This is Frank Patterson again, Matt. We have gaps that we can manage our production rates to a very manageable no decline basically, which is a great opportunity for us in the Marcellus. As far as the delays that we've seen, we were not on Constitution so that's really not something that we were counting on. We did have a small amount of gas that we wanted to put through NED; of course, that's fairly gone now. So we have an opportunity here to really manage this field to a really nice no-decline position with very little capital.","If you go to page 13 on the slides, you'll see that we're really not putting a lot of capital into the Marcellus because it doesn't need capital. As far as moneys being spent in the field, it is going to the Utica. The Utica has access through open to the Gulf and we are going to be putting on additional Utica dry wells this year and next year and growing some additional Utica dry wells going forward.","As far as sales or divestitures of assets, Marcellus is a core asset. There are parts of the Marcellus that might not be core and we would consider that with the right price. Utica, we're pretty happy with our position.","Robert Douglas Lawler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I might just add on, Frank, that the Marcellus is an incredibly powerful asset, stability and production, significant upside in terms of future opportunity there in the Marcellus, the Upper Marcellus, an ultra-low cost operating team up there. It just presents a significant high-return opportunity for us. Obviously the gas position and getting the gas out is the key issue and we'll continue to monitor that and ready to invest there when the opportunity presents itself and getting more gas out of the basin.","Matthew Merrel Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Great. And just a follow-up question to Brian's on the Haynesville. You guys have seen some pretty significant improvements over the last few years on completion innovation in the basin. So I was wondering if you could just give us some context around maybe your thoughts on breakeven economics within the context of the Haynesville. And as we look at the forward curve for 2017, I know that's starting to kind of come up on the horizon from a discussion perspective, but is this probably the area where you'd first allocate incremental capital as we roll into 2017 if the forward curve plays out?","Robert Douglas Lawler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I guess I have to go back to we've got a lot of exciting things still left in the Mid-Con. We have 1.5 million acres there. So we've got really strong economics there. And then our Eagle Ford has experienced a renaissance as well with the longer laterals. So those are still, preferentially if we're spending more dollars, those plays always look really strong.","In the Haynesville, again, we're continuing to improve. We're getting close to 20% returns at the strip here. And it's hard to explain how impactful these long laterals have been to that play out there, because we're getting \u2013 we're seeing no degradation in performance with these 10,000-foot wells. So we're getting double the production for effectively half the cost out there.","We also have a new play there. I didn't mention on my first set of comments, we've got our first 7,500-foot Bossier well that's flowing today. And it's 17 million cubic feet a day at 7,300 pounds. I mean, there's a lot of exciting things going on in the Haynesville, but our Eagle Ford team, they're drilling \u2013 plan to drill for this year 90 800-foot wells on average, which is nearly double what they were a couple of years ago.","So their returns have gone through the roof, and we're actually \u2013 our returns today in Eagle Ford with the current cost are about the same as when oil was $80. So I mean it's just significant how much of a change the Eagle Ford team has made there.","We had wells coming on a year ago at 500 barrels a day. Our latest wells are coming on close to that 1,000 barrels a day. So we've had just a huge transformation in the Eagle Ford team over this first quarter here that for me, again, if I'm fighting for capital, that's the area I want to send it first.","Matthew Merrel Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Next we'll go to Charles Meade with Johnson Rice. Please go ahead.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Yes. Good morning, Doug, and to the rest of your team there. I was wondering if I could ask another question about the Meramec sale and looking specifically at your slide 6. That map, if I'm interpreting it right, it looks like what you guys have retained is the down-dip more gassy portion. And I'm curious, am I interpreting that correctly? And if so, is that an expression of your preference that you think that that asset or that portion of the play has a higher upside now or is that more a function of where the inquiries were for the acreage that you might want to sell?","Robert Douglas Lawler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So just to reiterate that we really like our bid composition, continue to believe that's a significantly undervalued asset in our portfolio. Specific to your point, Charles, we seek upside in the Meramec in the remaining acreage that we have. It's not necessarily all gas, or more gassy-related. And we see other significant opportunities with the Oswego that we've noted before. So when you look at our position, we've got what we believe to be still good upside opportunity. And we'll be balancing the investments across oil and gas in Mid-Con where we can get the best return. Do you want to add anything to that, Jason?","Jason M. Pigott - Senior Vice President-Southern Operations","No. Again, when we talk about the acreage we retained, we're focused on the yellow and the northeast part of Kingfisher County up there. That's where the Oswego acreage is that we looked at. But we had at one of our releases a while back just a map of all the STACK plays at Mid-Con. They're much larger than just this small STACK area. We struggle to come up with a name of what we would call the STACK because we've got Miss Lime wells that, again, continue to get downplayed but have fantastic results out of the Miss Lime continually. But there are just all kinds of STACK plays that are \u2013 there's new tests going out in the Mid-Con all the time and because of our large acreage position we're set to take advantage of those. And we've got some news that I'm really \u2013 new prospects that I'm really looking forward to talking to you about as this year progresses and into next year because our G&T teams are just really fired up about all the potential they see in Mid-Con. It's more than just the Meramec.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Got it. And forgive me if this should be obvious but on that map, it's that gray portion that you sold and the yellow you've retained?","Jason M. Pigott - Senior Vice President-Southern Operations","Yeah. There's two sales there, so we had the FourPoint sale, which is the southwesterly sale but, yeah, the target in the middle, though, is what we sold this time.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Got it. Got it. And then, if I could ask, perhaps for Nick on this slide 9, I know that you guys have had a lot of moving parts with what you've \u2013 the different avenues you've chosen to reduce your debt. But, Nick, I understand this is specific \u2013 slide 9 is specific to your 2017 maturities. But can you take us through what of this, is there anything new here that's incremental since your last disclosure?","Domenic J. Dell\u2019Osso - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No. This is all just repeat of our last disclosure. We had done the debt-for-equity exchanges, some open-market purchase, and then we had completed our exchange obviously back in December. So, no, there's been no incremental activities since then. I think the last time we updated the market on this was around sometime in March and then pretty quickly there after that we got an earnings quiet period and all of those things. So we've been quiet on this front recently as we completed our bank amendment and got through earnings and look forward to being more active in the weeks to come.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks, Nick.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Good morning, guys. Good morning, Doug.","Robert Douglas Lawler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So, the acreage you've kept in the STACK, I know this has been a bit of a theme for the call, but one of the things that you had talked about in the past was that if and when you decided to start increasing activity there, it could be used as leverage to help with your midstream negotiations. I'm just wondering if you could just frame generally where you stand in that whole picture in the context of clearly you're signaling you're going to get active at some point.","Robert Douglas Lawler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure, Doug. Good question. We still see good opportunity with the other remaining STACK opportunities and the remaining acreage that we have, as Jason noted, 1.5 million acres that we still have good leverage in that particular asset to help us with our midstream negotiations. And likewise in the other assets, we continue to work closely with Williams looking at additional stratigraphic dedications, lateral dedications, potential other business lines.","There are a number of things that we're working. We still remain excited and encouraged that we will continue to find improvement there and win-win solutions with Williams. And what I would just encourage you to focus on, as we have done several times and highlighted what we intended to do, we've accomplished just that and confident that that will be the case again.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. I look forward for more news on that. But my follow-up is \u2013 I guess, it's a little bit more of an obtuse question and certainly hasn't been talked about too much lately. And it's basically the VPPs, when you start to get the volume spike from those. I'm just wondering if you could walk us through the kind of timeline because my understanding is that some of those over the next year or two will start to come back to you.","Robert Douglas Lawler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. So the volumetric production payments, we presently have six remaining. Each has a different timeline. With the asset sales that we've highlighted, we will see the number of VPPs and the complexity associated with them continue to reduce. With these transactions, we should see three or four of those go away. As we noted in the press release and I have put in my comments, that's principally the reduction that you see from the gross proceeds down to the net proceeds, about $950 million, Doug.","So that was a \u2013 what remains are at different time intervals, but when I started the company we had nine. We're at six today, and we will continue to see more roll off this year. And so that volume really is insignificant at this point in time.","Domenic J. Dell\u2019Osso - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Doug, just to provide a little bit more color there, after the transactions that Doug just spoke about, we will have remaining our VPP in the Devonian and our VPP in a field in Northern Oklahoma called the Sahara field. Other than that, everything else would have been retired, like the Barnett last year, or repurchased.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good. Nick, just to be clear, is it fair to characterize the VPPs remaining as in the non-core asset category? In other words, if you secure the balance of your disposals that it will disappear as well?","Domenic J. Dell\u2019Osso - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","It's possible, Doug. I think it just depends on structures of transactions and where assets sit and what else is around them, so it's certainly possible.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Doug, my last one if I may is just on costs. You're making tremendous progress obviously on getting costs done, so it's good to see. But I'm curious with eight rigs running what do you think \u2013 it's kind of a horrible question to answer \u2013 what do you think your capability is within the firm? And assuming things get better at some point, what are you capable of running at up from that eight-rig program you're running? And I'll leave it there. Thanks.","Robert Douglas Lawler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I'll never underestimate the Chesapeake employees, they are doing a phenomenal job on our cost and those continued improvements. And I expect there to be nothing more than continued improvement.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So in terms of capability, Doug?","Robert Douglas Lawler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Capability...","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","What I'm getting at is obviously there's have been head count reduction and there's been activity reduction and so on. Now you're running eight rigs. What's the capacity of Chesapeake, what level could you operate at?","Robert Douglas Lawler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I just would highlight again the capability and capacity of this company is phenomenal. And the technology improvements, the efficiency of the organization, G&A reductions that we've had to undergo like a lot of the industry have not compromised the strength and ability of this company. And so I feel very good about our competitive position, comparative position, to reduce costs in the current pricing environment, and competitive position that should we see a more stable, higher-price environment that we could ramp up and handle that additional capital activity level very easily.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. I'll leave it there. Thanks a lot, fellas.","Operator","That concludes today's question-and-answer session. And at this time I will turn the conference back to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.","Robert Douglas Lawler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. I appreciate everyone's time on the call today. We're very encouraged about the progress that we continue to make at Chesapeake. As I noted in one of the questions there, we've highlighted a number of times our strategy and our intent to further improve the company, and I just want to reiterate that today.","Our commitment is as strong as ever. Our commitment to drive greater value for our shareholders and all the stakeholders, the excellent work by the employees at Chesapeake and making sure that we drive for the greatest return and the greatest value for this company.

Sir, please go ahead.","Gordon Pennoyer","Good morning and thank you for joining our call today to discuss Chesapeake's financial and operational results for the 2019 second quarter. Hopefully, you've had a chance to review our press release and the updated investor presentation that we posted on our website this morning.","During this morning's call, we will be making forward-looking statements which consist of statements that cannot be confirmed by reference to existing information, including statements regarding our beliefs, goals, expectations, forecasts, projections, and future performance and the assumptions underlying such statements.","Please note that there are a number of factors that will cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements, including the factors identified and discussed in our earnings release today and in other SEC filings. Please recognize that except as required by applicable law, we undertake no duty to update any forward-looking statements, and you should not place any undue reliance on such statements.","We may also reference to some non-GAAP financial measures, which help facilitate comparisons across periods without and with peers. For any non-GAAP measures we use, a reconciliation to the nearest corresponding GAAP measure can be found on our website and in our earnings release.","With me today on the call are Doug Lawler, Nick Dell'Osso, and Frank Patterson. Doug will begin the call, and then turn the call over to Frank and Nick for a review of our operational and financial results, before we turn the teleconference over for Q&A.","So with that, thank you and I will now turn the teleconference over to Doug.","Doug Lawler","Thank you, Gordon and good morning. I'm pleased today to report Chesapeake's continued strategic progress. The second quarter featured increased oil production and enhanced capital efficiency, which continue to drive margin growth as we advance towards sustainable free cash flow. We're maximizing value of our diverse portfolio through a returns-focused capital allocation strategy and we're prudently managing our debt maturities to maintain future liquidity.","On the call today, you will hear reference to our rate of change, which simply stated highlights the ongoing transformational improvements that are reflected in our past performance, current business delivery and future value growth proposition. You will also hear reference to our scale, which emphasizes the size, strength and diversity of our portfolio.","Our scale provides the foundation for competitive and differential economic resource development. You'll also hear reference to our technical and operating capability, which combined with our scale and rate of change drive differential capital efficiency, cash cost leadership and future growth.","During the quarter, Chesapeake produced a record 122,000 barrels of oil per day and we increased our oil mix percentage to a record 25% of total production. The oil volume increase is driven by the successful integration of our Brazos Valley asset steady growth from the Powder River Basin and improved base production performance from South Texas and the Mid-Continent. Accordingly, we have raised the midpoint of our full year 2019 oil production guidance by approximately 250,000 barrels.","Higher oil volumes and our focus on cash cost leadership yielded the highest second quarter margin per BOE in five years. We have lowered our full year guidance for production expense as well as gathering processing and transportation expense. I'm very excited with the rapid progress we have made in our new Brazos Valley asset. After only five months from closing, we have a clearly defined plan to fully achieve the forecasted annual synergy savings of $250 million to $280 million per year.","We'll continue to build up on the cash cost improvements and capital efficiencies identified. Notably, we see further opportunity to the projected $600,000 capital reduction realized on a per well basis as we've recognized up to $2 million in savings on certain wells. As a result of our capital efficiency, we have lowered the breakeven oil price for a Brazos Valley well to $39 per barrel an approximate 26% improvement.","Oil production is poised to increase during the second half of 2019. We expect to turn in line approximately 170 oil wells in the Powder River Basin, South Texas and Brazos Valley assets, an increase of roughly 50% over the first half of 2019. In a few moments Frank will share more with you on our asset level progress.","Capital spending for the quarter was in line with our guidance and we remain confident in our full year forecast. As a reminder, we have downside protection for approximately 75% of our 2019 oil and gas volumes. We'll continue to pursue asset sales to further reduce debt. Nick will share additional detail on our liquidity, liability management and financial improvements for the quarter.","As noted in our earnings release in 2020, we expect to allocate more capital to oil growth areas with less capital going towards our gas assets. As a result, we have an approximately flat capital program to 2019, we project our 2020 oil volumes will show double-digit percentage growth over 2019 while our gas volumes will show a double-digit percentage decline. Importantly, our projected adjusted EBITDAX remains approximately the same at 2019 levels using today's lower NYMEX strip pricing and our current hedge position.","We look forward to driving further value from our diverse portfolio and capital discipline in 2020 and beyond.","We'll remain flexible and prudent with our capital allocation using our scale and operating efficiency to drive value in this volatile pricing environment. I'm excited about the future of Chesapeake Energy and value that we have to offer. Our employees, leadership and Board are driven and committed to achieving our strategic priorities of reducing our leverage metrics, improving margins through continued oil growth and achieving sustainable free cash flow from our portfolio of high-quality assets.","I'll now turn the call over to Frank for some further commentary on our oil growth and other operational achievements from the second quarter.","Frank Patterson","Thank you, Doug. Good morning everyone. Let me start by commenting further on the significant capital efficiencies we've already realized in Brazos Valley. The operating team continues to demonstrate the ability to rapidly change the outlook and performance profile of this asset. We've advanced the integration of Brazos Valley into our portfolio and are rapidly moving to full development mode. We've demonstrated significant improvements across all aspects of the business units operations.","As Doug noted in his introduction, we have eliminated an average of over $600,000 per well in a few wells we've seen -- we've recognized over $2 million savings. These savings are the result of improved drilling and completion techniques, faster cycle time and lower oilfield service costs, but we're not done.","Just last week the completion team set a field frac crude record by pumping 15 stages and placing 8.4 million pounds of sand in a single day. This accomplishment was aided by our operated sand mine, which is now supplying 100% of our sand needs for two factories.","On top of operational performance and cost savings, the team has also accelerated production performance by more than 30% with the average 2019 wells reaching similar cumulative production in 180 days that historically took 260 days. So far this year, we have turned in seven wells that have reached a maximum 24-hour production rate of more than 1,000 barrels per day compared to just three that have reached similar levels in 2018.","Additionally, we've increased workover activity and made a concerted effort to raise the field to Chesapeake's operating standards, which has already improved base production by more than $500,000 barrels compared to our original projection for 2019. Our subsurface understanding of the field was high when we completed the acquisition, but has grown even stronger in recent months as the team has had a chance to gather additional data.","We've been able to leverage our Reservoir Technology Lab and new PVT data to greatly increase our understanding of fluid properties in the field. As a result, we have shifted more than 230 locations into the black oil window to plain. Our understanding will continue to evolve as we have recently taken two full cores, which are now under evaluation in our core lab.","While there are many ways to manage or how we've improved performance in this asset, I'm most proud of what the team has done to redefine the economics of the play. At current strip prices, we have increased our two-year per well cash flow projections by $1.3 million. And as Doug noted, since the acquisition, we've lowered the projected breakeven from $53 in 2018 to $39 today.","As we look forward to the rest of the year, 100% of our activity will be focused in the high-margin oil window of the Eagle Ford. And improved cycle times will allow us to accelerate our activity further and we anticipate placing approximately 45 oil wells on line in the second half of the year compared to just 28 wells in the first half.","We anticipate continuing this trend in 2020 and currently forecast delivering 44 million to 46 million barrels of oil production from a four rig drilling program. Needless to say, we're excited to have Brazos Valley in Chesapeake's oil portfolio and look forward to driving more value from the asset.","Derivative change is not restricted to Brazos Valley. This week South Texas drilling team delivered a 15,361-foot measured depth well in a time of 5.5 days, averaging over 2,700 feet per day safe and fast. Awesome results. On the production front, the team continues to deliver strong base volume performance this was driven by adjusted well spacing, enhanced completions and production optimization. The team also did a great job managing a planned third-party plant outage that affected sales volumes in June.","As a result, we exceeded our internal production forecast for the quarter in the field. South Texas continues to be a strong free cash flow generator for the company and a foundational asset. In the Powder River Basin, the team continues to drive cost down and grow our margins, while remaining on target to deliver 100% year-over-year oil.","Our development plan in the Turner continues to evolve and the field GOR is moving lower as more wells are focused on the oil window. Our central production facility came online in July and currently over 50% of our oil volumes are on pipe versus being truck. We'll continue to move more production to pipeline and as a result, we expect to reduce GP&T per barrel of oil equivalent by more than 25% this year.","Operationally, our cycle times continue to improve with the average Spud-TIL time expected to decrease approximately 25% year-over-year. While we focused our attention on developing the Turner formation, we remain excited about the stacked pay potential under our acreage footprint. We recently drilled our first Niobrara well since 2014 and expect to record initial results in the next quarter.","Additionally, the team continues their technical work on the Mowry formation, and currently intend to drill the initial Mowry test -- an initial Mowry test and the volatile oil window later this year.","With the majority of our capital focused on high-margin oil assets, we will lean on our core gas assets for efficient free cash flow delivery. The Marcellus continues to generate significant free cash flow, while we maintain a disciplined capital spend.","The quality of Chesapeake's position in the region is exceptional, and our continued operating improvements driven by refined spacing, longer laterals and optimized completion has significantly lowered our F&D costs and continue to yield improved recoveries per lateral foot.","With these improvements, we've rapidly decreased our breakeven price. As we look ahead, at approximately 1,350-foot spacing and current rig pace, we have over 10 years of drilling inventory at a PV10 breakeven price of between $1.50 and $1.75 per MCF.","Overall, Chesapeake continues to deliver progress on the fronts that we can control operationally. Using our geotechnical and engineering expertise, we're seeing more opportunity across all basins. I'm confident that in the second half of the year, the rate of change will continue.","With that, I'll turn the conference call over to Nick to review our financial performance.","Nick Dell'Osso","Thank you, Frank, and good morning, everyone. Driven by stronger adjusted oil production and increase in our production mix towards oil and lower total cash operating expenses, we reported a 26% increase in adjusted EBITDAX margin per BOE compared to last year.","As we stated last quarter, the margin improvements we're delivering are not simply due to price as realized prices before hedges were lower compared to last year primarily due to portfolio rotation and our intentional shift of capital to higher margin oil production and away from drilling natural gas.","We improved our cash operating cost structure by approximately $57 million over the second quarter of 2018, primarily through lower GP&T expenses. Continuing the trend of optimizing our GP&T spend, we will be launching an RFP process for a new oil pipeline gathering agreement in the Brazos Valley area shortly.","Moving our oil production to a gathering system should greatly reduce our current reliance on trucking oil volumes, thereby improving our cost structure in the region. In addition, we're also making progress towards solutions to help deliver our Brazos Valley oil into the Gulf coast market, allowing us to take advantage of improved pricing versus WTI.","We expect to have more to announce on this by the end of 2019 third quarter. In the PRB, we are connecting pads to our new oil gathering system every week and expect this to lower our oil gathering expenses in the field even further.","Finally, as Doug noted, we are allowing our gas volumes most specifically the Haynesville production to fall in 2020 based on prudent capital allocation in this weak gas price environment. Our gathering contract in the Haynesville is an acreage dedication with no minimum volumes or other commitments. So, we will see no gathering penalty from this volume drop.","We do have forward transportation out of North Louisiana that we will not fully utilize at this reduced volume profile. As a result, we forecast a net impact to our GP&T for the Haynesville region alone in 2020 versus 2019 of an absolute reduction of $79 million or an increase of just over $0.03 per MCF.","Production expenses rose during the second quarter due to a number of factors. We began to improve our base production in Brazos Valley, which resulted in higher year-over-year work-over activity and water disposal costs. Additionally, our add well tax is increased due to higher property valuation assessments in Texas and Wyoming.","We believe these anticipated one-time events and catch-up expenses are mostly behind us. So, we expect our LOE per BOE to come down both in the third and fourth quarters. And accordingly, we have reduced our outlook range for full year 2019 production expense.","On the balance sheet side, our liquidity is strong as we entered -- ended the quarter with availability of approximately $1.6 billion under our $3 billion Chesapeake credit facility and approximately $600 million under the $1.3 billion Brazos Valley credit facility.","We will retire our near-term maturities through cash flow in future asset sales, when market conditions are more conducive to refinance, pending maturities we will be prudent in doing so.","We currently have a couple of small portfolio, clean-up asset divestitures underway. And while we are optimistic they will yield positive outcomes, our liquidity position affords us the opportunity to be patient and hold-off selling if the markets ultimately prove unattractive.","Finally, we have significant price protection through the end of this year and for a meaningful proportion of 2020 expected production. For the second half of 2019, over 75% of our forecasted 2019 oil production and natural gas production is hedged with downside protection at average prices of $59.38 per barrel and $2.83 per MCF respectively.","We also have approximately 265 BCF of gas and 15 million barrels of oil hedged at $2.76 and $59.93 respectively for 2020. Additionally, we have locked in pricing for approximately four million barrels of our remaining Eagle Ford volumes in 2019 at a premium of approximately $5.85 to WTI.","Operator, we'll now turn the call over for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Devin McDermott with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Devin McDermott","Good morning. Congrats on the very solid execution in the quarter.","Doug Lawler","Thanks, Devin.","Devin McDermott","My first question, I wanted to get in a bit more detail on the capital allocation strategy as you move into 2020. And I think, as you laid it out, the shift away from gas over to oil makes a lot of sense and it definitely highlights some of the value of your portfolio diversity as well. But I wanted to dive into a bit more detail, as you think about where you cut on the gas side and allocate more capital on the oil side, what some of the levers do you have there? Where would be -- you cut first, sounds like Haynesville is pretty high on the list but a bit more detail there would be useful?","Nick Dell'Osso","Sure, Devin. I appreciate the question. The focus of the company is, obviously, to drive where we can capture the greatest returns. We are very fortunate to have extremely strong gas assets, which we have a lot of confidence in. The breakeven in Marcellus is extremely low and very, very competitive and we obviously still have some takeaway constraints up there that are just with the infrastructure that exist in the Northeast. So that remains one of very top rate of return investments in our portfolio and we expect that production to remain relatively flat, as it has for the past few years.","The oil assets, the margin enhancement and things that we're driving for with the free cash flow -- sustainable free cash flow growth that we're targeting, that's all going to be driven by oil investments, now, notably the base and execution in South Texas and then the growth in Brazos Valley and the Powder River. So, obviously, that leaves us with the Haynesville, which, given current pricing and the flexibility we have, we will react accordingly as we have reduced that activity substantially there currently and forecasted very low activity level with current pricing.","And if you see, we will recognize better prices in 2020. We will constantly evaluate that capital allocation and direct investments where we can capture the best return. That said, though, the economics and the margins that we're capturing from the oil investment make it difficult to see a lot of capital going back towards the Haynesville anytime in the near future.","So where we sit is there's basically a lot of strength with Marcellus. We'll continue to monitor that production level there, but very pleased with the performance and execution of what we can deliver from that asset and the bulk of the capital, as this year, will be directed towards all the oil growth.","Devin McDermott","Got it. It's very helpful. And you also had some comments on potential further asset sales per deleveraging and you also noted that given the capital efficiency improvements that you've seen so far, there is a nice organic path to deleveraging over time. But as you think about the leverage targets and how far the strategic action or asset sales might fit into achieving that over time? Could you provide a bit more detail and what would fit in those asset sale targets? And what the opportunity set you see there is?","Nick Dell'Osso","Sure. Devin, we have a very large portfolio of producing assets in acreage and probably don't want to go into a ton of detail on this call, but we're looking at a little bit acreage in Northeast PA that probably makes sense for us to consider divesting and a little bit acreage associated with the acquisition we just made, that it is not of our primary drilling target.","Both areas have great returns and it's the kind of acreage positions that inside of our portfolio we are choosing not to drill right now, but the return profile available to them is attractive. And we believe therefore could be attractive to other producers in the market. It is just a part of our strategy always to look very carefully at our portfolio every year and think about what assets we should continue to own and what assets are rather inefficient for us to hold on to, given the development profile that we have. And so, this is just part of that.","It will be a nice tailwind to the handling of near-term maturities, if that all plays out and if we decide that the market conditions are not attractive to move forward with those divestitures, we can continue to hold them. It's really just a matter of whether or not the opportunity cost versus what's available in the market today makes sense to us.","Doug Lawler","Devin, I might just add on top of Nick's comments there that our goal of deleveraging and when you look at the future of the company and we have a clear line of sight with the oil assets and the strength and quality of the portfolio to delever organically, as you've said, over time. However, our focus is to accelerate that as quickly as possible.","And so, whether its non-core small or even larger assets as market conditions dictate, we will remain open and focused on that deleveraging priority, which still remains our number one strategic priority. So we've got a few things really in the work, as Nick highlighted, and we'll continue to look for opportunities to further delever and accelerate that deleveraging that we've described.","Devin McDermott","That makes a lot of sense. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Arun Jayaram","Yeah. Good morning. Perhaps this one is for Nick. You showed some progress on the GP&T line item, with cost coming down in the Powder River Basin. I was just wondering if you can talk broadly about the portfolio, and other opportunities to kind of lower your GP&T costs, over time.","Nick Dell'Osso","Yeah. Absolutely, so Arun you saw, and we talked a lot about last quarter, how we put in place the oil gathering contract in the Powder. And that's going to be a great contract for us.","We're going to get it roll to market faster. We're going to get it to market more consistently, without regard to having to wait for truck traffic, and snow, and things like that. And inclement weather, having oil on pipe is just a much more reliable form of delivery.","In addition to that, the cost to deliver, oil through a liquid, either other transportation point or liquid sales market, via pipe is dramatically lower on a per barrel basis. We're doing this, of course through a third-party contract, where we don't spend any of our own capital.","We're going to look to do the same thing in Brazos Valley. We've had a number of midstream companies approach us. We are seeking a partnership there, to go out and build that kind of a system similar to what we've contracted for in the Powder.","So, we'll undertake that RFP here in the near-term. There is more we can do across the portfolio of course. We think very actively about how to manage our portfolio volumes as they grow around the way that we contract for our gathering, processing trend.","It is of course, always about delivering the highest value hydrocarbon, for the lowest cost. So, to give you an example of what I mean by that, in the Powder we did also sign up for a little bit of incremental transportation, that takes us from Guernsey to Cushing.","And in doing that, we give ourselves more stability of pricing, the pricing in the Guernsey market is held up pretty well. You did see last winter there can be times where, the Guernsey market gets congested. And so with this incremental transport out of basin, we feel like we have that pretty well covered.","So we'll pay a little bit for that transportation. And believe that it's well and nice to have that option. Especially as we grow volumes there, we will overrun what we can feasibly sell in Guernsey on a regular basis.","Similarly in the Brazos Valley, we're going to look to gain access to the Houston market and potentially the corpus market as well, looking at and making sure, we have direct access into the premium MEH through LLS pricing structures that we utilize for our Eagle Ford barrels.","And when we believe that there are a couple of options, because we have to do that. And so we're moving down that path. So we'll move away from trucking extensively in the field to gathering on pipe.","And then, we'll pay a little bit of transportation, incremental to what we do today to get from the field to the premium price point. And then all in including the improvement in bases that we'll realize, we expect to have an overall more economic position.","I did note that in the Haynesville, we will see our gas volumes fall. As there is a little bit of pressure on the Haynesville specific GP&T next year, that's something we will continue to look at and see if there are any other opportunities there, to optimize that spend and that FT that we committed to back in 2010 and obviously a very different world.","But the pressure that we'll see in 2020 is pretty manageable. And so we feel really good about the pretty obvious economics decision to pull back capital to the Haynesville, in a time our gas prices are obviously extremely weak.","In the Marcellus we still maintain a very attractive gathering and transportation cost structure. We get access to very premium markets in the Northeast, especially in the winter.","Our gathering cost in the Northeast is extremely attractive relative to peers, that is, one place where we have a competitive standout position. And we look to continue to leverage that.","It's part of what helps us recognize in extremely low breakeven, as Frank pointed out, in the Northeast and its what holds up our investment in an asset like that even in this time of very weak prices.","So when we talk about gas falling year-over-year, we are very much pointed to the Haynesville there. We're going to do a pretty good job of maintaining our volumes in the Marcellus. Because the rate of return there is still pretty attractive even at these levels, with our breakevens as well as we've gotten them.","Arun Jayaram","Okay. And just about the Eagle Ford -- thanks for that commentary, thoughts on the Eagle Ford there?","Nick Dell'Osso","Yeah. So we continue to look at a number of things in the Eagle Ford, both trying to consider alternatives for the gas gathering, costs there that are on the high side of what we believe, reflects the best situation we could have in the market today.","Of course that's also a contract, that's been in place for many years and was built out for a different time, in a different set of economics. And also on the oil takeaway, our growth activity in the Eagle Ford has really come to a place where we are generating free cash flow out of that asset. And not really expecting that asset to grow volumes dramatically from here.","And so we're going to work with our transportation partners there, to think about it if there are any other ways to optimize that. But those are all things that are works in progress. You can assume that in every basin, our marketing team is hard at work everyday, trying to optimize how and where we're going to deliver our volumes and under what costs.","Arun Jayaram","Great and just my follow-up Nick is the CapEx is slightly tilted to the first half of the year. I mean, if you just take the midpoint of the range, roughly 53% of your CapEx in first half 47% in the back half. But your TILs on the oil side are more concentrated in the back half.","So can you just help reconcile, thoughts on second half CapEx, given that mix?","Nick Dell'Osso","Sure. That's just timing. If you think about what has to happen in order for our TIL schedule to reflect, what you see there. There is a chart in our slide today that shows that, the largest number of TILs occur in the third quarter. In reality, the largest number of TILs occur in late August through late September. And so in order to do that, we've started spending money sooner than that. And so you have more money that comes out in the first half than you do in the second half. The cycle times in these assets are something that we think about often and always trying to compress, but they are still very real. And so you spend money in May and June to be \u2013 to start bringing wells online in August and September and the cycles that follow.","Arun Jayaram","Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Brian Singer","Thank you. Good morning.","Nick Dell'Osso","Good morning, Brian.","Brian Singer","In Brazos Valley, can you add a little bit of color on the expansion of the black oil window? Can you take us through the results that you saw from kind of well data that you saw from first quarter wells to 230 additional locations? And then what you see as the upside versus downside risk to the economics of locations as you get more data on declined rates from these first quarter wells?","Frank Patterson","Yeah. Brian, this is Frank Patterson. So when we went through the acquisition, we kind of walked everybody through at that point, there were only three PVT, or four PVT samples for the entire field area. So we were kind of working with a limited amount of data. So \u2013 and the drilling program has not drilled several parts of the field. And so we were kind of being very cautious and conservative the way we viewed the fluid windows. As we've now dug into it and been able to go out, and capture some PVT samples, do some analysis, and then we've drilled a few wells what's happened is those wells that are the 230 wells that have shifted they've shifted from basically the volatile oil condensate window to a black oil, or a relatively low GOR window. So we have pretty high confidence in that, because not only do we have PVT data, but we also have well performance data. And I think there is a map in the presentation that will demonstrate that.","We're seeing pretty high confidence of delivery across the footprint. We're trying to describe that in one of the other maps that we put in the presentation in that, we've drilled across a big portion of the footprint now and seeing really good results. We're going to continue to extend that as we go out and drill additional wells. We're still trying to optimize the completion design here. We're pumping less fluid quite a bit of sand, which we think is key but we're trying to eliminate some of the fluid that we're pumping and getting a more complex fractured network around the well bores and we're still at 1000-foot spacing. So that's the next step is what is the spacing really going to look like at the end of the day, we think it's between 750 and 1,000. We'll know more about that after we get our core results. We have two cores that we have just taken and we took those cores across the Austin Chalk through the entire Eagle Ford section. So really get a lot of good data here in the next few months. I think what you're going to see is our footprint is going to expand, and I think we're going to see potentially some areas where we can maybe tighten up on some spacing as well.","Brian Singer","Great. Thank you. And then my follow-up is with regards to natural gas both in the Haynesville and the Marcellus can you talk to any constraints on how long you could keep your rig count in the Haynesville at zero and in the Marcellus to keep production flat? Is there any point at which either any of the GP&T or midstream becomes a constraint where you would otherwise either need to raise the rig count or want or need to renegotiate contracts?","Doug Lawler","No. There is really no constraint Brian. We do have FT as I noted earlier, and the 2020 impact of that FT is pretty muted. It would grow a little bit over time as you saw volumes continue to fall, if you stayed at zero rigs. I don't expect that we will stay at zero rigs forever. I would think that at some point the gas market will begin to look at some sort of a rebound here and come back to some reasonable level, where the Haynesville is more economic than it is today. As you think about what our breakevens are in the Haynesville, they're not terrible and we're just choosing at the moment to think just as much about near-term free cash flow as we are about long-term rates of return.","And in a market where things might be a little bit more stable, there is long-term rate of return here that we can access at prices that do not need to be north of $3. In fact they can be well below $3 and we might choose to drill some more wells in the Haynesville. So this is not a departure from the Haynesville forever by any stretch, but it is in the near-term a recognition that with gas in the low $2 on the prompt and falling in 2020 that it probably makes sense for us to focus on free cash flow more so for the immediate term.","I'll also note that our FT begins to fall a little bit starting in 2021. And so as you do think about that long-term profile it's pretty manageable. The costs are real, but again we've incorporated those in what I gave you earlier to note that the gathering or the transportation cost all-in for the Haynesville alone next year would see $0.03 pressure per MCF. So we can digest that and we can think about how we want to position it for 2021 as we get into 2020 and consider where we are.","Great thing about the Haynesville of course is that when we get a price signal to do so we can bring capital back and bring a lot of production online relatively quickly. So there is no real penalty there other than just the FT that exists for quite a while, but does get a little smaller starting in 2021 and then again another slight step down in 2022.","So as we think about the Marcellus on the other hand, we are maintaining relatively flat volumes there and are always eager for a price signal that we can grow our volumes in the Marcellus with the confidence that we would see current pricing because as we all know the Marcellus is capable of a tremendous amount more volume from us and we just worry that if we overrun the in-basin markets we would see prices collapse in a hurry. So we just try to balance what that demand looks like with the supply that we deliver.","Frank Patterson","And Brian, this is Frank. I'll just give you a little more color on Marcellus. Just kind of think of it as a two to three rig program to maintain that 2.3, 2.4 bcf a day output it's probably the lowest activation cost in the gas world in the U.S. and really capital efficient. We're seeing a lot of dramatic changes in because we're -- we have the footprint to allow us to drill longer laterals so we can basically draw the capital efficiency of that even higher.","The completion and the spacing -- upgrading the spacing to a wider spacing has also paid huge dividend. So we're pretty pleased with our Marcellus. And as Nick said that's a lever we can pull if the gas market allowed us to. And so just think of that right now as kind of a steady state of two to three rigs going forward for a while.","Brian Singer","Great. Thank you. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Please go ahead. ","Doug Leggate","Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking my questions. Doug, I wonder if I could just follow-up on Brian's question and ask you the same on the Haynesville with zero rigs what is the underlying decline look like there? What would it take to stabilize the Haynesville?","Doug Lawler","So it's a great question. And as you know the Haynesville is a tremendously productive asset and very, very dependent upon commodity prices. And what we love is that the team there has done such a good job around capital efficiency and productivity and the investment profile there is essentially at our discretion.","And as we look as Nick highlighted there I think it was very well said that even when we look at 2020 the decline in the current GP&T commitments were not significant enough that it says we're going to direct capital there to satisfy a GP&T obligation. And so as we look out into 2021 and beyond then we will continue to look at how we can best maximize those volumes to satisfy those legacy GP&T commitments.","We also are excited about other opportunities in the Haynesville area particularly in respect of the Cotton Valley. Cotton Valley is an area that -- or a horizon that has we have not actively invested in to my knowledge here at Chesapeake and we have a great acreage position that we can continue to look for economic development there in the future. So I think it's a good question. It's something that we're not really that concerned about and we'll direct capital there and make the best investment decisions with the continued priority of driving the greatest margins and achieving that sustainable free cash flow.","Doug Leggate","Appreciate the answer, Doug. My follow-up is for Frank, if I may. Frank there are a couple of call-out wells here in the presentation Bell 4 in Brazos and RRC BB up in by the River. Can you just talk what's going on there because it was like dramatically better results than what you've guided towards? I'm just wondering if there is something unusual about those? Or if we're starting to see a trend up into the right in terms of how you see the productivity of those areas?","Frank Patterson","Okay. Doug, thanks for the question. The Bell 4 remember that's a 4-well pad. So you have to scale that down. So that's in the black oil window. What that did was that well validated the work that we did on PVT analysis and validated that the black oil window extends further down deep than we had originally thought. We're still trying to get the optimum completion style on those wells. So that's a 4-well pad so that looks really impressive, but you got to scale that back. ","Doug Leggate","Right.","Frank Patterson","On the RRC, we highlighted that in our last call. It's a well up to the -- in the oil window of the Turner. It's in an area that we got the spacing we think correct. The well performance is really stout in the north part of that field. If you look at, the entire oil window, we've tried to demonstrate that in the graphic in that, our average oil window wells are exceeding the peer performance within the basin.","And two of the wells to the north that we're highlighting, that we talked about last time, that had really high IPs those wells are hanging in there and really outperforming.","What we're seeing is there is variability in the Turner. And that was something that we expected. This is not a shale. This is a sandstone and a silty sandstone. So as we drill across the footprint, we're going to see, a little bit of variability. But even with that variability, we're seeing really high rates of return on the mean well.","Doug Leggate","Understood, I appreciate the clarification guys and the great, great, for the quarter. Thanks.","Frank Patterson","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Heikkinen with Heikkinen Energy. Please go ahead.","David Heikkinen","Good morning guys. Just curious if you have any thoughts or expectation on the impact of oil realization, in the Eagle Ford Brazos Valley premium, as Permian volumes get to the Gulf coast? Does the premium is contract, in your expectation?","Doug Lawler","Yeah. So the way we forecast that Dave is that, we simply look at the same forward curves that you all do. And there is a curve for MEH which is our primary pricing point. And it certainly shows the contraction. And so that's how we build our economics.","As the U.S. continues to export oil, we think that there is potentially the opportunity for some of that premium, to be sticky. But we don't forecast anything beyond what the market tells us to expect today.","David Heikkinen","Okay. That's helpful. And then, as you talked through each asset GP&T, the extra $79 million or $0.03 for Haynesville. What do you think the run rate should be for GP&T, into 2020? Just kind of a color that's fine.","Doug Lawler","It's always a function -- yeah, so it's not just a function of what the run rate or what the current rates are, everywhere today but also a function of the mix that we will see going forward.","And so, as we refine capital allocation going into 2020 and we refine our budget going into 2020, we would give everybody more specific guidance. But it should be around where we see it today. It could be a little higher, could be a little lower.","In theory although, I think we've done a pretty good job, of getting things done today. We'll continue to work on, other step changes that may present themselves to us. But for now, I would say, until we have other renegotiations or new contracts that we would put in place, we feel pretty good about our run rate.","David Heikkinen","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice. Please go ahead.","Charles Meade","Good morning, Doug and Nick and Frank and rest of the team there.","Doug Lawler","Good morning, Charles.","Charles Meade","Thank you. I'd like to pick up on one of your answers to an earlier question you were talking about the Bell pad that validated your view of that black oil window. And, you talked about, how you're still trying to figure out the right way to complete those wells?","And I'm curious, did you vary your completion and\/or your, landing zone across those four wells, on that pad? And if you're not, iterating that way, how should we look for you to iterate as you try to triangulate it on the right recipe?","Frank Patterson","Yeah. I think its going to just come with more and more exposure Charles. When we took over the asset, we have to complete some wells that had already been drilled that were already drilled by the previous operator.","So we started in -- the first thing we wanted to do was get, our logistics down and get our stage count up. We've successfully done that. The team has done a fantastic job, as I stated in the commentary. What we're doing now is, we're starting to look at as you said, landing zones. We're looking at the actual design, and how much sand to put away.","We've reduced the amount of water. We're putting in the wells, which helps us both on the pump times as well as the flow back in handling fluid on the surface. And so, we're seeing a lot faster oil cuts, on flow back. This is just going to evolve over time.","We haven't completed that many wells yet. And as we complete more wells, I think you're going to see that we're going to start having an increase, in productivity as we learn more and more about, where to physically land the well, and exactly how to treat all the wells.","There is a lot of knobs to turn. And you just can't turn them all at the same time. You have to slowly work your way through. We're in a very, very nascent stage, of this development.","And I think you're going to see this thing evolve a lot like South Texas, where we get the spacing, the completion design all optimized, in pretty short order.","Charles Meade","Got it, that's helpful detail. Thanks for that, Frank. And then, if I could go back to the 2020 CapEx question and ask may be a bigger picture or ask it from a different perspective.","I get that you guys are shifting towards oil from -- away from natural gas. But wonder if you could talk about, how you're arriving at the total level of CapEx that, you're choosing? Because, it looks to me like you -- it looks like another meaningful outspend versus 2020 cash flows at least at the current strip. And so, maybe could you guys talk about your thought process that makes sense in terms of what is obligated CapEx perhaps to hold your lease position together and your key players and then maybe perhaps the next piece of the stack would be the work that you have to do to optimize your development plan along the lines what Frank was just talking about? How do you guys stack up the pieces to arrive at that total to two-level?","Nick Dell'Osso","Charles, so we really don't have an obligated CapEx or lease expiration or commitment that obligates us to a particular capital level. As we think about our capital allocation and flexibility that we have achieved over the past several years, we have tremendous flexibility in how we choose our CapEx program and where we direct those investments.","As we think about, how we generate the greatest value given any particular asset decline, given the margins that we're trying to capture, given the free cash flow development how we optimize, the NAV of the company over time, we will rigorously evaluate each of the investments. And what is great and I love is that we have a tremendous amount of flexibility. The capital efficiencies that have been driven into our program that resulted in lower breakevens we've seen.","As Frank highlighted in some detail, there that each of the asset area is the rate of change that we've accomplished results and greater productivity and greater capital efficiency. And so, we're not projecting a meaningful outspend in 2020 and we'll continue to evaluate pricing and the economics and how we best optimize the capital investment and the production over that near-term of one to two-year window.","We also continue to look at hedging. We haven't provided the guidance out there, but we've established some meaningful hedges for 2020. And we're confident in our ability to continue to perform and achieve our strategic metrics.","Charles Meade","Thank you, for that color Doug.","Frank Patterson","Only thing I would add to that Charles is that, as we think about where we want to be long-term which is obviously to be free cash flow positive, we want to be there in a way that is sustainable. And so the investments, we are making today are generating very strong returns. And as long as that is true, we will continue to make those investments, so that we can get to a level of cash flow that will be sustainable.","If prices fall much further, then we will relook at that as Doug noted we have that flexibility and that is something that with a diverse portfolio of assets that have some of them have extremely low breakeven costs all the way through gas in the Haynesville today, which is certainly at a level that pressures its economics. We have -- it's a competitive strength for us to be able to pick and choose where we spend our capital and make sure that we are earning a great rate of return on every well that we drill. And if we are doing that, then we will continue to invest in our program and build shareholder value. If we are not, then that capital will come down. It's pretty much as simple as that.","Charles Meade","Got it. Thanks.","Operator","And our next question comes from Josh Silverstein with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Josh Silverstein","Thanks, good morning guys. Just wanted to build on that last question there. Would you think sustainable free cash flow will come in 2021? And I guess Doug from your comments you guys do expect to be free cash flow negative next year. Just doing, I guess some of the math that you put out there if you take the $2.55 EBITDAX from this year hold it flat roughly $700 million of interest expense that's roughly $1.85 billion versus the CapEx spending of around Q2. So, should we be thinking that the outspend is less than that? So, I just wanted to clarify those comments.","Frank Patterson","Sure Josh. No, we have not provided guidance for next year. Obviously, pricing makes a big impact on that. And as we look, we are obviously going to be driving towards being free cash flow positive just absolutely as quickly as possible. And I think that the best thing to do is to look at the rate of change and what we've accomplished and the productivity of our wells continued improvement in our capital efficiency and we are definitely not saying that we're going to be -- have an outspend next year because as Nick highlighted, we have a tremendous amount of flexibility in our capital allocation.","And so the key is what he said and I'll reiterate is that, we have great flexibility in our program. We have tremendous assets. We'll continue to adjust and look for opportunities to further improve our productivity and capital efficiency and we'll continue to look at asset sales and how we can best manage the portfolio for long-term value.","And the progress that we've made up to this point in time gives us tremendous flexibility and options going forward. And so, I think the best thing to look at is that the rate of change and the stability that's in our company and program today will continue to build upon that in 2020 and 2021, we'll be pursuing that positive free cash flow just as quickly as we possibly can with the tremendous portfolio that we have.","Josh Silverstein","Got it. Thanks for that. And then just understanding the two times leverage target that you want to get to based on where you guys are right now, it's almost double that. Is the goal to delever through EBITDA growth faster? Or is it asset sales that will get you guys down faster?","Nick Dell'Osso","It's both and it will be as rapid as we possibly can and what makes the most sense for our long-term value-creation story, but there is no question that the strength and quality of the portfolio that we can do that organically with the growth that we expect from our oil assets and we will continue to monitor and look for opportunities with small and potentially bigger asset sales to accelerate that.","Josh Silverstein","Thanks guys.","Operator","And our next question comes from Kashy Harrison with Simmons Energy. Please go ahead.","Kashy Harrison","Good morning everyone. And thank you for taking my question. So just one quick one from me. Frank, in the press release you highlighted 10 years of inventory remained in the Marcellus at your current spacing assumptions. I'm just wondering if you could give us some color on how we should think about economic inventory in years across your major regions including the Eagle Ford, the PRB, the Haynesville, the Mid-Con and the Brazos Valley?","Frank Patterson","Okay, Kashy. So we were trying to describe kind of the core of the Marcellus. There is a lot more inventory there that's economic than what is stated. That's the $1.50 to $1.75 breakeven locations. So that's only a partial available inventory to us.","In Eagle Ford, and -- we can talk about Brazos Valley. Brazos Valley we're just getting started. We have a lot of locations available to us. Today, we're still trying to understand exactly how big the breakeven -- the low breakeven window is. It looks to be quite large. So I would say you have multiple years at the four rig program, and the inventory, it really depends on how many rigs you want to throw at it. We could accelerate Brazos Valley if we so desired. I think four rigs is a really good run rate for us operationally.","In South Texas, we have less runway there. We probably have three or four years in the lower Eagle Ford, then we have the Austin Chalk and the Upper Eagle Ford which will tag on to that. So it's probably one of our more mature assets.","In Gulf Coast, in the Haynesville, we have years of inventory. And if we go to a low rig count, which we will be doing in the near term zero to low rig count, it's just going to extend.","Mid-Conference, there is a lot of different plays available to us in the Mid-Con. The issue with the Mid-Con is that there is not one large play, it's a bunch of discrete plays, but there is thousands of locations available to us, if we wanted to push that lever. The nice thing about the Mid-Con is it's a very oily basin. So there is a lot of oil opportunity there.","And then the Powder, the Turner probably has another few years of run rate at the current rig deployment, but then the Nio is basically across our entire footprint and is well over 1,000 locations. Mowry will be very similar to that as we move forward. Then we have Parkman, Sussex and other formations available to us. So we have long runway in every single one of our assets that will be competitive in our portfolio.","Kashy Harrison","All right. That's it from me. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Neal Dingmann with SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Neal Dingmann","Good morning guys. Thanks for fitting me in. Doug, just a quick one for you and Nick. You talked all about and I know you've done a great job of accelerating the oil growth, and so I'm looking how good, how the returns look for both your Brazos and the PRBs. So I'm just thinking you want to decelerate -- I'm sorry, you want to obviously lower the leverage, and you're getting these type of returns would that consist of potentially increasing activity potentially even more in those plays? I'm just wondering how you sort of balance the two, I mean, given the deleveraging strategy and the returns you're seeing especially in the PRB and the Brazos?","Doug Lawler","Yeah, sure Neal. We're all very excited about it and encouraged by the capital efficiency and those productivity gains we're capturing. And indeed that there are opportunities for us to potentially accelerate, but the balance that we have to look at in this portfolio given that the debt that we have and incurring additional cost, we're just are very mindful of how we manage through this commodity volatility that we're seeing.","And so, we will constantly evaluate the option there. We see opportunities. We can increase the rigs in both assets, but we are targeted on the most efficient development plan that we can possibly capture. And we're not going to react to just one-month or two-month type of price particularly on oil.","We're looking for the long-term making adjustments on the gas, because of the greater macro issues that exist there. And it's always an option, but at present that's not something that we're thinking about.","Frank Patterson","Neal, this\u2026","Neal Dingmann","Okay. And then -- go ahead, I\u2019m sorry.","Frank Patterson","I\u2019m sorry. Neal, this is Frank. One thing to think about and I think we've spoken about this before that, we're not going to sacrifice efficiency in our assets. So, think, if you accelerate you have to accelerate both drilling and completion and align the two. But what you don't want to do is go drill a bunch of wells and end up with DUCs and shallow capital. So, when you think about expanding in any play, it might be more than one rig to match up with the completion grid.","Neal Dingmann","Great add, Frank. And then just lastly one quick one. Just Frank in the PRB without wine rack test in the West, what you're trying to get out of that, and could that change plans on a go forward?","Doug Lawler","Yeah. Neal, in the Western part of our play we actually have the Turner and the Frontier kind of sitting on top of each other. And it appears that there might be a frac buried between the two, and we're trying to find a way to access the entire storage of those two systems. So, it's kind of a combo cast between Frontier and the Turner, which they're kind of genetically the same they're just deposited from different ends of the basin. So, we're testing that concept. If that holds true and it works, you'll probably see additional wine racking on the west side of our field.","Neal Dingmann","Very good, thanks, guys.","Doug Lawler","Thank you.","Operator","And that's the end of question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Doug Lawler for any closing remarks.","Doug Lawler","Yeah, thank you, operator. We appreciate everyone joining us today. Just to reiterate once ahead, you'll continue to see Chesapeake execute on our priorities and driving change throughout all of our assets.","As we look to deliver record oil production and a record oil production mix in 2019 followed by the stated double-digit oil growth that we expect on relatively flat capital in 2020. We continue to be targeting and improve margins as we increase our production through lower GP&T and another cash cost. And as we noted, we will be reducing our gas activity and forecasting double-digit decline in gas in 2020 at current pricing.","We have a tremendous amount of confidence in our ability to continue with the momentum that we have and building on the rate of change that we've stated today, with our scale and diverse portfolio and disciplined approach to allocating capital with the highest return opportunities, we're very well-positioned to deliver value for our shareholders.","We thank you everyone for your time today.

Baird","","Operator","Good day and welcome to the 2012 Q3 Chesapeake Energy Earnings Conference Call. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jeff Mobley. Please go ahead, sir.","Jeff Mobley","Good morning and thank you for joining our 2012 third quarter earnings conference call. Joining me today is Aubrey McClendon, our Chief Executive Officer; Steve Dixon, our Chief Operating Officer; Nick Dell\u2019Osso, our Chief Financial Officer; as well as John Kilgallon and Gary Clark as part of the Investor Relations team.","Our prepared remarks this morning should last about 15 to 20 minutes and then we\u2019ll turn it over to Q&A. Aubrey?","Aubrey McClendon","Good morning. We especially appreciate those of you who are joining us from the Northeast Corridor today. We appreciate the effort you are making to be with us this morning and we hope your lives get back to normal as quickly as possible.","Turning to the 2012 third quarter, I would first like to highlight Chesapeake\u2019s strong operational achievements during the quarter. Our daily average production was up 24% year-over-year and 9% sequentially. We believe both measures will lead our large cap peers and rank as one of the very best operational performances for companies of any size in our industry.","Especially important is the steady transformation of our asset base from an exclusive focus on natural gas three years ago to a focus that today and in the future, will remain more balanced between natural gas and liquids production.","As evidence of the magnitude of our transformation, during the third quarter, our daily average liquids production was up 51% year-over-year and 10% sequentially. Those liquid growth percentages would have been even higher at 57% and 13%, respectively, if we hadn\u2019t rejected 467,000 barrels of ethane processing during the quarter because of very low ethane prices especially at Conway, Kansas.","Even more significantly, our daily average oil production was up 96% year-over-year and 21% sequentially. We believe it\u2019s very important for our investors to recognize that Chesapeake\u2019s liquids growth story is primarily an oil production growth story more than an NGL growth story. Obviously, not all liquids are made alike and so we are certainly focused on increasing oil production more than NGL production.","Starting from just 33,000 barrels per day of liquids production three years ago, in the 2012 third quarter, we produced an average of 143,000 barrels per day of liquids, a more than fourfold increase in just the past three years. We believe we remain on track towards achieving our goal of at least 250,000 barrels per day of liquids production in 2015.","I would also like to emphasize that our oil production growth is not from a single basin. We are seeing significant oil production growth not only from our biggest liquids play, the Eagle Ford, but also from eight other liquids-rich plays: the Cleveland, Tonkawa, Granite Wash, Hogshooter, Niobrara, Mississippi Lime, Marcellus, and Utica. We believe Chesapeake\u2019s multi-play liquids growth story is unique in our industry and its diversity helps greatly de-risk our future growth plans.","I would next like to highlight Chesapeake\u2019s continued progress on our asset sales program. As indicated in previous announcements, we are working hard to complete our big midstream asset sale by year-end 2012 and are also hard at work on sales of non-core portions of our Northern Eagle Ford and Mississippi Lime properties. Our goal remains to reduce the company\u2019s net long-term debt to less than $9.5 billion through value-creating asset sales and to keep our debt levels no higher than $9.5 billion in the future.","We have multiple sale \u2013 asset sales initiatives underway and we look forward to sharing additional details with you as we complete our two-year asset sales goals of $17 billion to $19 billion by year-end 2013.","Through these assets sales, we will have trimmed our portfolio back to just core of the core in virtually all of our plays. And that core of the core will have become virtually all HBP in most of our plays by year-end 2013. This strategic transformation into our asset harvest phase should lead to greater operational efficiency, which you are starting to see more clearly in today\u2019s results. And much higher returns on capital than we have experienced during the past seven years of new play identification and capture.","Turning to natural gas markets, much to the amazement of most observers, the market has overcome an almost 900 bcf storage surplus from just seven months ago to a year-over-year storage surplus today of just about 120 bcf. We believe the small remaining storage overhang should soon go into a year-over-year deficit, a quite remarkable turn of events from this past spring.","Furthermore, gas rig count has continued dropping almost every week. Winter weather patterns are shaping up to be very different than last winter\u2019s exceptionally warm winter. Natural gas demand is growing across all sectors of consumption. And coal to gas switching in the electrical generation market is proving stickier at higher gas prices than many assumed it would.","In short, after battling natural gas headwinds, driven by relentless supply growth for the past four years, we now expect to enjoy a multi-year rebound in natural gas prices driven by demand growth that is likely to be equally relentless. This move from a multi-year trend of natural gas headwinds to a multi-year period of natural gas tailwinds will have many positive implications for Chesapeake and its investors.","To highlight just how much we will benefit from strengthening natural gas markets, I\u2019d like to remind you that in 2013, every $0.10 per mcf change in natural gas prices roughly translates into $100 million of additional EBITDA.","In conclusion, we look forward to the completion of our 2012, 2013 asset sales, and more focused drilling activity that will lead over time to a balance between drilling capital expenditures and operating cash flow as we transition into our asset harvest strategy from our previous strategy of new play identification and capture.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Nick.","Nick Dell\u2019Osso","Thanks, Aubrey, and good morning. Q3 was an outstanding operational quarter for Chesapeake as Aubrey noted, featuring strong production growth, particularly in our liquids plays. Additionally, costs across the board were lower for the quarter, with the one exception being DD&A, which I\u2019ll address shortly.","I\u2019d like to point out that our impressive production and cost performance during the third quarter resulted in adjusted EBITDA of $1 billion, which was more than 15% above analysts\u2019 consensus estimates.","I\u2019d next like to discuss our announcement yesterday morning of our $2 billion term loan being offered to debt investors today. This loan will provide the company with additional financial flexibility through Q4 of this year and into next year as we balance the timing of asset sales and other balance sheet considerations.","Importantly, it will provide excess liquidity ahead of the winter, the presidential election and the potential year-end fiscal cliff. Debt market conditions remained very strong, so we expect this loan to price at attractive terms relative to our current debt structure.","Our $4 billion May 2012 term loan, which serves as a bridge to asset sales earlier this year has been paid down to $1.2 billion following the completion of our Permian sales and the proceeds from this new term loan will fully repay and terminate the May 2012 term loan at closing.","On the asset sales front, projects are progressing quite well. We continue to work towards the completion of our midstream sales and expect those to be completed before the end of the year. We\u2019re very pleased with the deal structure that we\u2019ve created whereby our midstream needs will continue to be met by the same talented teams that have been responsible for the largest and most rapid development of midstream infrastructure in the unconventional resource industry.","The contractual relationships we have with CMD and Access Midstream Partners are mutually beneficial and we are pleased to continue those relationships through the sale of our 100% interest in CMD. In addition to midstream, our other asset sales are progressing well with a few other new transactions currently in negotiations.","You may have noticed that we reduced the content of our outlook on schedule A at the back of our earnings release and are not currently providing guidance for asset sales for the remainder of 2012 and in 2013. Going back about a year ago, we added this incremental information on those subjects, in part because we expected asset sales to provide funding for the majority of our drilling program.","As we approach the end of 2012 and look forward to 2013, we expect to continue our announced asset sale goals as previously identified, but also expect to have sufficient visible liquidity on hand to cover the amount of any funding gap in 2013 as we complete our asset-based transformation and reduce our debt to no more than $9.5 billion.","The previous guidance we had around the overall magnitude of asset sales in 2012 to 2013 of $17 billion to $19 billion is still consistent with our plans in Q4 2012 and 2013. However, I will note that it is possible that some of the oil and gas sales transactions scheduled for Q4 could actually close in Q1 2013. We remain absolutely committed to reducing our net long-term debt to no more than $9.5 billion.","And if not achieved by December 31, 2012, we expect to accomplish this number one goal in early 2013.Our changes to our outlook also include a 1 million barrel increase in projected oil production for 2012, which reflects better than expected production results and is aided by minor delays in the previously anticipated completion of asset sales. These delays in closing are also the primary contributor to increasing our drilling and completion CapEx guidance and our outlook on schedule A by $250 million on the high end of our previous range. However, I\u2019m pleased to report that we were able to offset that increase by an equal $250 million decrease in projected leasehold spending.","Also, as a result of the higher oil production, improved gas prices, and high priced oil swaps that we added during the third quarter, we are increasing Chesapeake\u2019s estimated 2012 operating cash flow by $575 million from a midpoint of $3.225 billion to $3.8 billion. We are also increasing our 2013 operating cash flow projection by $500 million due to an increase in expected NYMEX gas prices from $3.75 to $4 per mcf, our strong oil hedges and a projected decrease in lease operating costs.","Please note that this combined increase of $1.1 billion in projected operating cash flow in 2012 to 2013, compared to our projection 90 days ago, also comes with no projected increase in combined leasehold and drilling CapEx for 2013.","Back to our earnings release, we did, as expected and discussed last quarter, have a non-cash ceiling test write-down this quarter. The full after-tax charge was $2.2 billion and also included the evaluation of unproved leasehold that we will allow to expire under our more focused drilling program on the core of the core of our asset base.","As we noted last quarter, focusing on the core of the core is a natural part of our shift to what we\u2019ve been calling harvest mode and will result in improved near-term and long-term returns on capital, as well as a more balanced overall cash flow profile.","With regard to proved reserves, continuing decreases in natural gas prices in each quarter of 2012 have led to price-related downward revisions of 4.9 tcfe year-to-date. Price-related revisions accounted for about 90% of our total proved reserve revisions. On the positive side of the ledger, we added 3.9 tcfe through the drillbit year-to-date, resulting in a net decrease of 2.6 tcfe or 14% since December 31, 2011 inclusive of production.","This is against a backdrop of SEC trailing 12-month pricing for natural gas reserves falling 31% to $2.83 per mcf. The ability of the company to replace 3.9 tcfe of proved reserves in the face of a 31% decrease in natural gas prices speaks directly to the success of our shift to a more balanced oil and gas asset base and the success we have with the drillbit this year in our newer liquids-focused plays.","As a reminder, this non-cash ceiling test is excluded from our covenant calculations under our revolving credit facility. One final note on this topic is that the timing of the two Permian sales not closing in the third quarter resulted in our DD&A rate temporarily spiking to $2 per mcfe during the third quarter. We expect this rate to settle back down following the completion of those sales and anticipate 2012 and 2013 DD&A of $1.65 to $1.85 per mcfe as shown in our outlook on Schedule A.","Moving on to the cost side of our business, we experienced a very nice sequential decrease in production expenses from $0.97 per mcfe in the second quarter to $0.84 per mcfe this quarter, a decrease of 13%. Across the board, both in the office and in the field we\u2019re generally seeing very good unit cost control trends and economies of scale as we ramp up liquids production. Accordingly, we have reduced our 2013 production cost guidance in Schedule A to $0.90 to $1 per mcfe from $0.95 to $1.5 per mcfe.","I would also like to point out that we saw a nice sequential downtick in G&A expenses per mcfe before stock-based compensation from $0.39 per mcfe in the second quarter to $0.34 per mcfe in the third quarter, a decrease of 13%.","Our drilling and completion CapEx for the quarter was $2.3 billion and has started to decrease significantly in September and October. The peak this year was 165 operated rigs active in January, and we were still running on average of 160 rigs in April. We are now operating only 89 rigs which represents a year-to-date decrease in operated drilling activity of 46%. The lag time between rig ramp down and the decrease in CapEx is now largely over and we are starting to see a material reduction in our monthly CapEx since our September drilling and completion CapEx was 18% lower than August, and October and November are showing significant incremental decreases as well.","Our leasehold CapEx is down significantly this year as we previously noted. I would like to try and clear up a bit of confusion in the tables in our release and note that the acquisition of proved and unproved properties in the cash flow statement, includes the VPP we repurchased in conjunction with our Permian sales. The reconciliation of oil and gas properties on page 16 of the release provides the best view of leasehold in the acquisition of unproved properties line.","On the hedging front, we now have swaps in place for approximately 76% of our fourth quarter oil production at an average price of $99 per barrel and approximately 69% of our projected 2013 oil production at an average price of $96 per barrel.","Additionally, we\u2019re now selling approximately half of our oil at LLS-based price and have recently hedged more than 35% of that basis exposure relative to WTI at an average premium of $14 per barrel for the first half of 2013.","On the gas side, we are pretty heavily hedged for Q4, but remain essentially unhedged for 2013 at this time as we await the further strengthening of natural gas fundamentals as gas production declines from Chesapeake and other major gas producers start to be felt in the marketplace.","I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to our COO, Steve Dixon.","Steve Dixon","Thanks, Nick. As Aubrey and Nick mentioned, CHK\u2019s third quarter was truly exceptional from a production growth standpoint. Rather than review the growth rates already mentioned by Aubrey and Nick and in the press release, I\u2019d like to provide some color around production in the quarter for each of our three products: oil, NGLs and natural gas.","Last quarter, we emphasized that oil production, much more so than NGLs, would be our primary growth driver going forward, and that was indeed the case during the third quarter. We averaged net oil production of approximately 98,000 barrels per day in the quarter, which is up a remarkable 18,000 barrels per day from the second quarter of 23%.","All of our key plays contributed to this quarter-over-quarter strength, but the Eagle Ford clearly led the way. Oil production would have been even higher than reported had we not experienced an unplanned plant outage in the Eagle Ford, which I\u2019ll address in a moment.","On the NGL side, reported volumes were down sequentially, about 9% compared to the second quarter. However, had we chosen not to reject approximately 7,400 barrels per day of ethane during July and August, NGL volumes would have been roughly flat with the second quarter. We do not anticipate rejecting as much if any ethanes during the fourth quarter, which should positively impact our reported NGL volumes in the coming quarter.","On the natural gas front, we are down to our target of 9 rigs drilling. That\u2019s five in Northern Marcellus, two in the Barnett, and two in the Haynesville. And as a reminder, last year, we were running as many as 81 natural gas rigs, so it\u2019s quite a remarkable turnaround for the nation\u2019s most active drilling program.","Despite that slowdown in drilling, natural gas production grew a robust 19% year-over-year and 9% sequentially during the third quarter. Reported natural gas volumes would have been even higher had we not experienced a significant downtime at a third-party processing facility in Southern Marcellus region. That said, we are now seeing the effects of our reduced gas drilling program and expect that the third quarter will be our peak quarter in terms of natural gas production.","In fact, 2013 is currently budgeted to be the first year in the company\u2019s 23-year history that our natural gas production will decrease year-over-year. It is the end of a remarkable era of industry-leading growth. It\u2019s also a great sign for a pending recovery in gas market fundamentals. We continue to project that our 2013 total company gas production will be down 7%. This outcome will be most notable in the Haynesville Shale where our gross production is expected to decline about 9% sequentially from the third quarter to the fourth quarter of this year.","Turning to specific plays, I\u2019d like to start with the Eagle Ford, which continues to deliver exceptional production growth. Third quarter net productions from the Eagle Ford was 52,200 boe per day, which is a 44% increase over the second quarter and a 371% increase year-over-year. While these results were better than expected, they could have been even better had we not experienced the outages at the Regency sour gas processing plant, which was effectively down the entire month of September.","We estimate that these outages forced the shut-in of approximately 8,000 barrels of oil per day, net to us during the month of September, and that would have translated into roughly a 5% higher liquids production than we actually reported during the quarter.","In the third quarter, we connected 124 wells in the Eagle Ford, which exceeded last quarter\u2019s exceptional performance of 121 well connections. Importantly, drilling cycle times continue to decrease and we are now down to just 15 1\/2 days from spud to rig release. This has enabled us to reduce our average rig count down from 34 in the second quarter to 26 in the third quarter, while actually growing our backlog of wells that are waiting on completion and pipeline connection. In fact, at the end of the third quarter, we had 233 wells awaiting completion and pipeline connection.","That\u2019s up from 220 wells in inventory at the end of the second quarter. This once again sets up a table for strong production growth in the fourth quarter and in 2013 and beyond. In addition to exceptional drilling and well connection performance, our completed well costs in the Eagle Ford have decreased substantially year-over-year, and the average per well production rates are continuing to increase.","For example, of the 124 wells we connected in the third quarter, 35% had peak production rates in excess of 1,000 boe per day, and 93% of those wells had peak rates in excess of 500 boe per day. This compares favorably to the second quarter in which it was 31% of the wells connected at peak rates over 1,000 boe per day and 91% had peak rates in excess of 500 boe per day.","Importantly, the production mix in the Eagle Ford is getting oilier also with 68% of our production during the third quarter coming from oil versus 66% in the second quarter. Moving on to the Anadarko Basin, we have five plays there, the Miss Lime, Cleveland, Tonkawa, Granite Wash, and the Hogshooter, which continue to provide steady liquids production growth.","At September 30, we had 31 rigs running in these plays and a combined third quarter net production of 97,000 boe per day, which is up from 88,000 per day during the second quarter. Production mix from these plays combined is also getting much oiler with 36% coming from oil in the third quarter compared to 34% in the second quarter.","In the Powder River Niobrara play, we are well underway on our drilling program, which will ultimately develop more than 1,200 locations in a liquids-rich, over-pressured core area in Converse County, Wyoming. It\u2019s where we have 33,000 acres under control. To date, we have drilled 25 wells in this core area. However, due to limited gas takeaway infrastructure and processing facilities, only 16 of these wells are actually completed and producing. But we expect a nice production ramp during 2013 from this area as indicated by very impressive test rates on \u2013 we\u2019re experiencing on recent wells.","I\u2019ll now turn to the Utica Shale, where we have a leading lease \u2013 where we are the leasing leasehold owner, driller and producer. We have 13 operated rigs currently working to evaluate our 1 million-plus net acres. In terms of number of rigs drilling, the Utica is the second most active of our 10 key plays, behind only the Eagle Ford.","We continue to focus our capital on the core of the wet gas area inside our JV with Total. To date, we\u2019ve drilled 134 wells in the Utica. However, only 32 of these wells are actually producing as we continue to build out necessary midstream processing infrastructure and takeaway capacity. Like the Powder River, we expect much more meaningful production contribution from the Utica in 2013.","In the meantime, we are continuing to drive down drilling cycle times and total well costs, as well as refine our completion techniques to deliver optimal hydrocarbon recovery. We expect to achieve excellent returns in the Utica and look forward to sharing these with you in the quarters ahead. To give you an idea of scope, we believe that our acreage position could support more than 4,000 wells in Utica Shale over the next couple of decades.","To summarize our operational efforts, we continue to ramp up to full development mode in several key plays and we are seeing reduced cycle times across the board. This is allowing us to maintain our well count and production targets while running fewer rigs and improving returns on capital.","Looking to the months and years ahead, we anticipate that two additional factors will enable us to greatly improve our drilling and capital efficiency. First is by focusing our operations in the core of the core. We will be drilling our highest rate of return prospects and secondly, which we transition out of an HBP mode and into more of an efficient harvest mode, we can focus on pad drilling, our equipment mobilization times will compress, our water handling logistics will get simplified, road and pad construction costs will decline, and many other economies of scales will be realized. While it\u2019s difficult to quantify with precision, we are targeting long-term capital efficiency improvements of at least 15% to 20% as we transition to pad drilling.","Speaking of CapEx, we expect to see a very material decrease in drilling and CapEx during the fourth quarter. Additionally, our leasehold spend now appears to be on track to come in as much as $250 million or 13% below our previous full year 2012 target of $2 billion.","Going forward, we plan to dedicate roughly 95% of our E&P CapEx towards drilling and completion and only 5% on leasehold. This will have a very positive impact on our all-in F&D cost. It has taken time and capital to transition Chesapeake\u2019s large natural gas production machine into an equally effective liquids production machine and we believe the majority of the heavy lifting is complete and we look forward to harvesting what we have sown.","To conclude my remarks, the shift to liquids is progressing ahead of expectations and is on target to achieve our long-term goal of 250,000 barrels per day in 2015. We believe our capital has been put to good use in this transition, having generated liquids production growth of 51% year-over-year and adding proved reserves of 750 million boe at a very attractive drilling and completion cost of $11.52 per barrel. Using SEC pricing, those added reserves are worth $8 billion in PV-10 or $10.68 per barrel.","Operator, we will now take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you. At this time, we will start the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) We\u2019ll take our first question from Doug Leggate at Bank of America.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America","Thanks. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Excuse me. I\u2019ve got a cough...","Aubrey McClendon","How are you doing, Doug?","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America","Not too bad, if I can get past my frog in my throat here. I\u2019ve got a couple of questions, please. First of all, on the disposals, the absence of any material commentary around the Mississippi Lime joint venture and the addition of some Eagle Ford and I don\u2019t know if this is actually correct, but there is also some murmurings about Hogshooter asset sales as well. I\u2019m just wondering if you can bring us up-to-date with the process and the additional assets you\u2019ve put in the \u2013 what appears you put in the pot as it relates to your refocusing strategy, particularly on the Mississippi Lime. It seems to be a little quiet there. Any color would be appreciated.","Aubrey McClendon","You got it, Doug. Thanks for your questions. Let me go in reverse order. The Hogshooter, not clear why there was so much confusion on this, but let me see if I can clear it up. We have an asset package out called West Turkey Creek. It\u2019s actually a Granite Wash package centered around the town of Elk City in Western Oklahoma. It\u2019s to the west of our Colony Wash play. Our teaser that the broker has out on it mentions that there is Hogshooter potential on this acreage, but it is primarily a Granite Wash package. And it is, gosh, I think close to 100 miles away from our big Hogshooter wells out in the Texas Panhandle. So, to be clear, we are not selling anything in the core of our Hogshooter production across the Texas Panhandle and it comes into a little bit of Far Western Oklahoma.","Then with regard to the Eagle Ford, we do have a portion of our Eagle Ford acreage, what we call the Northern Block that we have on the market today. That\u2019s I think being marketed through Jefferies. And that is a very attractive amount of acreage that we need to sell because we simply do not have the capital to go drill all the wells that are required there to HBP that acreage. We\u2019re more focused on the southern part of our block in what we call the wet gas area. This is all up in the oil area. And I think it has around 10,000 or 11,000 barrels a day of production at this point. So, it should be a very attractive package for another company, and again, we hope to have news on that by the end of the year.","With regard to the Miss Lime, it has been a long and frustrating process there because we really started out in late spring targeting Asian companies exclusively for a joint venture there. And with the recent turns in the CFIUS approval process for foreign companies investing in the U.S., it\u2019s become clear to us \u2013 it became clear to us around a couple of months ago that the notion of getting something done there could be more complicated than what we had thought before.","So, we pivoted and started to turn to the industry. So, we\u2019re in discussions with a number of companies about a portion of our assets there. Remember we have about 2 million acres there and this area we called JV1 is about 280,000 acres. So, we are still open for business there; we would consider a JV although at this point, probably happy to consider 100% sale as well. So, that\u2019s where we are on those two deals. Hopefully, we will have agreements on them by the end of the year. Outside chance that we could close one or both of them, but it\u2019s very likely that the actual closings will slip into the very first part of 2013.","Does that clear it up for you? Do you have anything else?","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America","That\u2019s good. I\u2019ve got one follow-up and one housekeeping, if I may. I guess this is for Steve. Steve, it\u2019s quite a while since we\u2019ve seen some of the curves that you gave us on type curves for some of these various different plays. And it looks at least to us that pretty much across the board, you\u2019re kind of hitting it out of the park in terms of production versus those indicators. How different is the core of the core, particularly in the Eagle Ford and the Miss Lime to the indications you gave us and what kind of running room do you think you\u2019ve got there? If I could just layer into that, when you\u2019re talking about the Eagle Ford, can I ask you what your choke policy is there? And then I\u2019ve got one follow-up, please.","Steve Dixon","Thanks, Doug, this is Steve. We\u2019ve been very pleased with our results really in all of our areas and the core of the core strategy allows you to focus on your best rates of return areas. We probably are exceeding a lot of our type curves areas and are in the process of updating those; excellent results to date.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America","So, no \u2013 so, we\u2019ll get those updates when we should expect some news on that some time or will you just continue to report quarterly?","Steve Dixon","We haven\u2019t been providing the specifics for a little while, Doug, and I don\u2019t know that that will change in the near future.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America","Okay. There\u2019s a bit of debate around the choke size, Steve. If you could tell us what you\u2019re running down there, that\u2019d be great.","Steve Dixon","These wells are free flowing so they are on choke. We \u2013 and most all of our liquids-rich plays, we don\u2019t open those up wide open. We keep back pressure on them. Multiple reasons for that; one is just for the equipment and facilities, to right size those to last through the longer life of the well. Some debate still on whether that actually increases your recoveries, but we\u2019re certainly pleased with the results we\u2019re seeing with our program.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America","All right. I\u2019ll leave it there, fellows. Thanks for your time.","Aubrey McClendon","Okay, Doug. Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Dave Kistler with Simmons & Co.","Dave Kistler \u2013 Simmons & Company","Morning, guys.","Steve Dixon","Morning, Dave.","Dave Kistler \u2013 Simmons & Company","Real quickly on the CapEx that you mentioned, Nick, and the decline in the drillbit CapEx spending. Can you walk us through how that relates to the rig count that you shared with us? Are you at the right level at this point to achieve that decline that you\u2019re targeting or should we expect to see additional declines in the rig count?","Nick Dell\u2019Osso","I think we\u2019re getting down to where we want to be in rigs. We\u2019re at 89 rigs today, but we\u2019re actually physically operating about nine more than that as we\u2019re still under a transition agreement in the Permian, but none of those dollars are obviously burdening us. So \u2013 but that\u2019s really where we probably ought to be today and there would be small fluctuations through the fourth quarter and into the first quarter of next year, but pretty representative of our \u2013 being done with our ramp down. So, yeah, what we\u2019re really seeing now is that the roll through of the lag of bookings coming down as rigs have come off is showing up in the numbers. So, we\u2019ll see that October and November continue to decline and then it should begin to flatten out into December.","Dave Kistler \u2013 Simmons & Company","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And maybe tying that a little bit to the Miss Lime, in the second quarter, you guys had talked about running 22 rigs throughout the balance of the year and it looks like right now you\u2019re at 9 rigs. Can you walk us through a little bit of what changed and why you\u2019re making those kinds of adjustments there?","Steve Dixon","Yes, Dave, this is Steve. Part of that is CapEx reduction, core of the core focus, but a big part of it is that we were outrunning our infrastructure there. These wells move a lot of water and so we need to get disposal systems built out, get electrification in place to be able to run those wells more economically. So, it was really that probably more than anything.","Dave Kistler \u2013 Simmons & Company","Okay. And then just one last one, if I might. With respect to taking out some of the typical disclosures that were in Schedule A, can you talk a little bit about what you\u2019re thinking about for spending in the oil service and midstream side of things? I think that was removed as well \u2013 I may have missed it somewhere else in the release.","Nick Dell\u2019Osso","You\u2019re right, Dave. We did move it \u2013 we did remove it. Midstream for 2013, we expect to be zero because we expect not to own it any further. And services will be down pretty well from 2012 as well. We\u2019ve largely completed our build-out of PTL, which is our pressure pumping business. And the combined total of midstream and all other \u2013 sorry, services and all other CapEx should be about $1 billion or in that neighborhood, but \u2013 which is not different than we\u2019ve said before, but we just felt that with the loss of midstream from the projections, it really became less interest on that number, so we took it out.","Dave Kistler \u2013 Simmons & Company","Great. I appreciate the clarification, guys. Thank you.","Nick Dell\u2019Osso","Yep. ","","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Neal Dingmann with SunTrust.","Neal Dingmann \u2013 SunTrust","Morning, gentlemen. Say, just two quick questions. First, Aubrey, just your thoughts on, you mentioned about going after the core of the core, and your thoughts in the Eagle Ford, obviously, the results look spectacular there. And just wondering on that reduction in rig count, does that just have to do with overall CapEx that Nick or Steve was suggesting or just maybe your thoughts on Eagle Ford sort of activity going forward?","Aubrey McClendon","Well, I think what we\u2019re seeing in the Eagle Ford as we\u2019re seeing across all of our plays is just quicker cycle times and we continue to drive those numbers down and so we can get done what we want to do with fewer rigs today than what we thought six months or a year ago. So, you can basically spend about the same amount of money, but you get far more wells with reduced cycle times. So, I think if you talk to service companies across the sector, particularly drillers, they will see that this is a phenomenon that\u2019s giving them a little bit of consternation that the industry is becoming so much more efficient.","So, as a consequence of lower cycle times and of needing to hit a glide path where our CapEx and operating cash flow are in balance in 2014, we have needed to reduce our CapEx across the company, and in 2013, we\u2019re planning for it to be about a third lower than it was in 2012. And so, we can\u2019t drill everything that we have; we\u2019re long assets and short capital. So, we are strategically moving towards the best parts of our plays and so, we\u2019ve identified an area in the Eagle Ford that we think will provide very attractive returns for a company that\u2019s not there or a company that\u2019s there and trying to expand its operations. For us, we will focus all of our efforts in the Eagle Ford down in the southern portion where I think Steve said we have another 3,000 or 4,000 wells to drill in that area.","Neal Dingmann \u2013 SunTrust","Aubrey, any HBP issues in kind of those top eight or nine plays that Chesapeake covers at which you\u2019re kind of referring to when moving these rigs around?","Aubrey McClendon","Well, that\u2019s certainly an important consideration and I think I said in my remarks that by the end of 2013, we should be largely HBP in most of our plays, that won\u2019t quite be true in the Utica, for example, but in the Marcellus, and the Eagle Ford and certainly in the Haynesville and the Barnett, where we\u2019re just about there today. We\u2019ll be in a position where we will have far more flexibility than we\u2019ve historically had.","And as Steve mentions, the returns that you get from drilling a second and third well on the pad compared to a first well are exceptionally better and so now that we have built an inventory of future wells to drill, and have incurred that heavy lifting of those costs, our returns on capital will go much higher.","I saw some work the other day that part of our company had done where we looked at in our top 10 plays, what percentage of our acreage was PDP, and it was less than 10% and yet the HBP portion of it was well over 50%. So, you\u2019re beginning to see that we have a lot of acreage held that\u2019s not yet on our reserve books, and that would be the focus of the company for the years to come.","Neal Dingmann \u2013 SunTrust","Okay, very good, and then last one if I could, just on the Utica, obviously, a number of \u2013 a large number of wells drilled there, but not tied in yet. Your thoughts on timing of when you could get to that sort of equilibrium point looking at next \u2013 is that something next year or will you be running such and the build-out will be such on midstream that it might take even longer than next year?","Steve Dixon","Neil, this is Steve. I\u2019ll answer that. We are working hard building both pipelines, but then also processing facilities need to be put in place. And some of those take longer lead times, but 2013, we have a lot of processing coming on and again construction every day on the pipelines to get these wells hooked up. So, 2013, we\u2019ll see a big, big increase.","Neal Dingmann \u2013 SunTrust","Got it. Thank you all.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from David Tameron with Wells Fargo.","David Tameron \u2013 Wells Fargo","Hi, good morning. Aubrey, in the guidance, there\u2019s a little line in there about this \u2013 I guess the forward guidance remains at the risk of the Board or Operating Committee adjusting that going forward. Has the Board signed off on this 2013 or do you anticipate any other changes for 2013 as you go through the next few months?","Aubrey McClendon","Yeah. Dave, good question. Where we are is our Board meeting in December is geared towards discussing our 2013 budget. That\u2019s kind of the rhythm that most oil and gas companies have. So, we had other issues that we wanted to focus on, and September and December will be the time where we address the budget. So, that\u2019s why we\u2019ve said that we don\u2019t have an officially approved 2013 budget. But obviously, we have to have a plan that we\u2019re working on right now and that\u2019s the plan that we\u2019ve laid out today, but certainly it\u2019s subject to further discussion with the Board.","David Tameron \u2013 Wells Fargo","Okay. Thank you. And then for \u2013 a couple of bigger picture questions. On the ethane front, you talked about or Steve did maybe, you talked about ethane rejection in the quarter. Can you give us your outlook for 2013? How you see those markets and have you guys built any assumptions into your guidance?","Aubrey McClendon","Yes, we continue to build low NGL prices in our budget driven by low ethane prices. And we, obviously, have an oversupply of NGLs, primarily ethane. Actually some of the NGL components are above the prices where they were a year ago. But this is going to take a couple years for the demand for those products to increase. Propane would certainly be something that would benefit from a colder winter than last year. So, in our view, these things are all getting fixed through demand growth and also you\u2019ll see, I think two pipelines completed in 2013 that will connect Conway to Belvieu. So, the huge differentials that you\u2019ve seen during 2012 in Conway compared to Belvieu should go away.","So, we try to move as much of our product to pricing at Belvieu, but we still have substantial exposure to Conway. So, we look for low prices in 2013 but steady improvement by the back half of the year into 2014 with, of course, a normal winter being quite beneficial to us on \u2013 across the board on NGLs.","David Tameron \u2013 Wells Fargo","Okay. And then last question \u2013 and that\u2019s helpful color. The last question on the natural gas front \u2013 and obviously you laid out your case for a bullish scenario, but why not go ahead and take some risks off the table and hedge out that \u2013 your 2013 program a little bit? What \u2013 can you give us your thought process around that?","Aubrey McClendon","Sure, I\u2019d be happy to. So, for starters, we like to hedge. We\u2019ve been successful hedgers, about $8.8 billion of hedging gains since 2006. So, it\u2019s something that we talk about every day, our hedging committee is Jeff, and Nick and myself.","And so, we\u2019re charged with mitigating risk but also with optimizing returns and our view of the market is driven by information that we have that maybe not everybody else has in terms of where we think our production is headed and how we model the production of our competitors as well.","And we simply view that today\u2019s strip for 2013 and frankly, for years beyond that, does not reflect a full appreciation of what happens when big producers like us reverse course and go in to managed decline. And as Nick said in his remarks, we\u2019ll be down 7% year-over-year. That will be the first year in 23 years that our company had experienced a gas production decline, Chesapeake has been responsible for about 30% of all the gas production growth the whole industry has generated in the past five years.","And so, when we roll over, we think we will pull the whole market with us and we think that the prices that we see out in 2013 do not reflect that. In fact, I saw one Wall Street piece even this morning that projected the Haynesville will be flat to up in 2013 gas production. That\u2019s simply impossible. Our production is already down 25% from a peak. Our Barnett production is already off 11% from its peak. Steve mentioned that our Haynesville production will be declining by 9% quarter-over-quarter, third quarter to fourth quarter.","David Tameron \u2013 Wells Fargo","Okay. So, even the Marcellus kick that we\u2019re going to get with the additional infrastructure -?","","Aubrey McClendon","Yeah. We just don\u2019t see \u2013 I mean, we model all that; we\u2019re the biggest producer in the Marcellus and we just don\u2019t see the Marcellus being able to overcome the declines that are going to happen in the Haynesville and in the Barnett along with all the other conventional gas that today, of course, still represents about more than 50% of all the gas production in the U.S. So, it\u2019s simply a matter of trying to pick our spot and we haven\u2019t yet seen our spot, but we will \u2013 by the time that we talk again, after the first of the year, my guess is that we would have started to layer in some hedges.","We are...","David Tameron \u2013 Wells Fargo","All right, I appreciate.","Aubrey McClendon","Yes. We are very well-hedged on oil. I would like to point that out.","David Tameron \u2013 Wells Fargo","Thank you.","Aubrey McClendon","Thank you, Dave.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Scott Hanold with RBC Capital Markets.","Scott Hanold \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Thanks. Just a follow-up on that sort of gas price question. When you all step back and look at your drilling activity, I know in the past you\u2019ve said before that your gas plays have to compete with your oil plays \u2013 plays on a heads-up basis. Can you give us a little bit more color, I mean, if gas got to $5 to $6, I mean, and oil was in this $85, $90 range, does that start making that transition back to gas happen again?","Aubrey McClendon","Yeah, and, Scott, to be clear, you said $5 to $6, right?","Scott Hanold \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Yes, that\u2019s right, that\u2019s right. And $5-plus \u2013 so let\u2019s just say $5-plus, get above $5, yeah.","Aubrey McClendon","Well, certainly $4 to $5, we\u2019ve said then no change in our approach. $5 to $6 we\u2019d probably \u2013 we would evaluate and take a look. The Marcellus is certainly competitive with oil projects at inside that $5 to $6 range. The Haynesville and Barnett it still may be a toss-up, but remember also, we and other companies still have acreage that needs to be HBP on the oil side. So, just as rig activity was sticky on the gas side when economics indicated that you might reduce your count, the industry kept it pretty high because it needed to convert options with a one or two-year life to them to options that have no expiration to them. And you\u2019ll see that on the oil side as well.","Scott Hanold \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay. So, you sense that the rig count could be pretty sticky with the oil plays here for at least the next few years is generally what...","Aubrey McClendon","Yes, that\u2019s what you\u2019ll see from us.","Scott Hanold \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay. All right. And then on the Utica Shale, I think when you all first started talking about this play pretty aggressively, you had sort of dubbed it as better than the Eagle Ford or something pretty close to that. And with obviously over 100 wells now drilled and a few dozen on line, what are your thoughts right now? Does it \u2013 it seems like it\u2019s a little bit more gassy with some of the results. And how does your kind of the core of the core strategy work in the Utica? When do you think you could really start fine tuning that a little bit better?","Aubrey McClendon","Well, I think we have a really good handle on where the core of the core is and we feel like we own it in Columbiana and Carroll and Harrison Counties. And so, we went after the wet gas here. We picked up some oil acreage in some of our deals and haven\u2019t been in the process of really selling the oil acreage to companies that we\u2019re more focused on that part of the play than us. So, I think in the wet gas \u2013 the best of the Utica wet gas is absolutely competitive with the best of the Eagle Ford wet gas.","And so, the question is really is \u2013 has the area of wet gas narrowed somewhat? Probably it has a little bit. But so did the Eagle Ford wet gas window and we\u2019ve dealt with that. And we have acreage in the right spot for the Eagle Ford wet gas; and then Utica, I think, our Utica wet gas acreage is between 300,000 and 400,000 acres out of our million-plus acres there. So, we\u2019re thrilled with the Utica. It\u2019s just taken a while to be able to show results because we simply are waiting on midstream build-out to occur which will be starting in 2013 and extend on into 2014.","So, I think if you look around and look at the wells that Gulfport\u2019s announced and some of the other wells that other companies have announced that if you\u2019re in that corridor which stretches from Columbiana down through Carroll and Harrison, and maybe a little further south from there, you have results that are as good as any from any play in the country.","Scott Hanold \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Understood, thanks. And one real quick one. I think, Steve, you may have mentioned that you are running nine rigs on the Permian obviously for the purchasers. Nick, could you just give a little color? How does that run through the financials? Will we be seeing some of that rolled through Chesapeake CapEx and back out somewhere else or is that going to be sort of a non-impact to any kind of CapEx you could report in the fourth quarter?","Nick Dell\u2019Osso","It\u2019s a non-impact. We do that through a Transition Services agreement.","Aubrey McClendon","So, basically we just bill them for 100% working interest and they pay us for that.","Scott Hanold \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Understood, thanks.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Jason Gilbert with Goldman Sachs.","Jason Gilbert \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I\u2019m going to ask you my usual one on CapEx. Spending was higher in the quarter than I think any of us had been expecting. I was just wondering if you could talk about what drove this, if it was HBP or rig \u2013 term rig contracts? And in our numbers, 4Q CapEx is going to have to be down something like 30% in order to meet your guidance. So, I was just wondering if you can elaborate on how nimble you can be in reducing the spending? I know you spoke to it a little bit in the prepared comments, but just wanted some more detail.","Nick Dell\u2019Osso","Sure, Jason. The short answer is we can \u2013 you can call it nimble or you can call it, I guess, completed. But at the current rig count, we\u2019re there. So, it\u2019s really a matter of the lag from the ramp-down that you see rolling through. And one of the things to keep in mind here is that as you bring rigs off, which we\u2019ve been doing since, I guess, mid to late spring, you still have a number of associated costs after the rigs go away. You have frac crews that have to complete their work on the wells that have been drilled. You have other mobilization costs, et cetera. And so, that has taken more time than any of us probably anticipated to run through the system.","But we are absolutely seeing the lower month-over-month numbers now that will drive us to exactly where you\u2019re looking fourth quarter. I agree with your assessment of the decrease that\u2019s required and we think we\u2019ll hit it. We\u2019re on target to do so.","Aubrey McClendon","Jason, I might also mention that we did take the high end of our CapEx estimate for the year up by $250 million but apparently some people lost the point that we also reduced our leasehold spend by an equal amount of $250 million. So, leasehold is really a forward-looking indicator of CapEx and it has really fallen off in the last few months and will continue to decline further and we\u2019re taking it from $1.750 billion in 2012 to only $400 million in 2013. So, that run rate is dropping very aggressively as well. So, I hope people do recognize that net-net we ended up flat on our CapEx guidance.","Nick Dell\u2019Osso","And then the...","Jason Gilbert \u2013 Goldman Sachs","That\u2019s...","Nick Dell\u2019Osso","Go ahead, Jason.","Aubrey McClendon","Go ahead, Jason.","Jason Gilbert \u2013 Goldman Sachs","That\u2019s helpful. I appreciate that. I had a follow-up also on the Haynesville. And I was just wondering, what is the longer-term strategy for that asset? Based on your comments, it sounds like you need at least $5 gas, and possibly higher to have it compete with oil projects, and it\u2019s also got to compete with the Marcellus. I mean, is this an asset you still consider to be core?","Aubrey McClendon","Yes, it\u2019s one of our 10 core assets along with Barnett and eight others. So, and I think it\u2019s a great point that people are not fully appreciating which is that I think there\u2019s a case out there for gas prices that most people aren\u2019t willing to contemplate because they run individual well math that says, oh, at $4.50 or $5 or $5.50, you can make money drilling that Barnett well or that Haynesville well.","And, yes, the answer is you could, but capital is always scarce and, as a consequence, you have to pursue projects that have the best returns. And today those best returns are in plays like the Eagle Ford, the Utica and other liquid-focused plays. And that will remain the case. And we are comfortable with our gas production continuing to decline for as long as is required for gas prices to become attractive enough for us to take rigs away from oil plays and go put them in gas plays.","And so, right now, we have one of the biggest gas storage reservoirs in the world sitting there in the Haynesville and sitting there in the Barnett and sitting there in the Marcellus. And it has incredible option value and I think what you\u2019ll see is the demand for gas increase over the next one to five years to get to a point where the gas curve is going to have to go be competitive with the oil curve for projects for additional drilling in these fields. And when the gas curve pays us to take on those responsibilities of drilling those additional wells, we\u2019ll do so. But not until then.","Jason Gilbert \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Great. And one final one, if I may. Just is there any update on the additional Utica JV you\u2019ve mentioned in the past as to what timing might be there?","Aubrey McClendon","Sure. That project we talked about in 2013 that would be a JV on the dry gas side. So, just to remind everybody, we have a JV with Total on the wet gas side. And we do not have a partner on the dry gas side. So, we\u2019re \u2013 that\u2019s a 2013 project and we anticipate that gas prices will become attractive enough during 2013 to get some interest there.","There\u2019s lots of companies that are looking to export gas from the U.S. who need some domestic exposure. And as a consequence of that, we think we will have plenty of people to take a look at it. And the results, I would say, on the dry gas side of the Utica are very, very strong, and in fact, quite competitive with what we see in the Marcellus in the northeastern part of the dry gas play, the Northeastern Marcellus.","Again, it\u2019s not something that you talk about very much in a time of low gas prices. But we have drilled a number of Utica dry gas wells that are very strong and will generate rates of return competitive with our Marcellus drilling.","Jason Gilbert \u2013 Goldman Sachs","But to be clear, that process has not started yet, right?","Aubrey McClendon","It has not started. It\u2019s a 2013 process. You\u2019re right.","Jason Gilbert \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay. Great. Thanks so much. I\u2019ll turn it back.","Aubrey McClendon","Okay. Thanks, Jason.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Good morning.","Aubrey McClendon","Hi, Brian.","Nick Dell\u2019Osso","Good morning, Brian. Brian Singer \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Just following up on the Utica. Can you talk a bit more towards production mix, oil, NGLs and gas given the variability that we\u2019ve seen in some of the wells that have been drilled and then some more detail on backlog changes and the gas contribution you expect from Utica in the context of your 7% overall gas decline next year?","Steve Dixon","Hi, Brian. This is Steve. I\u2019ll start on that. I mean, like the Eagle Ford, the Utica has a dry gas window, wet gas window and oil window, and so with very limited well results to date, it\u2019s really weighted towards wherever those wells are. And so, it\u2019s \u2013 I don\u2019t think you can say that it\u2019s going to be gassier or oilier. It\u2019s really where the well mix is producing. We\u2019re very, very pleased with the results. We\u2019re very pleased with what we think hydrocarbons in place are in the Utica. So, it\u2019d really just be where processing midstream and the wells get drilled.","Brian Singer \u2013 Goldman Sachs","I guess, to be specific, what percent gas do you expect and what percent oil do you expect from the core wet gas or whatever you would call core of core that drives the strong rates of return versus the Eagle Ford?","Aubrey McClendon","Brian, this is Aubrey. I\u2019m looking at something that our natural \u2013 our NGL yield is about 40% to 45%. And I\u2019m sorry that I don\u2019t have the break between processed gas and oil but we can get back with you on that. But again, it\u2019s pretty consistent with what we\u2019ve seen in wet gas plays like in the Eagle Ford. But we\u2019ll \u2013 we can get back with you off line.","Brian Singer \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay, that\u2019s great. And then speaking of the Eagle Ford, when you think about core of core and I apologize if you mentioned this already, can you just talk about the acres that you would put in the core of core and has it been those acres that has been the major driver so far of the production increases that we\u2019ve seen recently?","Aubrey McClendon","I\u2019m sorry, which were you referring to, a particular play or just...","Brian Singer \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Yes, I\u2019m sorry, in the Eagle Ford shale. When you think about the north versus south in the core of core, how many acres would you call the core of core and have those acres been the major driver of your growth here in the last couple of quarters?","Aubrey McClendon","I don\u2019t have the exact percentage, but it\u2019s going to be probably in the 60% to 65% range. And, yeah, it\u2019s definitely \u2013 those have been the ones driving it, although I think I did say that our gross production is around 10,000 or 11,000 barrels of oil per day on what\u2019s for sale and so obviously a disproportionate part of our production is in the southern part of the play.","Back to your Utica comment, I mean one thing you could do is just look at three wells that we\u2019ve highlighted there and add up our liquids production compared to natural gas production and come up with a percentage of natural gas.","Brian Singer \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Do you think those wells are representative of the averages that we\u2019ll see on a going-forward basis for your acreage?","Aubrey McClendon","In the core, wet gas phase, absolutely, yeah.","Brian Singer \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay. That\u2019s great. And then lastly, it was asked earlier on the \u2013 you talked about the December Board meeting and the 2013 budget. Would you expect any meaningful changes as a result of that Board meeting in terms of the operational plans, any major shifts in growth that you\u2019re projected out of spend when all is said and done?","Aubrey McClendon","Brian, I really can\u2019t speculate on that at this time. We\u2019ll just have to have the discussion, see where oil and gas prices are and see how our plays stack up and make those decisions at that point. And as soon as those decisions have been made, we\u2019ll be able to get back to you.","Brian Singer \u2013 Goldman Sachs","That\u2019s great. Thank you.","Aubrey McClendon","Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Biju Perincheril with Jefferies.","Biju Perincheril \u2013 Jefferies","Hi, good morning. A couple of questions. On the reserves front, there was a sizeable negative provision. Can you give some color where that is and what drove that? Not price-related revisions.","Steve Dixon","Predominantly, it was all price-related. We had some that were just aged PUDs come off but it was not a big number, Biju, it was pretty much price-related.","Nick Dell\u2019Osso","The other aspect of that, of course, is that with lower rig counts, there\u2019s PUDs that we no longer can model within our five-year rule. So, as we\u2019ve lowered our rig count this year, we have to remodel what will fit as PUDs and so there\u2019s a component that includes that.","Biju Perincheril \u2013 Jefferies","Got it. So, would it...?","Nick Dell\u2019Osso","The reserves are still \u2013 of course, the reserves are still on the ground and to the extent acreage is held-by production, we\u2019ll get to them in better price times.","Biju Perincheril \u2013 Jefferies","Okay. Okay. And then, on slide 12 of your latest deck, if I look at the growth coming from associated gas, you are forecasting a lower number now as compared to the previous slides. Is that just lower drilling activity or a shift in your mix where you\u2019re drilling or are you expecting any lower productivity in any of the areas?","Aubrey McClendon","Certainly not lower productivity. I think that\u2019s related to just lower activity overall as we seek to glide down to our projected CapEx for 2013.","Biju Perincheril \u2013 Jefferies","Okay. And then one last question on the CapEx. Can you talk about sort of your monthly rate where you are now with sort of 89 rigs versus where you were, I think, over close to 120 rigs a quarter ago?","Nick Dell\u2019Osso","Yes. Biju, I\u2019ll just repeat what I said before which was September was down 18% from August and October looks to be down pretty significantly again and then we expect November to be a further decline from there. So, again, it doesn\u2019t tie on a calendar perspective exactly with when the rigs come off because there\u2019s a lag in the bookings and there\u2019s a lag in the associated capital that comes behind the rigs. So, it\u2019s a little bit hard to tie it to exactly when the rigs come off, but I\u2019ll just, again, guide you back to what we are seeing in month-over-month changes which is very material.","Biju Perincheril \u2013 Jefferies","Got it. All right. Thank you.","Jeff Mobley","I believe we have time for about two more questions, particularly out of courtesy to other companies and their earnings calls. So, operator, if you could open it up for a couple more.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.","Charles Meade \u2013 Johnson Rice","Thanks, guys, for letting me be one of these last two. This will be quick.","Nick Dell\u2019Osso","Hi, Charles.","Charles Meade \u2013 Johnson Rice","Can you tell us where you are and kind of what the remaining tasks are to get the CMD divestiture closed and does it make sense to think about it in like a percentage of completion?","Nick Dell\u2019Osso","We probably have some work plans around here with a percentage of completion on them. But, no, it doesn\u2019t really make sense to think about it like that. Look, this is our fifth deal that we\u2019ve done with GIP over the last several years when you include the original transaction and the drop-downs that we\u2019ve completed taking the MLP public, et cetera.","So, we know these guys well. We have a high degree of confidence in where we\u2019re headed. This is across multiple basins. Some of our partners are, of course, impacted here. And we need to talk to them about what we\u2019re doing and we\u2019re in the process of doing all that. So, it\u2019s just a big complicated process with have a lot of paper to move and we\u2019re progressing forward with it as expeditiously as we can.","Charles Meade \u2013 Johnson Rice","Got it. Thank you. And then I wanted to go back to one comment that you guys made a couple of times in your prepared remarks when you said that you were going to stay at or below $9.5 billion of total debt going forward. What is the timeframe on that or what are the kind of the conditions associated with that? Because it doesn\u2019t really make sense as a perpetual goal.","Nick Dell\u2019Osso","Well, I think that\u2019s a fair comment, Charles, other than the fact that we really believe that our balance sheet got stressed over the last several years as we made a transition and then that transition occurred during a time of very low natural gas prices. So, we acknowledge that we would like to have less debt on our balance sheet.","As reserves and production grow into the future, we could always choose to revisit that. But for the period we see in front of us, we would like to be clear that the company knows or has a view as to what an appropriate level of debt is and we\u2019re going to get there and stay there. So, we\u2019re not ones to say never about anything, but on this one, we\u2019re pretty firm about where we want to be and we\u2019re going to stay there for the time being. So, things could change over the future to impact that, but for now, we\u2019re focused on that goal.","Charles Meade \u2013 Johnson Rice","Great. Thank you, Nick. That\u2019s it for me.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our last question today from Michael Hall with Robert W. Baird.","Michael Hall \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Thanks. I guess, just one quick one for me. As I think about backlogs and efficiencies, I know you talked a lot about it on the call. I guess, first, what\u2019s the current backlog up in the northeastern part of the Marcellus from your all\u2019s side of things? And then second, do you have any sort of estimates around what sort of capital is associated with bringing the backlogs on, particularly in the Eagle Ford and also the Marcellus, and the timeline for reducing those down to what you might call a more normalized level? Sorry, a few questions in there.","Aubrey McClendon","I know. We got it. I think Steve is going to take these, just gathering information.","Michael Hall \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Thanks.","Steve Dixon","In the Marcellus, we still have over 200 wells in backlog. We took quite a few of those off already this year. And we\u2019ll plan on reducing that further in 2013.","Aubrey McClendon","And I think that\u2019s in our press release, in the Eagle Ford, for example, we have 233 wells that have been drilled...","Michael Hall \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Right.","Aubrey McClendon","Aren\u2019t producing. But none of those are really what you would consider backlog waiting on a whole lot of infrastructure and most of that is in a spot where it\u2019s the normal course of business.","Michael Hall \u2013 Robert W. Baird","I guess, that\u2019s \u2013","Nick Dell\u2019Osso","And we do project the capital for that as well or do our best to project the capital for that as well. So, it should not lead to \u2013 that in and of itself we hope won\u2019t lead to surprises in CapEx.","Michael Hall \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Okay. Any willingness to disclose that capital or no?","Nick Dell\u2019Osso","I still think I have it split out here but...","Aubrey McClendon","Basically, our well costs are about half for drilling and about half for completion, so you can always work off that.","Nick Dell\u2019Osso","But some of those wells will have already been completed and just waiting on a pipeline and require very little capital. Some are waiting on completion. So, there\u2019s just a variety of things in that mix.","Michael Hall \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Okay, fair enough. And then as you think about these drilling efficiencies that the industry and yourselves are seeing, I mean, is it fair to think that as you get surprised to the upside, if you will, on efficiency gains that drives some sort of creep higher in capital as you\u2019re unable to react to all that real-time to those efficiency gains?","Aubrey McClendon","We would simply reduce rig count. I mean the focus is on what\u2019s the right level of capital and the course that we can do that, with fewer rigs then obviously that\u2019s the best outcome for our shareholders. So, we and others in the industry are continuing to try to get more efficient and to the extent we can use fewer rigs to develop our properties over time, that will be a very good thing for all of us.","Michael Hall \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Got it, great. Thanks, I appreciate it.","Aubrey McClendon","Okay. Thanks, everybody. We appreciate your participation today. If you have any follow-up questions, Jeff and the rest of his team are available for you.

Doug will begin the call, and then turn the call over to Nick for a review of our financial results before we turn the teleconference over for Q&A.","So with that, thank you, and I will now turn the teleconference over to Doug.","Robert Douglas Lawler - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Thank you, Brad. Good morning and thanks for joining our call this morning. Chesapeake continued to deliver our business as planned in the second quarter. We have several exciting well results that prove the quality and strength of our portfolio and provide confidence in our capital efficiency and operational performance. As a reminder, our 2017 capital program was designed to improve our margins and increase cash flow following a production decline resulting from asset sales and low capital investment in 2015 and 2016.","We are reiterating, today, our full year guidance for capital and production, as previously disclosed. I'm pleased to share that the value and capital efficiency of our investments continue to improve through our extended lateral expertise and completion technologies. We're on track to deliver our 2017 oil growth target of 10% and we expect to exceed our goal of 100,000 barrels of oil per day prior to year-end. This production target is a leading indicator of our strategic goal of restoring the company's cash flow. We're pleased to see that oil production coming online, and I'd like to highlight the improvements in our EBITDA per boe, which has more than doubled from a year ago. These are important metrics to monitor as we position the company for growth within cash flow and increased returns on capital.","Production in the second quarter averaged over 528,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, flat compared to our first quarter production. In July, we have already seen a significant uptick in production from the second quarter average to approximately 548,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. We expect our production will accelerate further beginning in August as we plan to place on production approximately 60 wells in this month alone. In the second half of 2017, we expect to turn-in-line approximately 250 wells, representing more than half of our total turn-in-lined wells for the year.","Just turning to the assets quickly, in Western Dimmit County, in South Texas, we are in the process of bringing online 20 wells that have some form of enhanced completion design. Our oil growth trajectory for the company for the remainder of 2017 is primarily driven by the Eagle Ford. For the second half of 2017, we expect to place roughly 100 wells online in South Texas compared to 61 wells turned-in-line during the first half of 2017. In the Powder River Basin, we are presently operating two rigs and we plan to add a third rig in October. We're very encouraged by the results we have seen from our first Turner and Parkman wells along with the early results from our first Mowry well.","Our first two Turner wells continue to outperform our pre-drill expectations. These two wells have each recorded cumulative equivalent production of 224,000 barrels, approximately 78% oil, and 134,000 barrels, approximately 46% oil, respectively, after 142 and 76 days online, respectively. We plan to dedicate the third rig exclusively to additional Turner development and place another four wells on production in the Turner this year.","Our first Mowry wells provide confirmation of what we estimate to be a significant resource. While it has only unloaded 21% of the fracture stimulation fluid pumped, it has reached a peak rate of over 6 million cubic feet of gas per day with a relatively short lateral. We have seen spot rates as high as 7.6 million cubic feet of gas during flowback, but as noted, the well is still flowing a large volume of frac fluid.","We drilled this well in a gas window, essentially, as a proof-of-concept well to test productivity, permeability and pressure, and it is strategically located near existing infrastructure to minimize cycle times and maximize value. We've taken two cores in the oilier area this year, and each showed good saturation. Our plan will be to move into this oilier area and drill a longer lateral on our next well. Powder River Basin will also contribute to our oil growth target in 2017, as we plan to put 19 wells to silv (05:37) in the latter half of the year compared to nine wells in the first half of the year.","In the Mid-Continent, our produced water cut is on the high end of expectations and putting pressure on the economics of our North Meramec wells. We continue to redesign our completion techniques and we'll redeploy capital from this program as necessary as we evaluate new results.","In the Marcellus, we have begun testing different completion designs and flow capacities. Our early results from the McGavin well are nothing short of outstanding. We started flowback on the McGavin well last Friday, and after six days it has already reached a peak rate of 61 million cubic feet of gas per day, making it the highest-rate well we have operated in the Marcellus and possibly the highest-rate well ever recorded in Northeast Pennsylvania. We will continue to be \u2013 to test enhanced completion in many of the 40 or so remaining wells we plan to place on production in the Marcellus by year end.","Finally, in the Haynesville Shale, we recently drilled and completed a 7,500 foot lateral well in DeSoto Parish with a peak rate of over 38 million cubic feet of gas per day, or nearly 5.15 million cubic feet of gas per 1,000 lateral feet. This result is particularly important because this well is located outside of the Springridge area where the majority of our recent success has taken place. This well's performance gives us additional encouragement as we prove the concept of long laterals and enhanced completions across our entire acreage position.","We also performed our first Haynesville recompletion utilizing a new production liner. Peak production from this refrac reached almost 9 million cubic feet of gas per day from a lateral of only 2,990 feet. This is an encouraging result and we look forward to doing more refracs in 2018.","In the first six months of 2017, we've made good progress at increasing our EBITDA through growing oil production, keeping our cash costs low and reducing our market commitments and obligations by approximately $585 million. Looking to 2018, our operating and capital efficiencies provide significant flexibility in capital spending. And of significant note, free cash flow neutrality is achievable at $50 oil and $3 gas in 2018. We're prepared to adjust our 2018 capital program and production growth targets based on market conditions.","Our key priorities are unchanged for the company. Further reducing our debt is our top priority while continuing to improve our operating performance, capital efficiency and EBITDA margins. We are resolute, determined and confident in our ability to achieve our strategy and to deliver differential value to our shareholders.","I'll now pass the call to Nick to share further details on our second quarter financials.","Domenic J. Dell\u2019Osso - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Thank you, Doug, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased with the results for the second quarter. Our production grew 2%, sequentially, after adjusting for asset sales. As Doug mentioned, our production started to move higher in July and we expect that our multi-well turn-in-line projects in the Eagle Ford, Utica and PRB will provide strong oil production acceleration in the third quarter.","On the cost side, we expect our combined production and G&A expenses to move lower in the second half of 2017 on a per unit basis. This is despite a modest increase in G&A costs, primarily as a result of asset sales. We've reduced our producing well counts in which we had a working interest by over 24,000 gross wells over the last 18 months, primarily driven by our divestitures in the Mid-Continent, Barnett and Devonian areas, reducing our overhead recovery on producing locations. Regardless, we expect these combined metrics on a per boe basis, particularly LOE, to continue to decline in the last six months of the year.","Our gathering, processing and transportation expenses improved sequentially on a boe basis, and we reduced our oil and NGL GP&T guidance along with our basis guidance on oil. We are currently projecting an improvement in our oil basis by $0.30 per barrel, due in part to strengthening market conditions in the U.S. Gulf Coast and a flatter contango oil curve, along with several successful marketing development initiatives across all four oil basins in our portfolio. On the GAAP side, although our basis for the first six months of the year came in better than we had anticipated, we are maintaining our basis guidance due to the recent pressure seen in the Northeast with the delays of Rover and the Nexus Pipeline.","We increased our income statement interest expense guidance primarily as a result of accounting adjustments related to the $750 million debt refinancing we completed in June. This is primarily a function of refinancing the Second Lien Notes that were accounted for under the Troubled Debt Restructuring accounting rules where the Second Lien Notes have a GAAP carrying value premium that depreciates over time. With the tender, we saw an acceleration of a portion of that depreciation that was previously an offset to reported interest expense. Notably, our cash interest expense was virtually unchanged as a result of the June refinancing.","Regarding our cash position, as expected, we have used the cash balance we started the year with to retire debt and other obligations, and now sit with a $575 million revolving credit facility balance and $3.1 billion of available liquidity.","Related to our core business, total CapEx has outpaced EBITDA by approximately $200 million year-to-date as we restore the company's cash flow generating capability. Separately, we have retired debt of approximately $1 billion inclusive of tender settlements, open market repurchases, calls of near-term debt and debt maturities. We've paid legal settlements in judgments of approximately $500 million, including the Bank of New York litigation, paid approximately $400 million in buydowns of marketing contracts, and paid interest and preferred dividends of approximately $450 million. All this activity was offset by sales proceeds of approximately $950 million to-date. This outspend was in line with our expectations for the first half of the year and, as a result, we have reduced debt, improved our working capital deficit and improved our profitability on a go-forward basis","On the A&D front, following the close of our Haynesville Shale assets in the first quarter, we have sold or agreed to sell multiple additional producing properties and acreage for approximately $360 million to-date. We expect approximately $265 million of these signed asset sale agreements to close in the third quarter. The production impact of the assets sold to-date in 2017 is minimal, about 16 bcf of gas. Since we have not adjusted our total gas production guidance for the year, it's also a reflection of the productive power of our remaining gas assets. We continue to work other non-core asset packages, particularly in the Mid-Continent area, as well as larger assets as we work toward our goal of removing $2 billion to $3 billion of debt from our balance sheet.","Finally, for 2017, we currently have approximately 74% of our remaining projected gas production hedged at $3.09 per mcf and approximately 60% of our remaining projected oil production hedged at approximately $50.32 per barrel. Using the midpoints of our production guidance, we have also hedged a meaningful portion of our 2018 gas production hedged at $3.09 per mcf and have added to our 2018 oil hedges, which have an average hedge price of around $49.87 per barrel.","Operator, that concludes my comments. I will now turn the call over to you for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we'll go first to Neal Dingmann from SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Morning, gentlemen. Doug, my first question, really, is just about your comments this morning about the potential \u2013 upcoming reallocation of capital, specifically besides bringing that rig in the PRB. Could you talk a little bit \u2013 I think in the prepared release you mentioned about potentially reducing spending in certain areas altogether. So, just any color you can give on where you might reduce altogether and any of the reallocation you can give us more color on?","Robert Douglas Lawler - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Sure, Neal. Thanks for the question. The reduction in our rig activity has been part of our pro-capital program all year. And as we noted, we intended to average 17 rigs for the year. We've been high to that a little bit and we planned on reducing our rig activity in the latter part of the year. So this is really consistent with our plan.","Keep in mind, as well, that the flexibility around our program today as we have tremendous optionality to direct our capital towards where we see the best returns based on market conditions and based on the results of our investments. That capital efficiency and flexibility the company has is something that I consider to be one of our competitive strengths. As a result of that competitive strength, we are in excellent position to reduce our capital or increase our capital based on market conditions, and we're prepared to do.","With the hedging protection that we have in place for 2017 and our goal of restoring that cash flow after these asset sales and the reduced activity in the past few years, we feel very comfortable and very confident that the extended lateral program, the completion efficiency and the results we're seeing in some of these areas, such as Powder River Bain, this monster well we've seen in the Marcellus and the continued improvements in the Eagle Ford, that we're pumping bigger fracs and seeing good results from it.","So we're in great position to perform exactly as planned. It's noted as a reduction in drilling activity, but it's really just \u2013 it's the allocation of capital towards where the best investments for our strategy are to be located. And as we look forward to 2018, we are in an excellent position at $50 in oil and $3 gas to be free cash flow neutral, and we're prepared to adjust that program as necessary.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","It's a good point. And then, just lastly, by my numbers here, certainly, your cash flow, it's been \u2013 is coming down dramatically. But could you talk about, in addition to that, you mentioned asset sales, I think, around $360 million to-date, how you see those sort of shaping up the rest of the year and into 2018? Thanks, Doug.","Robert Douglas Lawler - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Certainly. So the asset sales, we're pleased with the progress we've had to-date, but we are not done. We see several other opportunities that we look forward to sharing with you as the year progresses. Keep in mind that we have a stated goal of $2 billion to $3 billion of further debt reduction to reduce the leverage on our balance sheet and to make the company more competitive, and we still are very confident.","Keep in mind that this company has a tremendous land position and a tremendous number of assets, high quality assets. We've got a significant resource potential in each of those assets, and that gives us a lot of flexibility as what we choose to divest of. And as we test concepts and test new plays with the extended laterals and the completion technologies, we are narrowing in on value and what we think are proper prices to divest of any additional assets. So, we will continue the divestment program. We've not put a target out for the year, but what you can expect is we'll continue to be divesting of non-core assets and looking to further strengthen our balance sheet with the proceeds.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks, again, for the details, Doug.","Robert Douglas Lawler - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Thanks, Neal.","Operator","And we'll go next to Brian Singer from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, sir.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks, good morning.","Robert Douglas Lawler - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Hi, Brian.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Wanted to further focus on a couple of the assets you discussed in your comments. First is the Mid-Con, you made \u2013 I think you made some comments in your prepared remarks with regards to some higher water cuts and redesign the completions. Can you just give us a \u2013 take a little bit of a step back on the various Mid-Con plays that, I think, were areas of focus going back to the analyst meeting last year, and how you see the path forward?","Frank J. Patterson - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Hey, Brian, this is Frank Patterson. Good morning. How are you?","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thank you.","Frank J. Patterson - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","So, in the Mid-Con, the Oswego, which we've been \u2013 was pushing hard on, that is a play that's really working for us, but we've always said that has a limited running room. It's a relatively small footprint. We're going to continue to push on that and we've seen really good results, over 1,000 barrels a day in most of our wells.","In the Meramec, the hydrocarbon content is there. What we're struggling with is, as we frac these wells, we believe we're probably fracking out of zone and down into the Mississippian, which is a high water cut type of a formation. So, we need to redesign our completions. And because the water cut is higher than we \u2013 on the high end of our expectations there, we're going to slow down just a little bit, redesign, rework the G&G, rework the engineering, and we'll probably redeploy some capital out of that asset, and then come back to that as we understand how to redesign the completion.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great, thanks. And my follow-up is on the Marcellus. You highlighted the very strong well there and your interest in potentially reallocating maybe a \u2013 maybe it's a perception of reallocating capital. Can you talk a little bit more to that point, to the degree that we have new pipeline capacity coming online to \u2013 that improves local prices in Appalachia, how aggressively should we look to Chesapeake to add capital and what do you think the production impact could be?","Frank J. Patterson - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Thanks. First, I just really, really have to call out the team on this. They were looking around the organization at the completions that have changed many of our fields and said, hey, what if we do that in the Marcellus? So they did a great job of challenging themselves and coming up with, okay, how could we optimize and make the best Marcellus completion possible? Kudos, also, to the field team for safely and efficiently bringing a well of that magnitude on. That's an incredible achievement. We had to basically redesign the surface facilities. As you can imagine, we're not used to bringing on 60 million a day wells in the Marcellus. So, that's great.","As far as the Marcellus as we see it today, we've been producing pretty steady in the 2 bcf to 2.2 bcf a day. That's our capacity as far as being able to get pipe \u2013 gas out of the field. We are still looking for more opportunities because this is great rock and we can step on the accelerator. But I think the more important thing about the big well is it tells you how \u2013 first, how good the rock is because this is in a developed portion of the field. It's not an outlier. It's kind of in the heart of the field.","Secondly, as we push these better completions and longer laterals, it's going to speak to the capital efficiency. We're going to have less capital in the ground for the same amount of gas, which is pretty substantial.","And then, the third and probably the most important thing for the future is, this is in the core of the field. But just like in the Haynesville, this completion design \u2013 this well design, if we move it out into what we consider the less prospective area, the less core area, we can actually change what the core is in this field, and our footprint of really high quality gas now probably expanded substantially.","Robert Douglas Lawler - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","I might add, Brian, to Frank's comments that this company is all about capital efficiency. And the benefit of our portfolio as we deploy capital and the expertise that we have from all of the wells we've drilled, all of the completions that we've pumped, it just gives us tremendous flexibility and optionality to direct the capital, whether it be from Mid-Continent to Marcellus to Powder River back to Haynesville. We're just going to continue to improve. And we'll take these learnings and are seeing excellent results, and we're recognizing core expansion based on those technologies. And so, the \u2013 what we consider to be one of the strongest attributes of this company with our capital efficiency is this strength and this portfolio and the diversity that it provides to us, it's a significant value lever for the company.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, I appreciate the comments on the resource and the timing. From a capital allocation perspective, should we expect you to be adding rigs in 2018 in the region, in Northeast PA?","Robert Douglas Lawler - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Yeah. Brian, right now, we have about 2.2 bcf a day cap on our capacity. So, what you might see us actually do is, in 2018, we may deploy less capital and allow more capital to be put on other assets until we get additional takeaway capacity.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll go next to Charles Meade from Johnson Rice. Please go ahead.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company L.L.C.","Good morning, Doug, to you and your whole team there.","Robert Douglas Lawler - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Good morning, Charles.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company L.L.C.","I wanted to pick up, I guess, maybe where Brian left off-and again, those are really impressive results and it's good color you've given on the Marcellus well, but I wonder, keeping with your theme of capital efficiency, can you give us an idea for what the incremental cost of this well was over your typical design? Or maybe if you don't want to give that, a sense of what that incremental capital efficiency was and if it's not where you want it to be, whether it can improve?","Robert Douglas Lawler - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Are you sitting down, Charles?","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company L.L.C.","No, I have a standing desk in my office. I'm teasing. Yes, I'm sitting down.","Robert Douglas Lawler - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Okay, Charles, hold on to your sideboards of your desk there. So this well is a little bit more expensive than the wells we've drilled. This is a 10,500 foot lateral with a relatively aggressive frac on it, about $8.5 million. That's the field estimate today. These are early numbers, of course, because we've been only been on for about six days or seven days, but we believe that we can get that cost down as we go forward.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company L.L.C.","Well, I tell you what, I'm out of my chair and on the floor, now.","Robert Douglas Lawler - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Okay. Jason's team has done a great job. I'd love Jason to put a little color on that as well.","Jason M. Pigott - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Well, it's funny. The team, again, they were trying to figure out how to get 60 million a day out of one of these wells, and they actually call it the Rambo frac because they needed to attack that formation like Rambo would a POW camp. So they increased the cluster efficiency and packed it with 32 million pounds of Hell on Earth. So we succeeded in setting the captive gas molecules free.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company L.L.C.","All right. If I could ask a question about the Haynesville, also, that 40 million a day well outside of the core is certainly remarkable, but to me, what caught my attention more was that refrac of that early well and that rate you got from, frankly, a short lateral. So can you talk about how that came in versus your expectations? And I know, Doug, you mentioned in your prepared remarks you're planning on doing more of that, but can you elaborate a bit on where that fits in your outlook for 2018 and perhaps where it ranks in the stack of capital efficiency or attractiveness?","Jason M. Pigott - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Yeah. This is Jason, again. We're really pleased with the well. Again, we're just continuing to optimize the Haynesville and focus on those designs. I mean, we started by last year with 55 million pound jobs. That's a little bit bigger than we actually needed. So what's great about these wells is we're pumping less sand than we did at the 5,000 pounds per foot and still getting these really strong reserves \u2013 results; so, again, just optimization from the team. It's more than just sand. It's the number of perf clusters that we treat, the distance between the perfs, and all those things come together. And each well is unique, and they're unique even within the fields. So they've really done a great job of trying to customize the jobs for the rock that we have in each of these parts of the company.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company L.L.C.","And the refrac, Jason?","Jason M. Pigott - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Oh, refract. Refrac is good. Again, it's 9 million a day. It's our first one, we \u2013 the first one that we've tried a liner on, which gives us a fresh piece of pipe to work with. There's two ways to do these refracs; one is to treat the whole well, and then pump diverters in one giant job versus putting this liner in place. So it's still early, so we don't have EURs pumped; it's about $3 million we expect to do on a regular basis. So compared to a few years ago, we were drilling and completing new wells for $8 million and getting 12 million a day IP that's been (27:10) our first refrac of this type, I think, is a good step forward and opens a lot of potential for us in the future.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company L.L.C.","Great. Thanks for the color, guys.","Robert Douglas Lawler - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Charles.","Operator","And we'll take our last question from David Tameron from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead, sir.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yeah. Morning, Doug.","Robert Douglas Lawler - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Hey.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Eagle Ford, the Upper Eagle Ford that \u2013 obviously, a very good well there. Can you talk about how many more you have planned for this year and remind me of your potential kind of locations there longer term?","Frank J. Patterson - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Hey, David, this is Frank, again. We are going to continue to work the upper Eagle Ford into our program. What we've come to the conclusion is that it probably needs to be a co-development and associated with the lower Eagle Ford, both for efficiency and ultimate \u2013 the best completion design. So we are currently reworking that.","Kind of the western portion of our field has upper Eagle Ford over it and we are working on what is the best spacing associated with that. As we've seen these bigger completions, we're looking at, should we adjust our spacing assumptions, maybe a little bit further apart, and driving capital efficiency by doing that.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then, jumping over to the Powder, it sounds like for the \u2013 just reading the press release, right, the rest of the year you're doing some of the Turner, some of the Sussex. I think in the past, you've tested the Parkman and the Niobrara. Can you just talk about \u2013 just step back and give us a big picture view on the Powder and kind of where you see the most potential? And when we think about 2018, where do you expect your activity to be focused?","Frank J. Patterson - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","What we've seen so far in the Sussex and the Turner, those are probably the lowest cost producers we have in our inventory. Those are low $30 breakeven prices. You know, we're going to step on the gas on those. We will focus on those.","Sussex, we're drilling \u2013 we are basically in development mode. It goes up the heart of the field, and we will be bringing a bunch of those wells online here in the next two weeks to three weeks.","The Turner has been fantastic. We've basically drilled the edges. We have not drilled the core of the field, yet. We are now moving rigs into more core area. We've learned quite a bit about the GOR across the field, which is it changes slightly, but the pressure has been good, the deliverability has been outstanding. So, we're going to continue to tweak our completions to optimize these. We're drilling longer and longer laterals, now, both in the Sussex and in the Turner. So you're going to see us focus in \u2013 the rest of 2017, into 2018 and into 2019 on those two plays.","The Niobrara, what we've determined to-date is that completion matters. And so, the bigger completions really change the dynamics of that play. We will continue to work that into our plan.","Parkman is good. It's just not a large play on our acreage position. So, we're going to focus on our best economics. We're pretty excited about what we've seen in the Turner, and I'm really, really excited about what we \u2013 what I anticipate the Sussex is going to do here in the next few weeks.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Just one \u2013 I'm just going to sneak one more in. So, Mowry, you guys talked about validating the concept, I think is what you put in the slide deck. Can you just give us what you saw from that and what it means \u2013 just what you learned from that well?","Frank J. Patterson - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","We have drilled no Mowry wells on our acreage. There have been Mowry vertical penetrations on our acreage, but no horizontal. We knew that formation would be higher pressure and potentially naturally fractured. So what we did was we decided to drill a well where we had access to pipes, so we could maximize the value of what we were investing. So we went kind of to the center of the field, where our gas pipe gathering system is robust, and drilled a 4,100 foot lateral; did not want to take a big bite on this because the Mowry in the area has always been notoriously difficult to drill horizontally, but we got a really good 4,100 foot lateral. We put a very large frac on it.","Honestly, I didn't really want to talk about it this early because we're early in the flowback. We're only about 20%-plus of frac fluid back, but the well came on gas almost instantaneously. And it's been a pretty stout gas well. Until we get it unloaded, we just don't know what it's going to do. We've taken two cores in Turner wells. The Mowry is just below the Turner. We've taken two cores this year. Those cores are in our lab and we've analyzed them. They have good saturations of gas and oil.","So, the next test we do will probably be up in the oil or wet gas ram to see what we can do as far as getting a high \u2013 a longer well, a higher rate well, not knowing what this one's going to do. We don't know what its rate is going to do, but a higher rate well and a better economic flow. So, that's \u2013 that is in the testing stage.","Powder, the way I would look at Powder in the near term is Sussex, Turner, and probably Niobrara. Mowry is something that will come on the back side of that.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks. That was a great overview. I appreciate it. Thanks.","Robert Douglas Lawler - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Okay. We appreciate everyone joining the call today. For any additional questions, please contact Brad. We're excited about the things we're executing upon, but certainly see a lot of potential and opportunity. Just to highlight, again, we're executing as planned with our program, reiterating our guidance on capital production, and the capital efficiency that we continue to improve upon is something that we will be taking advantage of across the strength of our diverse portfolio. So, thank you, all. I hope everyone has a good day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you so much for your participation.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Brad Sylvester. Please go ahead, sir.","Bradley D. Sylvester - Vice President-Investor Relations & Communications","Hey, good morning everyone and thank you for joining us on our call today to discuss Chesapeake's financial and operational results for the 2016 second quarter. Hopefully, you've had a chance to review our press release and the updated investor slides that we posted to our website this morning.","During this morning's call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which consist of statements that cannot be confirmed by reference to existing information, including statements regarding our beliefs, goals, expectations, forecasts, projections and future performance and the assumptions underlying such statements. Please note that there are a number of factors that will cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements, including the factors identified in our earnings release today and in other SEC documents.

Doug will begin the call and then turn the call over to Nick for a review of our financial results, and then we'll turn the teleconference over for Q&A.","So with that, thank you, and now I'll turn the teleconference over to Doug.","Robert Douglas Lawler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Brad, and good morning. I hope you've had the opportunity to review our press release and presentation from earlier this morning. We continue to make good progress on multiple fronts, including a meaningful reduction in our debt, stronger production, lower operating costs and optimization of our portfolio. While we still face a challenging commodity price environment, I think it's important to note the significant progress that Chesapeake Energy has made despite commodity prices.","In the past three years, we reduced our total leverage by approximately 50%. We've reduced our cash costs by roughly 50% and significantly improved our capital efficiency. This year's capital program is roughly 10% of the capital spend in 2012 and, importantly, our production today is approximately equivalent to our 2012 production. We have sharpened our operational capability, technology, geoscience and engineering to drive further value for our shareholders for the long term. We have three major gas assets, each with a significant well inventory of new drilling opportunities that can produce in excess of 30 million cubic feet per day per well.","I'd like to share a few examples of our continued progress. In the Haynesville, we have recognized transformational value improvements this quarter. We continue to lead the industry on long-lateral technology with six 10,000 foot wells drilled to date. We have recently tested the largest completion in Chesapeake's history with over 30 million pounds of sand being pumped in the well. Results have been very impressive with a restricted initial rate of 38 million cubic feet per day and a flowing pressure of approximately 7,500 psi. We call this new era in completion technology proppant-geddon. And we've not yet reached the point of diminishing returns in the Haynesville and we plan additional tests up to 50 million pounds in the back half of the year. We look forward to sharing more results of the proppant-geddon program in the future.","In the Eagle Ford similar to the Haynesville, we continue to optimize our drilling schedule with longer laterals. We moved from an average lateral link of 6,500 feet in 2015 to an average of 9,300 feet in the second quarter of 2016. We've slashed our cost to drill and complete an Eagle Ford well by more than 50% on a cost per foot basis. Total well costs for wells completed in the second quarter averaged just under $4 million, with drill times reduced to 9.7 days even though we are drilling wells with longer laterals.","The move to longer laterals in all of our fields allow us to accelerate value capture as each rig is developing up to twice the rock volume compared to last year. These are just a few examples of our recent cost and technology improvements and we believe these improvements directed at our high quality assets provide our shareholders with competitive investment opportunities for years to come. We have in excess of 9,000 well locations across the portfolio that can generate greater than a 20% rate of return at $3 gas and $60 oil.","Since June of 2015, we have reduced our total debt by over $3 billion, with $1 billion of that reduction being since the beginning of 2016. In addition, we are confident in our ability to completely retire and\/or refinance our 2017 maturities.","The complexity of our business has further improved in the second quarter with the repurchase of four volumemetric production payment contracts, leaving the company with only two of the nine VPPs that we had three years ago.","You've also seen that we've increased our production guidance for the full year. This is driven primarily by gas volume increases from the Haynesville and Marcellus assets. Our operating teams have done a fantastic job in generating more value out of our capital program, primarily due to operating efficiencies and lower service cost, resulting in the opportunity for higher activity in the second half of 2016.","For the last six months of the year, we plan to take the following actions, all of which will be completed within our previously estimated CapEx guidance range. First, we plan to drill 100 more wells, which is roughly twice the number of wells originally planned in 2016. Primarily this will occur as we keep three rigs running in the Eagle Ford when we had previously expected to release those rigs earlier this summer. Second, we're projecting to place on production approximately 75 more wells than we originally planned. Third, in July, we took down a small property acquisition in the Haynesville for $87 million.","I'm very proud of our team's ability to more than overcome the 35,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day sold in 2016 dispositions within the same calendar year. However, more important is the great momentum this additional activity provides to our 2017 production and cash generating capability. You will note that we've updated our oil production guidance as the majority of our announced divestiture transaction closed in the second quarter.","Full year guidance has been reduced by 1 million barrels in the Mid-Continent area as a result of the Granite Wash divestiture to FourPoint and the STACK divestiture to Newfield. To a lesser extent, Mid-Continent oil production for the year was also impacted due to compliance with water restriction directives established by the State of Oklahoma.","The increased drilling and completion activity in the latter half of 2016, made possible through our efficiency gains, will greatly benefit 2017 oil volumes, offsetting decline and resulting in 2017 oil volumes being relatively flat year over year.","As a very preliminary look to full year production guidance for 2017, our total production volumes are projected to be down by a mid single digit compared to 2016 production levels. We continue to focus on improving our gathering and transportation costs across the portfolio. We are actively working with Williams and all of our midstream and downstream service providers on win-win solutions in the current pricing environment. We are encouraged by the progress we have made to date, and we believe we will be able to announce additional meaningful improvements in the near future.","Following on to my initial comments, we have used this period of reduced activity to perform an in-depth study of the resource position and potential of each one of our operating areas. In short, the oil and gas resource potential of Chesapeake Energy is stunning. Our asset value and portfolio of investment opportunities are being redefined through better operating efficiencies and cost structure improvements, and also through the rapid evolution of the technologies we apply.","The result of this work provides the foundation for competitive investment performance with significantly enhanced economics. We're working hard every day to apply these technologies to our extensive undeveloped acreage position and anticipate that these efforts will translate into incremental shareholder value.","As an example and as noted, you can look at the Investor Relations slides posted to our website this morning, you can see the impact that operational efficiencies and technology application are having on the Haynesville asset. We look forward to sharing more about our value proposition and competitive portfolio in the near future.","On the A&D front, we are increasing our target of gross proceeds from divestiture, either closed or under signed PSA to over $2 billion for 2016. One of the select areas that we believe will contribute to the new divestiture target is certain acreage within our large Haynesville footprint. Nick will provide some additional detail regarding our recent A&D efforts including the highly accretive acquisition that we closed last week in the Haynesville.","In closing, I am pleased with the significant progress we continue to make in reducing our debt, eliminating complexity, lowering our costs and high-grading our portfolio. We are beginning to see evidence that our differential leverage reduction and industry-leading operational capabilities are gaining traction with investors. However, we are just getting started. We believe the portfolio of high quality economic opportunities within Chesapeake is unmatched in the unconventional oil and gas business. We are driven to succeed and we'll continue to work relentlessly to reduce our debt and improve our midstream contracts, and we will continue to share news about our progress on both fronts soon.","The breadth and depth of our portfolio will continue to expand from a multiplier effect as we apply our leading-edge technologies to the development of our assets. This will result in unlocking more and more value. The momentum behind the transformation of Chesapeake is building, and with it the realization of greater value throughout our portfolio.","I'll now pass the call to Nick, and then we'll open the call for questions.","Domenic J. Dell\u2019Osso - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Doug, and good morning, everyone. As Doug has stated, financial discipline across our entire business remains a priority at Chesapeake. It's not only about reducing our operating expenses or capital cost savings, although we've done very well in those areas. Our main focus is the reduction of our total debt and the improvement in our liquidity, specifically, debt maturing in the next six to 24 months. While the debt capital markets have been constrained over the past 12 months, we are pleased with the recent increase in the pricing of our securities and believe our opportunities to enter the market are improving.","As you're aware, in April, we reaffirmed the $4 billion borrowing base for our revolving credit facility, and in return, we've pledged additional properties. The recent improvements in our cost structure along with our leverage to gas prices has yielded a significant uplift in the value to our reserves. Using the same database, same type curves and same reserves but using June 30 strip pricing, our proved reserves increased to approximately $11.1 billion at June 30, compared to approximately $3.1 billion when using the SEC methodology of the average of commodity prices on the first day of the month over a trailing 12-month period.","Using June 30 strip pricing and a 9% discount rate, similar to how our bank group values our reserves, the value increased to approximately $11.9 billion. We have ample reserves backing our liquidity position of approximately $3.1 billion at June 30. With this liquidity, we are well positioned to fully retire or refinance our pending 2017 debt maturities.","On the expense side, our cash costs continue to decline, and we have moved our production expense guidance lower due to additional cost savings. During the quarter, our G&A ticked up a bit due to additional legal expenses related to the settlements of legacy lawsuits and some bad debt expense that we wrote off, impacting our EPS by about $0.01. Overall however, we expect our G&A to remain within our current guidance range at this time.","On the A&D front, we have closed on the announced sales to FourPoint and Newfield. We've also stated that we intend to put a select portion of our Haynesville assets on the market. These are lightly developed properties that we will not likely further develop for some time given the depth of our Haynesville drilling inventory.","After the acquisition we completed in July, we currently have approximately 430,000 net acres in the Haynesville and are looking to sell approximately 150,000 net acres of that position. While we know there is substantial value to be created with the evolution towards longer laterals, higher frac density completions and cost efficiencies going forward, we will retain a position where we have hundreds of locations remaining to be drilled by Chesapeake after the planned disposition. The acreage we are looking to sell includes approximately 95 million cubic feet a day of production.","In July, we acquired approximately 70,000 net acres in the Haynesville, primarily within our already existing operating units, for approximately $87 million, pursuant to a pref right we had on the properties. Through the acquisition, we increased our average working interest in the area to approximately 83%, along with adding daily net production of approximately 60 million cubic feet a day of gas. The midstream contracts on the asset are the same as Chesapeake's and the rates on those have decreased since our renegotiations with Williams last year and some of the downstream transport this year.","Additionally, our operational efficiencies are allowing us to better utilize our transportation, which brings even more improvement to those contracts. Most importantly, we exercised our pref right on the purchase because we felt we were getting the assets for a fraction of the value using current pricing. Using June 30 strip pricing, we internally valued this incremental asset at approximately $200 million or more than double the cost. Additionally, the PV-10 of the PDP alone was higher than the purchase price. We are huge believers in the Haynesville, and with gas prices lifting and the current completion techniques being employed, we are very pleased to have increased our working interest in the play at an attractive price.","We've been adding to our hedge position for the remainder of 2016 and 2017 to help derisk our cash flow. For the remainder of 2016, we are hedged at approximately 75% of our projected production, with approximately 373 Bcf of our remaining 2016 gas production hedged at $2.77 per Mcf and approximately 12.1 million barrels of our 2016 oil production hedged at approximately $46.60 per barrel. We have also started to add some 2017 hedges. For 2017, we currently have 290 bcf hedged at $3 per Mcf and 7.7 million barrels hedged at approximately $47.79 per barrel.","In closing, we are making meaningful strides in our debt reduction efforts and look to do more in this area. Our production remains strong and we've been able to beat estimates and guidance without increasing our capital spending range. We expect more success in the A&D market and look forward to being able to talk more about these transactions later this year.","That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","The first question comes from Matt Portillo at TPH.","Matthew Merrel Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Good morning, guys.","Robert Douglas Lawler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Matt.","Matthew Merrel Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Just a quick question on the Haynesville. I was curious if you could update us on your thoughts around capital activity in the play heading into 2017 given the soft guidance? And specifically around that, just trying to get a better sense of where the breakeven economics are in the basement today and how that competes for capital versus the Eagle Ford which has historically been another area that's been a call in capital.","Jason M. Pigott - Senior Vice President-Southern Operations","Hi. This is Jason. Again, we're going through the budget process as a company right now and we expect to kind of keep three rigs flat but running some sensitivities on that as we speak. So, the Haynesville again with these new completion techniques, they've really transformed the asset for it. It's just as competitive as the Eagle Ford is.","One of the challenges that we've got is all the teams are doing very similar things and they're fighting each other every day for every dollar in a good way. But they all have rate of returns that are in 40% to as high as 60% in every single play that we operate. So it's been an exciting time for us as our economics today are better than they were when we had $80 oil prices. And we continue to optimize each of these plays.","So the longer laterals, when you look at Chesapeake's history, we went in a least capture mode where we kind of had one well per 640 acres. So for us, we see an advantage and we're one of the few companies that can go to these 10,000 foot wells. And nearly every play that we operate, we're not as overdeveloped. We're not focused on having to go to down spacing and increase density to add well count. We're adding these longer lateral wells across every field that we operate today and we're not forced to just down space in order to add inventory.","Matthew Merrel Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Great. And then just a follow-up question in regards to the increased forward guidance this year. I was just curious how much of the enhanced completions you're baking in across your asset base, i.e., is that guidance increase already assuming the higher density completions in the Haynesville and potentially some of the changes you're making in other basins?","Domenic J. Dell\u2019Osso - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes, expecting the switch in all of our Haynesville completions to this new design, which is baked into the forecast and it's causing us, driving our increase in guidance.","Matthew Merrel Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Neal Dingmann at SunTrust.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Good morning, guys. Say, Doug, just maybe a little more color if you could on the asset sales and maybe sides obviously which you've closed, wondering what others you already have PSAs on. And just when you look at regions that you consider noncore, if you could talk about that.","Robert Douglas Lawler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure, Neal. That's a good question. The extensive portfolio that we have and the significant acreage position gives us a lot of flexibility as we look at our go-forward capital plans, the cash generating capability of the company, and how we might accelerate value from some of these assets. The acreage positions are large, as you know. And as we look at the core positions, what may not be a primary core to Chesapeake could be outstanding core acreage for another company, which drives that interest. And that's what we wanted to highlight for you today in the Haynesville is we have literally hundreds of locations, a significant multi-year inventory of high quality acreage for us to develop.","But we also believe that given the quality of the acreage and the opportunity there, that we can accelerate some value. So, we know that there is what we'll call select areas that whether it be inside of core or noncore, that we can accelerate value. And as we look across the portfolio, I'm not prepared to give you any further guidance other than the Haynesville, but there are several other areas that we're looking at. And we feel very good about achieving that divestiture target.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Got it. And just lastly, just looking at that slide 8, that shows that huge portfolio. You mentioned with your rigs today, I noticed there was not a rig yet in the Barnett. Either for you or Jason, just how you see \u2013 I think on that slide 8 it shows about 65,000 a day, how you think about the Barnett as far as activity or just maybe production?","Robert Douglas Lawler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, the Barnett is a great asset. It's been a fantastic asset inside our portfolio. When you look at the potential we have with the longer laterals and with the economics that we're getting out of the other plays, the Barnett's not getting a lot of capital in the near term. So, it's still a very strong, high quality asset. We don't see directing capital there this year or in the near term.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Appreciate it. Thanks, Doug.","Operator","And we'll go on to the next question. It comes from David Heikkinen at Heikkinen Energy Advisors.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Good morning, guys. Just a question on the working interest and your expectations of the region for the additional spuds and POPs this year, the 100 wells you'll drill, where will those be and the 75 wells that you're going to put on production?","Jason M. Pigott - Senior Vice President-Southern Operations","I can answer that. Most of them will be in Eagle Ford. We were planning to shut that program down earlier in the year. We decided with, well, once we've seen the cost savings they've been able to achieve, again they've taken their well cost down to $4 million for wells that are 9,000 feet long. So that's an amazing transformation for them. Also savings in areas like the Haynesville have allowed us to just keep that program going, so we're reinvesting there.","So that's the biggest increase in our drill spuds is going to be in the Eagle Ford. And I say we've gone to, I think we had 25 was our original plan, so we're now up to 100. So a lot of incremental spuds in Eagle Ford. Those translate, really are going to show up more in 2017 because their acceleration on the schedule, and so the TILS don't start to really come in until 2017. So that's when you'll see those. We do have about 15 or so incremental TILS in the Eagle Ford this year.","Mid-Con saw a big jump in the TIL count as well. We had some of the curtailment issues that impacted us early in the year. We had shut down our Miss Lime completion program. We've been able to work through the water issues by recompleting into different disposal zones which open up our water capacity later in the year. So we'll be TILing a lot of Miss Lime inventory, which we don't talk a lot about that, but they're making some fantastic wells in the Miss Lime that are very competitive in our portfolio as well.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","And along those lines, with the oil volumes flat year over year, just trying to make sure I'm getting with the right benchmark for 2016. Is that your updated millions of barrels guidance, basically just think that 2017 will be flat with the updated guidance for 2016 or is that like an exit rate for fourth quarter? I'm just trying to make sure I get the right benchmark for that soft guide.","Robert Douglas Lawler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, it's total production for the year is anticipated to be flat, Dave.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Awesome. And then you all hit kind of...","Jason M. Pigott - Senior Vice President-Southern Operations","Dave, let me just jump in on that. If you think about what that means given the trajectory this year, that means that what's really happening during 2017 in order to be flat year over year is a ramp during the year.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Yeah, you started high in the first quarter then declined through this year and then V up in next year with those TILS particularly.","Jason M. Pigott - Senior Vice President-Southern Operations","That's right. So, the momentum there is really strong.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","The cost per rig line now in the Eagle Ford and the Haynesville has come down a lot. Can you \u2013 you're doing things faster and you talk about lower well cost. Can you just kind of update us on an annual cost per year, what a rig line costs in your four major operating areas, Eagle Ford, Haynesville, Mid-Con and Utica?","Domenic J. Dell\u2019Osso - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I don't have it on a per rig line basis. Let's do the Eagle Ford. We TIL, we're getting to 2.5 wells per month. They're $4 million gross per well. And then so we're drilling 30-ish wells per year in the Eagle Ford at $4 million a POP on a gross basis. We're averaging about one well per month in the Haynesville even with the longer lateral. So they're on a pace of 12 per month. If we go to these enhanced completion techniques, which we're planning to, cost will be $9 million to $10 million. So you're talking $120 million on a gross basis per rig line there, all in. Then what was the other area?","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Mid-Con is the other main area.","Domenic J. Dell\u2019Osso - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Mid-Con will be hard to do.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Of course.","Domenic J. Dell\u2019Osso - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We've got a great story in Mid-Con that we're not telling you today because the acreage capture out there is very competitive. We've got 15 different formations that the team has been mapping since the divestiture. We've replaced all of the inventory that we sold to Newfield with prospects in new plays. This is an area where our core lab has given us a great advantage as we're taking cores in some of these new formations and we're able to analyze them faster than anybody else in the play. But because it's such a mixed bag of wells that we're drilling in order to test these 15 different formations, it's hard to put a dollar per rig line together on this. If you get with Brad, we can try to get you some numbers there, but it's a very different portfolio that we'll be drilling in the future in Mid-Con.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Just a completion in the Miss Lime now since you're TIL-ing some wells there, what do they cost? I haven't thought about that in a bit.","Domenic J. Dell\u2019Osso - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I think they're $400,000.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Yeah it's pretty low.","Domenic J. Dell\u2019Osso - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Total well costs for a Miss Lime well is about $2.3 million.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Okay. Perfect. Thanks, guys.","Operator","And we have time for one more question. It will come from Doug Leggate at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Good morning everybody. Doug, real interesting commentary around the potential to resolve some of the transportation issues. I realize that some of these things are confidential and so on. But as an order of magnitude, could you provide some idea as to what you might think the end game could be as by way of impact on the cost basis?","Robert Douglas Lawler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Let me make sure I understand your question. It was cutting out just a little bit, Doug. To understand the cost on, did you say transformation or transportation?","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Sorry, I apologize. I'm not quite sure why my line is choppy this morning. But, so basically, the potential to continue to improve your transportation agreements in terms of the cost obligations, I'm just wondering if you could kind of quantify what you think the order of magnitude could ultimately be on the improvement?","Robert Douglas Lawler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. I guess the way that I would look at that, Doug, is in calling out the progress that we've made over the past couple of years, the message in our call today is, we've got huge opportunity all over this company. And I couldn't be more excited about it. And we're going to share more detail in the coming months about those improvements. So I'm going to hold off on quantifying it for you exactly at this point. But what you can expect is the cost structure improvements, portfolio enhancement, the technologies, improvements on our debt, these things are all just part of the plan that is leading Chesapeake to a much more competitive, much more valuable company. And I just will address your question by saying that we expect to see continued improvements in those transportation costs and continuing to work with Williams and other midstream service providers, and I'm excited about it. So, it's good things are coming.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I appreciate you trying. Well I guess it was worth a try, Doug, I guess. Maybe my follow-up very quickly is no capital really going to the Barnett. There's obviously, I apologize, there might have been someone asked this earlier because there's a couple of calls going on this morning. But the Barnett has been mentioned in dispatches as a potential disposal candidate. Could you comment on your view as to whether that you see that as a core asset at this point? And I'll leave it there. Thanks.","Robert Douglas Lawler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","The Barnett has been a great asset for Chesapeake. It's a high quality asset as the investment community knows. It has not attracted capital in the near term. And based on the quality of a few of the other assets, we have a hard time directing capital there in the next few years. So that given, we will continue to look at the portfolio, our acreage position of developed and undeveloped properties. And if there's opportunities to accelerate value, enhance the economics, enhance the EBITDA or cash flow of the company, we will absolutely capture that. So that not only applies to the Barnett, it applies to the entire portfolio.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Congratulations in your efforts to date, Doug. Thanks a lot.","Robert Douglas Lawler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks a lot.","Robert Douglas Lawler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay.

","Doug will review our operational and financial results and then we will open up the teleconference up for Q&A.","So, with that, thank you, and I'll now turn the teleconference over to Doug.","Doug Lawler","Thank you, Brad, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to share with you today Chesapeake Energy's third quarter performance highlights and to affirm our full year 2019 guidance range for production and capital expenditures, as well as share directional guidance regarding our 2020 capital program.","Despite significant commodity price volatility, Chesapeake continues to deliver higher margins and balance sheet improvement while positioning for sustainable free cash flow generation.","In the third quarter, we achieved several notable milestones highlighted by record production in the Brazos Valley asset, continued capital efficiency improvements as demonstrated by shorter cycle times, greater productivity, and lower CapEx. Cash cost reductions were recognized on an absolute basis across G&A, LOE, and GP&T as compared to the second quarter.","As you'll recall, we raised our full year production -- oil production guidance in the second quarter, and despite a few operational and timing challenges in the third quarter, we remain confident in delivering production and capital expenditures within our full year guidance range due to the balance and strength of our portfolio.","Turning to our assets, our progress continues in Brazos Valley, which set a new monthly production record in October of approximately 55,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day including more than 40,000 barrels of oil per day despite running one less rig in the 2018 program.","Our capital efficiency improvements continued to deliver impressive results. The team has turned 13 wells to sales this year with a peak rate above 1,000 barrels of oil per day while averaging 824 barrels of oil per day at peak rates in the third quarter. We have also reduced cost per lateral foot by approximately 21% since our acquisition.","Additionally, we have made significant improvement to the field's base decline through our well optimization and workover program. Importantly, as our subsurface understanding evolves, the commercial black oil window of the field continues to expand further growing our deep inventory of high-margin future oil locations.","The development program in our legacy South Texas asset continued to deliver as we turned in line the majority of our new drill completions in the latter part of the third quarter. As a result, our production in the basin has steadily grown since the beginning of the fourth quarter averaging approximately 58,000 barrels of oil per day in October.","Further cycle times continued to improve, and importantly, even after drilling roughly 3000 wells in the field, we recognized an 8% improvement in cycle time this quarter. Additionally, our drilling team set a single-well field footage record of 6,800 feet in one day during October.","In the Powder River Basin, the company continues to eliminate operating costs in the Turner development program. Year-to-date, we have reduced cycle times by 25% year-over-year and recognized per-well savings of approximately 10% or $800,000. Our efficiency enhancements have resulted in a recent Turner pad being drilled and completed for approximately $6 million per well. The last 25 wells turned to sales in the Turner have averaged approximately $7.2 million per well.","While we continue to improve our capital and operational efficiency in the Powder, production volumes were below our expectations in the third quarter due to a group of isolated wells located in the northern edge of our Turner acreage, which encountered lesser reservoir quality resulting in lower-than-expected performance compared to other Chesapeake wells.","Additionally, field production was adversely affected by third-party electrical outages that have interrupted our midstream takeaway. We are actively working with our third-party utility and midstream partners to mitigate recent power constraints.","As we have discussed at length, we remain excited about the stacked pay potential of the Powder River Basin. We recently placed on production our first Niobrara well since 2014, achieving record results. With the longer lateral and a modern completion design, the well has quickly become the best-performing Niobrara well in the basin reaching a 24-hour peak rate of 1600 barrels of oil per day while producing more than 106,000 barrels of oil in its initial 87 days.","We anticipate turning four additional Niobrara wells to sales in the fourth quarter and expect approximately 25% of our 2020 Powder River Basin capital program will be directed towards the Niobrara formation.","In the Marcellus shale, capital efficiency gains continue to result in prolific well performance, highlighted by nine recent wells reaching peak 24-hour flow rates between 60 million to 85 million cubic feet of gas per day. The quality of our Marcellus acreage and operational efficiencies positions Chesapeake to continue our strategy of maintaining relatively flat operated production to capture the value from seasonal basin congestion and pricing with minimal investment required. We continue to improve our cash cost structure across the company.","In addition to quarter-over-quarter reductions in all cash cost categories, we also made meaningful progress in reducing our GP&T and G&A expenses by a total of $109 million compared to the third quarter of 2018. We also restructured several gathering and transportation agreements during the quarter. The progress we made this quarter in improving our future midstream and downstream commitments is significant.","First, we were able to restructure our gas gathering and treating agreements in South Texas from a cost of service to a fixed fee structure. Second, we negotiated a new Brazos Valley crude transportation agreement via pipeline, which provides access to premium Gulf Coast markets. And finally, we are currently in the RFP process to award additional Brazos Valley wellhead crude gathering business.","On the balance sheet, we\u2019ve reduced approximately $733 million of face value of debt and preferred shares in exchange for approximately 319 million common shares, resulting in total debt decreasing to approximately $9.7 billion compared to $10.2 billion at June 30.","We believe these transactions along with our planned reduction in capital expenditures next year and other efficiency measures will reduce our debt levels and improve the ratios under our revolver. Additionally, we reaffirm the borrowing base for our Chesapeake credit facility with no change, and the Brazos Valley facility retermination will happen later this year.","We continue to evaluate multiple opportunities that can further improve our balance sheet, including divestitures, deleveraging acquisitions, and capital funding options. Finally, we have a significant portion of our 2020 production volumes hedged with approximately 265 billion cubic feet of gas, 17 million barrels of oil hedged at $2.76 per mcf and $59.28 per barrel of oil.","We have a proven track record of capital efficiency and cash cost leadership across our business, and we look forward to further improvements in the year ahead. Due to lower commodity prices, we have updated our 2020 forecast to reflect an approximate 30% reduction in our drilling and completion activity, while we will provide full detailed guidance at a later date. We currently anticipate delivering flat oil production, while utilizing 10 to 13 rigs and project between $1.3 billion to $1.6 billion in total capital expenditures.","We will continue directing the majority of our capital to our highest-margin oil assets and our capital spend will be ultimately be determined by commodity prices in 2020. Additionally, we expect to reduce our production and G&A related expenses by approximately 10% continuing our track record of cash cost leadership.","We believe this capital program along with our strong projected finish to 2019 and continued capital efficiency improvements will position us to target free cash flow in 2020. We remain confident in our strategy, asset portfolio and our talented employees, and we'll continue to utilize all of our resources to drive for greater shareholder value and returns. Our Board, management and employees are fully aligned and focused on our strategic plan priorities of delivering higher margins, sustainable free cash flow and further delevering our balance sheet to achieve a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of two times.","The volatile commodity price environment has pressured the speed and timing of accomplishing these goals, but we will continue to make incremental progress and improve our competitiveness and profitability.","I'd now like to turn the call over for a few questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Devin McDermott with Morgan Stanley.","Devin McDermott","Good morning.","Doug Lawler","Good morning, Devin.","Devin McDermott","My first question is on the indicative directional 2020 guidance. I was just wondering if you could help us bridge in a bit more detail some of the year-over-year reductions in spending. So what are the key drivers of that reduction? Where are you cutting back activity? And then as we think about how that spending might flex in that $1.3 billion to $1.6 billion range, where are some of those flex items there to the extent you can provide detail?","Doug Lawler","Yeah. Sure. Thank you, Devin, for the question. We actually because of the quality of the portfolio and the strength of the assets see a reduction taking place in activity across most of the assets. While we are not -- have not finalized exactly where the rig count will be next year, what we do know is that $1.3 billion to $1.6 billion will be directed across the higher-margin oil assets.","So you'll see two to three rigs in the Powder, two to three in South Texas, two to three in Brazos Valley and two to three in the Marcellus asset. That will vary based on pricing and we have that flexibility in our program that we can make those adjustments, but due to the quality of the assets and the high grading of where we direct the capital, we expect to see reductions across each of the assets in that competitive capital attention [ph] that has proven to be so helpful to us in the past.","Devin McDermott","Got it. That makes sense. And then my second, it's similar but on the operating costs on the G&A side to your point to a 10% reduction in overall costs next year. Similar and what's driving some of those reductions? I guess, how much is coming from some of the transport restructuring that you just announced versus cost reductions elsewhere, and what's the time line for that 10% being realized as full year average over average or are we going to enter the year at a run rate that's 10% lower? How should we think about the cadence?","Doug Lawler","I think the best way to look at that is we are -- we continue as I was trying to highlight there in my comments to make quarter-over-quarter improvements, so I think you can expect to see that continue across the year.","Specific targets for LOE and G&A as we attack all parts of the cost structure in G&A and LOE. We see continued efficiencies and synergies either through technology or through more efficient ways to do our business. We really project that to be across the year and more a reduction on an absolute basis compared to 2019.","The way I look at that is that historically the company has continued to make improvements in those areas to find better ways, to do things to find better and more efficient ways to operate, and that continued reduction is really just a reflection of the operating philosophy that we've had over the past several years.","Devin McDermott","Got it, makes sense. Thank you very much.","Doug Lawler","Thanks Doug.","Operator","Our next question comes from Subash Chandra with Guggenheim.","Subash Chandra","Yes, hi Doug. It seems like you've achieved what a lot of E&Ps would like to do which is shed legacy GP&T costs. Just curious if you give us magnitude of this reduction and I think the Eagle Ford if I recall correctly was your most expensive GP&T contract in the past. So, any more color there?","Nick Dell'Osso","Yes. Hey Subash its Nick. So, what we did in the Eagle Ford is we went from the cost-of-service contract structure to a fixed fee structure. The primary benefit of doing this is the clarity it gives us on our development program going forward.","Year-over-year, we won't actually see an immediate decrease in the rate paid. And what we get again is the clarity in the development program going forward and a better long-term rate of return as we think about the embedded cost of that cost of service over time.","So, it's a big win for us to have that clarity to understand the long-term economics of the field, and not have the uncertainty of the cost-of-service contract. And then when you marry that with what we were able to do on the long-haul takeaway side where we took out transportation, gosh, almost 10 years ago for much higher delivery of oil volumes, we have great access to the Gulf Coast markets. We were able to work with our midstream partners to get access to the Gulf Coast markets now for our new Brazos Valley asset and better utilize that transportation that we pay for out of South Texas across the Board. But we think there's a lot of potential for future economic benefit here. The immediate impact is greater clarity.","Subash Chandra","Got you. Thanks Nick. And a follow-up, any sort of the non-traditional assets in the portfolio that you can monetize whether it be water assets or royalty assets?","Doug Lawler","Yes. Subash we have a number of opportunities like that whether it be non-traditional assets in our portfolio, whether it be opportunities for non-core areas across the acreage across the country or as we look to evaluate and the current market opportunities to divest of a larger asset.","So, I think that that's a space to continue to watch. We are seeing interest in different things, some in the non-traditional, some in the non-core, and we'll continue to focus on that as a primary and principal way of further delevering.","Subash Chandra","Got it. And if I could ask one final one please. Any way to hazard a guess on what the oil ratio might be in 2020 for total volumes?","Doug Lawler","Sure. As we forecasted because of the reduced capital spend on the gas side next year and maintaining the oil production it will likely maintain that 25% to 30% on the ratio as we exit 2020.","Subash Chandra","Great. Thank you.","Doug Lawler","Yes, thanks Subash.","Operator","Our next question comes from Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan.","Arun Jayaram","Yes, good morning. Nick I wanted to start with you. There's some language in the 10-Q around the leverage ratio covenant in the credit facilities, wondering if you could comment on your revised thoughts on 2020 and your confidence of staying in compliant with that covenant.","Nick Dell'Osso","Sure. Absolutely Arun, so I think most of you may be familiar with the way this disclosure comes about and it's based on our projections over the next 12 months and the ability to keep up with the covenants in the credit facility.","I'll remind you that in our credit facility, we have a decreasing covenant around debt-to-EBITDA throughout 2020. So, it's a reflection as much of the covenant structure that was put in place over a year ago at much higher prices than it is our underlying business and how we are progressing with our debt reduction.","As you're aware and as we've talked about at length we've been keenly focused on absolute debt reduction and we've made great strides. We expect to continue to make strides using all the same levers that we have; cost discipline in all aspects of our business; asset sales; hedging prices as they rise; capital markets transactions; and of course, working very closely with our bank group which we do on a regular basis.","We could go out and seek a waiver at any time from our bank group. But at the moment we're -- continue to be focused on the strategic levers that result in permanent debt reduction.","Arun Jayaram","Got it. Got it. And shifting gears a little bit I wanted to see if you could talk about maybe some implications to the gas macro from your initial outlook comments on 2020. What would that imply if your oil production stays relatively flat for natural gas volumes next year?","Nick Dell'Osso","Well, as you'd expect if we're not investing a significant amount of capital, you'll see our gas production decline. In the Marcellus, we anticipate to be relatively flat Arun for the year running two to three rigs up there. And the capital efficiency and the quality of the asset the rock that we have in the Marcellus is just outstanding.","You made a comment about the greater macro environment and I think that that's an interesting comment. Because when you see a company like Chesapeake with the strength and quality of our gas portfolio reducing capital I think it should be a good indication of directionally where others should be reducing activity as well. We are -- we have that gas lever available to us in our portfolio.","At present, we don't want to invest there because of the higher margin greater returns we can get from our oil assets. And I think that from a macro level you'll see others reduce or pull back spending because if a company like Chesapeake is investing with the quality of our inventory, it ought to be an indicator that other others shouldn't be either.","Arun Jayaram","Great. Thanks a lot, Doug.","Doug Lawler","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer","Thank you. Good morning.","Doug Lawler","Hey, Brian.","Brian Singer","With the slower growth path in 2020 to get to the flat oil production year-on-year, can you just talk about how you see trajectory for oil, particularly at the end of the year? And then how you see the implications on 2021? And if you could just touch on the impact on decline rate at the end of next year as well as a result of the slower path that would be helpful?","Frank Patterson","Hey, Brian this is Frank Patterson. It's a good question. We're still working the 2020 plan as far as exactly where we're going to put all the capital to drive the best performance. As you probably have figured out, we're going to enter the year at a relatively high rate and we'll go into somewhat of a decline. The 2021 program has not been fleshed out at all. I think we have an opportunity to move capital around and drive a better 2021 outcome than people might be guessing. But definitely, we're going to see some decline from the beginning of the year towards the end of the year. We'll work very, very hard for 2021 to create an inflection moving up into 2021 to keep that relatively flat. If the price of oil stays where it is, I think you probably need to be thinking kind of flattish in 2021 and that would be something that we would strive for.","Doug Lawler","I might just add on that Brian that -- pardon me just for a second there. Really the culmination of all the work that's taking place in Chesapeake, the capital efficiency improvements, the cash cost structure that we've recognized over the past several years is what positions us in this volatile period to be able to reduce the capital and maintain that relatively flat oil production. So we are ever mindful of what those impacts are to future cash flows with a reduced capital program.","But because of that capital efficiency, the quality of our assets, the allocation of capital across the portfolio, we have confidence in a reduced program to the tune of 30% that doesn't compromise those later years. Now indeed, if you're not investing with the given decline rate and nature of the shale production profile, you're going to see a need to fight that decline. But that's really what we're trying to communicate is that the capital efficiency and at that spend level will be roughly in that flat type of range as Frank highlighted.","Brian Singer","And what oil price are you now assuming versus with the second quarter as an example when you were talking more preliminarily about next year?","Doug Lawler","We've actually -- we're assuming current market prices. Actually what we've been modeling is something a little less than current strip. So I think we're in pretty good shape as we forecast how that's going to turn out in the year.","Brian Singer","Great. And then my follow-up is on the Powder River Basin. Can you talk to why GP&T costs have fallen in the area and any implications for further reduction into 2020? And then you highlighted some of the negative results and it seems like you think that is a one-off. Can you just add some color on whether this represents an inventory reduction or just an attempt to push out the limits of the field?","Nick Dell'Osso","Brian, it's Nick. I'll answer the GP&T. So a couple of things happening there. One, just the sheer increase in volumes in the field drives some economies of scale, which are attractive. The second is that earlier this year, we've moved from trucking our oil from the wellhead to a sales point to an oil gathering system at a very attractive rate. So that's starting to show up. We expect to see some continued reductions as economies of scale drive more efficiencies on the gas side. There's going to be a step down at some point in the future. We had a restructuring of the gas gathering agreement here at the end of 2016. And there's an opportunity for us once we achieve certain volumes to have a step-down in rate. That will happen at some point in the relatively near future. So I would expect the GP&T and the Powder to continue to decline.","Frank Patterson","Brian this is Frank. So the -- we're calling out some wells in the Turner on the very north end of our field kind of at the furthest northern extent of our acreage position. Those wells are underperforming our expectations. We put a slide in the deck to kind of give you some color on that. If you look at those wells they kind of perform at the basin average, but not to our expectations. What we think we saw up there was probably some lower reservoir quality. It's also in an area where there's quite a bit of congestion and offset operator drilled four wells per section which is something that we don't think is the right answer. We actually had an opportunity to join in those wells and sold out.","We drilled -- we spaced off and drilled those wells at two to three wells per section, which is the right answer we believe from our work to the south. The rock is just not performing now as expected in that isolated area. If you look at the rest of the Turner program, what you can see is that the remainder of our wells inclusive of those nine, we're actually outperforming the basin by about 40% which we think is good. We want more.","So we're pushing for better completions, better well design and better spacing solutions. So we just wanted to call that out because it's important. It represented about 2,000 barrels a day of under-delivery in the Powder. We have to admit that in the third quarter, but we're going to make that up through the rest of the program. So just wanted to highlight there is some variability. We understand that variability. We don't have to drill wells up in that area any further.","Brian Singer","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Heikkinen with Heikkinen Energy Advisors.","David Heikkinen","Good morning guys. And thanks for taking my question. Had one operating question first and then one financial question. On the operating side, as you think about your improved cycle times and really the reduction in rig count, how does that impact like your ratio of rigs to frac fleets by region? Can you maintain a similar and stable frac? Or do you have to flex that up and down with rigs just as you've improved your drilling time?","Frank Patterson","Yes. David, this is Frank. That is very important to us. The operational efficiency is imperative. We're working through that. We do believe a two to three rig program in most basins we'll keep one frac crew, if not a frac crew and a half busy. Our goal will be to align as much as possible the rigs with the frac crews. And that's what we're going through right now David.","We're also negotiating contracts with our vendors, suppliers to get the best possible price going into 2020. So that's all work in progress but we are keeping that kind of alignment between drilling crews and frac crews. Very much on the front burner making sure we get that done.","Right now it looks like we'll probably be able to keep one frac crew fully busy in all of our basins with the exception of maybe Powder. If we move to more and more Niobrara in the Powder that will allow us to expand that frac crew into more time because those frac jobs take quite a bit longer than the Turner wells.","David Heikkinen","Okay. That's helpful. Just on the efficiency side going next year. And then as you think about the transition to free cash flow in 2020 and the cuts and -- which is a necessary move, how do you guys think about the criticality of your two free cash flow and gas assets in the Marcellus and Haynesville relative to your covenants and long-term free cash flow plan?","Doug Lawler","Yes. That's a good question. The gas steel assets are still a very important and critical part of our portfolio that give us balance and diversity that we really, really like. The quality of the Marcellus is simply outstanding and cash flow projection and profile there that we expect over the next several years is quite significant and quite meaningful to us.","The reduced activity in the Haynesville, as you would expect and how we model our cash flows there, we fully incorporate that profile, that decline that we'll experience until we start redirecting capital to that direction again. And that's all been considered and weighed into the covenant situation and the projected cash flow and returns and free cash flow neutrality and the sustainable free cash flow that we seek to deliver in the coming years.","So the way I'd look at that and answer the question is that the gas assets are very important and critical to Chesapeake. They're a tremendous lever and we evaluate the capital program and the cash flows very closely with respect to our financial performance and future profitability of the company.","David Heikkinen","And any exit would have to be at a premium to your covenant multiples I'd assume?","Nick Dell'Osso","I think that's...","David Heikkinen","That's a simple assumption.","Nick Dell'Osso","Dave I think that's a simple way to think about it. But I think we'd be cautious to guide you to expect that there's a big exit of a large gas asset at a price that isn't something that we would find attractive to shareholders across the board. So I don't think we would be driven just by that one metric.","David Heikkinen","Okay. Thanks, gentlemen.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Doug Lawler for any closing remarks.","Doug Lawler","Yes. Thank you for joining us today. And just to reiterate, our confidence in our program and execution of our strategy remains very high. Our oil production will continue to ramp in the last few months of the year growing over 10% in the fourth quarter as compared to the third quarter and we're on track to meet our 2019 production and capital guidance.","Looking forward to the year ahead, we'll reduce our capital spend by approximately 30% as I shared on delivering flat oil production and maximizing our cash flow. Our capital efficiency improvements combined with the proposed development plan positions the company to target free cash flow in 2020. And we'll continue to build a business which is resilient to the fluctuation of the commodity market. This concludes our conference call. And if you have any further questions please do not hesitate to reach out to us. We're happy to address any questions. Thank you.","Operator","The conference has now concluded.

Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Brad Sylvester. Please go ahead, sir.","Bradley D. Sylvester - Vice President-Investor Relations & Communications","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today to discuss Chesapeake's financial and operational results for 2014 and the fourth quarter. Hopefully, you've had a chance to review our press release and the updated Investor Presentation that we posted to our website this morning.","So, during this morning's call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which consist of statements that cannot be confirmed by our reference to existing information, including statements regarding our beliefs, goals, expectations, forecasts, projections and future performance and the assumptions underlying such statements.","Please note that there are a number of factors that will cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements, including the factors identified and discussed in our earnings release earlier this morning and in other SEC filings. Please recognize that, except as required by applicable law, we undertake no duty to update any forward-looking statements, and you should not place undue reliance on such statements.","I would now like to introduce the members of the management team who are on the call. With me today are Doug Lawler, our Chief Executive Officer; Nick Dell'Osso, our Chief Financial Officer; Chris Doyle, our Executive Vice President of Operations for our Northern Division; and Jason Pigott, our Executive Senior Vice President of Operations for our Southern Division.","So with that, I'll now turn the conference \u2013 the teleconference over to Doug and Nick and then we'll move to the Q&A session. Thank you.","Robert D. \u201cDoug\u201d Lawler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Brad, and good morning.","I trust that everyone has had a chance to see our press release that was issued earlier this morning. I'd like to start this call by first thanking the Chesapeake employees for an outstanding 2014. Together we made remarkable improvements in our operating efficiencies, financial stability and competitive performance. And here are a few of the significant accomplishments achieved in 2014.","Our safety performance in 2014, as measured by total recordable incident rate, or TRIR, was the best in the history of the company, a 35% improvement over 2013. We reduced our cumulative reportable spill volumes by 42% compared to 2013, and I'm very proud of these two significant improvements in our safety and our environmental performance.","On the operations side of our business, we grew our total oil and natural gas equivalent production by 9%, adjusting for asset sales in 2014, an impressive accomplishment when considering the reduction in our total capital expenditures compared to the prior year.","In mid-December, we reached a new production record of 770,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and achieved the highest production in our company's history while operating an average of 64 rigs, which is less than half the number of rigs we operated in 2012.","Since 2012, we have improved our capital efficiency by 30% to 60% in each of our major operating areas. Through these efficiencies, the continuous improvement and the cost leadership of our employees, we have driven hundreds of millions of dollars out of our well costs over this time period.","We reduced our drilling and completion expenditures by nearly $1 billion compared to 2013, all due to our increased focus on value and efficiency, but also because we created a supply chain group in 2014 that delivered significant synergies and cost reductions.","In total, our capital expenditures fell by 14% in 2014 to approximately $6.7 billion. If we exclude acquisitions, our capital expenditures were 23% below 2013. We reduced our cash costs by 9%, achieving the lowest production and G&A costs on a BOE basis in a decade.","From a financial perspective, Chesapeake became significantly stronger, less complex and much more flexible in 2014.","There are three major accomplishments that set us apart from our peers. First, we completed the largest and most significant transaction in our company's history with the divestiture of our Southern Marcellus shale and Eastern Utica shale assets for approximately $5 billion, giving us tremendous financial flexibility. While the assets represented just 7% of total production, the proceeds from the sale equaled 40% of our market capitalization at the time it was announced, another reflection of our industry-leading, high-quality, unconventional portfolio.","We completed a $450 million acquisition and exchange that doubled our equity interest in the prolific oil-rich Powder River Basin, an area which we believe will be another strong oil growth engine for the company. We successfully spun off our oil field services division, a critical step in divesting non-core assets and affiliates and focusing our efforts and resources on our core E&P business. We redeemed our Utica preferred shares which not only reduced complexity but also eliminated $75 million of annual cash dividend payments.","We reached another first in our company's history with a new unsecured $4 billion credit facility with investment grade-like terms. We also received two-notch upgrades from Moody and S&P, placing us one level below investment grade at both rating agencies. We eliminated $4.2 billion of leverage and complexity from our company in 2014 and ended the year with over $4 billion of cash on hand and we were completely undrawn on our credit facility. These, along with many other achievements, have helped Chesapeake to become a much stronger company, which brings us to today.","As I've told our employees many times, the transformation that has occurred at Chesapeake over the past 18 months has prepared us for such a time as we see today. The current commodity price environment is difficult, but our focus on value and industry-leading performance is unchanged and we are managing our business and activity levels around current strip prices of approximately $55 per barrel for oil and $3 for natural gas.","Looking at 2015, we have reduced our total planned capital program by 37% compared to 2014. We're forecasting production growth of 3% to 5% in 2015. As noted, despite making changes to this year's capital program and reducing our activity levels, we are not changing our focus on driving differential performance.","We will focus even more on increasing our financial and operational flexibility in 2015 and throughout this challenging commodity price environment. We will continue to drive our costs lower and generate more value where we invest and use \u2013 and this confidence comes from using 2014 as a proxy, and I have no doubt we will succeed.","In closing, I've said before that 2013 was our year of transformation. 2014 was our year of foundational improvement, and 2015 will be a year of leadership for Chesapeake Energy. Our determination to drive top quartile E&P performance and our commitment to creating shareholder value are stronger than ever, and I'm confident that we are positioning Chesapeake to be a leading E&P company.","That concludes my comments. I'm now going to turn the conference over to Nick for a review of our financial results, and then we'll open up for questions. Nick?","Domenic J. Dell'Osso, Jr. - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, Doug, and good morning, everyone. As Doug mentioned, Chesapeake has never been stronger than we are today, both operationally and financially, and we are very well positioned as we enter 2015.","We made significant progress in 2014 in simplifying our balance sheet and strengthening our financial position, primarily driven by the sale of our Southern Marcellus and certain of our Eastern Utica assets, the redemption of our preferred shares, our oilfield services spin-off and our new unsecured credit facility we put in place.","We are confident that our strategies to create shareholder value are working. And while the current pricing environment is not particularly enjoyable for our industry, we will continue to be nimble and flexible with regard to our capital investments, and we'll continue to take the appropriate steps to keep our positive momentum.","Our production of 729,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day for 2014 fourth quarter grew by 12% both sequentially and year-over-year after adjusting for asset sales. In December, we began curtailing approximately 250 million cubic feet of gross operated gas per day in the Marcellus due to low in-basin field prices.","Other operators in the area began curtailing gas in the fourth quarter as well. These curtailments have totaled approximately 15,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day and continued in the first quarter at rates as high as 20,000 to 25,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.","This, combined with the asset sales of our Southern Marcellus and other producing properties of 57,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and various downtime events of approximately 7,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in our other operating areas, has resulted in a first quarter 2015 production projection of approximately 645,000 to 655,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. I would also like to note that in our outlook, we are projecting curtailment to remain in place for all of 2015.","On the pricing side, lower NGL pricing due primarily to weaker ethane and other product pricing had a significant effect on our earnings and cash flow in the fourth quarter. We also recorded the annual impact of our MVC production shortfall in December as forecasted, which reduced our gas revenues by approximately $120 million or approximately $0.43 per Mcf.","While our hedges helped partially mitigate the impact of lower pricing and will continue to help us in 2015, we expect our realized pricing to remain low and have included our estimates of basis and non-basis differentials and our MVC estimate for 2015 in our press release.","Our forecast on cost discipline throughout the entire organization has helped to partially offset the effects of lower commodity pricing. Our production expenses, production taxes, G&A expenses and net interest expense for the 2000 (sic) [2014] fourth quarter were $7.56 per boe, a decrease of 8% year-over-year. Operationally, we continue to see our completed well cost decline in almost all of our operating areas. As we become more efficient, we will drive our costs even lower.","As the year progresses, we believe that oilfield service cost reductions will become more apparent, and, as such, we are building in an estimate of around 10% in service cost savings for 2015 before any capital efficiency improvements by our operating teams.","Finally, our balance sheet is in great shape. With the successful completion of the sale of our Southern Marcellus, over $2 billion in other asset sales, and the new revolving credit facility we put into effect in December, our liquidity position has never been better. With over $4 billion of cash on hand at the end of the year, nothing drawn on our credit facility, and a net debt to capitalization ratio of around 29%, we are in excellent position to weather this current price environment and take advantage of opportunities to add shareholder value.","That concludes my comments, so I will now turn the conference over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And we'll take our first question from Dave Kistler with Simmons & Company.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Co. International","Good morning, guys.","Domenic J. Dell'Osso, Jr. - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Good morning, Dave.","Robert D. \u201cDoug\u201d Lawler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Co. International","So, looking at your reduction in wells that are going to be tied to sales in 2015, can you talk a little bit about how you're going to manage that process throughout the year? A lot of folks have been deferring those completions for better service costs and for higher commodity prices. Just any kind of color on the cadence of that would be helpful.","Mikell J. \u201cJason\u201d Pigott - Senior Vice President-Operations, Southern Division","This is Jason Pigott. Yes. Primarily in the Eagle Ford, we'll be looking to defer some of the completions. We've done a similar analysis that you have mentioned that our peers are doing that a little bit higher oil prices, definitely the value of gaining that higher price outweighs the loss in NPV of deferring that completion. So, that's something that we'll do this year. We'll build a little bit of inventory as we continue to run rigs in an area like the Eagle Ford.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Co. International","Okay. Appreciate that. And then just looking at the individual stats you were giving on well cost, and realizing that those are basically just through October, I imagine with the comments about 10% reduction in service cost baked into your forecast. Can you give us kind of color where you think those well costs stand today? Because that seemed to show a slight uptick through October.","Mikell J. \u201cJason\u201d Pigott - Senior Vice President-Operations, Southern Division","This is Jason again. Yeah, we've seen really good \u2013 one of the things we need to do is separate the supply chain savings from our technological innovations, and we're going to see both of those this year. An area like the Eagle Ford, which we indicated $6.1 million. We see $5.8 million in our wells that we're drilling to date, with targets of getting down to $5.5 million.","Haynesville is another area where we've seen a lot of innovation and service cost reductions. We've got a budget. Those are difficult to put in a dollars per well because we're drilling at least three or four different types of wells out there. We have single-unit laterals which are running around the $7 million range, up to \u2013 we're trying some of these 7,500-foot laterals that can cost us almost $9 million. And we've even got a couple of laterals planned this year that would be 10,000-foot laterals that would be around the $11 million range.","But just this week, we had one of our lowest cost wells go down and actually the field cost estimates on that were $6.3 million for a well that was just a standard section. So, we're seeing really good improvement. It's going to be difficult for us to put these costs in a dollar per well because we're drilling a wide range of wells out in that field.","M. Chris Doyle - Senior Vice President - Operations, Northern Division","Dave, this is Chris Doyle. I'm just going to give you a little bit of color from the North assets in the Rockies. The team peeled off $1 million from 2013 to 2014. What we indicate is $9.1 million well cost. I see us, without any supply chain savings, coming in under that $9 million mark. And then on top of that, supply chain savings will push us to the low 8's. We continue \u2013 as Jason mentioned, we continue to push longer laterals, additional testing. So, we're not focused on a one well number, really focused in on value.","In the Utica, the team delivered wells in that $6.5 million range and I see us in the low 6's prior to supply chain. And so, we have a chance to bust $6 million there. And then in the Marcellus, I'd see us in the high-6's per well cost.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Co. International","Great. I appreciate the added color, guys. Thank you so much.","Mikell J. \u201cJason\u201d Pigott - Senior Vice President-Operations, Southern Division","And I'd also just highlight too as far as well cost and we're getting those down. Some of the graphs we show where that capital efficiency where we take the capital divided by the productivity and those are some things that are difficult to see in area like the Haynesville where we're testing tighter perf clusters, some different completion designs, more sand and they really drive up the EURs. When we look at that, it's really that capital efficiency we continue to improve that and have seen great gains this year and don't expect that to stop in 2015. So we're really excited about the program going forward.","Robert D. \u201cDoug\u201d Lawler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And I just might add, Dave, this is Doug. We are intentionally holding production back in 2015 because we believe it's the prudent thing to do, which means that we're going to see some increase in our inventory. But I'd also just remind everyone that as you look at Chesapeake and our production-generating capability, it's one of the most strong competitive attributes of this organization, and the ability to efficiently grow production is simply outstanding.","So, the way I'd describe it is it's like a coiled spring. And once we see that it's the prudent thing to do to increase that production, we're going to unleash that spring, and we will rock it forward and continue to drive greater value for our shareholders.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Co. International","Well, I appreciate all the added color, guys. Thank you so much.","Operator","And our next question is from David Tameron with Wells Fargo Securities.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. Doug, can you just talk about the M&A environment and \u2013 I mean, there's been a lot of questions obviously about what Chesapeake could purchase. Can you talk about \u2013 or Nick or whoever \u2013 your availability? How much financial availability do you have to do something like that, and then just kind of any color you can give us on what you may be looking at?","Robert D. \u201cDoug\u201d Lawler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. That's a great question, Dave. We have \u2013 with the total liquidity we have available to us, the cash position that we have, we have a tremendous opportunity, whether it's \u2013 basically, everything is open to us that we could pursue to drive the greatest value for our shareholders. We see a lot of opportunity out there at present. We think that that opportunity will persist through 2015.","The key for us is how do we strategically build and improve our portfolio to be more competitive for the long haul. And we're not focused on just a single year or a single quarter. We are focused on how we drive the greatest value over the long term. Anything that we do is going to be focused on how do we materially improve our returns for that long-term period?","So, we're evaluating a number of different things. We have not publicly stated what our plans are, but we will continue to look for opportunities to either bolt-on acquisition opportunities, new opportunities that we can pursue. We also have a lot of strength in our exploration program, and we'll continue to look at that, and then we always have capital structure opportunities as well.","So, we're in a unique position with significant liquidity and cash on hand to move quickly and at the right time, to add the most value for our shareholders.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Can you give us any leanings, Doug, as far as gas versus oil or anything along those lines?","Robert D. \u201cDoug\u201d Lawler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, as you guys know, Dave, I mean, this company has one of the best gas portfolios in the entire world. And our ability to increase gas production from these world class shale \u2013 gas assets is just unbelievable. And so, that strength and that power, we have a lot of confidence in the portfolio. We've noted that from the existing asset base, we have the capability to grow these assets to a million barrels equivalent per day inside a five-year timeframe.","Now, obviously, prices impact that and can slow us down a little bit. But I'd also highlight for everyone that in the latter part of 2013, to come up with better integrated, better planned field development plans, we ratcheted back our drilling program, and there was a lot of questions about what's going on with that, and why is Chesapeake reducing rig count?","And then we quickly went in an area like the Eagle Ford, from 9 rigs to 22 rigs in less than nine months. So, our ability to mobilize and drive value is unlike anyone else. And so, the capability to drive value and drive new volume growth from our assets, we've got tremendous confidence in. And as we look at the portfolio and we look at our margins, we have that 70\/30 split of gas to liquids, and so our focus in opportunities that we believe are most attractive long term for our portfolio will be oil-weighted. And so that's just the way I would answer that question.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then just one more and I'll let somebody else jump on. If I look at just the CapEx allocation, you guys have it split out there by area. And I'm looking at Utica at 25%, which call that off of $4.5 billion, call that $1 billion-plus, whatever that number is. And then I'm looking at the D&C CapEx allocation for 2014, and it looks like \u2013 it looks about half of that, yet the rigs are being cut in half year-over-year. Can you just talk about \u2013 just help me true up those numbers.","M. Chris Doyle - Senior Vice President - Operations, Northern Division","So, in the Utica, we'll be running three to five rigs we indicate. Keep in mind that the carry is rolled off in 2015. One thing I would point out in the Utica, we're currently producing over 850 million a day. We've not only hit our exit rate of 100,000 barrels a day net as we targeted last Investor Day. We averaged that for the quarter.","So, those \u2013 that asset is performing exceptionally well. That puts us right around our current processing capacity and compression capacity. We'll continue to expand that a little bit this year. But we don't see the need, with the way the wells are hanging in there and the way the team is executing, to run more than three to five rigs. And so that's the plan for us in 2015 for the Utica.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. So, is there facility numbers in there? Is that \u2013 I'm just \u2013 is it 200? Are you running 200-plus a rig, $200 million a year?","M. Chris Doyle - Senior Vice President - Operations, Northern Division","We also have \u2013 we have a little bit of an inventory work down that we didn't see in 2014, so that will skew the numbers also.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. All right. I'll let somebody else jump on. Thanks, guys.","Operator","And our next question is from Joe Allman with JPMorgan.","Joe D. Allman - JPMorgan","Thank you, operator. Hi, everybody.","Robert D. \u201cDoug\u201d Lawler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Joe.","Joe D. Allman - JPMorgan","Doug, could you walk us through the sequential quarterly production? We got your full year guidance and we got the first quarter from your presentation. The first quarter 2015 guidance suggest you're going to be flat through the year because you just walked us through that. And Nick, if you could just give us the details on the curtailment again, where is that and how much do you have baked in for 2015?","Domenic J. Dell'Osso, Jr. - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","I'll answer that last question first and Chris may want to jump in with more details because the curtailments are in his area. But we started with about $250 million gross a day in December. We have at various times through the quarter curtailed more than that. On a net basis, we see that at about \u2013 it started at about 1,500 barrels a day. At points, it's been as high 20,000 or 25,000 barrels a day. And so, we baked in between that 1,500 to a little bit higher number in for the year into our guidance.","So, price dependent, that could come off at some point but for now, given where the strip is, given where we see field pricing in the Northeast, we think it's prudent to assume that those volumes would stay off line for the year.","Joe D. Allman - JPMorgan","And Nick, is that all Northeast?","Domenic J. Dell'Osso, Jr. - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, that's all Marcellus, Northern Marcellus. And that's us plus our non-op.","Joe D. Allman - JPMorgan","Okay, that's helpful. Thanks.","Robert D. \u201cDoug\u201d Lawler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And then, just Joe, if you look at slide 8 in that presentation, it has a simple walkthrough of the production volumes basically from that record rate that we achieved in December of 770,000 barrels a day, but also shows on a quarterly \u2013 for the quarter, where we're at 729,000 and basically walking down with the divestitures, curtailments and then just some incidental downtime that brings us down to that 645,000 to 655,000 range. And then what we're looking at in that capital program is that we certainly, as you know, have the ability to ramp up our capital should we want to do that, and if we did, you'd see corresponding production increases.","So, what we have targeted right now is we're looking at all the opportunities to how we can drive the greatest value, and it gives us tremendous flexibility. And so, with our projection in that $4 billion to $4.5 billion range, which includes everything, including capitalized interest, we are very comfortable and confident in our ability to grow 3% to 5%, and on an adjusted basis, and we will \u2013 we have significant opportunity to increase that if market conditions dictate.","Joe D. Allman - JPMorgan","Okay. That's helpful. Yeah. And I see that slide. And I guess it suggests that you're going to be basically flat 1Q to 2Q, 2Q to 3Q, 3Q to 4Q to get to that same 1Q average that matches the full-year average. So, is that fair?","Robert D. \u201cDoug\u201d Lawler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","It's approximately fair, yes.","Joe D. Allman - JPMorgan","Okay. And then...","Robert D. \u201cDoug\u201d Lawler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I would just highlight, again, Joe. I would not underestimate this company's ability to grow efficient production.","Joe D. Allman - JPMorgan","No, I appreciate that. And then in terms of the deferrals, so is your plan to actually complete some of those deferred completions during the year, or for the most part, you're going to really push those off until 2016?","Mikell J. \u201cJason\u201d Pigott - Senior Vice President-Operations, Southern Division","This is Jason. We are pushing most of those into 2016. And we'll have an area like the Eagle Ford, for example. I mean, we'll have \u2013 we'll build 100 wells of inventory that \u2013 again, like Doug was saying, we have the ability to act on if prices change. We can instantly bring in some frac crews and complete those wells. So, we'll build a little bit, but we would plan to push that towards 2016, right now.","Joe D. Allman - JPMorgan","Okay. That's helpful. And then lastly, you got into some of the M&A type opportunities you have with the cash you've got. Like, what are the most likely uses of the cash you have? Like, is a significant use going out and buying bolt-on acreage or some other assets or do you have other ideas for the cash?","Robert D. \u201cDoug\u201d Lawler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, basically, Joe, we have the ability or the option to do a number of different things with that cash. And so, we haven't shared anything yet with it. The key there is that we can invest in our own portfolio. We can use it for acquisitions or, as I noted, we can look at our capital structure. And so \u2013 and we look forward to sharing more with you and the investment community as the year progresses, but right now, all those options are open to us.","Joe D. Allman - JPMorgan","All right. Very helpful, guys. Thank you.","Robert D. \u201cDoug\u201d Lawler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Joe.","Operator","And our next question is from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Good morning, everyone there. Guys, I was wondering if I could ask a bit about the NGL pricing, not so much for the fourth quarter, but really for your outlook. And I think most people are aware that the pricing has been weak and ethane has got a negative crack spread, all that sort of thing, but I'm curious if you guys could talk a bit about what your outlook for the NGL pricing is, and if that is possibly related to that negative midstream margin we saw in Q4?","And maybe as part of that, I'm looking at your guidance here where you're guiding to $48 to $52 off WTI. Is the right way to think about that is WTI is $55 and so you're guiding to $3 to $7 a barrel? Is that \u2013 it didn't seem right, but that's the way the math seems to work.","Domenic J. Dell'Osso, Jr. - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Charles, we are forecasting a very weak NGL pricing environment for the year. There was a part of your question that didn't come through. But in general, we have a fair amount of ethane, some of which we do need to recover, given various specs. And so we're pulled down by ethane prices even in this environment, and pricing will be challenged this year on the NGL front.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Got it. Thank you, Nick. And maybe the part that was not \u2013 that didn't come through was if that was related to that \u2013 to the negative midstream margin we saw in Q4. Is that really attributable to that, to the NGL pricing difficulties?","Domenic J. Dell'Osso, Jr. - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","No, that's really not the same driver at all.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Okay. Okay. And then if I could get you guys to talk a little bit more about your, I guess, your overall CapEx philosophy. And I know you guys have spent a whole lot of time and I'm sure more iterations than you want to talk about, looking at what your 2015 plan is going to be. But as I look at it, you guys are one of the few companies or maybe one of just a handful that are significantly outspending cash flow in the year.","So, can you talk about what your, I guess, approach and philosophy is, especially given some of Jason's earlier comments about it's actually paying to wait right now on \u2013 not just on maybe service costs, but also with the contango in the commodity price. And so what \u2013 I guess I'm asking, why wouldn't you maybe hit the brakes harder in one, in the first half of 2015?","Robert D. \u201cDoug\u201d Lawler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, as we look at our investment opportunities across the portfolio, maintaining the underlying strength of the operating efficiencies, maintaining the strength of the leasehold position, basically what we're doing is investing at a relatively conservative rate to maintain the production and maintain all the operating efficiencies so that we can accelerate and move forward when the time is right and prudent to do so.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","That's good detail. Thank you, Doug.","Operator","And our next question is from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Good morning.","Domenic J. Dell'Osso, Jr. - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Good morning, Brian.","Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I wanted to follow up a bit on the production profile but I wanted to talk a bit on the production mix side. It seems like with much of the curtailments coming on the dry gas side, can you talk to the production mix because it seems like when we take out the Southern Marcellus production relative to fourth quarter that nat gas seems to be staying a bit flat and most of the liquids are \u2013 most of the liquids are declining. And I just \u2013 and I wonder if you can talk more specifically about what your oil backlog would be and how you see your oil production trajectory over the next few quarters?","Robert D. \u201cDoug\u201d Lawler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Certainly, Brian. It's a good question. So, the 3% to 5% production growth we anticipate for 2015 is comprised of \u2013 basically we see our oil volumes increasing in that 2% to 3% range for the year and gas is in that 4% to 5% type range. NGL is relatively flat or slightly negative for the year.","Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yeah. Got it. Are you building a big backlog of oil production that you could easily bring on or not really?","Robert D. \u201cDoug\u201d Lawler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, with that inventory, we definitely will have opportunities for increasing oil production in 2016 when we focus back on attacking that inventory.","Robert D. \u201cDoug\u201d Lawler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","As Jason noted a minute ago, the completion deferral in Eagle Ford, for example, you can always bring a frac crew back and begin to accelerate that \u2013 the newly created inventory whenever you get a price signal to do so.","Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And then given the cost cutting that you've already done, can you just talk to whether you expect to have at or better than industry cost reduction opportunities from here? And I wondered if you could also touch on the SG&A side. It may not exactly be apples-to-apples, but it looks like on a dollar per boe basis, that it was actually upticking here.","Robert D. \u201cDoug\u201d Lawler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, the \u2013 I would say that our cost cutting and efficiency, demonstrated in 2014, were like no other in the industry. And I would just \u2013 I would look to 2014 to the value creation, the value barbarians inside of Chesapeake Energy that are driving further efficiencies and value. And I would expect nothing less than seeing a low-cost operator, the most efficient operator in these assets, and continued improvements in our cost structure.","This is not \u2013 when you look back at the year and you look at what's been accomplished in the past few years inside of Chesapeake, this is not \u2013 we hope to reduce costs. This is a company that's delivering exactly what we said we were going to do, and I would expect to continue to see further cost improvements.","Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","To be specific on that then, if we fast-forward to the end of the year, where do you think we could see the greatest surprise that you would under-spend your budget, all else equal, because of cost reductions; that we would see your lease operating costs fall; or that we would see SG&A come in below your guidance?","Robert D. \u201cDoug\u201d Lawler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, Brian, looking across the board, everything is a focus point for us. Cash costs are a focus, the capital efficiencies are a focus, and we're structured and we are motivated in all the right ways inside the company today to drive that greater value. So, I would expect in every area for us to see improvement and what I believe the way that we're focusing material improvements in all the areas.","So, the uncertainly around the prices, the uncertainty in the current environment definitely impacts the amount of rigs we have running and affects the production rate, but the whole focus that we have is to be prudent and conservative in our capital allocation, continue driving the things that we've built upon in 2014 and I think you'll continue to see strong operational capital efficiency and financial improvements inside Chesapeake in 2015.","Domenic J. Dell'Osso, Jr. - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","And just to reiterate one of the points that Doug is making there, you asked us what should be the biggest sort of surprise. Well, if prices improve, the biggest source of surprise will be production.","Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Scott Hanold with RBC Capital Markets.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. Good morning. I was wondering if I could maybe ask a question again on service costs. You all talked about a 10% reduction. It's a little bit less than some in the industry have been talking about. Is there something regarding when you guys had locked in your contracts or where your contracts go to that may limit some initial cost reductions in the system? And additionally, maybe give a little bit of color. When you all spun off Seventy Seven, did you have to lock-in contracts at that point in time, which may have been, like, earlier than when obviously you would have liked to given what's happened in the market?","M. Chris Doyle - Senior Vice President - Operations, Northern Division","Hi, Scott. This is Chris Doyle. We've been working with our partners and vendors to work out a mutual solution here, and for Chesapeake, that means bringing costs in line with the current price environment. For our vendors, that means having the chance to work with the most efficient operator out there and an operator with the long-term financial sustainability of Chesapeake. The 10% of D&C is not a back-of-the-envelope number that we threw out there. This is a rigorous scheduled out line item by line item analysis of what we see as the opportunity to drive additional capital out of our system.","To your question about Seventy Seven Energy, we have the contracts in place, but we also have market price indications that mean that they have to provide us with market price, and we are seeing that market move significantly down commensurate with the current commodity price environment.","The supply chain organization that stood up 18 months ago, I've been really, really impressed with. They're there not only to maximize the purchasing power of Chesapeake, but to solve what is not just a one-dimensional problem. This is not just cost and that's it. It's also about value. It's about getting the best service for that cost.","And from our vendors' perspective, it's not all about what they can charge us. It's about operating efficiency and knowing that a Utica frac spread working for Chesapeake is going to put away two times as many stages as any other operator in the area. And so, it's a complex issue. We've got a ton of folks working it. I'm highly confident we're going to drive the best solution for our shareholders.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay.","Domenic J. Dell'Osso, Jr. - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","I might just add on top of that just real quick, Scott, the 10% is not our target. So, I think that \u2013 don't misconstrue that, well, 10% is what we hope to achieve or that we're targeting to achieve. We believe we'll be able to go beyond that. Our focus and our targets exceed that. That is just a reflection of the conservatism in our program that we expect to accomplish that, and we'll be absolutely seeking to drive greater cost reductions in that out of our program.","M. Chris Doyle - Senior Vice President - Operations, Northern Division","And the 10%, just to follow on is not a December-to-December number. We can see that significantly higher than 10%.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay, understood. And just one more point of clarification on the budget. Is there any like a standby charges on the rigs that's assumed in there?","M. Chris Doyle - Senior Vice President - Operations, Northern Division","We have, both North and South, we have some minimal expenses in there to stand rigs down, but they're not material.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And then one more, if I could. On the curtailments in the Marcellus, can you give a little bit of color, were the curtailments because obviously pricing has been a buck or \u2013 a buck or so in some of the areas. Is it because production was uneconomical or was it your positioning that we're going to just defer production for a better price at a future time?","M. Chris Doyle - Senior Vice President - Operations, Northern Division","That's really it. 2014 when I think about the Marcellus, they completely redefine the way we thought about that asset and rather than grow for growth's sake, to really key in on value and we're not going to give gas away. And essentially what we saw was what the in basin pricing, we're better to curtail that 20,000 net barrels a day then produce into a strained environment. We'll leverage our takeaway capacity, our takeaway to get out of basin and we're seeing really good out of basin realization. But we're not going to give gas away in basin.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And I know that there's not a whole lot of dollars budgeted for the Marcellus, but why spend any dollars up there at this point if we're just curtailing gas?","M. Chris Doyle - Senior Vice President - Operations, Northern Division","So, we'll be running one rig up there. There's a little bit of lease work that we have to do. Importantly, I've continued to drive the team to look at longer term testing in the area of the Upper Marcellus. We're going to drill some of those tests. This is a long-term asset for us and not one that I'm ready to completely shut the rigs down. It's not that we won't. It's just not our focus today.","And it was interesting. I was going back and we mentioned the Franclaire pad in the last quarter, and it was a stark reminder to me this previous week of how far this asset has come. Franclaire pad is a five-well pad, two wells drilled back three years ago and three wells drilled last year. The three wells drilled last year were 7,300-foot laterals versus 6,500-foot. They were drilled in an average of 12 days instead of 33 days. They were drilled for $7.3 million versus $10.8 million, and the average IP of those three wells was 22 million a day versus 6 million three years ago. So, completely different value proposition for this asset and that I just get really excited on, thinking about decades of growth and value coming out of the Marcellus.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","I appreciate all the clarity. Thank you.","Operator","And our next call is from Doug Leggate with Bank of America.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good morning, everybody. Good morning, Doug.","Robert D. \u201cDoug\u201d Lawler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I guess someone touched on this earlier about the potential cash flow CapEx balance for this year. I just wonder if I could get your perspective on this because given, obviously, you have got some hedging in place, given where the gas price is in particular, it seems, at least on our numbers, that the cash outspend could be about 50% of your capital.","Can you give us some idea as to how you see the out-spend and whether or not there is a plan in place to curtail further if things don't improve in the second half of the year? I'm just wondering if this is like a two-step process or if the budget is pretty much set for the year. And I've got a follow-up, please.","Robert D. \u201cDoug\u201d Lawler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","That's a good question, Doug. Actually, I look at it that it's an ongoing process. I don't think it's one step, two-step or three-step. I think that we will be managing that capital spend. We will be looking at our activity levels, looking at commodity prices, the cash generating capability of the portfolio. And continuing to look focusing on the long-term, on how we drive the greatest value for the long-term. So, it will be an ongoing process.","Indeed, we do see opportunities that we can continue to further reduce our capital. And as I noted in some of the initial remarks, we can also ramp it up very quickly if we see that opportunity. So, that balance of cash flow and CapEx spend for the year will be something that we're watching very closely and looking to optimize given the current market conditions.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Doug, I don't want to press the point too much, but as an order of magnitude, maybe this is one for Nick. But I think on your planning assumptions, what would you expect the outspend to be for this year, because you've done tremendous job in capital efficiencies? Obviously, the commodities have all gone against you a bit here. But you have \u2013 you came in on one of the key premises was to get that spending back within cash flow and I'm just curious, is it marginal in your view or is it material for this year? I'm just trying to get a feel as to how you guys are thinking about it.","Robert D. \u201cDoug\u201d Lawler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, the way I'm looking at is long-term value, Doug. And so, the benefit that Chesapeake has today with our operating strength and our financial strength is that if we continue to invest above our cash flow based on commodity prices, what you can trust to be confident is that has a long-term benefit. And so, obviously, where it sits today, we will be in a deficit spending situation. But the point there is to continue to look at the long-term. And so, I hesitate to say, well, what are prices going to be in the latter part of the year? What's the recovery going to be? Well, what you have is an operating and efficient capital machine that we can ramp up or ramp down accordingly.","So, rather than guide to what a specific outspend would be, I would just ask you to focus on what's been accomplished in 2014: the capital efficiency, the improvements in our cash costs, improvements in the capital program. As Chris noted, the improvements in capital efficiency, whether it be cost or EUR across the portfolio are significant. And so, our focus is driving that value for the long term.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I guess my follow-up, hopefully, is I guess kind of related, Doug. It's on the rig allocation that you've laid out in the release. It seems that the areas getting the least reduction, if you like, are the Haynesville and the Mississippi Lime. I'm kind of having a tough time seeing that either of those is economic at $3 gas and $50 oil.","So, can you help us understand why they're not seeing a greater decline in the context of that pursuit of value, and whether or not there is \u2013 whether it's HBP obligations or midstream obligations, what's driving the decision to hold the rig count relatively steady in those two areas? I'll leave it there. Thanks.","Mikell J. \u201cJason\u201d Pigott - Senior Vice President-Operations, Southern Division","Hi, Doug. This is Jason Pigott. The Miss Lime, again, the teams have been just continually outperforming in that area. It's one that every time we drill a well, it continues to exceed our expectations. Even at $3 gas and $50 oil, we're getting 18% rate of returns out of the Miss Lime in our core. So, they're really strong returns.","That system, what we do is we build out our water infrastructure as we go along, so it's a little bit difficult to predict some of our expansion opportunities. But the teams have continually outperformed the type curves. Our Miss Lime, we have a great position. It's actually one of the best projects in our portfolio and one that we probably don't highlight enough.","With respect to the Haynesville, as I mentioned, the teams are really just crushing it there on costs. We do have the minimum volume commitments there that we consider when we're making our economic decisions. When you consider that we will pay those gathering fees whether or not we drill or produce a well or not, those returns are 40% rate of return internally in the Haynesville, so they're the most economic project that we would invest in our company right now. So, they're really strong.","The teams are continually pressing the limits there. We've tried new things like stacked laterals that have come on line recently. We've tried changes to our completion designs, and those results have both been really positive, and they've been positive in some of our areas that have historically had lower EURs. So, the technological innovation there has just been fantastic, and it really is going to expand our inventory in the Haynesville.","Additionally, we've just drilled our first two \u2013 well, we've drilled the first and are drilling the second 7,500-foot lateral in the Haynesville, so we should have those pads on line, too. And those generate very competitive rate of returns whether or not you consider those MVCs as sunk-costs or not. And both of those programs, they're one of the best investments we can make in the company, which is why we continue to have those higher rig rates there, and it's just \u2013 again, the teams have done an outstanding job of turning both of those assets around in the last year.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right. I appreciate the answer. I guess I'll take it offline, but I'm kind of looking at the balance of outspend relative \u2013 from an 18% return in this environment when costs haven't fallen yet. I guess I'm just trying to understand why the activity level doesn't fall further, but I appreciate the answer, guys. Thanks very much indeed.","Operator","And our next question is from Neal Dingmann with SunTrust.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Good morning, guys. Just a little on Doug's question. In the areas, could you talk about kind of lease obligations? Is there anything that come into play? I know most of your areas now \u2013 I've talked to Chris and Jason in the past. I know most are HBP, I'm just wondering. Obviously, looking at the Utica, Haynesville, Powder and the Miss, is there anything that just significant lease obligation to speak of?","M. Chris Doyle - Senior Vice President - Operations, Northern Division","Neal, this is Chris Doyle. As we've said in the past, there is still a little bit of HBP activity up in the Utica. We'd see that as probably two to three rigs and that creates sort of that minimum rig count to continue to hold that acreage position. No other acreage or meaningful acreage issues in the Marcellus or in Powder.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Okay. And then, Nick you'd mentioned about the service costs assuming some further decrease in there. Are you able to continue to take advantage of service costs continue to fall as most predict? Will you continue to benefit from that or I'm just wondering or do you have some already termed out? I'm just wondering how you \u2013 what you all have for contract wise?","M. Chris Doyle - Senior Vice President - Operations, Northern Division","So, this is Chris Doyle again. Contract-wise, we have \u2013 we will continue to move with the market up or down. We don't lock in to fixed fees, fixed rates. We want to capture any further reductions and likewise for our suppliers. If the market returns, we'll see that increase as well. We don't lock into any set of long-term prices for the most part.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Got it. And then just lastly looking on the schedule, on the guidance schedule at the NGL and the natural gas I guess estimates or differentials, if you will. Are those based on some of your midstream \u2013 I guess what I'm trying to get a sense of when I look at that natural gas at $1.70 to $1.90, a bit lower than the past. Is that some of your obligations that are factored in there, or maybe if you could just talk a little bit about how those are established?","Domenic J. Dell'Osso, Jr. - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, that's actually not too dissimilar than what we saw in 2014. That includes basis differentials. That includes gathering. That includes long-haul transport. So, that's an all-in number, and, again, it's pretty similar to what we saw last year. What we've done is we spiked out the MVC to make sure that it's clear what that number is. That'll be a fourth quarter expense, just like it was this year. And so, the $1.70 to $1.90 is inclusive of all the other.","Again, we are forecasting, as I noted with curtailments being in place \u2013 given that we're forecasting curtailments in place for the full year, we're forecasting weak Marcellus, North Marcellus pricing for the full year 2015.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Thanks, Nick. Great color.","Operator","And our next is from Matt Portillo with TPH.","Matthew Merrel Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Good morning, guys.","Robert D. \u201cDoug\u201d Lawler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Matt.","Matthew Merrel Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Two quick questions for me. Just one follow-up on the Schedule A that you guys put out. Could you just remind us what WTI and NYMEX price you're assuming as kind of the base there?","Domenic J. Dell'Osso, Jr. - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","It's roughly $55 and $3 for gas.","Matthew Merrel Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Great. And then I guess my second follow-up question in regards to your spending program as you think kind of longer term around capital allocation. You mentioned kind of a number of times that as the commodity price warrants, there's the potential to reaccelerate growth. Is there a level we should be thinking about, heading into 2016 and beyond, that kind of triggers that reacceleration of capital, both from an oil and gas perspective? And kind of where would you likely allocate capital first as you kind of think about adding rigs or laying rigs back into the market?","Robert D. \u201cDoug\u201d Lawler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I think, obviously, we'll be targeting where we can derive the greatest value, and so that's somewhat dependent on the commodities. I mean, obviously, the opportunities that we have in the Eagle Ford to accelerate that program are very strong and then the gas opportunities going back to the Utica or additional rigs in the Haynesville provide us great flexibility and that's one of the benefits of our portfolio.","So, we haven't put like an exact price target there Matt, that we're saying, you know, at this price we're going to come back in, because we have a number of strategic opportunities that we're evaluating and we'll continue to evaluate how do we drive the greatest value.","M. Chris Doyle - Senior Vice President - Operations, Northern Division","One thing I would add there is, with the Rockies, this is an asset team that redefine themselves as well in 2014, prepared to run seven to nine rigs. We're running three to four. And so we will be ready to pull the trigger. 2014 saw not only successful expansion tests in the Niobrara aerially but also vertically with multiple benches being test but successful tests in the Parkman and the Sussex. We had a successful test now in the Teapot well exceeding our expectations, making over 400 barrels a day, just a ton of stacked potential in that play. I would see us looking to that area to potentially ramp up given the right price environment.","Matthew Merrel Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Thanks very much.","Operator","And our next question is from Dan McSpirit with BMO Capital Markets.","Dan E. McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you and good morning. Doug, you've seen more than one cycle on your lifetime, how precious is liquidity this time around? I ask the question on weighing opportunities that way in an effort to get a better sense of how cautious you may be in the current environment.","Robert D. \u201cDoug\u201d Lawler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","It's a great question, Dan. And liquidity and the ability to have flexible options in this commodity price environment is extremely valuable. And we feel that we are competitively positioned to execute with our existing portfolio for the long haul. We feel like that we are also very strong with respect to having opportunities to improve and build upon the portfolio. So, that liquidity is absolutely paramount and key to giving us that flexibility.","Dan E. McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Very good.

The company has now aligned its structure to deliver differential value to our shareholders through disciplined cash flow growth rather than an activity-focused, land-driven capital program.","We have recently completed an extensive review of the entire asset base and I\u2019m very pleased with the value-creation opportunities that exist in our portfolio. Through the transformation process, we\u2019ve maintained our focus on improved operational efficiencies and reducing capital intensity. This statement is supported by solid third quarter financial results and oil production growth. ","Another key takeaway for the quarter is our continued progress regarding capital discipline. In the third quarter, our drilling and completion capital spending was approximately $350 million less than the second quarter. We have also reduced our land acquisition spending and our production costs.","We still have significant opportunities to improve our capital allocation and efficiency and reduce our cash costs, which we believe will result in greater returns and greater cash flow. For the quarter, Chesapeake reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.43, which compares to $0.10 per share in the third quarter of 2012.","Adjusted EBITDA was $1.325 billion, up 29% year over year. On the production side, oil growth led the way, up 23% year over year, while total production growth, on an organic basis and adjusted for asset sales, in the third quarter was approximately 8% year over year.","Net oil production in the third quarter increased to 120,000 barrels per day, or roughly 4,000 barrels per day greater than in the second quarter. This is despite the sale of assets in the Mississippi Lime and Northern Eagle Ford Shale, that contributed approximately 15,000 net barrels of oil per day in the second quarter. Oil production growth in the third quarter came primarily from the Eagle Ford and to a lesser extent the Utica, Mississippi Lime, and the Southern Marcellus. ","The percentage of production from liquids plays increased to 27% during the quarter and the percentage of realized revenue was 65%. We expect a continuation of this trend due to the ongoing ramp up in the Eagle Ford and the Utica, and the continued focus of our capital program on liquids drilling.","In light of better than expected oil production during the third quarter, we are again raising our full year 2013 oil production outlook by 2 million barrels to a range of 40 million to 42 million barrels. With one quarter left in the quarter, you\u2019ll note that the midpoint of our guidance implies a projected decrease in oil production from the third quarter to the fourth quarter of approximately 9,000 barrels per day.","I\u2019d like to point out a few factors underlying this anticipated sequential decrease. Accelerated inventory reduction during the second quarter in the Eagle Ford, along with one month of oil production from assets that we sold at the end of July, provided additional oil volumes in the third quarter, while weather and infrastructure issues in the Eagle Ford during October have slightly reduced oil volumes for the fourth quarter.","Additionally, as part of our focus on discipline, we have reduced our rig count at the Eagle Ford throughout the year. This short term break has allowed us to concentrate on optimizing the drilling program going forward as we transition to a pad-based program, which we expect will lead to improved cycle times and improved project economics.","We have also increased our focus on well scheduling, which we anticipate will minimize downtime associated with simultaneous operations in the future. We expect that these factors will combine to provide a brief pause in the growth rate in the Eagle Ford oil production during the fourth quarter, with an expected return to sequential organic growth in 2014. We look forward to sharing a more detailed outlook with you early next year. ","Now I\u2019d like to switch gears and discuss capital spending. I\u2019m very proud of the asset teams for coming in under budget for the quarter while still meeting or exceeding our production targets. Drilling and completion expenditures were approximately $1.25 billion during the third quarter, roughly $180 million less than budget and $350 million less than the second quarter.","Spending on new lease hold was $45 million during the quarter, or approximately $50 million below budget. The lower than expected capital expenditure level is partially attributable to fewer wells drilled and completed in the quarter. We are also beginning to experience capital efficiencies and lower average well costs resulting from improved operating performance, most notably in the Eagle Ford, where our drilling on single well patches decreased from approximately 65% in the first half of the year to 40% in the third quarter, and we anticipate this percentage will be approximately 25% in the fourth quarter and 15% or lower next year. ","Turning to asset sales, through the end of the third quarter, we have received proceeds of approximately $3.6 billion. During the fourth quarter, Chesapeake anticipates completing additional asset sales for net proceeds of approximately $600 million. Additionally, we continue to pursue other asset sales transactions that may close in the first half of 2014.","The proceeds from sales are anticipated to be directed toward reducing financial leverage and complexity and further enhancing our liquidity. We expect that further transactions will be driven by portfolio optimization rather than near term funding needs. As previously noted last quarter, we currently do not see any need to issue equity, and we will continue to drive greater efficiencies into our capital program. These efficiencies and cost leadership are an important part of our ongoing effort to match capital expenditures with cash flow.","To conclude, I\u2019m very pleased with the organization\u2019s ability to deliver on its near term production and cost targets at a time when multiple transformational initiatives have been in progress. Some of the results of these initiatives are already being realized while we expect others to be realized over time.","As previously noted, we will be providing our 2014 guidance in early 2014, after we have completed our assessment of the optimal allocation of capital within our portfolio for the year. We expect to continue delivering organic production growth next year, and we plan to do so with a lower capital program than in 2013.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Nick Dell\u2019Osso, our chief financial officer, for additional financial and performance information. Nick?","Nick Dell\u2019Osso ","Thanks, Doug, and good morning. As Doug noted, the third quarter was a strong quarter for production, asset sales, and capital discipline, which enabled us to lower 2013 capital expenditure guidance and leave production guidance relatively flat while at the same time making substantial improvements in our balance sheet and liquidity.","We ended the third quarter with nearly $5.2 billion of liquidity, consisting of $4 billion of undrawn corporate revolver, approximately $215 million of availability on our oilfield services revolver, and approximately $1 billion of unrestricted cash.","Our liquidity position improved by approximately $430 million compared to the end of the second quarter, and by approximately $840 million from year-end 2012. Long term debt net of cash ended the quarter at $11.7 billion, down from $12.4 billion at the end of the second quarter and $12.3 billion at the end of the year.","In line with our strategy, we continue to reduce financial leverage and complexity and have a number of initiatives underway in the fourth quarter of this year that will continue into next year. For example, we recently repurchased some assets that were subject to sale leaseback arrangements with financial counterparties including surface real estate in Fort Worth as well as a package of drilling rigs. ","Turning to costs, our production expense in the quarter was $0.76 per Mcfe as we continue to do a good job of managing LOE despite our ongoing transition to liquids. Accordingly, we are reducing our full year 2013 production expense guidance range by $0.05 to $0.80 to $0.85 per Mcfe.","Looking ahead, we are focused on optimizing production and returns, so some of the initiatives we believe could be very positive to our program, such as work over expenses and increased usage of artificial lift, may result in some upward pressure to production expenses from current levels as we get into our 2014 development program.","Longer term, we aim to further optimize our per-unit production expense even as we transition to a higher mix of liquids in our production stream. To accomplish this, we have established a cross-functional team specifically charged with identifying and implementing LOE reduction and optimization measures.","With respect to G&A, many of you have seen the announcement surrounding our workforce reductions during September and October. These were difficult but necessary actions to align the organization with our new operational structure and strategy to achieve profitable growth from captured resources. We have also been implementing other non-workforce-related G&A initiatives over the last year that will result in further cost savings, the full effect of which we will highlight for you with our 2014 outlook.","On the hedging front, we have been actively locking in oil and gas prices for next year via swaps and collars, as well as opportunistically covering a portion of our short oil call position. We have entered into swaps covering 2014 production to establish an average natural gas price below our $4.23 per Mcf on approximately 640 million cubic feet a day of production. On the oil side, we have swaps with an average floor of $93.79 per barrel covering about 60,000 barrels per day. ","With regard to our long-dated oil call position, we have taken advantage of low volatility and the decline in oil prices in recent days to buy back approximately half of our outstanding short call position in 2014 and approximately 35% of the position in 2015. This will free up hedging capacity and provide us flexibility to enter into more downside oil price protection when and if the market provides an attractive opportunity to do so.","I\u2019d like to conclude with some comments about our natural gas differentials, and in particular Northeast basis. Our company-wide natural gas differentials for the quarter came in at $1.46 per Mcf, which is an increase of $0.17 per Mcf compared to the second quarter. ","This increase is primarily attributable to the temporary maintenance related basis dislocations that we and other operators experienced in the Marcellus during the quarter. We have adjusted full year differential guidance in our outlook to reflect the basis widening we have seen in the Marcellus and to a lesser extent other basins. ","Chesapeake has firm transportation contracts for approximately one-third of the 1.4 Bcf per day of new capacity going in service in the Northern Marcellus during the fourth quarter, as we look to route production into more favorable markets.","Thank you for your time this morning, and we will now open up the call for questions. Operator? ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions.] And we\u2019ll take our first question from Dave Kistler with Simmons & Company.","Dave Kistler - Simmons & Company ","Real quickly, just thinking about \u201914 and the progress you guys have had with cost reduction so far, can you highlight for us, or just give us a little bit of indication, of where you think you could see the biggest area for continued improved reduction in cost or capital efficiency?","Doug Lawler ","I guess the way I would answer that for you, in light of not being able to give the particular guidance by area for 2014, is that a lot of the initiatives that we have undergone have been what I call cost management. And I believe that we have cost leadership opportunities in all of the areas in which we invest. And those cost leadership initiatives are going to provide us significantly better returns and better margins in 2014 as we go forward in our program. ","So rather than focus on one particular area or highlight what area might benefit from the specific initiatives, I believe that all the areas are going to benefit and it\u2019s because of the focus, it\u2019s because of the supply chain synergies and the opportunities to capture efficiencies that the company has previously been unable to do as we move to a more efficient well-disciplined drilling and completion program on multi-well pads.","Dave Kistler - Simmons & Company ","And then just based on your comment of moving to multi-well pads, can you talk a little bit about maybe what that means to production? Not so much the trajectory as you highlighted organic growth, but more so should we expect the production becomes lumpy, or the particular areas - perhaps the Eagle Ford or the Utica - will see really lumpy production? Just trying to get a handle on that going forward.","Doug Lawler","Sure, that\u2019s a good question. As you would expect, when you move to multi-well pads your cycle times can increase a little. But overall, based on the focus that we have, I think that we\u2019ll continue to see some lumpiness in the program, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be too different from what we\u2019ve seen in the past, and my hope is that with the better planning, the better cycle time in aggregate, structuring, as I mentioned in my notes about the scheduling initiatives that are in place, I\u2019m hopeful that that will completely offset whatever multi-well pad drilling and completion operations could result in as far as lumpiness.","Dave Kistler - Simmons & Company ","And then maybe just one more in the Eagle Ford. Given the production growth that you saw, some of the other hiccups, can you just talk about the wells that you did complete? Kind of laterals, costs, anything that you did differently that contributed to the strong production growth there?","Doug Lawler ","We had about 140 turn in line wells in the Eagle Ford during the quarter, which was outstanding performance. We\u2019re getting into an efficiency mode and attacking the wells and how we can expedite the production, shortening the cycle times, planning for the next completion and the infrastructure. So it really is a combination of all those different things that are resulting and seeing some improved performance there. I\u2019m excited about what the Eagle Ford has to offer for us, as you are aware. We have the industry leading oil growth rate in the Eagle Ford, and it\u2019s very competitive and we expect additional really good things to come from the Eagle Ford.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch "," ","Doug, I met with you and your team not so long ago, and my understanding is that you\u2019ve got a bunch of task teams or task forces in [town] where you\u2019re looking at stretch goals to bring operating costs down by something on the order of 50%. That\u2019s a big goal. I\u2019m just wondering if you could give us an update as to how you see progress there and the likely timeline for delivery. And I\u2019ve got a follow up please.","Doug Lawler ","We see huge opportunity there, and that\u2019s something that\u2019s going to take place over time. Capturing the innovation and the ideas of our field staff, the use of automation in our operations, and all the different things we have available to us, competitive things such as our data systems that we have here in Oklahoma City, how we can optimize drilling, completion, and production operations are all really really exciting things that I believe will continue to help us on our production cost. ","So we have set some very aggressive targets. We are performing well on our lease operating expenses and production costs. I\u2019m encouraged by the progress the teams have made to date. But we\u2019re not satisfied with it, and we see huge opportunity there. And we\u2019ll be striving for a pole position with respect to our lease operating costs compared to our peers. ","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch ","Could you remind me too, the progress to date, Doug?","Doug Lawler ","I haven\u2019t provided that yet. We\u2019ll be putting that information in when we share our 2014 guidance.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch ","One other one from me. I don\u2019t know if this is one you\u2019re able to answer with any eloquence, but what I\u2019m trying to do is reconcile lower spending with your comments in your press release suggesting that you will still have growth next year. So can you help us with the order of magnitude as to what the core of the core well profile looks like compared to, let\u2019s say, the average wells that you had been drilling to try and hold acreage? And I guess the key areas like the Marcellus, Utica, and Eagle Ford would be the ones we\u2019d focus on. ","Doug Lawler ","As you\u2019re aware, the single well pad drilling, the HBP focus to keep the lease hold and continue the test the acreage that we have under lease initiatives have been significant in the past several years. But it has not been efficient. And so the production growth recognized from these single well pads and as we\u2019ve delineated the acreage has not been the most efficient production growth. ","That said, we still have to demonstrate our ability in the core of the core to show higher quality, better returns, and offset the inefficient production growth decline that will be taking place in the next few years. And so that really is the crux of the evaluation process and how we\u2019re focusing where the capital can be directed to capture the best margins and the best returns, and to continue to show and demonstrate competitive growth.","So there\u2019s really not any other advice I can provide for you there at this point in time, other than the comment that I made that we expect to see positive production growth next year with the lower capital spend.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch ","Is this the kind of thing you\u2019ll be able to add more color on when you provide guidance?","Doug Lawler ","Absolutely.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch ","Okay. And the final one from me, if I may, the $600 million of disposals planned for Q4, can you quantify any volume impact associated with those? Sorry if I missed that in your remarks. And maybe an update as to how you see the order of magnitude on further disposals, let\u2019s say first half of next year. ","Doug Lawler ","Just to be clear here, we\u2019re only talking about probably an impact of one month from the transactions that are slated for the fourth quarter. So the production impact of those this year won\u2019t be significant. It\u2019s safe to say our asset sale program is still focused on assets that we consider to be outside of our primary development plans and focus areas. ","We have a lot of great assets, as you know, and some of those are coveted by others, including at times others that operate those assets. And so this is just a chunk of assets here that we\u2019re selling that shouldn\u2019t have an impact on fourth quarter production in a material way, and really shouldn\u2019t impact the trajectory going forward in a material way, on what\u2019s being sold. ","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch ","And order of magnitude for next year?","Doug Lawler ","On this package, no. I don\u2019t want to give an order of magnitude on it, because like I said, it\u2019s not going to have a material impact on the trajectory.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from David Heikkinen with Heikkinen Energy Advisors.","David Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors ","You all provide really good details in your press releases in each area as far as wells completed and activity levels. Could you give us kind of an outlook as far as pace in each area, of what we should be reading at year-end just to help us kind of illuminate the slowdown in the Eagle Ford and what your exit rate would be from a rig count might be helpful as well, in each region?","Doug Lawler ","We\u2019re in that process right now, of narrowing down and focusing on what exactly those rig counts are going to be. At present, we\u2019re in the 60 rig range, and I think you can expect that through the rest of the fourth quarter. As we look to provide that guidance in 2014, we\u2019ll be more specific about ranges in the Eagle Ford and the other areas. ","I think the question is very good, but without being able to provide more detail on it, what I can share with you is we are focused on it very very intently and making sure that the capital that we have to spend is absolutely directed at the best spot to provide the competitive growth metrics that we believe we need to achieve.","So your question is good, but you\u2019re a couple of months ahead of us in being able to provide that information.","David Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors ","If we just think about a run rate then, you\u2019ve pulled down to 60 rigs, you slowed down a little bit in the Eagle Ford, just because of the month of October. Everything else kind of runs the same. I guess the problem is in the Utica with the Natrium fire, probably that slows down as well. Can you give us an idea of what your current Utica production is maybe?","Doug Lawler ","We\u2019ve been working closely with Dominion, and as we\u2019ve looked there at that fire and how it\u2019s impacted this, we had provided information that suggested we were going to be in the $330 million net exit rate there for Utica. We\u2019ve had really, really good growth from the second to the third quarter in our volumes, and with the Kensington facility starting up in December, there\u2019s an additional $200 million that will be coming available. ","So I don\u2019t think that the surface related, whether it be processing, compression, or infrastructure issues right there are going to materially impact our operations and rig count in the Utica, just because these are short term in nature and we\u2019ll be working through those and continuing to optimize on our own efficiencies and what we control. ","David Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors ","So it\u2019s just fourth quarter that it impacts?","Doug Lawler ","Yes.","David Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors ","And then Nick, your comments on gathering and transported marketing have been a focus in the market on what\u2019s happening in the Northeast, kind of on average are your realizations on oil, gas, and NGLs tend to be a little lower than peers. Can you give us a little more detail as far as how much of that is fixed and how much of that is variable, just given the temporary maintenance?","Nick Dell\u2019Osso ","Well, the moves this quarter are primarily due to the basis differentials in the Northeast, and to a lesser extent some other basins. But we\u2019ve had our guidance out there for what our differentials look like based on our gathering and transport contracts that are in place for the year, and then I would say they were impacted again this quarter by what we saw in the way of basis. So without breaking it out specifically, because obviously those contracts are not all fixed and under [unintelligible] themselves, I would just guide you to look at it that way.","David Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors ","So it kind of keeps the same levels, maybe bring it down a little bit once you get past this temporary issue?","Nick Dell\u2019Osso ","I\u2019d like to think we should return to a little better differential after we get past this temporary issue, that\u2019s right.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from David Tameron with Wells Fargo.","David Tameron - Wells Fargo "," ","Just a couple of questions. Doug, back to the capex comment about 2014, I know you\u2019ve said before in the past that your other capex is going to be down. When you\u2019re talking about lower capex year on year, are you just talking about E&D? Or are you talking about the total?","Doug Lawler ","I\u2019m talking about the total.","David Tameron - Wells Fargo ","Care to give any color on E&D?","Doug Lawler ","I would love to, but you\u2019re going to have to hang with me there for a little bit, David.","David Tameron - Wells Fargo ","All right. No problem. And then let me get back to David\u2019s question. You guys put out some rig projections. In the second quarter you said you were going from \u201913 going to end the year at 10 in the Eagle Ford, those types of numbers. Are those still good? Or are those all being reevaluated right now? ","Doug Lawler ","Well, I think there\u2019s so many opportunities for improvement there, not only with the way that the drilling and completion teams are looking at the operations and already realizing synergies and reduced costs, but there\u2019s also opportunities with our scheduling and our simultaneous operations planning that\u2019s going to also help reduce cycle time and help improve that cash on cash cycle time. And so all of those things are weighing into whether or not we run 10 rigs or 12 rigs. ","And as you\u2019re fully aware, the capacity of this organization and the talent that resides here, if we need to run 15 rigs in there, we can do it very quickly. If we decide we need to run 20, we can do that. But it\u2019s going to be at a pace that gives us the optimal returns, and so what we see at present is that we\u2019re at that 10 rig run rate, and there will be an opportunity to potentially increase that next year, but it\u2019s not going to be at the expense of parking capital in the ground that we don\u2019t get a return on, and a return in competitive near term order. ","So the pace, the returns, the quality of the investment, and the cycle time are going to really drive that, and what\u2019s great about it is we can run 10, 12, or 20, and have done it before. ","David Tameron - Wells Fargo ","And then just last question, on the divestment front, you talked about the $600 million in the fourth quarter, but you still have the service piece out there, some other interest in various E&P companies, etc. What\u2019s your outlook for those as we head into \u201914 or even \u201915 as far as\u2026 I know your capex spend is going to be way down in the service side, but can you just talk about outlook for those assets?","Doug Lawler ","We\u2019re continuing to evaluate the portfolio, and each of the entities and assets that are underneath Chesapeake Energy we are working and looking closely at to make sure that the returns generated are accretive to higher corporate performance. And there\u2019s noncore assets that have been sold off, there are other assets that we\u2019re looking at potentially selling, and basically it\u2019s going to be return-driven on the total portfolio. And we\u2019re in a position where our liquidity and our cash flow generation, there\u2019s not anything that\u2019s going to be sold on a fire sale basis or that needs to be done so that we can fund our capital program next year. ","So it will be more opportunistic in how it fits in our portfolio, and I think that the best way of perhaps answering your question is that there are a number of other things that we\u2019re looking at because we have a high-priority target to continue to improve our balance sheet and we\u2019re going to do that. ","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Scott Hanold with RBC.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets ","Could I just clarify one thing? In the Utica, are you basically confirming your 330 million a day target exit rate? Is that right?","Doug Lawler ","No, it is subject to the Natrium plant, and when it comes back online. But I think the key there is that we\u2019re ready to go, and with the Kensington plant coming on, we\u2019ve got adequate capacity that we\u2019ll continue to be ramping up there, and it\u2019s just a near term issue. And we\u2019ll hopefully get past that pretty quickly.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets ","The other thing is that you all indicated at the beginning, I think, that you did sort of that review of your asset base, and you see a lot of value creation opportunities. Stepping back and looking at the context of that comment, is that sort of implying that there\u2019s just a lot of high-level development opportunities there, or that there\u2019s certainly a lot more monetization effort that you can undertake as you look into \u201914 and beyond?","Doug Lawler ","I think the fair answer there is it\u2019s both. We see significant opportunities for capital reduction, capital efficiency, and the process that we\u2019ve implemented, and it\u2019s working very well right now in how we competitively allocate our capital for the best returns. I\u2019m very pleased with the progress we\u2019ve made on that, and monetization, things that we don\u2019t see that will be a part of our investment portfolio in the next several years will be evaluated for potential monetization.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets ","And would you be willing to speak specifically about [unintelligible], or maybe in general, like things like ownership of oilfield services, Frac Tec, Chaparral? I mean when you look at those relative to CHK\u2019s other upstream opportunities, would you consider those a little bit more noncore?","Doug Lawler ","Well, we\u2019ve talked about some of those assets in the past as being items that we would be willing to sell. And frankly there\u2019s no difference in viewpoint there. The reality is we have no need to rush out and just take whatever price is available. ","So for example on Chaparral or Frac Tec, those are our assets that given where valuations are in the industry today, and the structure of our ownership, we could either sell or hold for better valuation at some point. They don\u2019t require us to continue to put capital into those entities, and they\u2019re passive investments. And so we\u2019re not in a rush to sell at a bottom price, and yet there\u2019s still things that we would be willing to sell. So as far as their being noncore, I\u2019m happy to say that\u2019s still the case. ","Doug touched on oilfield services previously, our own internal services, that is, and that\u2019s a business that we\u2019ve owned for a long time, we\u2019ve had a lot of success with, and it\u2019s part of what we\u2019re reviewing to determine the best way to own and operate or get value from that business going forward. ","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets ","And then one more quick one if I might, more of an operational question in the Eagle Ford. Are you all evaluating other formations or zones outside of the Eagle Ford? Are you looking at both the upper and lower Eagle Ford, the Buda or Pearsall? Are those things you\u2019re testing at this point?","Doug Lawler ","Yes, as you know, we\u2019ve got a significant lease hold position there, and we see other opportunities as well. So I think that we\u2019ll continue, as we look to improve our Eagle Ford program and performance, making progress on the things that have already been accomplished so far this year, that looking at those other opportunities for additional investment, we\u2019ll be evaluating and testing through time. ","And so there\u2019s a number of initiatives that are in place on our lease hold, including spacing and other optimization efforts that we believe are going to pay off very nicely for us with that large lease hold position. ","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Arun Jayaram with Credit Suisse.","Arun Jayaram - Credit Suisse ","I just wanted to just see if you could give us a little bit of a baseline as we look towards, you mentioned in the press release, organic growth in 2014. Just wanted to see if you could give us a baseline on what we should think about. You had some asset sales this year, just to base that organic growth on. And my follow up is would you expect to grow your liquids in \u201914 relative to that baseline? ","Doug Lawler ","Yes, we continue to expect, with our focus on the Eagle Ford and the other liquids plays, that we\u2019ll continue to grow our liquids.","Arun Jayaram - Credit Suisse ","And just trying to understand what the baseline for that growth would be, given the asset sales that you\u2019ve done in 2013.","Doug Lawler ","The organic growth rate in the third quarter was 8%, and so when you look at the divestitures and things that we can be potentially looking at next year, that\u2019s why we have said that we have confidence that we\u2019ll be able to continue to show positive growth with the reduced capital in 2014.","Arun Jayaram - Credit Suisse ","Just to clarify, I\u2019m just trying to understand, when you\u2019re talking about organic growth, and as we look to our models, do we just assume your actual reported results in \u201914, are you parsing out the impact of asset sales? ","Doug Lawler ","Yes, same-store sales is what we\u2019re describing as organic growth, but if you look at it in an aggregate basis as well, we still are evaluating it with plans that we will continue to see growth next year. So without being able to provide you the exact detail just yet, we have to continue to defer to when that guidance will be provided and that detail is coming shortly.","Arun Jayaram - Credit Suisse ","Fair enough. And just a follow up, as you think about potentially doing something with your oil service assets per se, obviously that\u2019s, perhaps, helped you in terms of thinking about efficiencies, but as you know, Doug, the oil service multiples are quite a bit lower than Chesapeake\u2019s current multiple. So just wondering if you can talk about maybe some of the positives of separating oilfield services from, on the flipside, some of the negatives.","Doug Lawler ","Well, as Nick highlighted, the oilfield services have provided a very good competitive advantage for Chesapeake, and we\u2019ve seen tremendous synergies by having those assets in the company. And part of our ongoing evaluation there includes, with our new strategy, how can we best optimize with those assets as a part of the company. ","And so it\u2019s under review, and we\u2019re going to continue to evaluate it, because the driver there is that with all of our assets, we\u2019re going to make sure that we get the best returns on all the capital that we spend, and our direction in trying to be a better performer and a top quartile performer. So it\u2019s under review, and at this point in time, that\u2019s really all the color I can provide on it. And we\u2019ll share more with you when we can. ","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Neal Dingmann with SunTrust.","Neal Dingmann - SunTrust ","Just wondering, on as far as lease expenditures, your thoughts on next year versus this year and how you see that. Clearly, you\u2019ve got the capital reduction plan in place, but just wondering, still on leases, what your thoughts are.","Doug Lawler ","The company still has a very significant lease hold, and as we are going through this process of evaluating where the capital will be allocated next year, some of that lease hold will continue to be developed. Some of it will be tested for whatever technology or synergies that we can push to those areas to capture value in the future, and some of the lease hold won\u2019t make it in our cut. ","And so we\u2019ve got an ongoing process that we\u2019ll be continuing to evaluate, and that evaluation will include current operations and what we can do with it to get the best returns. It will also include how technology and innovation can be applied, and in some cases, if it\u2019s very long-dated, or we don\u2019t see [unintelligible] to it, we\u2019ll actually sell it or relinquish it. So the lease hold position, the key there is we\u2019re not going to be a land-driven company. ","Neal Dingmann - SunTrust ","And then just one other question, turning it over to the Utica. You\u2019ve got a good slide on 13 that basically lays out the midstream development there. Your thoughts? Is that now, when you look at it going forward, keeping up to your activity there? Or are you still resting some of these wells, maybe perhaps a little bit longer than you would waiting on some midstream?","Doug Lawler ","It\u2019s improving, and I think what you\u2019ll see is continued improvements with the additional facilities and processing that\u2019s being built out and will be in place the latter part of this year. So I think that that story and matching the cycle times and the optimum investment rate there that rig count and all is under close review, and I believe it will be very close to optimized in 2014. ","And we\u2019re not quite there, but with all the infrastructure that\u2019s being put in place, and it will be in service here in the latter part of the fourth quarter, first part of next year, we don\u2019t see that materially impacting the pace that we\u2019ve got scheduled at this point in time. ","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Peter Kissel with Howard Weil.","Peter Kissel - Howard Weil","Nick, one more question on the balance sheet, please. It seems like you\u2019re pretty comfortable with the current leverage levels, and of course you\u2019ve got the $600 million coming in the door over the next quarter or so. So it seems like your plan is to basically just drill your way to a less levered balance sheet. Am I reading that correctly? Or is there some sort of more drastic delevering event to look for in \u201914?","Nick Dell\u2019Osso ","Well, when you say we\u2019re comfortable with our current level of leverage, I guess I\u2019d answer that in two ways. One, I don\u2019t feel any current pressure in the market relative to our current level of leverage, and obviously credit markets are favorable. The cost of debt is favorable. However, for the long run, we believe our balance sheet has too much debt on it, and we have a strategic goal to reduce that. ","And so as we look at our portfolio, and as we identify the assets that we believe are not optimal for us to own, and like we said, we think there are several that, over the course of the next many months and maybe years, we\u2019ll be where we would like to sell them. We expect that a number of those proceeds will go towards reducing the leverage on our balance sheet. ","And when I say the leverage on our balance sheet, I commented that we\u2019re looking at overall debt, we\u2019re looking at cash commitments in the future, so in my prepared comments I talked about having reduced some sale leasebacks on some rigs, which are not debt, or operating leases, but yet they\u2019re a structure that\u2019s in place that gets in the way of exactly how we own our assets that have a cash cost to us that\u2019s carried out into the future, and it\u2019s a simpler way for us to look at our company without those leases in place at the moment. And we believe we\u2019ve bought them back at relatively attractive prices, from an NPB perspective it makes sense for us to do so. ","And so that\u2019s how we\u2019re going to continue to think about this. We want our balance sheet to be smaller on the leverage side, and we want our overall capital structure to be simpler. And we can do that with the proceeds from asset sales, we can do it with the proceeds that are thrown off from the bus over time, and we\u2019ll continue to do so. But there\u2019s no real sense of urgency in that. We\u2019re not rushing out to create something to make it happen immediately.","Operator","And then one other question. There\u2019s been a lot of talk on efficiencies, but I was wondering if you wouldn\u2019t mind just drilling down a little bit deeper and talking about some of the completion optimization initiatives. Not so much on the pad drilling, but more on the actual well designs. Any sort of reduced frack spacing or anything like that in particular that you\u2019re using across the portfolio that\u2019s really driving better performance, better IRRs and whatnot?","Doug Lawler ","It\u2019s a great question. I think the best way to look at that is that the efficiencies that the industry has captured over the past several years we\u2019re just at the beginning stages of, whether it be the amount of sand pumped, the spacing, the cluster spacing, the fluids, we have so many opportunities to continue to improve and optimize our program. ","And each of those things are under evaluation and review, and I think we\u2019ll continue to see in all of the areas, as we narrow down and begin some of these optimization plans, that frankly we have not been able to do up to this point in time, because we\u2019ve been more focused on how to hold the leases. ","So this is a huge opportunity for us, huge in respect to cost, huge in respect to estimated ultimate recovery, and really it captures almost every single aspect of completion and design that you can think of that is being evaluated and reviewed here. ","But I\u2019ll also note that there isn\u2019t anything out there in the industry that\u2019s taking place that Chesapeake has not tried or participated in, so even though we might be on a single well pad and away from the best acreage, testing new ideas and continuing to look for ways to improve have been part of our program, it\u2019s just the focus now, as we concentrate in these high quality areas, is going to give us a better return. ","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Mike Kelly with Global Hunter Securities. "," ","Michael Kelly - Global Hunter Securities ","I was hoping you could give us a bit of a look under the hood in the current capital allocation process that you\u2019re going through right now. I think it would be helpful just to hear you compare and contrast it to how it\u2019s being approached today versus maybe how it\u2019s been done at Chesapeake in years past. And then just I\u2019d like to gauge if this is a process that you think will ultimately yield some potentially meaningful swings in how you allocate capital or spread capital around across your core basins in 2014.","Doug Lawler ","It\u2019s a great question. The capital allocation process in the past has been primarily directed at how we continue to maintain and hold the lease hold. And while there has been some benefits to that, it has not been the most efficient. And the focus now, with the competitive capital allocation process, is to ensure that all of our dollars are directed at where the best returns are achievable. And that includes a rigorous post-appraisal process. It includes that we will lay rigs down in certain areas if the investment in the wells are not performing as we expected. ","And so it\u2019s a very, very strong difference from capital allocation in the past, and I\u2019ll also note that the capital allocation and competitive funding is not going to be based on additional debt instruments that can be secure, whether it be conventional or creative ideas, to execute our program. And so really it\u2019s going to the fundamentals necessary to drive value and focusing on the high quality assets that we have, and we\u2019re excited about it. We think there\u2019s just a tremendous amount of opportunity.","Michael Kelly - Global Hunter Securities ","One on the Utica here. The bulk of your activity to date has been focused in Carroll County, but you do have a decent amount of acreage further to the southwest portion of the play, where we\u2019ve seen some really strong projections in terms of IRRs from some of your competitors. Just hoping you could maybe give us a sense of what you expect the difference in returns to be in Carroll County versus maybe what you have in the southwest. I think that would be helpful.","Doug Lawler ","We won\u2019t provide that information at this time. As we look forward to providing guidance in 2014, we\u2019ll have some additional asset review that can give you a little more color on that.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Matt Portillo with TPH.","Matt Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, and Holt ","Just a few quick questions for me. I just wanted to confirm, in the prepared remarks, did you mention that LOE would be potentially up on work overs in 2014? And then a second follow up question, just in regards to your longer term LOE initiative, I was curious, from the $0.75\/$0.76 per Mcf that you currently have today, what do you view as kind of leading edge LOE or kind of top tier LOE targets from your peers, with this similar type of production mix?","Doug Lawler ","The point we were trying to make is that the work over expenses and the opportunities there we also see a significant amount of opportunity there with our base volumes. And the point there is that there is a lot of value in it. And so if we were to see a higher LOE, it\u2019s going to be because we\u2019re capturing greater value with a work over program that\u2019s going to yield good results for us. ","And the point there is that as we continue to evaluate our production costs, that\u2019s an important element that we want to capture the greatest amount of value from. What we\u2019re saying, though, is there\u2019s also, in addition to that, significant opportunities. We\u2019ve lowered those costs, and we see opportunities going forward to further reduce those costs. ","And so your question, we\u2019re not trying to signal it\u2019s going to be higher. What we\u2019re signaling is we\u2019re going to capture the greatest value we can. And so then to your second question, the plan going forward, what I consider to be top-quartile type of LOE performance, is going to be in the $2 to $3 per BOE, or kind of in that $0.60 range. ","So that just gives you a little directional guidance where we are targeting to continue to drive our cost down, and I\u2019m very excited about the team that we\u2019ve got in place that\u2019s looking at all of the areas and whether it\u2019s standardization, knowledge sharing, best practices, with respect to all the different operations in the field that will result in driving those costs down.","Matt Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, and Holt ","And then there\u2019s been a big buildup of inventory over time, and I know you guys have done a good job of kind of working that down. I think just kind of skimming through the release, you have about 500 wells left in your backlog. I was hoping that we could maybe get a little more color in terms of where you think that ultimately should move to. What\u2019s an appropriate level of [selling] capital into the ground? I know you guys are trying to reduce that as a bigger strategic initiative.","Doug Lawler ","It\u2019s a very good question. And inventory depends on several things. It will depend on the rig count in the area, on infrastructure in the area, and our plan is to optimize that. I\u2019ll just go back to that comment about making sure that we\u2019re not parking capital in the ground that we\u2019re not getting a return on as quickly as possible. So the inventory levels, particularly as we move to more multi-well pads, there will be a base level of inventory that you would expect, as you\u2019ve seen before, with other operators that have been climbing that efficiency curve. ","So we\u2019ll continue to see an inventory and what is the exact amount? It\u2019s very dependent on the rig count, it\u2019s dependent on takeaway capacity, but what our commitment is that we\u2019re not going to just park capital in the ground for 9 months, 12 months, 15 months, or greater, without being able to get a return on it. So rather than look at what the optimum level of inventory is, I\u2019d focus that what we\u2019re going to do is get the greatest returns from the investments, and not strand that capital in the ground.","Matt Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, and Holt ","And then just my last question, quickly, on the mid-con, you guys you have kind of lumped all of your rigs together. I was hoping that we could get maybe a little bit more clarity in terms of where you may have been decelerating over the last few quarters. And in particular, I just wanted to get an update maybe on your Powder River Basin drilling program.","Doug Lawler ","Mid-con is an area that we still are very interested in, and that we like. We\u2019ve reduced some of our activity there as we\u2019ve been working our geologic models. The maturity of the geologic program and the predictability there needs to improve, and so pulling back a little bit to make sure that we\u2019re operationally doing the things we need to do, the technical and geologic work is focused properly. And I think you\u2019ll continue to see the number of rigs in mid-con will be in a range there as we increase and decrease based on our confidence in that program to continue to deliver. So we\u2019ve had several adjustments there.","And then the Powder River, we still are very encouraged about it. And you\u2019ll also see some fluctuation in the rig activity. The issue there involves infrastructure to a certain extent, and back to that comment about not parking capital in the ground for extended periods of time, and also the post-appraisal and work that needs to be done to improve our cost and make sure that we have a good, predictable play there.","But in both areas, we like the opportunities that we have, and believe that they will be very competitive in our portfolio. ","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from James Sullivan with Alembic Global Advisors.","James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors","Just a quick question I had. I wanted to see if I could get a little bit of quantification around your plans on switching over from single well one offs to pad drilling. I apologize if I missed this, but at this time you guys are still doing mostly single wells one offs at this point, in your main place, right?","Doug Lawler ","It\u2019s improving as we speak. We\u2019re recognizing the multi-well pad efficiencies and cost reductions. I think it\u2019s important to note that multi-well pads in and of itself does not provide the capital decrease. It\u2019s the synergies and the testing and the optimization that takes place that provides those opportunities. So you obviously benefit from multi-well pads because you don\u2019t have the additional pad location, road construction, all those kind of things that are high level hits, but in and of itself, it\u2019s the synergies in our operations and the greater purchasing power of Chesapeake that we\u2019re looking to capture.","James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors ","Do you guys give a kind of target percent range in the various plays, for what you\u2019re hoping to be at in 2014? Let\u2019s say if you were running in a generic play 10 rigs, are you guys thinking you might have five of them by this time next year running on pads? Or are you looking to get 100% in most of the major plays?","Doug Lawler ","We\u2019re targeting to get to 100%, but as you\u2019d expect, though, as you continue to develop a play you\u2019ll still have some outside of a multi-well pad type of grid. And what we\u2019ve been providing guidance on is that in the past couple of years, we\u2019ve been in the 75% range on single well pads, and going forward in 2014 we expect to flip that to be more 75% on the multi-well pads. So it\u2019s a big shift for us, and we\u2019ve targeted in our presentation some significant capital reductions that we anticipate can be up to 30%.","James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors ","And then just last one on this topic, as you guys think about doing this, I know you guys are guiding to a sequential decrease in output next quarter. But I assume you\u2019re sort of phasing in this program through your growth areas in the Eagle Ford and elsewhere, Utica. So I assume that the idea is that you don\u2019t go through the big kind of dry spell and then [pops] all in one quarter, or all in one section of time. The idea would be that you would maybe run through the plays. Is that the sort of concept?","Doug Lawler ","Yes, I think that\u2019s fair.","James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors ","","And then just last thing, do you guys have any updates on the program in the Niobrara? ","Doug Lawler ","No, not really, other than what we\u2019ve highlighted there just previously, that we are encouraged by the area, we see a lot of opportunity in it, and we\u2019ll be matching our capital spend with infrastructure and the best returns that we can get in the portfolio.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our final question from Joe Allman with JPMorgan.","Joe Allman - JPMorgan ","Doug, going back to Arun\u2019s question, you\u2019re expecting organic production growth in 2014. So are you expecting absolute production growth in 2014 over 2013? Or is it possible that you\u2019d actually have production down in 2014 versus \u201913 and still have organic growth?","Doug Lawler ","Well, Joe, I\u2019m just going to push you to when we give the guidance, okay? ","Joe Allman - JPMorgan ","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Because in the third quarter of \u201913, I think production was down 2% over third quarter of \u201912, but you indicated you had organic growth of 8%. So I think those numbers are right.","Doug Lawler ","That\u2019s right. ","Joe Allman - JPMorgan ","Okay. And then the midpoint of your new guidance for oil for 2013, the midpoint implies that your fourth quarter oil will drop by about 9,000 barrels a day. So why would we see that drop?","Doug Lawler ","Well, as we noted there, we had a couple of things. There are a few things that are entered into it. Partially, the acceleration of activity in Eagle Ford in the third quarter. We\u2019re going to be back at a more normal run rate in the fourth quarter. We benefited from an additional month when we sold some of the assets. We got a little bit of an uplift in the third quarter, because of an additional month that we had those before selling them. And then in October, because some of the weather issues that we had with the heavy rains down there in south Texas, that impacted our production a little bit. So that\u2019s the reason why we see that difference.","Joe Allman - JPMorgan ","And then in terms of asset sales, over 2014 you mentioned we might see some asset sales close in the first half of the year. Do you have a target for how much you want to sell, a dollar value or a range? And also, do you have some debt and metric targets that you\u2019re looking at? And on the same topic, in the release you indicated that you want to reduce complexity. Could you talk specifically? What complexity do you want to reduce? ","Doug Lawler ","I touched on that a couple of questions ago as well. When we talk about complexity, we\u2019re talking about things that leave us with future cash obligations or operating restrictions in ways that can affect how we run our bus, and we want to remove as many of those so we have the most freedom in how we run our business day to day if possible. ","In terms of a debt target, I\u2019ve said before that I don\u2019t want to have an absolute debt target. I\u2019ve said recently I don\u2019t want to have an absolute debt target. A couple of years ago, we put out a specific number, which was related to what the company looked like at the time, and the size of our assets at the time. ","And so we\u2019ll continue to think about this in terms of ratios and in terms of targets around those ratios, and what I\u2019ll just continue to say there is we intend to be an investment grade company over time. There\u2019s no one ratio that\u2019s going to lead us to that as a measure across the entire balance sheet, and we\u2019ll continue to target metrics that drive us toward investment grade performance. ","Joe Allman - JPMorgan ","So in terms of the dollar value of asset sales, should we expect at least a couple of billion dollars of asset sales?","Doug Lawler ","That\u2019s just going to be totally driven by our ongoing portfolio analysis and value determinations. We could decide to sell less or more than that, and it will be determined by how we view the assets that we have in the portfolio contributing to the longer term goals of production growth rate and shareholder returns.","Joe Allman - JPMorgan ","And then just lastly, I just want to clarify your cash flow expectations versus capex in 2014. Do you expect your operating cash flow to match or surpass your total capex, including E&D and lease hold and other capex?","Doug Lawler ","We haven\u2019t provided that guidance yet, but just directionally, what we\u2019ve been trying to indicate is that we want to implement and execute with financial discipline that is in that direction.","Joe Allman - JPMorgan ","So capex may still be above, but you\u2019re trying to at least get closer than you\u2019ve been in the past.","Doug Lawler ","Well, we haven\u2019t provided any of that guidance yet, so you\u2019ll get more on that shortly.","Joe Allman - JPMorgan ","What\u2019s the timetable for the new guidance for 2014?","Doug Lawler ","What we\u2019ve said here is that we\u2019ll provide that guidance early in the year. So you can look forward to that time.","With that being the last call, I just want to thank everyone for their time. I do believe we had a very strong quarter. I think it\u2019s a foundational quarter to Chesapeake, and I just want to reiterate that the number of initiatives that are in place in this company are significant. I believe we have a significant opportunity to continue to provide differential performance to the investment community, and I\u2019m excited about the opportunities and the talent that resides in the organization to execute that program. So 2014 is going to be an exciting year for us, and we\u2019ll look forward to sharing more with you about that here in the near future. "],"5131":["Chesapeake Energy Corp.

All participants will be in listen-only mode. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please also note, today's event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Brad Sylvester, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Brad Sylvester - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Thank you, Rocco, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today to discuss Chesapeake's financial and operational results for the 2018 third quarter. Hopefully, you've had a chance to review our press release and the updated investor presentations that we posted to our website this morning.","During this morning's call, we will be making forward-looking statements which consist of statements that cannot be confirmed by reference to existing information, including statements regarding our beliefs, goals, expectations, forecasts, projections, and future performance, the benefits of our proposed transaction with WildHorse Resource Development Corporation, the expected timing for the completion of the transaction, and the assumptions underlying such statements.","Please note that there are a number of factors that will cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements, including the factors identified and discussed in our earnings release today and in other SEC filings. Please recognize that except as required by applicable law, we undertake no duty to update any forward-looking statements, and you should not place undue reliance on such statements.","We may also refer to some non-GAAP financial measures, which help facilitate comparisons across periods and with peers.

Doug will begin the call, and then turn the call over to Frank and Nick for a review of our operational and financial results, before we turn the teleconference over for Q&A.","So, with that, thank you. And I will now turn the teleconference over to Doug.","Robert Douglas Lawler - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Thanks, Brad. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. A little over five years ago, our board of directors, leadership team and employees began a major business transformation of Chesapeake Energy. During this period, we have fundamentally improved all aspects of our business, demonstrating a commitment, passion, and tenacious determination to drive value for our shareholders.","We have decreased our total debt and leverage by more than $12 billion, eliminated legacy commitments and obligations by more than $10 billion, significantly reduced complexity, delivered industry-leading capital efficiency, and eliminated more than $1 billion in annual cash costs, all while preserving a world-class portfolio of unconventional assets in an extremely challenging commodity price environment.","Today is a special day for our company. I'm thrilled to be speaking with you about the significant strategic acquisition of WildHorse Resource Development. We are very excited about the future at Chesapeake and our ability to create tremendous value for our shareholders, and this transaction only further increases our enthusiasm.","We believe there is an incredible upside opportunity in our stock for investors. The compelling investment thesis in this powerful combination is anchored in the significant depth of oil growth opportunities in the portfolio, reduce weighting to natural gas, and improve financial leverage while pricing an attractive multiple of 2019 EBITDA and at a value that is accretive to our NAV.","Further, the WildHorse acquisition strengthens and accelerates delivery of our near-term strategic priorities of margin improvement, sustainable free cash flow and a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 2 times. Chesapeake is uniquely positioned to drive greater value from the WildHorse assets and enhance our ability to profitably grow through our proven unconventional development expertise.","The complementary WildHorse assets build upon our existing Eagle Ford position and with our Powder River Basin position gives us two powerful oil growth engines in our portfolio. We expect to more than double our oil production by the end of 2020, while accordingly increasing our overall oil production mix to 30%. Importantly, with this transaction, we project our EBITDA margin will grow by approximately $6.50 per boe during that period, an improvement of over 50%.","The enhanced margins in oil growth from the WildHorse assets will also have an immediate impact on our financials and balance sheet. Assuming current strip prices, we expect the incremental EBITDA created by this transaction alone will improve our debt to EBITDA ratio, accelerating our de-leveraging efforts by approximately 40% over the next two years.","Today, WildHorse has one of the premier Eagle Ford positions, spreading across approximately 420,000 acres in the play, 80% to 85% of which are undeveloped. This acreage has enviable access to premium Gulf Coast pricing. While the long runway and future development opportunities attracted us to the assets, we are also very pleased with the alignment of our strategic priority of increasing our competitiveness by improving our margins as WildHorse's EBITDA per barrel of oil equivalent is one of the highest of any independent E&P operator in the United States.","Additionally, we believe there are numerous opportunities to build upon WildHorse's impressive performance and further enhance the return profile of the asset. Chesapeake is a leading operator in the Eagle Ford and our capital efficiency in the basin is demonstrated by our ability to consistently drill and complete the longest laterals at the lowest cost per foot in the basin is second to none. Our proven operational track record and geotechnical expertise provide great confidence that we will deliver material savings across all aspects of the operation.","Specifically, we anticipate achieving an average of $200 million to $280 million in annual savings over the first five years to be realized through our capital efficient drilling and completion operations in the field as well as improved downtime lease operating expenses and the elimination of redundant corporate overhead. The savings are expected to be driven not only by the sheer scale of our operations but also by our ability to provide technical expertise through our Operations Support and Reservoir Technology Centers, the impact of longer laterals and enhanced completions, and our logistic capabilities, which will eliminate additional oil field service and supply chain costs.","Further, we expect to create additional value through our existing oil transportation options, demonstrating the truly complementary fit with our legacy Eagle Ford position. We will look to further optimize this asset into our current transportation portfolio, which provides access to premium MEH and LLS pricing in both Houston and Corpus Christi, additional flow assurance synergies within a company of our scale.","We'll provide a full update on our 2019 plans upon the closing of this transaction, but expect that over 80% of our drilling and completion activity will be focused on our high-margin oil assets in the Eagle Ford and PRB, while we continue to generate free cash flow from our Marcellus and Haynesville positions.","I will now pass the call to Frank to update us on our operations.","Frank J. Patterson - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Thanks, Doug. Good morning, everyone. As we get started this morning, I would like to commend the WildHorse team for putting together an incredible acreage position in the Eagle Ford. They've also done a really solid job delineating the play and building a strong production foundation. We're really excited to turn our subsurface and operations team loose on over 400,000 acres of a play that's just now entering the development stage. We're not starting with a blank slate on the subsurface side. We already have a really strong understanding of the [indiscernible] elements and petrophysical model as a result of a lot of regional work that we've been doing.","Also, a majority of the acreage is covered with 3D, and right now WildHorse is actually reprocessing that 3D to get a better product. We have gathered available fluids analysis and the core data from the public domain and from data room. All this has been combined with the existing well performance and we have a working model that ties very, very well with historical productivity of the wells. We will augment this analysis on the fly with additional core pressure testing and fluid data as development wells are drilled, allowing for very quick transition to a full field development plan.","With our in-house capabilities, the learning curve will be pretty quick. As we take everything learned from our Eagle Ford and South Texas, as well as the other basins, we'll hit the ground running. We will focus on moving towards longer laterals, reducing drilling and completion costs, and optimizing spacing to drive for the greatest value out of this contiguous acreage position. We also see potential in the Austin Chalk on the acreage footprint and look forward to additional appraisal opportunities. This gives us a third oil engine in our portfolio and a second one with direct access to premium markets in the Gulf Coast.","Now, a quick update on our current program. We're running five rigs in the Powder River Basin. To-date, our focus has been on appraising and drilling and spacing tests in the Turner. We have now delineated about 60% of our prospective Turner acreage and are rapidly entering into the development stage. Production has increased 107% since the third quarter of 2017 and 32% sequentially.","Looking forward, we anticipate net production to reach an exit rate of approximately 38,000 barrels a day in 2018 and then double again in 2019. Our 1,980-foot spacing tests have shown no degradation after 190 days online. We'll continue to monitor the production and pressure of these wells as well as other Turner completions with the objective to make a decision on final field spacing in the coming months.","In our step-out program, we've proven the northern and western portion of our acreage with three wells having 24-hour flow rates of between 1,480 barrels of oil per day and 2,725 barrels of oil per day. And more importantly, these wells averaged 82% oil cut, confirming our geologic model.","We're currently evaluating adding a sixth rig, likely targeting the Parkman and Niobrara in 2019. With our strong oil growth, we are focusing on more efficient facilities on common production facilities and gas plant expansion. In Nick's section, he'll discuss a new oil transportation agreement, which will allow us to continue to unlock the value of the stacked acreage position.","In the Eagle Ford, recent flooding slowed our logistics in September and October. But in spite of this, we anticipate the asset to deliver approximately $560 million of free cash flow in 2018. I'm extremely proud of the work done by the operations, drilling and completion teams to adapt and maintain strong execution in spite of the challenging condition.","Our Marcellus Shale continues to drive free cash flow and we continue to see strong performance from our extended laterals and the larger completion designs. In the Haynesville, well, performance continues to improve and we see completion costs dropping. But we currently plan to reduce our rig count moving forward in 2019 as we focus our capital spend on higher margin opportunities. We're making progress in every asset in our portfolio, and our teams continue to drive for value every day. As a result, Chesapeake continues to grow stronger and more competitive.","With that, I'm going to turn it over to Nick.","Domenic J. Dell'Osso","Thank you, Frank, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased with our third quarter results and continue to make progress on our strategic priorities of reducing our leverage, improving our margins, and reaching sustainable cash flow. With today's announcement regarding our planned acquisition of WildHorse, we believe these priorities will be accelerated.","Given Doug and Frank's comments on the acquisition, I will focus on our Q3 results. In September, we amended and restated our revolving credit facility extending the maturity date from December 2019 to September of 2023. In addition, we issued $1.25 billion of unsecured bonds through both a 2024 and 2026 tranche and use the proceeds to refinance our 1.5 lien term loan.","Yesterday afternoon, we closed our previously-announced Utica sale transaction and have called the remaining outstanding second lien notes. The refinancing of the term loan and the redemption of our second lien notes will save the company approximately $150 million annually based on current interest rates.","With the Utica sale closed, we believe our debt maturity profile will look significantly better as we exit 2018 versus when we started the year. At the beginning of 2018, we had over $4 billion of maturities due through 2023. By the end of the year, we expect to have reduced that number to a little over $2 billion, well within the company's expected liquidity profile. However, we will look for opportunities to retire that maturing debt through cash flow generation, targeted asset sales, as well as potentially refinance the longer-dated maturities when market conditions are constructive to do so.","During the third quarter, we were very active in hedging 2019 gas and currently we have downside protection on over 60% of our forecasted 2019 gas production at $2.81 per mcf. Additionally, our current 2019 oil hedges average just over $59 a barrel and we also started to hedge a modest portion of 2020 oil with swaps over $69 a barrel.","We've also added certainty to our Gulf Coast oil basis exposure in 2019 and are now hedged over a third of our Gulf Coast oil at a premium to WTI of over $6 per barrel. We are beginning to see significant improvement in our average realized Marcellus basis, as demonstrated by the $0.50 increase compared to the third quarter of last year. With Atlantic Sunrise now in service and basis tightening in Northeast Pennsylvania, we believe that in-basin pricing for our Marcellus gas will continue to improve over the next several quarters.","We have further strengthened our realized pricing for a portion of our Marcellus volumes by recently entering into a long-term supply agreement with a third party LNG provider. We expect these types of structured physical gas purchase contracts to become more prevalent both for Chesapeake and the industry, resulting and driving long-term demand higher as the demand for secure access to natural gas by global consumers increasingly focuses on the U.S. export markets.","Finally in the PRB, we are close to finalizing a crude oil gathering agreement which will take our crude oil volumes via pipeline to the Guernsey market beginning in the 2019 second quarter at a cost that's approximately half what we've been paying for in-basin sales via trucking or one-third of the current market rate for truck transport to Guernsey. We are also evaluating long-haul transportation options to take volumes further to Cushing, Oklahoma.","As Doug stated, we look toward 2019, we believe that the vast majority of our CapEx will be focused on higher margin and higher return oil assets in the PRB and Eagle Ford, and now including our planned acquisition of the WildHorse assets with a smaller amount of activity and capital to be directed to gas.","To close, we remain highly focused on executing on our priorities of reducing leverage, increasing our margins and achieving sustainable positive cash flow. We believe the announcement of our planned acquisition of WildHorse will position the company for improved future shareholder returns.","First, it creates an immediate positive benefit to our portfolio by adding tremendous oil assets both currently producing and to develop with our technically advantaged approach and cost structure for many years at an attractive discount to peers as Doug and Frank have stated.","In addition, the transaction obviously provides a significant equitization of our balance sheet. WildHorse's debt to EBITDA is obviously relatively low. Therefore, the combined company has a much improved ratio relative to Chesapeake stand-alone. As these assets grow with such a high margin profile, we project significantly improved free cash flow over time from our portfolio.","We always said we'd be judicious with our equity and would only think about using it for the right opportunity. We believe adding an asset with this much strategic value is that opportunity, and we look forward to creating significant additional value for our shareholders from this transaction for years to come.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Today's first question comes from Neal Dingmann of SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Good morning, guys. Congrats on the deal. Looks great, Doug. Doug, I was looking at slide \u2013 for you or Nick, slide 6 on the prepared slides, and my question around there, just kind of looking at how you expected the company to delever as well as the oil mix, is that based on \u2013 I know right now Frank mentioned going from five to six rigs in the PRB and I think you and WildHorse each have four running in the Eagle Ford. Could you just maybe talk around some of the call \u2013 I know you don't have full 2019 details out yet, but maybe just higher level expectations in the two bigger plays of what you might be running?","Robert Douglas Lawler - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Yeah. Sure, Neal. Thank you for the question. And I'm going to ask Frank to give the detail around that rig allocation.","Frank J. Patterson - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Yeah. Neal, this is Frank. So right now, we are running a solid five-rig program as of July in the Powder. And I think that those rigs will stay focused on the Turner, I think that will be our plan going forward. What we don't want to do is disrupt the delivery of that Powder program. So, the idea would be to bring in a sixth rig to test additional zones so we can continue to expand the opportunity set in the Powder.","With regard to the WildHorse asset, I believe they've been running a five-rig program, they may be down to a four-rig program today. We see the opportunity there to potentially create a little bit stronger fleet with a little bit bigger rigs going in there and maintaining a five-rig program. We don't know after we start to apply some of the techniques and operational expertise we have how much we could actually get out of that five-rig program. So, I don't know that we would expand that program. Initially, we will be taking, as I said, some core and a lot of information \u2013 gathering a bunch of information as we drill wells moving into that program. But that's kind of the plan going forward. We still have a couple of rigs running in MidCon which \u2013 there's a growth rig and in the Oswego rig and in the Marcellus we have a couple of rigs, probably we'll move to a third rig in the Marcellus next year. Haynesville, we will be dropping back potentially to one to two rigs.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And then just lastly...","Jason M. Pigott - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","This is Jason.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Go ahead. I'm sorry.","Jason M. Pigott - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","I just want to expand on that one. One of the fun things for us is we had a great quarter in Eagle Ford. We drilled almost 10,000 feet per well at 9.5 days versus WildHorse's 15 to 17 days for a 6,500-foot well. So, we're drilling nearly twice as fast and more footage. I mean, that's one of the things we think about what the rig count is. We can get a lot more wells drilled with fewer rigs in the current operations, which is one of the \u2013 some of the synergies that we see from Chesapeake bringing our horsepower ops center, a lot of our technology to this play.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Great add Jason. And then, one maybe follow-on to that, Jason, for you or Doug, when you initially looked at these assets, I'm looking here particularly at slide 5 and then \u2013 or slide 8 or both. There's a large component here that's undeveloped. And I'm just wondering, is it because of, Jason, what you just walked through which you all think about maybe that undeveloped piece or is it because of looking at slide 8, because of the synergies of the takeaway or is it a combination? I'm just wondering, Doug, really if there's any sort of one or two things that stuck out with this area of what really got you focused on here initially?","Robert Douglas Lawler - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Thanks for the question, Neal. Yeah. It's really all of those things. This acquisition hits all major strategic objectives of Chesapeake. And when you look at a large contiguous acreage position such as the WildHorse asset offers, that is just begging for the Chesapeake weapons to be deployed on it. And we are excited about what we can do with it on the drilling and completion side, the cost synergies that we can capture. Our experience and expertise, as I noted, we drilled \u2013 or noted in the presentation, we drilled and completed more than 2,000 wells in there. So, it's having 80% to 85% undeveloped. It just gives us a tremendous runway while complementing and adding and accelerating to all of our strategic objectives that I noted.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","I agree. Thanks. Makes all the sense, guys. Thanks so much.","Operator","And our next question today comes from David Heikkinen of Heikkinen Energy Advisors. Please go ahead.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Good morning, guys. And thanks for taking my question. First on the acquisition. I'm not as familiar with WildHorse but became more familiar this morning. When we pulled the well results, there seemed to be a decline in kind of well quality recently and just curious if that was some step-out drilling or if there is anything that you guys identified through the work you guys did as far as the distribution of well quality or any concentrations on their assets or their acreage that we should think about as you kind of step forward?","Frank J. Patterson - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Yeah. Heik, this is Frank. Really appreciate that question. Yeah, we recognized the same thing. I think what you're seeing is a degradation due to too tight a well spacing. As we work through this analysis, we got a lot of the existing PVT analysis, have gone back through and remapped the poor volume and tied it all together and created a model that really ties really well with the historical well performance. It's one of the reasons we're not coming out and saying, there is X number of wells on this acreage. This acreage is 80% to 85% undeveloped within the Eagle Ford.","What is the proper spacing? I think it's going to be just like our South Texas acreage, in that, in portions of the acreage, the spacing may be necessary to be 1,000 feet or potentially greater. In some parts of this acreage, the spacing may be a little bit tighter pushing to 750 or 500 point. There are wells within the current delineation plan that are much tighter than 500 feet. And I think you're seeing that response when you look at the wells. So, we will spend a lot of time and effort and properly space this, lengthen the wells out, put the appropriate completions on it. And I think we'll drive a maximum value out of this acreage position.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","That's definitely helpful and explains things. On the Powder, I didn't quite catch the numbers. What is your gathering agreement change, your dollar per boe costs in the second quarter of 2019, Nick?","Domenic J. Dell\u2019Osso - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Yeah. So we will move to an oil gathering line, rather than trucking. And so it'll be less than half of what we're paying today to have barrels trucked than currently we're selling in basin. So we're going to pipe those barrels all the way up to Guernsey which is a premium market to what we would get in-basin today by a couple of dimes and then \u2013 a few dimes. And then, we will do that again for a significantly less cost than the trucking, less than half. So our netbacks here should improve pretty significantly.","The agreement isn't finalized yet Dave. And so, I don't have a precise dollar per barrel to give you, but we know it is a more than half improvement.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","What's trucking costing maybe as a starting point, on a dollar per barrel basis?","Domenic J. Dell\u2019Osso - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Yeah. So today we're in the neighborhood of $2, sometimes a little bit more dollars a barrel.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Domenic J. Dell\u2019Osso - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","And so, this is going to be well under half.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","That's helpful. Thank you.","Domenic J. Dell\u2019Osso - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Thanks.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Doug Leggate of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Can you hear me okay?","Robert Douglas Lawler - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","We can.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah. Good stuff. Guys, I'm just curious what the transaction does to the balance of the portfolio. Does this change in any way your view of what's core and noncore across the rest of the asset base? And if so, how would you think about potential monetization opportunities?","Robert Douglas Lawler - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Yeah. Thanks, Doug. Frank would be excited to comment on that as well. When we look at the portfolio, the oil growth engines between the Powder and the WildHorse asset are very, very strong for us. Interestingly, the competitive economics, and as we look at capital allocation, the Marcellus attracts capital to the limit of the infrastructure available in the basin. It's just a phenomenal play. It's a very strong cash flow generating asset for the company.","As is the Eagle Ford, as you're aware, our existing asset, the Eagle Ford, we know that this asset has just such strong growth potential that it will be very competitive in our portfolio. But we also want to note that the strength of the other assets it's not \u2013 that this is just a single asset that comes into the portfolio and commands or attracts capital from the rest of the portfolio.","What we have been very proud of, Doug, and very encouraged by is through the past five years despite all this challenging environment that we've had with our legacy issues and the commodity price environment is that this is a world-class portfolio of unconventional assets. And it gives us tremendous flexibility in how we allocate our capital, tremendous learning, and shared resources across the assets for us to drive greater value. So that's been reflected in our operating costs, our capital efficiency, and it will continue to be reflected in our capital allocation as to where we direct that capital to capture the greatest value. Do you want to add anything, Frank?","Frank J. Patterson - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","No, that was good. Thanks.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So just to be clear, we should consider that the combined portfolio is a pretty stable model going forward?","Robert Douglas Lawler - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","That's absolutely right. And keep in mind, as we've highlighted, we will continue to look at all opportunities, all levers to capture greater value from that portfolio and continue to improve our business. So, keep in mind that business development is one of the planks of our strategy and we will continue to evaluate and look for opportunities to further enhance value for our shareholders. And so, the divestiture of the Utica successfully completing that yesterday, having two powerful oil growth engines and the strengths of the gas portfolio gives us tremendous optionality to capture value going forward.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Terrific. At the risk of upsetting Brad, I wonder if I could just have two quick follow ups. One, Frank, just very quickly. Last time we spoke about the Powder River, obviously you touched on the de-risking today. But can you give us some idea as to how you see the drilling backlog at this point relative to what you've previously suggested? Are we still in the de-risking phase or has the industry managed to help you along in your understanding of that?","And my final one is just very quickly on the synergies. Can you just give a high level as to how deep you've gone in establishing the synergies on the deal or is that still \u2013 is it still early days? Should we expect those numbers to go up? And I'll leave it there. Thanks.","Frank J. Patterson - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Yeah. I'll handle the Powder question and pass it over to Nick for the synergies. On the Powder side, as I said, we're probably 60% delineated in the Turner. We still have some room to expand that footprint and we'll be working through expanding that footprint across our entire acreage position next year. So, we are going to move into the development phase, which will basically start pad drilling in the Turner. We're already starting that process. The real question we have to answer is what is the absolute spacing that we want to land on. As we've talked before, Doug, the industry is kind of landed on four wells per section. We're more in the range of three wells per section and we haven't made that decision to move to that. Our current assessment is two wells per section.","What the industry has helped us do is there's more activity and more information coming out on the Niobrara and the Mowry, and those are things that we still have to derisk. We have a lot of Nio wells that we have in our portfolio or actual wells that we've already drilled. We've done spacing test there, we know what the spacing needs to be on that. The question is, can we commercially make that work with the larger fracs, and we think we can and that's where we're going to move next year. The Mowry is something that is \u2013 I would like to get unlock in the next couple of years because it \u2013 between the Nio and the Mowry they cover our entire acreage footprint and that would be a huge boost to us. Then we could go in and develop pads with Mowry, Nio, and Turner on top of each other and really, really drive some efficiency.","With that, Nick, do you want to talk synergies?","Domenic J. Dell\u2019Osso - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Yeah. So, Doug, the synergies in this transaction are tremendous for us, and look, synergies are \u2013 we understand that synergies are often hard for investors to give value to upfront. But in this case we believe the synergies here are very well justified. Think about what comprises them. We broke out in the slides that we posted today essentially income statement synergies versus capital synergies. The income statement synergies, there'll be a significant savings from G&A. We will obviously not have any corporate redundancies, and so there's a lot of savings from that alone.","In addition to that, we'll be able to do some things with LOE, managing downtime in the assets, things that \u2013 best practices that we have delivered within our own assets and know the improvements available and know what's there. We've done our diligence and feel very comfortable with that.","On the capital side, Frank and Doug have already touched on this. Our drilling and completion costs are just materially lower given the scale of operations that we have, the success that we've had with 10,000-foot laterals and the ability to deliver wells at approximately half the drilling and completion costs on a per foot basis. And so, these synergies to us are very real. And there's more to be had. Those are things that we know we can deliver today. They're sort of right in front of us to touch and feel.","An element of synergies that are additional, that are not included in that number that we're pretty excited about is marketing. When we think about the WildHorse asset and we think about the transportation portfolio that we have access to coming out of our legacy Eagle Ford position, we have significant access to both the ECHO terminal in Houston, which gives you access to the entire Houston and then worldwide market as well as the Corpus Christi terminal. We have excess capacity across those two pipes today that we currently pay for. And so with a little bit of further work with our midstream partners, we believe we can gain access to a balanced market of Gulf Coast pricing \u2013 premium Gulf Coast pricing and do so for very little incremental cost to Chesapeake to deliver these barrels given that we pay a reservation charge for that capacity today. It's available to us, and we can flow these barrels directly into it and get that premium pricing.","So, we're really excited about what that means. WildHorse has done a very good job in preparing to build an oil gathering system in the field and they have begun that project. So, that's under way and will be a great thing for us to pick up and continue to deliver on. And there's just a ton here to do. So, these are the things that we've identified pre-closing, and we know that with our track record of producing costs and delivering better performance out of our assets, there's considerably more to do here.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Guys, appreciate all the answers. And congrats, Doug, on getting the deal done.","Robert Douglas Lawler - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Thanks, Doug.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Bob Brackett of Bernstein Research. Please go ahead.","Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey. Good morning. I had a question on how to think about the inventory for WildHorse. Are you thinking about the black oil window working? Is it the volatile oil window? Is it the wet gas window? Or is it some combination?","Frank J. Patterson - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","This is Frank. All the above. All the above at the appropriate spacing for the fluid type that you're working with. So, we see multiple type curve areas if you want to talk about it in that context, and we ascribe value to every single type curve area, but we ascribe it at different spacing and potentially different lateral lengths and completion designs. That'll all evolve as we get more data, but we have a pretty good model right now with, like I said, a really strong history match which we're really pleased with.","Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","And if I think about the capital efficiencies, if the annual number is $150 million to $200 million and WildHorse's CapEx run rate is around $1 billion a year, should I think of that in terms of you see 15% to 20% per well savings?","Frank J. Patterson - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Yeah. That's reasonable. And again, it's going to be pieces here and there that will aggregate into a larger whole.","Robert Douglas Lawler - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","And, Bob, if you take a look at that slide on \u2013 in our deck, page 10, it really highlights for you the operating performance of what we have been delivering in our Eagle Ford asset. And from that, you can see that basically cutting the D&C cost by half is something that we anticipate in delivering those savings and that capital efficiency. And as we noted previously, the time in which we execute the operation is of great value to and that's levered by the strength of our operating center and Reservoir Technology Center, just the shared learnings across the portfolio. So I would hesitate to put any sort of limit whatsoever on what the efficiencies that we can capture based on our scale and experience and expertise.","Frank J. Patterson - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Bob, to be fair \u2013 this is Frank again \u2013 the WildHorse acreage requires potentially an additional casing string. We're going to work through that. So they're drilling different styled wells in South Texas, but we still see huge savings, primarily through our Operations Support Center and being able to keep wells in zone, mitigate the need to sidetrack and basically stay on bottom longer and more effectively as we drill these wells.","Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","And arguably they were still in sort of an exploration or delineation mode and this would eventually get taken to a sort of a factory mode?","Frank J. Patterson - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","That's correct. They were drilling wells in a step-out sense. So that is always more challenging than when you go into development. And that's we've \u2013 we've shown that across our portfolio as well. Once you go into development and we get some confidence in what we're doing, we can really drive some costs down.","Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thanks.","Jason M. Pigott - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","There's other opportunities (37:35) on the completion side. It's Jason. So, for example, they complete about six stages per day and we averaged eight and a half stages per day in the Eagle Ford last quarter. So, when you're getting more stages done per day, those pumping charges go down. So those are some things that we can also bring to the table with just efficiency not only on drilling, but our completion operations as well.","Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Right. Appreciate it.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Arun Jayaram of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning. Frank, I was wondering if you could maybe give us a sense of any thoughts that you have on what could be the core in terms of an acreage footprint. Obviously, they have a big acreage footprint here but any thoughts on how big the core is? And perhaps geologically, what are some of the bigger risks that you see in terms of the deal?","Frank J. Patterson - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Yeah. Arun, it's really hard to describe the core. They've done a good job delineating quite a big area. So, there will be areas from a core perspective commercially just because of fluid type and rock quality. But as we look at this, what we know today, the rock quality looks pretty reasonable across the area. It's a very reasonable drilling depth. The piece that is not completely factored in and it's an opportunity, and as you might want to think of as a risk is the structure as far as faulting and things like that. But we have a pretty good handle on that. Today, we'll have a much better handle on that and what it does to drilling longer laterals once we get the reprocessed 3D. But as we look at this, we don't see this as a risky position and we don't see this as something that we're going to not have a significant amount of the acreage available to drill.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Nick, the Eagle Ford was generating a significant amount of free cash flow for you guys in 2018. When you put the two Eagle Ford assets together, do you \u2013 maybe you could talk about some of the free cash flow characteristics you see for this asset? And one of the points you guys have made is accelerating the point to getting the free cash flow. So, just wondering if you can maybe provide some color on that versus the stand-alone Chesapeake basis.","Domenic J. Dell\u2019Osso - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Absolutely, Arun. So when you think about our portfolio here, we have a very large established base of production in the Eagle Ford, and that's what puts us in a place to have that asset be free cash flow positive. You think about our Powder River asset, if you think about this asset, they're a little bit more similar to each other in terms of where they are from a free cash flow maturity perspective.","So when you think about what we're doing in the Powder this year that we've talked about, which is that in the Powder, we will double production again in 2019 over 2018 and then likely again double in 2020 over 2019, you have a cash flow profile that at a five rig count becomes free cash flow positive during the year of 2019 and then on an annual basis from there on.","The WildHorse asset is in a relatively similar position, the way we'll run this asset, if we continue with five rigs which would be our current plan right now and push our cost synergies into it, it becomes free cash flow positive at the asset level pretty quickly. And then, it's going to continue to grow on a similar ramp to what we see in the Powder. With that level of investment activity, the production profile which is going to be vastly oil and very, very high margin oil will grow very rapidly and so the cash flow from that grows just as rapidly as your production, and you see the free cash flow profile of it expand quickly. And so, what that does for Chesapeake is, as we've been aiming for 2019 to be a year where we were restoring the cash flow loss from the Utica, this really accelerates that position dramatically and puts us in a place where we will have excess free cash flow much sooner as a result.","So, we'll have our full guidance and rolled-up assumptions out to the market ahead or around the time of closing, depending on the timing of how everything comes together here and be able to give you more clarity on that. But with the margin profile, the growth profile, and the capital efficiency profile of this asset, it is absolutely one that delivers higher opportunities for return of cash to our shareholders and deployment of cash in the most optimal way for our shareholders. And that is a significant driver of our desire to do this deal.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. My final question Doug, NGP, a very sophisticated player in private equity is obviously supporting this transaction. Any perspective that you have and any thoughts on that?","Robert Douglas Lawler - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Absolutely. I'm thrilled to have NGP as a major shareholder and I believe that they are extremely excited to partner with us and invest in Chesapeake. We are excited about the things that we'll do together to drive value to NGP and all of our other shareholders. And I think that that's demonstrated by their large percentage in the stock and what they will continue to hold. Having representation of the WildHorse shareholders on our board speaks further to that confidence. And we're looking forward to driving pretty significant value to NGP and all the shareholders.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks a lot.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Kashy Harrison of Simmons Energy. Please go ahead.","Kashy Harrison - Simmons & Company","Hi. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for taking my questions and congratulations on the transaction.","Robert Douglas Lawler - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Thank you.","Kashy Harrison - Simmons & Company","So just two quick ones from me and really just building on the prior question. So, Nick, can you talk about the timeline of free cash flow neutrality for the combined entity? Do you think it's more of a 2020 event, more of a 2021 event? Just trying to get some high-level thoughts on when you think the combined entity could be free cash flow neutral.","Domenic J. Dell\u2019Osso - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Yeah. It certainly looks more like a 2020 event, Kashy. We've been stating all along that 2019 was going to be a year where we were restoring the Utica cash flows and doing so with very high-return projects that are putting us in a position for great returns to shareholders. But that cash-on-cash return, again, the confidence in the delivery of that growth with this investment profile of this asset and the way that we're shifting some capital away from gas to an asset like this. So, the timeline is pretty similar but our confidence in it and the magnitude of cash flow that we will generate when we get there grows dramatically with this transaction.","Kashy Harrison - Simmons & Company","Got you. And then, maybe, a question for Frank and just touching on the synergies again. So, in terms \u2013 kind of like what you guys were saying, the market is, when it comes to synergies, it's seeing is believing. And so, when do you think we'll start to see the impact from those capital synergies? Is that something second half of 2019 the moment you get that asset, we'll start to see you transition to longer laterals and whatnot or is it something where maybe it starts to manifest in 2020, more so on the capital side then on the corporate side?","Frank J. Patterson - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","I'd like to tag team that a little bit with Jason and let him talk about the drilling and completion transition here. But I think from my perspective, we're going to start seeing the synergies play out right up front. We'll start making changes as soon as we can and as soon as the changes make sense. You'll see those changes, I think, first on the drilling and completion side. So, I'll let Jason kind of talk about where we would go.","Jason M. Pigott - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Yeah. I mean, those for us \u2013 what's great about Chesapeake is it's not just learning from the Eagle Ford. We have drilling challenges in Powder River for example that we deal with on a daily basis. So a real advantage for us is pulling all that together, but longer laterals definitely drive the efficiency. So the land department will be critical in just putting those units together and allow us to drill the longer laterals. So we should, by the third quarter, start to see that and well into 2020 which should be fully up and running. So expect to drive those synergies very quickly into the operations, some on the completion front.","We moved frac crews from Eagle Ford to Haynesville and immediately saw gains in performance there. So, those are some things that we look on the completion side and drilling side, which we see right away. And we have an Operations Support Center that monitors all of our drilling 24\/7. So there's an immediate benefit from being able to monitor our wells live. We also have a data analytics team that is tied into that Operations Support Center that could help us spot problems before they occur. So, those things should really happen fairly quickly.","We've also seen a lot of improvements just \u2013 not necessarily in the WildHorse, but across the company with sand sourcing. And there's $100 million in cost reductions we expect to see the next year just by supplying our own sand or going to regional sand in these areas. So, lots of gains across the company coming forward in 2019.","Kashy Harrison - Simmons & Company","Got it. And actually, if I could just sneak one more in. And this one's more so for Doug. When you think about the \u2013 you've added another leg to the stool in the Northeast Eagle Ford. And so do you see yourself as a consolidator in that area to build up on? I know there's some holes within Burleson County on the WildHorse disposition, and there's some nearby operators both on the eastern side, on the western side. So, how do you think about it in terms of just consolidating that? Is that something you'd be interested in the Northeast Eagle Ford area?","Robert Douglas Lawler - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Sure, it's a great question. And absolutely, in and around any of our assets, we look for opportunities where we can bolster our position, bolt-on type of opportunities or synergies that can be captured from our scale. So, keep in mind that that goes back to really a broader question around portfolio management and how we continue to develop and drive the greatest value from our portfolio. And that comes from an active business development program, which means that we will actively use our experience and expertise to drive the greatest value from the assets that we have.","And we will look at additional opportunities in and around our assets of how we can drive greater synergies and create more value. So, you can absolutely expect going forward that business development will be a part of our business strategy. And today, we've got a big challenge in integrating this asset and we're excited about it and think that we're uniquely positioned to do it with WildHorse. And as we integrate that asset and put the Chesapeake machine at work, we will always be looking for other opportunities to drive further value.","Kashy Harrison - Simmons & Company","All right. That's it for me. Thanks for the time, guys, and congratulations again.","Robert Douglas Lawler - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Yeah. Thanks a lot.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Dan McSpirit of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Daniel Eugene McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you, folks. Good morning. Curiously, at the time of second quarter earnings, WRD removed their single Eagle Ford type curve from the corporate presentation. I guess two questions on that observation. One, will the company bring back the type curve to help guide investors on the resource potential of what was acquired? And then two, will the company provide more than one curve, more than one type curve as WRD intended to do in early 2019?","Frank J. Patterson - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Okay. This is Frank. What I believe happened was as data became available, it could not be defined by a single type curve. As you move across the field from basically north to south in general, you go from a black oil to a volatile oil to a much more volatile oil in the south. So, I think you will see us look at it in a very similar sense. We've already got it broken up into multiple type curves. So, what that means is; one, the well performance will change slightly especially on the GLR side but also the spacing and completion design as we've discussed will change across the field as well.","So it's not one type of a reservoir. It is a reservoir that changes across the play. This is no different than the Eagle Ford in our producing area. We have the same type of philosophy in our producing area. We have black oil, we have volatile oil, and we have basically gas condensate in portions of the field. And we manage those quite differently on the drilling and completion side. So I think you'll see us handle this asset in the same way.","Daniel Eugene McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Got it. Thank you. And as a follow-up to that, how did the first year new well decline rates on what was acquired compared to the legacy Eagle Ford and PRB?","Frank J. Patterson - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","So, the legacy Eagle Ford wells decline rates have actually improved by going to the appropriate spacing. So, we're seeing that change over time. In the PRB, we're early there but those wells are actually in a reservoir that is actually a silty sand. And those decline curves are flatter than you see in a shale play.","What I think you're going to see in the WildHorse asset \u2013 and we don't have all the information today because we're still working with the information that's being provided to us. But you're going to see across the play, if you drill too tight a spacing, you're going to see too high of a decline rate. If you drill the appropriate space, I think you're going to see a very reasonable decline, probably pretty similar to what you're seeing in South Texas. It also depends on the completion style.","So all of that is \u2013 there's not one size fits all is the bottom line. It all changes. And we're used to doing work in fields like this. So, we're very comfortable with what we're seeing. It is not behaving abnormal to what we would expect.","Daniel Eugene McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Understood. And then, just one last one here. Will the company complete WRD's in-field sand project \u2013 and forgive me if you discussed that already \u2013 and are potential well cost reductions included in the synergy savings that you estimate?","Jason M. Pigott - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Yeah. The sand is something that we'll continue to evaluate. I mean, it's not necessarily our core business, but we can also \u2013 we can either use it or get regional sand at the same \u2013 at similar price. So that isn't necessarily a synergy that's included in this operation. We can get those across the board. But again, expect to see operational synergies fairly quickly. We can modify completion designs, which actually can reduce sand and increase \u2013 cut our cost and not degrade well performance. So those are things that we do differently in the Eagle Ford versus the WildHorse. So, all those type of things can be taken advantage of fairly quickly.","Robert Douglas Lawler - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","And I'll just add on top of that, the sand mine is \u2013 it's an excellent asset to have. And so, completing it out and being operational gives us a lot of flexibility. So we're looking to capture value and create synergies across the portfolio and the sand mine will be fully utilized and optimized to capture that value.","Daniel Eugene McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Understood. Got it. And just one last one here. The cost on the additional casing string that you mentioned earlier, where does that add to the well?","Frank J. Patterson - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","I don't have that number in front of me. It's just a matter of \u2013 in portions of this field, the old Giddings Austin Chalk field overlies a portion of the acreage. In that area, you have to basically run a string, a line running across the Austin Chalk to allow you to drill into the higher pressure Eagle Ford. That is not necessarily the case across the entire field and we'll work through that. And what we'll do is we'll just minimize the time it takes. The actual liner is not that expensive. It's just the time to drill the well, pull out, clean up and then run the liner and then you go back to drilling.","Daniel Eugene McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Understood. And thanks again \u2013 go ahead.","Jason M. Pigott - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Yeah. I'd just say the time is really important to that when you consider rig costs, spread rates I mentioned earlier. I mean we're drilling wells nearly twice as long for about five days faster. So, those incremental costs shouldn't be that huge to us. The gap is huge between there, again, $1,200 a foot and ours $600 per foot a lateral. So, I mean, there's lots of opportunity for us to improve fairly quickly in this deal.","Daniel Eugene McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Very good. Thanks again for the answers and for all the color. And good luck. Thank you.","Robert Douglas Lawler - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Thank you.","Frank J. Patterson - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Thanks.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Doug Lawler for any closing remarks.","Robert Douglas Lawler - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Yeah. Thank you. Just in closing, we're very excited about the acquisition of these premier assets. And I'd like to congratulate the shareholders and Jay Graham and the WildHorse leadership team for building an outstanding asset. We're really excited to go to work on it. This transaction accelerates our progress towards achieving our strategic and financial goals. It makes Chesapeake more competitive across all metrics and positions the company to deliver significant value to our combined shareholders for years to come. I could not be more encouraged or excited about the opportunity that presents itself for Chesapeake's future.","Thank you for joining our call, and we look forward to sharing more about our progress with WildHorse and the other parts of our strong portfolio with you in the near future.

Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Brad Sylvester. Please go ahead, sir.","Bradley D. Sylvester - Vice President-Investor Relations & Communications","Good morning and thank you for joining our call today to discuss Chesapeake's financial and operational results for the 2015 third quarter. Hopefully, you've had a chance to review our press release and the updated Investor Presentation that we posted to our website this morning.","During this morning's call, we will be making forward-looking statements which consist of statements that cannot be confirmed by reference to existing information, including statements regarding our beliefs, goals, expectations, forecasts, projections and future performance and the assumptions underlying such statements.","Please note that there are a number of factors that will cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements, including the factors identified and discussed in our earnings release today and in other SEC filings. Please recognize that except as required by applicable law, we undertake no duty to update any forward-looking statements, and you should not place undue reliance on such statements.","With me on the call today are Doug Lawler, our Chief Executive Officer; Nick Dell'Osso, our Chief Financial Officer; Chris Doyle, our Executive Vice President of the Northern Division; Jason Pigott, our Executive Vice President of the Southern Division; and Frank Patterson our Executive Vice President of Exploration.","Doug will begin the call, and then turn the call over to Nick for a review of our financial results before we turn the teleconference over for Q&A.","So with that, thank you, and I will now turn the teleconference over to Doug.","Robert Douglas Lawler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Brad, and good morning. Our results in the third quarter provide good solid evidence that we continue to execute on our strategy of improving margins, maximizing liquidity in this low price environment, preserving our cash generating capabilities and improving our core strengths of capital efficiency, speed and flexibility.","During the quarter, we have advanced several organizational and operational initiatives to further prepare Chesapeake for an extended low commodity price environment. We continue to see market efficiency improvements across the portfolio and we are pursuing new value-adding opportunities. As previously announced, we have taken action in the third quarter to make our company stronger. And we will continue to focus on improving our financial and operational competitiveness.","Here are just a few highlights from the quarter. We executed new gathering agreements in the Haynesville and dry gas Utica, which have dramatically improved the value of these two assets. We secured an amended revolving credit facility which has provided a significant increase in our financial flexibility. We eliminated our common stock dividend and also eliminated drilling and financial commitments resulting from the sale of our Cleveland Tonkawa subsidiary, both of which have added cash back to the company.","We continued to reduce controllable cost and eliminated approximately $200 million of annual production and G&A cost from our cost structure. We signed or are in the process of signing several sale agreements for non-core, non-operated assets. And finally, we achieved several operational records and accomplishments in the field, including meaningful progress in new resources like the Meramec, the Upper Marcellus and the black oil Niobrara.","Moving to our quarterly performance, our daily production averaged 667,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which after adjusting for asset sales is a 3% increase year-over-year. This included the impact of Utica and Marcellus curtailments of approximately 51,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and the sale of our Cleveland Tonkawa assets of approximately 8,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. As a result of our continued strong production performance and base optimization, we have raised our guidance for the full year.","Importantly, we continue to drive cash cost reductions on an absolute and per-unit basis. Third quarter lease operating expenses and G&A costs were $4.88 per barrel of oil equivalent, down approximately 9% year-over-year and down 10% sequentially. We have lowered our guidance again for these two categories for the remainder of 2015.","Additionally, we have reduced our full year CapEx guidance by $100 million to a range of $3.4 billion to $3.9 billion. Due to greater capital efficiency and expected low prices we intend to meaningfully reduce our capital spending in 2016. As I noted before, we recognize the challenging nature of our balance sheet and we are firmly focused on improving our financial strength during this difficult commodity price environment. The quality and diversity of our portfolio will continue to provide flexibility and optionality.","Finally, I'd like to touch on just a few of our operational highlights for the quarter. We continue to focus on improving completion efficiency as a value differentiator at Chesapeake as measured through finding and development cost. We are attacking our capital cost in the numerator and with technology and innovation we are making significant improvements in the recoverable reserves per well in the denominator and also the associated productivity per well. We are drilling faster and cheaper, drilling longer laterals and enhancing our completion techniques to drive further value from each investment.","In the Eagle Ford, we expect to see approximately 9% production growth this year compared to 2014, with approximately 45% lower capital investment. Compared to last year, we have seen a 13% reduction in drilling cost per lateral foot and an 8% reduction in cycle time despite a 7% increase in average lateral length. We currently have 19 wells drilled with greater than 9,000 foot laterals including two record 13,000 foot laterals. We also put our three highest rate wells online in the quarter, each reaching peak production rates of over 1,000 barrels of oil per day.","In the Mid-Continent area, an asset that I consider to be one of the most undervalued assets in our portfolio, we have drilled our first two wells in the Meramec and are drilling a third. We drilled our first Meramec well in 27 days and our second in 18 days. Our first well has been on production for just a few days and is still cleaning up, however has already reached over 870 barrels of oil per day and is still climbing. We are obviously encouraged by the early results of this well and our second well be placed on production later this month.","With over 1.8 million net acres in the STACK area in Oklahoma, we estimate that we have more than 1,200 future locations to be drilled in the Meramec and the Oswego formations, not to mention also the exposure to many other prolific oil horizons in the area. So expect to hear more from our Mid-Continent plans and performance in the future.","Moving to the Northern division, in the Upper Marcellus we completed two test wells in southern Bradford County. These two Upper Marcellus wells achieved peak production rates of approximately 19 million and 17 million cubic feet per day. This performance is highly competitive and we believe this opens up the potential for over 1,000 Upper Marcellus locations previously uncaptured in our portfolio. Because most of our acreage in this area is currently held by production we have development and timing flexibility.","The Powder River Basin asset has progressed dramatically in the past year and our estimate of recoverable resources there continues to expand. In October we placed a black oil Niobrara well on production that reached 1,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day with an 85% oil cut and 43 degree API gravity. This test is significant proof of the concept and validates the great work that our teams have been doing to add value to our shareholders in this asset.","Overall, I'm pleased with our progress but we still have a long way to go and significant value opportunities to capture. The strength of our portfolio offers great diversity and a resource base that is growing in size due to the improved productivity and capital efficiencies that we are seeing every day. As I've said before, and I'll continue to say, we are not done. We will continue to deliver and we will continue to improve our value proposition.","I'll now pass the call to Nick for review of our balance sheet and liquidity and then we'll open the call for questions.","Domenic J. Dell\u2019Osso - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Doug and Good morning, everyone. As Doug mentioned, we've done a lot in the past quarter to strengthen our liquidity and enhance our financial flexibility and we continue to see significant progress in many of the areas within our control. Our production, CapEx and cash flow outperformed expectations for the quarter as we continue to see operational efficiency and capital efficiency deliver strong results on our reduced capital program.","We finished the quarter with over $1.7 billion in cash and an undrawn credit facility with capacity of $4 billion at September 30. The amendment to our revolving credit facility at the end of September was an important step in securing and enhancing our liquidity through the term of the facility in 2019.","Shoring up of this important liquidity and the methodical progress we are making towards selling non-core assets gives us confidence to fund the required tender on our 2035 convertible debt this month with cash-on-hand.","Given the continued volatility in the market due to commodity prices and the better clarity around our forward liquidity position, we have been happy to be patient when it comes to any assets we evaluate for sale. However, we are making solid progress on the sale of non-core, non-operated positions where we are in the process of contracting several deals that we believe will bring in $200 million to $300 million between the fourth quarter of this year and the first quarter of 2016. This does not include some potential larger asset sales that we are evaluating.","As we enter 2016, our liquidity and cash flow generation are of utmost importance. We are committed to preserving that liquidity and driving stronger cash flows every day, focusing on both the cost side and the revenue side.","We have added meaningful gas and oil hedges for 2016, when the market has provided opportunities to do so. We structured the amendment to our revolving credit facility assuming no asset sales and low-commodity prices, giving us confidence in our ability to remain flexible throughout the year. As such, cash provided from any asset sales or higher prices can be invested in our balance sheet or our business in the way that creates the most shareholder value. Our strong and flexible portfolio and our people, who are relentlessly driving for better solutions, will both help us to weather this tough commodity price environment.","That concludes my comments, so I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we'll take our first question from Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Mr. Leggate, your line is open. Please check your mute function, sir.","Okay, we'll go to our next question from Neal Dingmann with SunTrust.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Morning, guys. Say, quick question, Doug, first on the STACK. Obviously, the first well at 870 barrels a day after three days looks quite good. How do you see that cleaning up over the next few weeks? And, again, I guess you guys identified a lot of that area. If you could talk about potential acreage, after seeing that first well and now drilling your third. How big a position you have in that area?","Robert Douglas Lawler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. You bet, Neal. I think I'll let Jason provide just a little bit more color but I'll make a few comments just high level. What's really exciting to us is this large acreage position and the capital efficiencies that Chesapeake continues to drive in all of our operations gives us the position to continue to expand core opportunities and really good investments in the STACK. And so, I'm very pleased and we expect that well to continue to clean up.","But what I also really am excited about is when you see the strength of Chesapeake's operating performance driving those days down, drill and complete on the well and we'll continue to see improvements there, you can expect to see continued successive capital efficiency and productivity gains from this asset. And I'd just really highlight that I think Chesapeake's position in the STACK continues to be our most undervalued asset. And Jason, if you want to kick in there I'd appreciate it.","Jason M. Pigott - Senior Vice President-Southern Operations","Yeah. Again, it's only three days and this well is drilled to the farthest north part in a thinner part of the Meramec, so I think that makes it additionally encouraging to me. The flowbacks that we've seen had been fairly flat in their production rate for the first month. Again, this well is flowing at 1,000 psi. We put a tracer on the very first stage of the frac and we have not seen that tracer chemical come back yet. So, we haven't seen all the wellbore yet, but it's been fairly flat for the first few days and it's in a thinner part of the play.","The second well that we're drilling or about to turn online here in the next couple weeks is in a much thicker part of the play and the pressure from the drilling out the plugs has been very positive as well. So, it should surpass even this first well.","As Doug mentioned, our drilling and completion efficiency have really been what's outstanding there. This first well came in at, say, 23.5 days. Current estimates for that well are $7.4 million, so we did a really good job out the gate. On the second well, via the help of our operations support team and a fantastic drilling group, the second well was at 18 days. It was $500,000 savings on drilling alone which could put this well in that $6.9 million range which we, based on some of the peers that I've looked at their data, this is kind of industry-leading cost for a 10,000-foot well. So we're really excited about it.","We're also taking a core on this third well. I think they've just about finished taking the core on that. One of the advantages of Chesapeake is having a core lab across the street, so we should be able to get a lot of our data back from that which will help us in the future with spacing and staggered laterals and really the development of the field.","Combined, again, we \u2013 our STACK is a little bit different than others. I consider the STACK, the Miss Lime, our Oswego and the Meramec here. So, together, those are \u2013 got a almost 400,000-acre position between those three formations. We didn't mention it, I think, in our notes, but we have drilled our first two 10,000-foot wells in the Miss Lime as well. Those two wells came in for an incremental $200,000 of drilling. So, those economics will be competitive with Meramec, Oswego, any other formation that's out there.","That one 10,000-foot well saves $1.4 million versus drilling two of our traditional 5,000-foot intervals. So that well is also being completed and should have production online. But it saves 35% on our cost to develop that field if those wells are successful. So, we're really excited about all the formation. It's not officially the STACK, but we've got that STACK interval play out there that just has three powerhouse formations that all have great economics.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Very good. And then, Doug, just one other if I could. How do you all think \u2013 you've obviously done tremendous job on shoring up your liquidity position. But how do you think about with where gas prices currently are and kind of how you see your spending next year, maybe if you could talk a little bit about any potential outspend or how you see that sort of going next year?","Robert Douglas Lawler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure, Neal. That's a great question. I think \u2013 and very important question for Chesapeake, particularly given our balance sheet. And we are not providing any capital guidance today for next year but I just would like to highlight that the flexibility and the options we have in our portfolio give us a lot of strength and as we look next year, I wanted to make sure to note on this call, that we are looking to meaningfully reduce our capital next year.","Gas prices obviously, being lower. You look at the strip, you see some sort of recovery. But we're not designing this business, Neal, around increasing prices and so the drive for efficiencies, the quality of the rock and the quality of these assets. We have got to find a way to be competitive and I can assure you that the capital spend and investment next year will be directed at how we can capture from this strong portfolio, the greatest value.","And with our program, we have significantly ramped down our activity. We've continued to take it down. And as we look forward to 2016, we'll maintain that flexibility to make further adjustments based on prices, based on capital efficiency and based on performance.","So you can expect that we'll be providing that guidance a little bit later, but the focus on capital efficiency and the focus on directing capital investments either to gas or oil, will be where we can capture the greatest value.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Great. Thanks for the details. Nice quarter.","Operator","And we'll go to our next question from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Good morning.","Robert Douglas Lawler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Brian.","Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Your mindset a quarter ago may have been characterized as Chesapeake needs to sell assets to increase activity levels to maintain or improve efficiencies. It seems like you moderated the tone a bit on activity levels for next year and you mentioned $200 million to $300 million of asset sales. But wonder if you could just characterize A, the extent of asset sales that we should expect and B, how that would translate into activity levels and further efficiencies versus the strong reduction in, say, Op cost that we've seen this quarter?","Robert Douglas Lawler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Sure, Brian. So as you look at the commodity price environment, you look at the opportunities that we had going forward. Our focus is still the same. And that is, if we can accelerate the value from an asset sale, we will do that. And we're looking at many different opportunities within \u2013 with that respect.","What I think is really important to note is that we're not dependent upon an asset sale in any way. And if we can capture and accelerate value, we will do that. But we don't have to, to perform the asset sales. We wanted to make sure to note that we have a number of underlying non-core things that are moving through and we expect to close on, as Nick highlighted.","But this environment and how we drive greater value from a large portfolio is something that we believe we still have opportunity to bring forward a greater value. So we'll continue to look at asset sales, but our position is the same, in that we are not depending upon asset sales.","If we do sell something, we've got a lot of options. We can put it directed towards the assets and invest in our program, or we can also attack the capital structure that we have highlighted, that we will continue to improve. So, Nick, you want to add any other color there?","Domenic J. Dell\u2019Osso - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. So we've talked quite a bit earlier this year, about a desire to sell non-core assets. And we've tested the market around a few things there. Like we said today, we have visibility into a few things that are moving forward, relatively small at this point. And we're, again, happy to be patient on that front because we do have the operational flexibility to take capital lower.","But really, what's, I think, driving things more than anything at this point is that our capital going lower for next year is driven more by commodity prices than it is by whether or not we sell an asset. I mean, we're going to invest in our properties the way that we think is the most prudent. And right now, if I turned around tomorrow and found that we were selling a large asset for a lot of money, it's not really going to change our capital plans in the near term. It might give us flexibility to think about things differently over a longer period of time or something like that. But for the short term, as we get into most of 2016 here, we see prices at a level that encourage us to be pretty low capital investment and allow the market to continue to heal itself.","And so, we're setting up our program such that if asset sales surprise to the upside, we'll be able to look at our balance sheet, try to do things that make the most sense for the long-term health of the business. And depending on how things unfold for next year, it could change, that means we would ramp capital. But it may not. And we have some challenges with our balance sheet, as everyone is well aware, that we focus on every day. And we've made some progress there and we'll continue to make more.","One of the things that we look at is with our maturity here, the put on the converts in November, this modest amount of non-core asset sales and the cost reductions that we have in front of us that are real cash-on-cash reductions allow us to fund that. And so, we end up in a cash position across a couple of quarters that's the same as we were planning to be earlier this year when you might have thought that that was a piece of debt that you would refinance. So, instead, we'll retire that completely, and we'll move on with the same liquidity position. So, we feel really good about that and we feel really good about the ability to be patient. The ability to look at our capital program and say what's driving lower capital spend is prices. And we're making the right decisions for long-term value creation.","Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks that's really helpful color. One follow-up asset-level type questions, a couple quick ones there, one on STACK, you've highlighted this now a couple of times as a really underappreciated asset, is STACK now strategic to Chesapeake from a development perspective, as a retained asset or is this a candidate for asset sale? And then in the Utica, you highlighted in the release an additional 350 mmcf per day of new capacity, allowing access to Gulf Coast pricing. Should we expect that your Utica production goes up by that amount or just you take gas currently getting lower prices and get higher prices on that gas? Thank you.","Robert Douglas Lawler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure Brian. I think you should consider that the STACK is a highly strategic asset to Chesapeake and as Jason noted, we've got great optionality there and a lot of excitement and energy around it and with respect to the Utica this is a powerhouse asset within our portfolio and having that additional capacity gives us a significant amount of flexibility. I think what's important to note there is that we are not activity-driven. We are not volume-driven. We are value-driven. And so what we direct our investments and how we fund, whether it be the STACK or whether it be Utica, is all directed at how we optimize the greatest value.","Christopher M. Doyle - Senior Vice President-Northern Division Operations","Yeah. And Brian, this is Chris Doyle, just a little additional color on the Utica, to answer your question, the 350 mmcf per day was the planned OPEN expansion. It's online. We're building out a lateral to connect our gas. What we saw in the third quarter and what you saw on our results of 15% sequential decline, that was a planned decline curtailment. We've brought that gas back on for a number of reasons. One, to access the Gulf Coast, part of our plan to get 80%-plus of our gas to that pricing. That's now in place. The other thing is seasonal NGL pricing that we see flip October 1. We've brought most of that gas back on. We've \u2013 actually the asset set production records last week and continues to hit it out of the park.","Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you.","Robert Douglas Lawler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Brian.","Operator","And we'll go next to Doug Leggate with Merrill Lynch.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks, everyone. Can you hear me?","Robert Douglas Lawler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, sure.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I'm so sorry guys. There was some kind of Phonegram on this morning. I'm quite embarrassed. Doug, if I may just prod a little bit on your comments about capital expenditure. I realize you're still some way away from giving us a guidance for next year. But can you frame for us how you see the areas that you're prepared to flex? Now, clearly, the opportunity set is getting a lot broader with the STACK and the Powder River. But just order of magnitude, what are the kind of moving parts that you see that's going to drive your decision for how \u2013 where you want to be next year relative to cash flow?","Robert Douglas Lawler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure, Doug. The \u2013 as we look at the commodity prices and project through the year, I think it's really important that the investment community know that we are not counting on price recovery. We are not structuring our investments, we are not structuring our focus on our balance sheet or any part of our business, expecting recovery. That said, that means we're going to see meaningful reduction in our capital program next year.","What I love about this company and I am so energized about is that despite that, the technology, the focus on improving our cost, the competitive tension within the organization for capital funding. I just would love for you to have the opportunity to see as we work through our portfolio, the tension and the competitiveness for where the next dollar of spend would potentially go.","With the Meramec and the emerging opportunities that we see there, the quality of the Sussex and Niobrara opportunities that exist, as well as the Eagle Ford and as well as the continued reductions on the gas side. We have significant opportunities. And I think that's why it's key to note that as we look at \u2013 for the near and longer term why we would consider looking at asset sales, not depending upon asset sales, but if there's an opportunity to accelerate value there, given the fact that with this large portfolio, some things may not be funded for some period of time. We will look at that. But that isn't a commitment to do it and it's all the value focus.","So we'll provide that detail to you and as I've noted, just the quality of the portfolio, this is not a one-trick pony outfit and not a two-trick. We got six really, really strong, powerful assets and that provides us a lot of flexibility.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Appreciate the answer. Doug. My follow-up is also, if I may, on the STACK and the Powder. You've talked obviously a little bit about potential asset sales this morning, but you haven't talked much about potential joint ventures. One could be forgiven for thinking these well results this morning are a terrific advert for the quality of your assets. I'm just curious as to whether there is any joint venture progress coming on the back of that? And I'll leave it there. Thanks.","Robert Douglas Lawler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. The \u2013 we consider the JV to fall under the same umbrella, Doug, as an asset sale. So that opportunity exists as well, across the portfolio on anything that we would want to accelerate under the \u2013 improve the underlying cash flow ability and direct JV type dollars to. So, I would just consider that the same as an asset sale that we see option and opportunity in that.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great stuff. Thanks a lot, guys.","Robert Douglas Lawler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah.","Robert Douglas Lawler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hang on just a second, Doug.","Christopher M. Doyle - Senior Vice President-Northern Division Operations","Hey, Doug, I was just going to add a little bit of additional color on Powder for you. The team just emailed me the latest test on the black oil. It continues to clean up. Yesterday it made over 1,400 barrels of oil. Over 1,600 barrel equivalent. So, we're really excited about that. It's been about a month online.","You mentioned, gosh, that's a great advertisement for any type of deal and, while that's true, we're also saying that we're reducing activity there and we pulled the rig out. And there are a number of reasons why we do that. One is response to low prices. This acreage position is held. I'm not real excited about selling into a market that is trying to tell us to slow down. But finally, there is a lot of work that we need to get done on the midstream side.","We've talked about the cooperative renegotiations discussions we've had with Williams. I'm really encouraged by what we're seeing out in the Rockies. At the end of the day, the Niobrara is dedicated. The Frontier is dedicated but what's not dedicated to Williams is the Sussex, the Parkman, the Teapot, the Turner, the Mowry, and if it's $3 and $50 for a long time, our development dollars are going to go away from the Nio.","And so we've got some work to do and we'll get it fixed and we'll be back at it and really excited about what we continue to see out there.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I appreciate that color, Chris. Just to check, you're working interest in the Powder is about 80%, right?","Christopher M. Doyle - Senior Vice President-Northern Division Operations","That's correct. We doubled up last year.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great stuff. Thanks very much.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Good morning, Doug, and to the rest of your team there. I was wondering if I could pick up on some of the comments that Chris was offering a little while ago on those 51 mboe a day that's curtailed right now. More generally, I'd like to ask what are the \u2013 I think the obvious answer to what would induce you to open those volumes up is better price. But if we could dig in a little deeper below that, are there more things like this change in the marketing arrangement with the Utica volumes that are going to induce you to bring that 51 mboe a day back to market?","Christopher M. Doyle - Senior Vice President-Northern Division Operations","Yeah. Charles, this is Chris. Yeah. Just to clarify, on the Utica where saw in third quarter, we were about 20 mboe per day curtailed. Decision there was not only a little bit of a shrink in gas realization partly because of the OPEN capacity that is now available to us, but also the seasonal nature of the NGLs in our contracts that flip that switch and make sense to bring those volumes on. So, we are not curtailed in the Utica at this point. This is a daily conversation, weekly conversation, that happens, and we will respond to what the market's telling us. But at this point in the Utica, we've brought those volumes on to capture better NGL realizations and better gas realizations getting to the Gulf Coast.","Now, in the Marcellus, we still have about 500 million a day behind choke. We have pulled off all of our activity or largely all of our activity. We're excited about the resource. Obviously we highlight the Upper Marcellus. But again, this is a daily, weekly conversation that happens. We anticipate bringing some of that gas online in the fourth quarter, but it's going to require higher gas prices. We anticipate that will happen, but we're not going to bring gas on just to hit a production number. We're going to do it to bring up cash. So, I hope that adds a little bit of color to your question, Charles.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","That does. That's very helpful. And if I understand correctly, this is about in-Basin gas pricing. There's no new marketing arrangement for Marcellus gas that is going to change the picture. At least in the next...?","Christopher M. Doyle - Senior Vice President-Northern Division Operations","That's correct.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Okay. Got it.","Christopher M. Doyle - Senior Vice President-Northern Division Operations","That's correct.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Thank you. That's very helpful. And, Nick, if I could go back to some of your comments which I agree, they're very helpful, your discussion about how you guys are looking at 2016 CapEx. But to go back to your prepared comments, you made a comment about investment in the business or the balance sheet. And I'm curious if you could talk a bit, is there a certain target level of cash or, perhaps, I know you're focused on total liquidity, but is there some kind of target level where you're trying to preserve optionality? Like do you want to keep at least $500 million cash on the balance sheet absent some fabulous opportunity?","Domenic J. Dell\u2019Osso - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No. I don't really think about it in terms of there being some sort of Mendoza Line there because we have a very sizeable liquidity position. Really, more I think about it is we have a number of obligations with maturities coming due and other things like that, that we need to preserve liquidity to meet.","And in the meantime, we'll continue to look for additional ways to enhance the liquidity position that, while sizeable today, we're focused on its uses over time. So, there is not a magic number there. I'd like to have more is the bottom line.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Got it. Thank you, Nick. I'm not a baseball fan, so I had to Google that Mendoza Line, but I...","Domenic J. Dell\u2019Osso - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, you knew it was a baseball reference. So there you go.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","No. I didn't even know that. But anyway, thanks a lot. I appreciate the color, Nick.","Operator","We'll go to our next question from David Tameron with Wells Fargo.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. Thanks for all of the color this morning. Most of it has been answered. But a couple \u2013 one clarification and one big picture. Those slides you have where it shows the breakeven for the PV-10s. It looks like it's $50 and $3. Is that held flat? And then as far as well cost and assumptions in there, are those \u2013 can you just talk about the math behind there? Are those current well costs, assumed well costs, targeted, those type of things?","Christopher M. Doyle - Senior Vice President-Northern Division Operations","Yeah. This is Chris. The color behind that slide is that the opposing commodity is held flat whether it's $3 gas or $50 oil to find the breakeven, and that is deliverable well cost, what we are doing today, and so this improves going forward. In fact, I think on the Mid-Con STACK, that's an update from where we were previously. So, yes, these bars continue to move and those teams look at where that bar is and they are beating each other up for capital and it's a fantastic thing to watch.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","And so the easy work has obviously been done there. How much more do you have? I mean, can we anticipate in the current cost environment, everything drifts a little lower, but is there another 5% to 10% in these type of numbers or how should we think about that?","Christopher M. Doyle - Senior Vice President-Northern Division Operations","I think, for sure, 5% to 10% just on operational improvements. No service cost decrease. We've got now with two, three years of track record showing continuous improvement. We've taken a big chunk out of each one of these plays and I fully expect that we'll continue to do that. That's why you see operational records continuing to be set quarter after quarter, drilling longer wells for faster. The Utica averaging under 10 days for all the wells in the quarter. Drilling a well in 6.8 days. These are teams that are bred to get better every single day. So, 10%, 15%, I would be shocked if we're not there within two quarters.","Jason M. Pigott - Senior Vice President-Southern Operations","And maybe less than that. So, this is Jason. At Meramec, for example, that curve was based on a $7.1 million well. And as I mentioned, our second well looks like it's a $6.9 million well. So they'll continue to improve on that and take it down. In Miss Lime, we're in the process of completing our first 10,000-foot well there. We can have a whole rig line of wells to do next year. That takes that curve down by 35%, if that is a successful program.","So there's some big things on the horizon. Eagle Ford as well. We're continuing to push longer laterals there. Again, we highlighted our first wells over 12,000 feet with one over 13,000 feet. I was looking back at what that meant to us. 2015 average drilling cost for Eagle Ford was \u2013 2014 average cost was $6.1 million. These two wells with laterals over 12,000 feet came in at $7.4 million and $7.1 million. So, we've had an increase of cost of 20% but increased our exposure to the reservoir by 100%. So when you're doing those kind of things, they're transformational to those breakeven cost.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. That's good color. Thanks. And then, I guess for Doug or Nick or whoever \u2013 and I'm not trying to be a jerk here but I'm going to ask the question. So, why not just tap the capital markets and issue some equity? I know what your answer has been in the past, but can you just talk about that?","Domenic J. Dell\u2019Osso - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure, Dave. We do sit with a large liquidity position. We sit in an environment where we know we have a lot of operational flexibility, we need to continue to evaluate things and think about the future and think about how things are going to evolve here and be planning for what everyone I think in the industry is planning for, which is lower prices for longer. But there's so many things for us to do within our existing portfolio, within our balance sheet as it exists today that I just don't see where that's at the forefront for us.","Robert Douglas Lawler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think just to add on top of that, the way we look at it though, Dave, and I don't \u2013 the question is a good question. And when you look at Chesapeake and the strength of the company and with the current commodity price environment and all of those options are available to us. And we will continue to look at the options that can drive the greatest value for the long term. And so, that's just one option and we'll continue to evaluate our investments. We'll continue to evaluate our capital structure and we'll be \u2013 what you can expect is we'll continue to be making changes to improve this great company.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","All right. And I appreciate the candidness. That's all I got. Thanks.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Dan McSpirit with BMO Capital Markets.","Daniel Eugene McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you. Good morning. Just a few questions on the STACK, appreciating that you're very early in the process of exploring and exploiting this asset. But any thoughts, early thoughts on the potential recoveries as well as maybe the b-factor or the shape of the curve as well as the product mix, at least on these Meramec wells?","Jason M. Pigott - Senior Vice President-Southern Operations","The Meramec wells have been, again, highly oil-weighted, 83% oil is what we've seen a lot of times. Our type curve is kind of a 900 barrel of oil per day IP, 600 days you're out to the 300 barrels or so per day. So, we'll be publishing more on our type curves out there, but the data is just early across the field, so really long-term estimates are difficult. But it looks, again, very economic, very competitive in the portfolio. We're really excited about it and as I say, we've got our rig going there. And what's great about it too is just the continued cost reductions out there that really enhance the economics.","Daniel Eugene McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Great. And then on the asset sales, is there any one asset or operation that's not on the table to be monetized in one form or another?","Robert Douglas Lawler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sorry. You're asking if there's anything that's not on the table to be sold?","Daniel Eugene McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","That's right.","Robert Douglas Lawler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I mean...","Daniel Eugene McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","That's off limits?","Domenic J. Dell\u2019Osso - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. We talk about what assets are core and what assets we're investing money in and what assets we believe have the longest term horizon for attracting investment within our portfolio. Those things move around as to what we think is top of the list and how we think about the long-term value of each of our assets.","With all of the things that Jason and Chris talk about on a regular basis, each time they deliver a new set of results, that's improved in one asset, it's going to improve its relative performance to another. We sit in a position where we would like to sell some assets. We are long assets. And in this market, we don't believe shareholders are valuing us being long assets and for good reason. And so, we would like to trim our portfolio, but it has to be for good value.","And so, while we don't get credit and like I said, probably shouldn't get credit for being long assets, we also should not put ourselves in a position where we take a really poor market and force a deal into it. Capital markets are pretty tough right now. The ability for other buyers to access funding to buy large assets is pretty tough. So, we need to be patient. We don't have a burning platform from which we need to sell an asset but we have an urgency and a need in our business to be getting our portfolio right for the long-term. So, we continue to have discussions. We continue to push on things but we don't find ourselves in a place where we have to force something into the market.","As to which assets are being considered for sale or not being considered for sale, we really don't go into that kind of detail but I guess, the right way to answer that question, and I think the way we think about those kinds of things are that we have a portfolio of assets, and each one of them has a value. And if anyone has a different view of value than I do of our assets, a higher view of value of our assets, then \u2013 for \u2013 because they're going to develop it differently or whatever reason, then we'll be commercial and listen to them. But that doesn't mean that we go out and actively shop things.","Daniel Eugene McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Great. And I appreciate that. And just revisiting the question on equity versus asset sales, do you anticipate the sales to be accretive, appreciating where the shares are trading?","Domenic J. Dell\u2019Osso - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, sure, the few things that we're doing right now are very accretive. It's very little production, it's non-core, it's non-operated, it's a handful of transactions, it's things that fit within the wheelhouse of other operators that we happen to own. It's a variety of things that drive what people want to buy from us even given the market that we sit in today. And so, yeah, very accretive.","Daniel Eugene McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Great. And then lastly here, just on the Eagle Ford, the inventory of wells waiting on completion maybe at the end of this year and next year that you can estimate?","Jason M. Pigott - Senior Vice President-Southern Operations","Yeah. We have 135 wells waiting to be completed at the end of this year and we're working through budget for next year. So that number will fluctuate as we go through the budget process.","Daniel Eugene McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Much appreciated. Have a great day. Thank you.","Robert Douglas Lawler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from David Heikkinen with Heikkinen Energy Advisors.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Good morning. Just a couple of quick questions. On the curtailment in the Utica, what was the split of condensate, gas and NGLs?","Robert Douglas Lawler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","It was pre \u2013 it was all coming from what we call the wet side, so it's consistent with our overall split. We're currently just on the ethane side at about recovering 20% to hit that A tax and get our gas into pipeline spec, so we're \u2013 it was heavily weighted to gas, but it's consistent with the overall asset.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","And then just in the STACK, good well results and you gave some details. What's your working interest, I guess, on average on that 400,000 acres in those first couple wells?","Jason M. Pigott - Senior Vice President-Southern Operations","The first well was 95% working interest. We're starting to form units now, so it's kind of hard to say what your average working interest will be over the development of the play. We're working as we go. The first few wells we've put together are in the 90%s as far as working interest...","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Yeah. I mean, so you're having success doing asset swaps and kind of forming a bigger working interest?","Jason M. Pigott - Senior Vice President-Southern Operations","Yeah. Everybody's trying to kind of core up their position, maintain operation of those sections. So we've been working together to everybody block up their position to minimize LOE expense and drilling, et cetera. The real win there is if you can drill the 10,000-foot laterals. And sometimes we're checkerboarded, et cetera. So, getting it together so that you can drill the 10,000 foot wells are a big win for all the operators in the area.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","And is there any issue with kind of OCC qualifying the Oswego or the Miss Lime as a shale for the cross section laterals?","Jason M. Pigott - Senior Vice President-Southern Operations","We're working on it. The Oswego is thinner. So, that's our technical debate we're having internally. Is it thick enough to drill the 10,000 foot and be precise as you get towards that toe area? But we've challenged \u2013 we've gone to 10,000 foot laterals everywhere in the southern division. And north is doing the same thing, drilling as long as they can. So, the preference is to push these things out as far as we can because it maximizes our efficiency of the drill bit, our LOE, minimizes surface footprint as well. So, it's a win for everybody when we can drill those cross unit laterals.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Okay. And then, Nick, the cut to CapEx of $100 million, $50 million of that was capitalized interest. Was the other $50 million you going from seven rigs in the Haynesville down to six or where is the other $50 million of capital cut?","Domenic J. Dell\u2019Osso - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. It's really just trimmed across the portfolio. There is a few completions. There is, like you said, the drop with the Haynesville rig. There's a variety of small changes across the portfolio.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Okay.","Domenic J. Dell\u2019Osso - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","It continues to come down and it will move lower in the first quarter.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Significantly lower is what you guys have said, so...","Domenic J. Dell\u2019Osso - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Right.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","...we'll hold you to that.","Domenic J. Dell\u2019Osso - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, the point though there, David, is that it's sequentially lower, not just lower year-over-year.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Yeah. Okay. Thank you, guys.","Robert Douglas Lawler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, David, just to follow-up on the \u2013 when I look at our production through that time we were curtailing, it's about 15% to 20% NGLs and the rest gas.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Thanks, guys. That's perfect.","Operator","We'll go to our next question from Dave Kistler with Simmons & Company.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International","Good morning, guys. Just a few maybe clean-up questions. With respect to the Spectra OPEN line coming on, was the production that's flowing through that factored in to the 4Q guidance? And is that potentially what's driving a portion of the increase to the gas guidance?","Robert Douglas Lawler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","That was always forecast. It was forecasted in there after last quarter as well. That line will be connected to our tailgate at Kensington this quarter. We're taking advantage of it. We've seen a little bit of strength in in-basin there in the Utica, and we have that capacity to get to the Gulf Coast. That's been baked in there, to answer your question, for quite a while, bringing that volume back in.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International","And I assume obviously the transport cost is as well, but can you refresh us on what the transport cost is or the economic uplift from getting gas out of basin?","Robert Douglas Lawler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","It is significant. And I don't know that we've gone into the detail of what our transport cost, but I can tell you it is exceptionally competitive versus our peers, like half.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International","Okay. Appreciate that. And then one last one just on the breakeven analysis that you guys put out. Can you talk a little bit instead of on the PV-10 breakeven, the actual maybe cash-on-cash payback periods in terms of how quickly those pay back and does that also influence what you'll select as far as what you're going to be drilling this next year?","Jason M. Pigott - Senior Vice President-Southern Operations","I don't know if we have it necessarily for every single play. But like the Meramec wells, it can be at two years or less or in that timeframe for paybacks, Miss Lime and the same thing. So, the things that we're focused on are that two years, two-and-a-half years or less timeframe from what I've seen out there. But I don't have a payout period by bar that we've got out there.","Domenic J. Dell\u2019Osso - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","That's going to be fairly consistent. And it absolutely goes into the decisions that we'll make. If we're looking at a really strong asset but we got to build out to it. And it's going to be a three-year delay type deal, we're just not going to put money there. We'll look at that cash turn and focus in on areas like Mid-Con, where we've got the infrastructure, we can hook wells up very, very quickly and get a quick cash return.","Robert Douglas Lawler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","As we're laying out our 2016 program, that is a big driver relative to the weight on that in the past and for obvious reasons. With decreased revenue, you got to be focused a little bit more on short cycle cash opportunities. And so, finding ways to put capital to work that has the nearest term payback makes the most sense from a return perspective in this market, even if bigger return opportunities are out there but they require a longer lead time to achieve them.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International","Okay. Appreciate the added color, guys. Thanks so much.","Operator","We'll take our next question from James Sullivan with Alembic Global Advisors.","James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys.","Robert Douglas Lawler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, James.","Domenic J. Dell\u2019Osso - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hi, James.","James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Just quick, cleanup question here. You guys had talked about the target for year-end 2015 of $1.5 billion of cash on hand. Does that include the $200 million to $400 million of asset sales you guys are contemplating here or is that kind of absent that?","Domenic J. Dell\u2019Osso - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","This was the $1.5 billion. The $1.5 billion, just to be very clear about all that, the $1.5 billion is prior to handling the November maturity. So, to the extent we're paying for that in cash, it will come down. But then, the cost reductions that we're seeing in those asset sales will then, again, offset that back higher. So, depending on the timing of those asset sales, it would either be still at $1.5 billion or maybe a little bit below. But then you have $400 million reduced debt. So, you have to include that in the analysis.","James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Got that, got it. That's great. And then just another little cleanup on this. Was any of the royalty, the payment for the Barnett royalty settlement, did that happen in Q3 or is that going to be a Q4 event?","Domenic J. Dell\u2019Osso - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I'm not actually certain on the timing of the payout of that settlement.","James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Okay. I can follow-up with you guys offline on that. But then, just a last one from me, in the STACK, you guys talked a little bit about your negotiations with Williams going well. Can you just remind me when it comes to the gas contracts, is there any part \u2013 and this includes obviously, laterals, because I know you're a little bit broken up in terms of deep and shallow rights there? But is there any part of that, that is in Blaine, Kingfisher, Canadian or wherever, or even a little bit broader in the STACK that is dedicated acreage for gas gathering?","Jason M. Pigott - Senior Vice President-Southern Operations","I can't tell you. The Williams are all over the place. I'm trying to remember \u2013 I know that Energy Transfer has some of the oil gathering (52:01) for the Meramec wells. But the gas, I'm trying to \u2013 I can't recall off the top of my head.","Robert Douglas Lawler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","There will be plenty in that area that is dedicated, and plenty that's not. We have such a legacy position through that area and legacy production from many different producing zones. But there will be some that would include the STACK zones, that's dedicated and some that's not. So it's going to be an important part of our discussions with Williams going forward. It's going to be a driver of our activity and it will be business that Williams and frankly, many other gatherers. That's probably the most competitive gathering area in the country, given the legacy footprint of development in the area, conventional production in the area and all of the pipe that's laying underground and frankly, in that part of the world, on top of the ground. So it's a very, very competitive area and a lot of gatherers will be pushing hard to get our incremental business there.","James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Okay. Great, guys. Thanks.","Operator","And that concludes today's question-and-answer session. Mr. Sylvester, at this time, I will turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks.","Bradley D.

All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions Please note, this event is being recorded.","I would like to turn the conference over to Brad Sylvester. Please go ahead.","Brad Sylvester","Thank you Chad and good morning everyone and thank you for joining our call today to discuss Chesapeake's financial and operational results for the 2019 first quarter. Hopefully, you have had a chance to review our press release and the updated investor presentations that we posted to our website this morning.","During this morning's call, we will be making forward-looking statements which consist of statements that cannot be confirmed by reference to existing information, including statements regarding our beliefs, goals, expectations, forecasts, projections, and future performance and the assumptions underlying such statements.","Please note that there are a number of factors that will cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements, including the factors identified and discussed in our earnings release today and in other SEC filings.

Doug will begin the call, and then turn the call over to Frank and Nick for a review of our operational and financial results, before we turn the teleconference over for Q&A.","So with that, thank you and I will now turn the teleconference over to Doug.","Doug Lawler","Thank you, Brad and good morning. Next month, I will record my sixth anniversary at Chesapeake Energy and I\u2019m as excited today as I ever had been.","Over the past six years, our strategy, commitment and tenacity to drive differential top quartile performance for our shareholders, has been consistent and strong and vibrant regardless of external or internal challenges. I'm very proud of progress and accomplishments and I'm excited about the future trajectory of the Company.","During these transformation years, we have shared our significant progress on debt and obligation reductions, operating and capital efficiencies, profitability improvements and the simplification of our business.","Importantly, for the last 16 quarters in a row, we have met or exceeded the street consensus earnings estimates demonstrating the strength of our employees, asset portfolio and strategy. We are consistently executed and performed as we have projected and we will continue to sharpen and improve our business delivery to drive greater value for our shareholders.","The foundational improvements in our balance sheet and capital efficiency and cash generating ability, combined with our operational expertise and scale have positioned the Company to accelerate our rate of improvement and value creation from our diverse asset base.","In the first quarter, Chesapeake continued to execute on strategic priorities, delivering yet again strong financial and operational results. As we look at our performance, no, asset exemplifies the energy, talent and conviction of our employees to deliver significant change in a short period of time rather than our new Brazos Valley asset, an asset we now project will be cash flow positive at the asset level this year.","During the last three months, we have rapidly integrated the new asset into our portfolio, eliminating approximately $500,000 in cost per well with improved drilling and completion techniques, highlighted by new records and drilling rate of penetration and number of fracture stimulation stages completed in a day.","On several wells in Brazos Valley, we have already achieved capital cost improvements of more than $1 million per well. As you would expect and as you know from our track record with our other assets, we will achieve further capital efficiency in the future on an average well and full program basis.","We are pleased with our saving and production improvements to-date in Brazos Valley and as we will share further in a moment, we believe there are additional opportunities to improve the returns and cash flow generating capabilities of the entire portfolio.","We averaged oil production of approximately 109,000 barrels per day in the first quarter, representing 18% in absolute growth compared to last year and 22% of our total production mix, that compares to 19% in the fourth quarter of last year.","We remain on-track to deliver the transformational 32% absolute oil growth we guided to in February, ultimately reaching a year-end oil production mix of approximately 26% of total net production.","But, more importantly, our increase in oil production along with our focus on reducing our costs continue to improve our competitiveness and cash flow generating capability. We believe the rate of change in our cash flow is already noticeable in 2019.","As we look ahead to the rest of the year, our talented employees are focused on delivering our strategic priorities and creating more value for Chesapeake while maintaining our safety and environmental leadership. We look forward to sharing more of our progress with you throughout the year.","With that, and I will now turn the teleconference over to Frank to cover additional operational and asset level detail.","Frank Patterson","Thank you, Doug. Good morning, everyone. As Doug mentioned, we were very pleased with the progress our team has made in just a little over 90 days integrating Brazos Valley into our portfolio. We are learning a lot and I'm pleased with what we have seen so far.","On the production side, we have already started to redesign completions, namely by reducing fluids used and maintaining sand volumes and combining this with better choke management -. Early results are extremely encouraging, and have seen on the Easy Rider pad in Burleson County where our choke management efforts have already delivered a 35% initial production uplift to historical wells in the area.","Once we start to integrate longer laterals, we believe the results will only get better. The well pad in Burleson County represents our first true grassroots wells. And early results are promising, proven from average lateral length of 7000 feet and completed with expansion of 2000 to 4000 fuel barrels per completion stage. This whole pad, is turned in line in late April, and has reached a 24 hour production rate of over 2700 barrels of oil per day and production is still climbing.","Comparing to other modern completions in this part of the field, this represents over 190% improvement in early flowback. When we took over operations in February 1st, the majority of the rigs were working in the gas window of the Austin Chalk.","We have now altered course, transitioning all four rigs of the oil window at Eagle Ford which we expect will result in our oil volume picking speed beginning in or around the third quarter with cost dropping quickly and an increase in our projected 2019 volumes we are right on schedule.","As a result at current strip prices, Brazos Valley now projects to be cash flow positive on an asset operating level this year. This is a monumental feet for our team and we look forward to keeping you updated throughout the year on our continued progress.","In our legacy, Eagle Ford position in South Texas, we continue to generate significant free cash flow through steady high margin or production. Over the last 18 months, the South Texas team has focused on improving capital efficiency through the implementation of appropriate spacing inclusion design, resulting in consistent oil volumes and markedly improved production declines. New well performance and a base production focus have driven very strong results. And we see more opportunities available on the base optimization side.","We have recently reallocated capital away from Midcon, and Marcellus areas and have redirected it to the Powder River basin, adding necessary to our programs. That rig began drilling in the tunnel formation this week and will transition to the Niabrara later in the year.","As you may recall, the last of Niabrara completions in the field are some of the best performing wells in the basin. We believe longer laterals and enhanced completions will unlock the full value of this play that underlies the majority of our leaseholder. The team is excited to move to the next phase of unlocking the value of the stake paid in the Powder River basin.","Our Powder River operations have rebounded from weather delays, which hampered operations and resulted in temporarily reduced production during the first quarter. As we have exited and our operations are back to normal and in April we averaged approximately 39,000 BOE per day, including 18,000 barrels of oil.","As we enter the second week of May, our Powder River production continues to grow at a steady pace, reaching a new production record of approximately 42,000 BOE per day, including 20,000 barrels of oil in Monday this week. This recent rate was driven by a five well BB pad and the new RRC well, which reached over 4000 BOE per day, 75% of that was oil. This 24 hour single well rate, represents a highest oil rate in our PRB play today.","The RRC pad also produced the first barrels of oil down on new oil gathering pipeline over the weekend. We have initiated construction of our first in-fill production facility which will continue to drive costs down and promote efficiency. A majority of our 2019 drilling program will be near that new CPF, which is also the highest oil portion of the tunnel play.","On the gas side of our operations, Chesapeake continues to generate significant free cash flow from the Marcellus shale. We achieved a record daily gross production level of 2.5 BCF a day in January, which resulted in a record average net production of 948 million cubic feet of gas per day during the first quarter. Appropriate spacing, enhanced completions and longer laterals continue to be game changers in the Marcellus.","Given our continued improved well performance and our commitment to a disciplined capital expenditure program, we plan to drop a rig in Marcellus in June, combined with the planned decrease in drilling activity in Haynesville, this means we anticipate averaging only three rigs in our gas asset for the second half of the year, although one of these drops was contemplated in the original budget plan. As stated earlier, the Marcellus capital would be redeployed to the Powder River.","Our field development program continues to impress in the Haynesville yielding results, highlighted by two recent two well pad with initial flow back results exceeding 80 million cubic feet a day. While we drop a rig from Haynesville this month, the team remains focused on optimizing base production and increasing our competitiveness by driving additional costs out of our operations.","And finally, in the Midcon, we are taking a pause to review and interpret newly acquired 3D data which we will use to help high-grade our drilling inventory in anticipation of an increased activity next year.","As we look towards the rest the year, we will maintain our focus on capital discipline while continuing to allocate majority of our capital to our oil assets, which we believe will drive substantial improved in margins in 2019. The momentum we have established quarter-over-quarter continues to grow and we look forward to continued program delivery.","With that, I will turn the teleconference over to Nick to review our financial performance.","Domenic Dell'Osso","Thanks Frank and good morning everyone. Compared to street estimates, we had an excellent first quarter in almost every measures. Our trend of generating higher margins continues, primarily driven by strong oil production that Doug and Frank highlighted, increased oil as a percentage of total production and lower operating expenses, which resulted in the best adjusted EBITDAX margin per BOE production we have recorded in over four years.","As Doug highlight, our production stream for the first quarter was 22% oil, compared to 19% in the 2018 fourth quarter and 17% oil a year ago. While the first quarter is traditionally our highest EBITDAX quarter for the year, it's important to note that margin improvements we are recognizing are not simply a function of the price. Our mix will continue to shift oil throughout 2019 and 2020 as the Powder River Basin, Brazos Valley grow and have a greater contribution to the total.","We expect to exit the year around 26% oil, the margin of this high oil content is meaningful with our oil assets approximately $30 per BOE EBITDAX margin lead by the Brazos Valley reaching over $37 per BOE due to its low structure and access to Gulf Coast premium pricing.","The bottom line result is that while our capital program is lower than last year and commodity prices are currently forecasted to be lower for the full year. Chesapeake will deliver greater cash flow due to our improved oil mix and cost structure.","Our cash operating cost structure improved over the first quarter by approximately $81 million, driven by continued improvement in our GP&T expenses. Our GP&T expense of $6.29 per barrel equivalent was more than $1 per barrel lower than the 2018 average driven by asset sales in 2018 in the midstream and downstream contract restructuring.","In the Powder River we have begun to connect that to our oil gathering system. We estimate this will increase our certainty of delivery, improve our flow back and production management efforts and ultimate lower our oil gathering expense in the field by approximately 75% going forward.","In the Brazos Valley are relatively low GP&T costs are contributing to the improve Company averages and we are working with several third-party midstream and downstream providers to further reduce these costs. We currently expect improvement of over 250 million in our GP&T line item in 2019 over 2018.","As seen in our press release this morning, we moved to the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas properties beginning this quarter. As you would expect the primary changes in our financials when compared to the full cost method are a reduction in reported CapEx with these cost moving the income statement in the form of exploration expense, G&A and interest expense, we will also have an increase in our DD&A rate due to less impairments under the successful efforts method compared to whole cost.","Our 10-Q and 8-K resetting our previously filed 10-K will have additional detail along with the brief presentation, we will post to our website and the changes. Brad or I would be happy to answer any further questions on this accounting change.","As a result, we have updated guidance this morning which moved previously capitalized G&A and interest cost from capital expenditures to the income statement. As a result, we reduced our 2019 CapEx guidance by approximately $200 million to a new range of $2.1 billion to $2.3 billion to 2019. Offset by G&A interest expense in a new line for cash expiration expense.","Importantly given the tailwind of higher oil prices in the quarter along with approximately 100 million of asset sale proceeds closed or pending, we are closing free cash flow gap significantly for the year. On a balance sheets side in early April, we exchanged approximate 884 million of senior notes due 2020 and 2021 for 919 million or new 8% senior notes due 2026.","This maturity extension was very manageable debt maturities in 2020 and 2021of approximately 300 million per year. In April we also repaid a maturity 380 million principal amount of floating senior notes using borrowings under our credit facility.","On the liquidity front as of March 31, we have borrowing capacity of 2.1 billion under our $3 billion Chesapeake credit facility and approximately $565 million under the 1.3 billion Brazos Valley credit facility. We look to attire additional maturities to cash flow generation under smaller asset sale and we look for market conditions that are conducive to refinance maturities.","We have a robust portfolio in place with approximately 70% and 80% of our remaining 2019 oil and natural gas production hedged with downside protection net average prices of $58 and $0.75 per barrel in $2.83 per MCF respectively.","We also have 250 BCF of gas and 13.2 million barrels of oil hedged at $2.75 per barrel per MCF and $60.10 per barrel respectively for 2020. Additionally, we have locked in Gulf Coast pricing for approximately six million barrels of our Eagle Ford for volume at a premium of approximately $5.69 WTI NYMEX pricing.","To close, we are off to a great start in 2019, and are pleased to see our return from capital invested continue to grow, and cash flow continue to improve. Cost savings are being captured and our production is on-track to deliver significantly more oil as we roll into 2020.","Operator. We will now turn the call over for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question will be from John Freeman with Raymond James. Please go ahead.","John Freeman","Good morning guys.","Doug Lawler","Good morning John.","John Freeman","You have made significant progress in a short time on the Brazos Valley and now it looks like you are spending about $40 million less than what your previously thought, you are still going to bring online a couple more wells than previously expected. Can you just give us some color on kind of what is embedded in the current guidance now in terms of where completed well costs are now and if that is reflected and leading edge wells reflected in the current CapEx allocation?","Doug Lawler","Yes sure, John. Frank and I will both comment on that. As you would expect that we are we are super excited about the Brazos Valley asset and we are going into it that with the acquisition and the excellent work that had been done there by WildHorse.","There would be opportunities to take what we have learned elsewhere in our portfolio and apply it to Brazos Valley and particularly with some of the completion efficiency, stage efficiencies and synergies that with our contractors and the way we approach our business could help drive those costs down.","Up to this point in time, as we have shared, we firmly recognize $500,000 per well of which there is a portion of that that is mostly drilling at this point in time, because with what we have been testing with some additional stages and longer laterals, to completion costs probably only represent about 20% to 30% of that 500,000 at this point. That said, we still see a significant opportunity there and I will let Frank comment further on that.","Frank Patterson","John, I just like to point you to Slide 8 in the deck that we put out with the press release today. And we have seen pretty substantial lateral length increase, which was our plan. Historically, the lateral lengths were around 5000 to 6000 feet. We are pushing those lateral lengths out to somewhere around 9200 to 9300 feet for the year.","We are way ahead of schedule on that. Our costs are coming down on a preferred basis about 20% as you can see on that and then Doug said, we are still working with the completion design. But the big game changer is that the kind of Chesapeake Energy methodology of getting stages put away. We have seen a 60% increase on stage count per day.","If you look at Eagle Ford wells, you are probably looking at that range of 7.4 million to eight million this year. We think we can get it down a little bit lower than that going forward. We have some things that we want to try to mitigate some whole conditions that we see that causes a little bit of extra time.","And then when we go to the Austin Chalk, those wells require a little bit bigger frac jobs. I would say you are looking at probably an 8.4 to 8.8 types cost there. We are not going to drill a lot of Austin Chalk, 2019 and 2020 will be very focused on Eagle Ford.","John Freeman","Great. And then just want to follow-up, any update on the plans for Brazos Valley gathering system, I know WildHorse is looking at having a system built, and I believe you all mentioned that you are probably going to put that out to bid to third-party sustaining of fleet?","Doug Lawler","Yes. We did in expect to put that out to bid to third-parties relatively thin. We are working through a bunch of logistics and planning for that.","John Freeman","Great. I appreciate it guys.","Doug Lawler","Thanks Joe.","Operator","The next question comes from Biju Perincheril with Susquehanna. Please go ahead.","Biju Perincheril","Hi. Good morning all. Doug, I know you don\u2019t have any 2020 guidance out yet, but looking at the total schedule and the momentum you have in the fourth quarter looks like you have a lot of momentum going into 2020. Can you say anything about how you see the oil production progressing through next year?","Doug Lawler","Yes. Sure. That is a good question Biju. I'm glad you asked it. When we first acquired WildHorse and have been integrating it into our portfolio. We had provided with some certain estimates of what we though rig activity would be and we actually have recognized a lower rig count in response to commodity prices and our pursuit of free cash flow neutrality and generating free cash flow as quickly as possible.","As Nick had highlighted, we anticipate to narrow that gap significantly and look for further improvements in 2019 and so the capital efficiency of program and the rig activity, inclusion activity are largely geared toward how we continue to strengthen the entire Company not looking at just one or single metric.","As that rolls into 2020 though, we are very excited about the efficiencies that we have accomplished and as Frank noted getting more from every rig in terms of capital employed as well as more wells drilled and completed, because of our efficiencies, it\u2019s a historical competitive advantage for this Company and we continue to recognize those improvements and we are using that to help position us greater old lines in 2020.","So, while we have not guidance out yet for 2020, under the revised circumstances that we have recognized with the capital spend and rig activity, we are encouraged about that profile and are 75% or 80% capital directed towards the oil a year asset. You could expect similar level of investment in 2020 and continued growth to that well.","Biju Perincheril","That is very helpful. And my follow-up was, at least looking at where Q1 numbers came in versus what I was modeling. One of the areas of positive surprise was Eagle Ford, legacy Eagle Ford oil and you touched on in the presentations some of the wider spreads well and last quarter I think you talked about a lot of the work you have done on minimizing downtime.","And I was just wondering, if you can just give a broad breakdown of how much of the improvement in Eagle Ford is from the productivity gains on the wells versus minimizing downtime and\u2026","Frank Patterson","So Biju this is Frank. I think it\u2019s really hard to say because as you recall, we went in and did a lot of work on spacing two years ago and determined that the down spacing was really detrimental to the wells. So what we are seeing now as a result of that work, there is actually slide that demonstrates it on Page 13 of our deck.","We have now re-spaced the field to the appropriate spacing for the rock type and the fluid type we believe and we have also changed the completion design for each of those spaces to maximize the recovery from the field.","So if you look at parent wells back when the field was first being developed and use that as a baseline, our new wells are performing at about 95% of parent and we think that is a real positive sign. That gives us early production volumes on the wet wells, but it also reduces the decline rate on those wells and the years.","So we are seeing good performance on the early wells, good performance on the wells once they go into base go into the base and then we are applying a lot of new technology and concepts to manage our downtime.","So it's a combination of all, and I don\u2019t think you can go in discretely break it out. I think what is, is we are doing a really great job in the field and here in the office with the engineering team basically managing this field for optimum results.","Biju Perincheril","Great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question will be from Subash Chandra with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.","Subash Chandra","Yes, thanks. Hey Dough, happy sixth anniversary, this one certainly feels different from the outside. So congrats on the quarter. And when I look at the PRB activity levels and I think you have a few more wells completing this year, curious if that changes the outlook for PRB oil growth which was previously provided.","Doug Lawler","Not at this point in time. Subash we are encouraged, we are excited, some of the activity and the way we have been continuing to optimize the drill schedule with the improvements that we recognized, we are super excited about some of the rage in this path as Frank noted the pad, total pad production here, recent performance is very encouraging.","I would rather look at that and encourage you to look at it, is upside rather than us putting a number on and at this point in time and just ask you to continue to look at the track record as you done of this Company and the trajectory that we are on there. We should see continued improvement and sharing those recent well results in some of the pad volume are good indicators of directionally where we think would be going.","Subash Chandra","Okay, got it. And I\u2019m going to try and jam a few questions in my follow-up. But In Brazos Valley am I thinking about this correctly that you are looking at all these production enhancement, spacing and so on and so forth. So this year it's pretty oil production volumes fairly flat with an eye towards driving growth in 2020, and then if that is paired by lower Marcellus, Haynesville activity that sort of gets you that 30% type oil cuts for next year?","Doug Lawler","Yes, that is essentially correct.","Subash Chandra","Okay, so Brazos, would that require more rig activity to drive that growth beyond what you have or\u2026","Doug Lawler","It's actually the capital efficiencies that we expect to achieve or doing more with less and actually seen capital reductions in that program as noted by the fact that we expect the asset level to be cash flow neutral or slightly positive there this year. So that is more of the indicative direction of how we expect to do more with less based on the capital efficiencies that we are achieving and recognizing.","Frank Patterson","Yes. Subash this is Frank. So just to give you a little bit more color on Brazos Valley. We have been working this a little over 90 days now. Most of the drilling activity was predetermined by the previous operator. So we have been basically taking what was already planned and trying to correct at course to the direction we want to go.","And so we are really not seeing our full on plan yet. We also have not taken the course that we need to take to get our reservoir characterization and our completions tweaked up. That will be happening in the next couple of months.","So on the website, the wells there, the wet wells, we are about where the budget was planned and it's close. We are a little bit behind because of some delays getting off the Austin Chalk wells. But what has been the real surprise is the base production. We have really changed the base production trajectory here.","We think that bodes really well because if we can change the base production, which is a pretty large number and then we can move to the to the type of drilling and completion program we want. We probably can do exactly what we want to do or said we were going to do with five rigs with four rigs and that said I must - a lag on my part right now, but I think it looks really good. So we have not seen this thing hit its efficiency stride yet.","Subash Chandra","Okay. Good color. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Heikkinen with Heikkinen Energy Advisors. Please go ahead.","David Heikkinen","Hey, Frank actually you just set up the question. So basically, you think you will have a 20% plus improvement in well per rig, per year in Brazos Valley kind of heading into next year with that four versus five rigs coming?","Frank Patterson","So David, you know that we are also moving to longer laterals, so the wells - what we are seeing is that with the penetration rate that we have been able to improve, we are getting basically a long lateral for the same time and cost of a short lateral.","And I think that is where we are headed. So yes, that is about a 20% increase if you just think about it that way. I think there is still some room to go. The drilling team is working on some opportunities to potentially change out the wellbore design that could actually give us a little bit more.","But I think the other side of the equation is going to be on the completions. I think we still have room to go there and I think we can optimize this completions. The other thing is, we are not ahead right now, but we will get ahead on the facility side. So this thing will start running a lot faster.","David Heikkinen","So that your cost per foot comes down and essentially you have a long lateral for the time of a short laterals. Okay. I just wanted to make sure that was right. Do you think you'll see the same improvement in the Powder as you get to a scaled program?","Doug Lawler","Yes. I don't think we\u2019ll see the dramatic change you\u2019re going to see in Brazos Valley because we\u2019ve been working the Powder for a couple of years now. We will see improvement. The big improvement on the Powder side I think is going to actually happen on the surface because when we get to the central production facility, and the oil and water gathering system put in place, I think that's going to allow us to really optimize the field development. As we\u2019ve noted in the call, we had some whether delays. It was really -- it snows, and it gets bad in Wyoming. And we're trucking all of our oil and all of our water, and when they shut down the highways, we\u2019re shut in. Once we get on pipe, now we have this consistency of development and production. So, I think we're moving in a really positive direction in Powder, very quickly. We will not see as big an improvement there, because we\u2019ve already seen pretty good improvement.","David Heikkinen","So, don't model winter weather as significant next winter with the gathering? Okay.","Doug Lawler","Yes. The model should be a lot more consistent next year, once we get on pipe. Then the only thing we\u2019ll have is crews and equipment moving to rigs and the completion.","Operator","Next question will be from Neal Dingmann with SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Neal Dingmann","Good morning all. Nice. Great progress, guys. Doug, just, maybe building out a little bit what Biju had asked earlier a little bit. You guys have done a nice job of quickly reducing outstanding even while adding the WildHorse deal. So, I understand, I think Biju had mentioned that not having the full 2020 out. Can you talk more in just broad terms how you envision next year kind of going forward the outspend and thus your leverage. I know you mentioned in prepared remarks trying to get it down two times. So, I guess, it's more about the outspend how -- inflection point that you could talk about next year to getting or anything you\u2019d give around that. Thanks.","Doug Lawler","Yes. Sure, Neal. The progress of the Company in that respect has been really, really strong, as I think anyone would agree attached to the progress we\u2019ve made there has been quite significant and quite substantial. As Nick highlighted, we are narrowing the gap in 2019 and extremely encouraged. We see minimal amount of smaller asset type sales for the productivity improvements. And basically, we're going to cross that bridge pretty quickly being free cash flow neutral and ability to generate greater positive cash flow. In that timeframe, we\u2019ve not been specific. It's highly dependent on price. We continue to put hedges in place to protect our capital program, quality of the assets continue to outperform. And the way to look at it Neal is that it\u2019s very, very close, very, very close. The underlying business here is powerful, strong, and capital efficiencies continue to improve. And as I\u2019ve highlighted before, the accomplishments of this Company over the past five years compare to no other. And what you can expect is that is this challenge of our debt reduction and achieving 2 times net debt-to-EBITDA continues to be a major focus for us; it\u2019s essentially our number one priority. And we will continue to make progress on it.","And, the way that we are approaching is through the excellent work being done with our current assets and looking for other smaller asset sales, or other opportunities for us to strengthen our portfolio, to continue to achieve that free cash flow neutrality, generate positive free cash flow and reduce that overall quantum of debt.","Neal Dingmann","Okay. And then, one last one, just looking at the PRB, obviously amazing well, that Turner well you all spoke of the 4,000 with not only the big rates, 75% oil. So looking at slide 16, maybe Doug for you or Frank, give me a sense of when you all now look at your 213,000 acres just the type of prospects you see as far as -- I mean, are there -- just trying to get a sense of, is there a large areas that can continue to have these phenomenal type wells or now that we\u2019ve seen -- again, not only the size but just the oil cut behind that. I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019re looking the entire play.","Frank Patterson","Yes, Neal. This is Frank. If you look at that map on 16, we put a star out there where the central production facility is. That\u2019s all kind of northwestern portion of the field is high oil cut. As you get down into the meat of our acreage around that CPF, those wells are going to be big wells. Now, are they all going to be 4,000 barrels a day? No. We're seeing some variability, but there are really strong wells. And when you take a look at them relative to other oil wells in the U.S., the Turner wells stack out pretty high in that stack. So, I think you\u2019re going to see us spend a majority of our time out on that northwest part of the field. We will only drill a few wells over in kind of the gassier area to maintain acreage because there is also Niobrara and Mowry available to us in that acreages as well. We don\u2019t want to lose the acreage. The map is really deceiving and I hadn\u2019t put a scale on here. But, we have a huge, huge acreage position here and it\u2019s all contagious. And so we have a lot of running room here in the Turner left, but, I\u2019m really, really excited about getting into the Nio as well because now we we\u2019ll be able to stack to Nio right on top of that Turner.","The other thing, don\u2019t forget that we may see something better than 4,000 barrels equivalent a day. So, it\u2019s just why we talk about the excitement around that well, the continued improvement and say, are you going to stamp every well at 4,000? Well, you are going to have variability naturally, but we're excited enough and encouraged enough, there may be something better than that. So, don\u2019t take that out of the equation either.","Operator","The next question will be from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice. Please go ahead.","Charles Meade","Could you go back to that Brazos Valley, could you elaborate a little bit more on what led you to go with this different completion design with lower fluid volumes and higher sand concentration? And I guess, is this an experiment or is this -- I guess it is experiment but is this close to what you think your final design is going to be and when are we going to know, or when will you know if you struck on the right design?","Doug Lawler","Yes. I\u2019ll just it\u2019s all days work at Chesapeake, Charles. I mean, it\u2019s everything we look at, it\u2019s continued improvement and how we get better and how we take our learnings from elsewhere to the new asset. And this -- the way we -- basically the same concentrations, roughly the same, what we\u2019ve principally reduced with the fluid. And we're going to continue to optimize and pull the levers that we know will be successful and what we\u2019ve learned elsewhere. And Frank can build on that.","Frank Patterson","Yes. Charles, I think, when we talk to you and everybody on the call about this acquisition, one of the things we said was that this spacing needed to be spaced out wider to about 1,000 feet. We have now gone in and done a bunch of looking at wells. And what -- it appears is that you need the sand concentration because the clay content is higher in this rock, and we knew that. WildHorse had done a fantastic job discerning that. But, what was happening was, there was a ton of fluid being pumped in every stage. And what that was causing was really long frack wings, and those frack wings were reaching out and basically interfering with each other. What we've done is, we've used the same sand content or the same sand amount but at higher concentration, pumping it away with a lot less fluid. That does a couple of things for us. One, it increases the complexity near the well bore and shortens those frack wings. So, we might actually be able to see a spacing change, once we understand the storage capacity here. But the other thing about it that's really important is, these wells took a ton of time to flow back because of the water that was being used. And so, we're going to be able to reduce the cost of pumping the jobs, because less water, we're going to have shorter flowback period, and we're going to have a stronger earlier oil cut.","So, everything we've done, I think is going to maximize or improve the economics of the wells. Are we at the end game here? No. We probably have some other things we can work on. But, this is a really, really good start. And we're encouraged by what we're seeing on the initial tests. ","Charles Meade","That's great detail, Frank. Thank you. And then, if I could ask a follow-up on your -- I guess your CapEx and your overall portfolio. Doug, you mentioned you have about 75% to 80% of your CapEx going to oily plays. But on the other side of that, you guys have really core -- center of the bulls eye positions in really the two dry gas plays that are really working right now the Haynesville and Marcellus. And there have been some news reports in the last few days of like Saudi Aramco trying to team up with Equinor to get into the North American natural gas market. So, could you talk about how you see those two dry gas plays at Haynesville and Marcellus, what role they're going to play in your portfolio -- not in 2019 but in 2020 and beyond?","Doug Lawler","Sure, Charles. Those two assets are world class, and you got a world class operator that can mobilize, develop those resources really quickly. And we'll continue to monitor pricing environment. The LNG build-out and as more gaskets on the water as additional demand makes sense and economically makes sense, then Chesapeake will react accordingly and adjust the program accordingly. So, they\u2019re super strong assets, extremely well-run here in corporately and particularly in the field. And we can revise and modify and flex our capital at any point time as economic conditions dictate.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to return the conference to Doug Lawler for any closing remarks.","Doug Lawler","Yes. Thank you. I appreciate everyone's time today. In our prepared comments, we made several references to rate of change or rate of improvement. And I just want to close today by highlighting that the underlying business continues to see excellent progress. And while we have accomplished a great deal over the past few years, the portfolio, the capital allocation and how we are approaching our business, the excitement that we have and the encouragement that we have to continue the rate of change and rate of improvement across our portfolio is something that we are really, really pleased about and really excited about. And I think it's differential. And I believe that, the Company's performance continues to reflect a well-run organization and one that's going to deliver more value to our shareholders disproportionately in the future. So, I thank you for everyone's time. And if there is additional questions, please follow up with Brad and we\u2019ll respond accordingly.","Operator","Thank you, sir.

Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Brad Sylvester. Please go ahead, sir.","Brad Sylvester","Good morning everyone and thank you for joining our call today to discuss Chesapeake's financial and operational results for the 2018 full year and fourth quarter. Hopefully, you've had a chance to review our press release and the updated investor presentations that we posted to our website this morning.","During this morning's call, we will be making forward-looking statements which consist of statements that cannot be confirmed by reference to existing information, including statements regarding our beliefs, goals, expectations, forecasts, projections, and future performance, the benefits of our transaction with WildHorse Resource Development Corporation, the expected timing for the transaction, and the assumptions underlying such statements.","Please note that there are a number of factors that will cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements, including the factors identified and discussed in our earnings release today and in other SEC filings. Please recognize that except as required by applicable law, we undertake no duty to update any forward-looking statements, and you should not place undue reliance on such statements.","We may also refer to some non-GAAP financial measures, which help facilitate comparisons across periods and with peers. For any non-GAAP measures we use, a reconciliation to the nearest corresponding GAAP measure can be found on our website and in our earnings release.","With me on the call today are Doug Lawler, Nick Dell'Osso, Frank Patterson, and Jason Pigott. Doug will begin the call, and then turn the call over to Nick for a review of our financial results, before we turn the teleconference over for Q&A.","So, with that, thank you. And I will now turn the teleconference over to Doug.","Doug Lawler","Thank you, Brad and good morning everyone. Chesapeake has delivered another strong year of operational and financial performance, a year defined by improvements in every aspect of our business. The investment thesis for Chesapeake Energy continues to grow, as we advance our strategies of reducing leverage, achieving sustainable positive free cash flow and enhancing our margins.","The WildHorse Resource Development acquisition and the Utica divestiture are excellent examples of our progress and provide further momentum in our competitive transformation. Just want to take a second and note the key attributes of our robust diverse portfolio and our business delivery capability. These attributes include three powerful oil assets with significant inventory and premium pricing. Two of these, the PRB and the WildHorse assets will drive 2019 absolute oil growth of 32% or 50% when adjusted for asset sale.","Two world class gas assets with more than 27 net trillion cubic feet of gas resources geographically positioned to supply global LNG growth for decades to come. Significant exploitation and exploration acreage for further value creation and\/or monetization, industry-leading capital efficiency amongst our large independent peers, industry leading cash cost amongst our large independent peers, radically improving mid-stream obligations and cost, non-price related margin improvements driven by oil growth and cash cost leadership, significant deleveraging progress and improved credit ratings, industry-leading experience and expertise to further optimize and deploy new technologies are further enhancing recovery and development efficiencies. Importantly, our commitment to safety excellence and environmental stewardship that has produced outstanding results.","From a challenging starting point five years ago, we began our transformation goal of becoming a top-performing unconventional E&P company. And we have made sequential improvement unmatched by our peers. I'm very pleased with our progress toward this goal and the momentum we have established as a direct indicator of future performance.","Chesapeake's focus on increasing oil production is yielding impressive result, materially accelerating our strategic priorities. Led by a 78% increase in net oil volumes from the Powder River Basin, we delivered 10% adjusted oil growth in 2018, while improving price realization and importantly lowering absolute cash cost, we ultimately recorded the higher earnings and EBITDA generated per bill of oil equivalent since 2014, when oil averaged $90 a barrel and gas averaged more than $4 per cubic foot.","Accordingly, 2018 adjusted net income was $818 million of $0.90 per diluted share. I'm especially pleased that we are able to accomplish these results while once again delivering industry-leading health, safety, environmental and regulatory performance across our company. The acquisition of WildHorse assets now designated as our Brazos Valley business unit greatly enhances Chesapeake's oil growth platform, providing further profitability, flexibility and optionality to our diverse deep portfolio.","Through the Utica divestiture, we reduced our net debt by $1.8 billion and I'm pleased that in total we eliminated $2.6 billion of secured debt last year. The new Brazos Valley business unit team is aggressively attacking numerous opportunities to drive capital efficiencies across the value chain. Through a combination of operational improvements and supply chain savings, the team has already identified, implemented and negotiated $200,000 to $350,000 per well in capital savings within the first month of taking over operations.","I have high confidence we will see further capital savings on a per well basis as the year progresses. In addition, we have made early cycle time improvement through increased drilling penetration range and a two-stage per day increase by the completions team. Further, the Burleson Sand Mine recently commenced operations in February 2019 and is anticipated to yield additional savings to the company's completions program.","As noted in our earnings release, at todays' strip pricing, we expect our cash flow to be meaningfully stronger in 2019. Capital efficiencies and cash cost leadership will remain our central focus serving as a recognized competitive advantage while we further reduce our legacy debt and realize non-price related margin improvements. We have decreased our absolute production costs each year since 2013 and anticipate reducing our cash cost an additional 3.5% in 2019.","In addition to driving cost out of our operations, we continue to develop innovative technology solutions to drive value and improve operating results. For example in the Eagle Ford South Texas area we implemented a new digital field technology solution to reduce downtime across the field. As a result, Chesapeake recorded a 17% reduction in controllable down volumes per day in 2018, which equated to an additional 1,100 barrels of oil sold every day. We are currently expanding the use of this technology to other fields and expect to have it implemented across all business units by mid-year.","Financial discipline has been a pillar of Chesapeake's business strategy since we began our transformation. And simply put, Chesapeake will continue to deliver more with less in 2019. This starts with keeping our capital expenditures relatively flat while still delivering significant oil growth.","We are relentlessly driving towards achieving our strategic priorities of delivering further debt reduction, enhancing margins and reaching sustainable free cash flow. Our 2,300 employees are highly motivated, empowered and energized to further improve our operations and financial position in 2019 to take full advantage of our strengths and thrive in any commodity price environment. Our momentum is building and we're excited to share our continued progress with you as we move through the year.","I'll now pass the call to Nick.","Domenic J. Dell'Osso, Jr.","Thank you, Doug, and good morning everyone. Our accomplishments in the fourth quarter and full year of 2018 were outstanding, focused on increasing margins and cash flow, the greater oil production is working and we continue to improve our balance sheet.","Starting with balance sheet, we used proceeds from Utica sale to repurchase debt ending the year with $8.2 billion of debt outstanding that was nearly $10 billion at the end of 2017. Additionally we refinanced our 2015 term loans as unsecured debt. The combined balance sheet improvements reduced earning expense by approximately $150 million annually and we're pleased about this in our recent credit rating upgrades.","Operating cost structure tightened again in 2018 with a $78 million or 3% reduction in combined G&A, GP&T and cost expenses. These improvements led to higher profitability per barrel and better free cash flow for asset sales than we have had in many years. Further, these changes are related to shifts in our asset portfolio and other permanent reductions to our cost structure, they are sustainable and along in the high \u2013 much higher mix of our total production coming from oils, as further synchronization further increases our profitability per barrel equivalent in 2019.","Despite commodity prices forecast to be lower across the board for 2019 on the NYMEX strip in response to 2018. In 2019, approximately 75% of our D&C CapEx will be directed to our higher margin and higher return on oil assets, in our PRB, Brazos Valley and Eagle Ford assets, while total planned capital expenditures are relatively flat with 2018. [indiscernible] decrease in our oil growth and oil mix percentage. Our operating capital expenditure for 2019 will be $200 million lower year-over-year, primarily due to the improvement in GP&T cost of $1.10 per barrel equivalent, particularly offset by LOE and G&A. The biggest driver of GP&T improvement is the sales of the Utica assets, but we are also seeing improvement in several other basins.","In the PRB, we've contracted with a third part to have an oil gathering system built at a very competitive rate. And the addition to the Brazos Valley barrels to the portfolio improve the average rate with their relatively low gathering and transport cost.","After years of being a significant drag on our profitability, our GP&T cost are forecasted to be $6.25 per barrel equivalent at the midpoint for 2019 which is highly competitive with the peer group. We expect further improvements in this line item in future periods at both PRB and Brazos Valley assets should continue to see opportunities for increased GP&T cost efficiencies as volumes grow. We also expect to see improved realized pricing, as we gain access to better markets through the year and into 2020.","On the liquidity front, we amended and restated our $3 billion revolving credit facility in third quarter, extending its maturity to 2023 at effectively the same terms. Additionally, we assume the $1.3 billion WildHorse credit facility and we've chosen to lead the WildHorse credit facility in bonds outstanding for the time being in an unrestricted subsidiary in Brazos Valley Longhorn, mean the Brazos Valley legal entity and assets do not support Chesapeake debt and vice-versa.","At the closing of the transaction, we had approximately $2.1 billion of liquidity on the Chesapeake credit facility and $575 million available on the Brazos Valley facility. We have a robust hedge portfolio in place, as we enter 2019 with more than 60% of our forecast oil natural gas and NGL production revenue hedged at strip prices, including more than 55% and 80% of our forecasted 2019 oil and natural gas production at averages of $57.12 per barrel and $2.85 per Mcf, respectively. Lastly, we've hedged about 7 million barrels of our Eagle Ford volumes at a premium of approximately $6 per barrel to WTI NYMEX pricing.","We also continue to enjoy a significant improvement in our average realized Marcellus basis and we believe in-basin pricing for our Marcellus gas will continue to improve year-over-year. The transformation of Chesapeake over the past five has been significant and is accelerating. As previously mentioned, we look forward to relaying our progress to you in the coming quarters.","With that, I will turn the call over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you very much. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from David Heikkinen, Heikkinen Energy Advisors.","David Heikkinen","Good morning guys and thanks for taking my question. And congratulations on all the hard work on the GP&T side. I know that was a big task and you all made a heck of lot of progress. Thinking about the integration of the WildHorse assets and then your comments on improving downtime on your base Eagle Ford, improving well cost, kind of curious about Burleson Sand Mine cost per well, but just how are you thinking about through the year, as you turn on those wells as a component of the total TIL schedule, like what's the \u2013 how do you integrate those assets and then what's \u2013 how do those wells get turned online as well? I'm just trying to think about that path of improving your integration.","Doug Lawler","Thanks Dave. I'll kick it off. We all have a tremendous amount of energy around what we see in Brazos Valley business unit and what the team is doing with that integration. As you would expect, we've put some really talented folks on that attacking that whole value chain, and we're super excited on what we see. We've been working really close along the time prior to closing of what we actually would put in place and what we see on the drilling and completion side is immediate opportunity and service related cost as well as supply chain synergy as we integrate it into the Chesapeake machine. And before I hand it Frank and Jason, I'll just comment that the hallmark, most notable quality in this company has been our operating expertise and experience with many years and many wells of knowing what to do and how to integrate these assets. So, I'll pass to these guys to share more with you.","Frank Patterson","Dave, this is Frank. We're pretty excited about what we're seeing to be honest with you. We had a relatively conservative model going into the acquisition. We're actually outperforming on a production side both in the fourth quarter and in the first two months of this year. But the more exciting things that we're seeing, we thought we could get to longer laterals late in the year, but we're actually going to be able to start moving the longer laterals much, much earlier. We're seeing good response to a few very minor tweaks to TIL management and artificial lift. Everything we thought we were going to be able to see we're seeing it actually earlier, so we're pretty excited about that.","The other thing that's really interesting is WildHorse have been pushing the Austin Chalk to the south what we have done in Washington county which is a very gas prone area. But we had identify some area north of the field that looked very oil prone. There is now two wells in the ground and falling back in the northern part, that looks good and as well as we model them, if not better than we modeled them, really good deliverability, good oil cut, pretty low gas cut. So, everything we're seeing is really exciting. We have a lot of work to do. We're not going to kind of flag and say this was \u2013 we're there year. But that is \u2013 I think what you are going to see is our pace is going to accelerate there.","So, we're cautiously optimistic that that's going to be a lot better than we thought. The sand mine is up and running. It started in February, we're running about 2,000 to 2,300 tons a day which is about half of our needs. And definitely we'll be up to our full needs somewhere in the next four to six weeks. So, things are going good on the ground there. Great team in the field that came along with the asset. Really proud of those guys. They are really knocking it out of park. Lot of good changes, lot off positive changes. With that, we have a lot of other opportunities and I'd like Jason kind of describe that \u2013 our base optimization opportunities.","Jason Pigott","Yes. I'll pick first on just some of the \u2013 we talked about the capital savings and I think that's one of the keys to this asset is we operate in multiple basins, we've been able to source the whole Brazos Valley team with existing people that we had. We didn't have to go out to the street and hire. So, we've brought in some of our best people to this asset and they were able to hit the ground running. And when our drilling team, and they were able to change up mud systems which equates to $30,000. They changed bottom-hole assembly which were at $30,000. They used supply chain and rebid some of the daily rentals which add up to $60,000. So, they are just attacking every aspect of the business to get these big changes.","On the completion side, one of the frac spread came up for renewal, we saw huge decrease in the cost of that, which is almost $200,000 on that one crew that will be running out there as well as transportation expenses on sand. I mean that's one thing we haven't really advertised a whole lot of, but we've been silently decoupling sand and it's proving to be a major advantage for us. We're going to go from pumping 5 billion pounds of sand in 2018 to pumping 8 billion of sand in 2019. So, really attacking those smaller parts of the supply and that's a big portion of our saving, and it's not just for this asset, it's across the business. We're going to save almost a $100 million on gross basis just in sand alone.","So, those huge for us and we're really excited about bringing more and more to the Brazos. We've only done parts of wells right now. We've only drilled out some plugs, we've only frac the well. We haven't drilled and completed a whole well there. So, when we get the whole system working together, we're really excited about that.","On the basin, of the digital revolution we've been talking about sometimes that's just seen as a buzzword, but for us it's real. We've been focused on as putting mobile technology in our operators hand and we've designed some software that is fit for them, plus its part of our culture change. We think about one Chesapeake and so it's both the office and the field trying to optimize base performance every day and our real focus is trying to get the maximum amount of cash flow up and by focusing on that we're really improved both the base performance and our EBITDA from the base by just attacking with a complete team.","David Heikkinen","That's helpful. And then just on the TIL schedule, you had the 33 wells in the third quarter, is there a large pad, is there some spacing test or is there something going on with the kind of the steady 15 to 18 wells every other quarter in the Brazos Valley, then you bump up to 33 here, that's just \u2013 that's timing of completion?","Doug Lawler","Dave, I think that's just timing of completions. We're going to pad development in Brazos and so, it's just the way it's going to fall out to be honest with you I think that there is an opportunity to move those TILs around and accelerate some of those. We just don't want to take too big of a bite. The teams are still getting their hands around how fast we can move.","David Heikkinen","That make sense. I just didn't \u2013 that's helpful. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Neal Dingmann, SunTrust.","Neal Dingmann","Good morning guys. Doug, I guess just you know in light of your forecast with the \u2013 you know basing in my model show just a slight outspend in current, given the notable improvement you show in EBITDA per BOE, could you just talk about how you next sort of envision your future free cash flow?","Doug Lawler","Sure, we've been very clear with our message out there that the focus on achieving sustainable positive free cash flow is a key priority for us and we've indicated that given the divestiture of the Utica and as we ramp up activity in WildHorse and further ramp up the activity in the Powder, that we will be in a slight overspend in 2019 and obviously with the strength of this portfolio and the strength of our assets, we have a number of opportunities that we will be evaluating to close that gap this year. I fully anticipate that we will through continued efficiency in our operations, better capital performance, smaller assets sales, that we will close that gap in 2019 and organically be in position through our EBITDA generation to be in a sustainable situation if that's closed 2020 going forward. So, heavily dependent upon commodity price. As you are aware, we're in a good position with our hedging for 2019 and we \u2013 while we see a slight over spend this year, we are extremely focused on it and underlying business is performing to deliver that sustainable free cash flow.","Domenic J. Dell'Osso, Jr.","This is Nick, I'll just add that when Doug talked about it being sustainable, that's really the key to us. And so, what we've been trying to do the last couple of years and are very close to now, especially in light of having completed the acquisition is to get our cash flow to a level that we can generate, and that's internally \u2013 internally generated funds to run our capital program and grow and do all of that in the free cash flow within free cash flow. And so, what we are very focused on is that, when we get there, we will be able to stay there and not have relatively short term phenomenon of being free cash flow that really impairs future growth or puts us in a position where we have to incur a longer-term outspend to satisfy an offsetting decline to stay at a reasonable level of cash flow and EBITDA.","It's really important to us that what we're doing is value generating to our investors, and being free cash flow in the short-term, without being able to actually return cash to shareholders or growth future cash flow is not going to generate value to shareholders. We're going to structure this in a way that when we get to a free cash flow positive position, we're generating values to shareholders either through returning that cash or continuing to grow the cash flow available to shareholders, and that's what we're focused on.","Neal Dingmann","Great add Nick, and then just my follow-up is just on infrastructure. It certainly appears you've added a significant amount of infrastructure to your two key assets, the PRB and the Brazos Valley. Could, one of you'll talk about how these infrastructure improvements will boost, how you look at that, how it will improve the growth in these areas? Thank you.","Domenic J. Dell'Osso, Jr.","Yeah, so those are two pretty exciting areas for us. When it comes to infrastructure, so in the Powder, as I've said in my notes, we have contracted for the build out of an oil gathering system that we're really excited about. It's going to take all of our oil on pipe all the way to Guernsey. From Guernsey there is a number of different options. We have to get to end markets and we'll evaluate all of those options. At the moment there is plenty of transportation at reasonable prices, we can get good access to Cushing and we're seeing pretty reasonable differentials. There was a period of time there December, January where differentials got pretty wide, but it was bleeding, and so we're going to be pretty focused on what the long-term solution there is that is likely to yield for us and improvement in real-life pricing. So, we're really pleased with the way that gathering system is going to be built out and then the access to markets we will have from the off-take point of that gathering system, because it has the potential to be a real advantage to us.","And the Brazos Valley, that asset being relatively new has relied on trucking for most of its production up to this point. The WildHorse team was in the early stages was getting ready to start building a gathering system. We will pick that up where they left off obviously and determine whether or not to put that out to bid, it's likely we will put that out to bid for third parties to build a gathering system for us there. So, we think that can reduce the cost of trucking out of the system, and once we get on pipe, we believe we can get to premium markets and have some optionality between Houston and Corpus and a number of places where we already have good relationships with marketers to get very good pricing.","As you can see our Eagle Ford gets a great price and we believe we can expose the Brazos Valley barrels to a similar pricing structure over time. I'll tell you right now in our forecast, we don't have those barrels forecasted to receive the same kind of price that our Eagle Ford barrels do, because we don't yet have them tied into the pipe systems that will deliver those prices to us. We'll close that gap we believe relatively soon. So, look for there to be uplift in the realized pricing on those barrels over time.","Neal Dingmann","Thanks for the details.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Charles Meade, Johnson Rice.","Charles Meade","Good morning, Doug to you and your whole team there. I wanted to ask about the Marcellus, and in particular I find it intriguing that you guys hit a record gross production rate up there in January, and I think it's probably not coincidental that comes with \u2013 you know some of the strongest local pricing we've seen up there in a few years. So, I wanted to explore, is that a coincidence or is it connected and to what extent do you guys have metaphorically a dial that you can turn up there to deliver extra volumes whether through accelerate completions or added compression or anything along those lines to the extent that strong local pricing continues?","Doug Lawler","Thanks Charles. The Marcellus as you know Frank and I we'll both have something to say about this. Frank and I have worked assets across the globe and this Marcellus asset is absolutely unbelievable and it's unbelievable in its productivity and its efficiency. The team are attacking it really, really well. And I think that as you look at the macro and the opportunity for global LNG growth and the opportunity to deliver that gas and get it on the water, it is perfectly positioned with this huge resource potential. And I'll just let Frank fill in the blanks there a little bit, because it's just \u2013 we could not be more excited about that world-class asset.","Frank Patterson","Charles, so the teams across the entire company have been relentlessly attacking the base and Marcellus is a great example of that. We're in the process and have been in the process of doing a lot of pad compression to continue to fill the base in. But then on top of that, the drilling and completion team and reservoir team have been working through spacing, making sure our spacing is adequate which we've spaced out relative to some of the offset operators. That and we've also been able to start drilling longer wells. We actually just landed this week our first 15,000 plus foot well. You have seen in the last few weeks, we've come out and talked about the JOEGUSWA wells, they were really high flow rates. I'll give you a real quick update on that. The JOEGUSWA well that had a IP of around 73 million a day in 90-days online has already made 3.4 Bcf, the one that had the 62 million a day has been online for 84 days and has already made 3.9 Bcf. These are horses. And we think we can replicate that across a lot of the field. So, what we're basically doing is making sure that we have the gas available and market opens up and I guess Nick can talk to you a little bit about some of the opportunities to expand the market.","Domenic J. Dell'Osso, Jr.","Yes, so we're pretty excited about what we're seeing up there in terms of market access to other pipes that have come online and certainly lifted the pricing for our in-basin pricing points and we have better confidence in those to the shoulder in summer seasons. We've also seen in the summer demand has just been stronger in the last couple of years and certainly we have some good hot summers, but there is clearly more \u2013 gas has more of a share of power demand in the summer than in years prior and we think that still playing out. We did sign a transaction last year that we previously discussed, and I think it got some publicity this week from the counterparty that we are going to deliver starting in late 2020 or early 2021 to a local LNG facility that will ultimately export that LNG into the Caribbean markets. We are really excited about that transaction and we've been approached by many others who are trying to figure out how to get access to Northeast gas and deliver it to offshore markets. With that transaction, we put in place a pricing structure that we see is pretty favorable. Having a floor to that in-basin pricing and it does have some upside sharing mechanisms associated with it as well.","So there is a lot to do there and the access continues to open up. We also see that we have a lot of discipline around how we grow production. That incremental transaction that I was just discussing will give us an opportunity to modesty grow our ceiling on production. But beyond that, we have a pretty good feel for what the market can absorb and we don't deliver above that. And I think you've seen many of our peers in the Northeast talk about moderating growth rates up there as well, which effectively everyone can see at what point they begin to overrun the market with excess supply. And we are getting better at understanding what the market needs in delivering those needs as opposed to over delivering. So I feel better about the pricing available to us in access to market in the Northeast. And I think there is a good opportunity for that to have a steady growth rate over the next several periods.","Charles Meade","Got it. That's helpful detail guys. And Frank, perhaps this is for you. I noticed you guys in the PRB still running all five rigs, folks on the Turner. Is there any change in the thinking about when you are going to test others zones about the prospectivity of zones \u2013 other zones or just anything in that regard, any change from what you guys have talked about in the last six months?","Doug Lawler","Charles, we are still batting around how do we get to those next zones. Powder is so good that it's hard to pull rigs off to that. We will be drilling some and completing some Niobrara wells in 2019. I think that's probably the next big play to work through. So we may end up moving rigs around and maybe potentially bring in another rig for a small period of time there, but we'll stay within the capital plan that we already have discussed. We'll just have to manage that though our portfolio, but yes, I want to get to the Niobrara. I want to get to some of these other zones faster than we are today. It's just really hard to check with the turnaround of the queue, but we are getting faster on the Turner. Our costs are coming down on the Turner. We are learning a lot about the Turner. It's really a play that, I think once we get it into development modes, it's going to be a real, real key play for us.","Charles Meade","Thanks, Brian.","Operator","Thank you very much. Our next question will come from Brian Singer, Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer","Thank you. Good morning. As you seek to get to that free cash flow inflection and stay there that you mentioned. How do you see your decline rates involving? Where do you see that decline rate now and how is that changing let say yearend or 2020? Is that a major play strategically that when you talk about getting there and staying there?","Doug Lawler","That's a good question, Brian. The decline rate is something that we are very strongly focused on corporately. As you know with the significant number of wells we have across the country that we see excellent opportunity there and that's what really driving a lot of these base optimization initiatives, including the new technology of what we described in our prepared comments. And our focus there on base optimization and how those technologies can help to offset that decline is something that's real important to our future profitability. The base decline for the company is really is unchanged. It hasn't really changed for the past few years. You're going to continue to see approximately 30% decline per year, and in that 30% we expect the capital program and those efficiency to deliver greater volumes and greater margin improvement, so that's going to help our free cash flow position. And as we look for ways to capture these technologies that help add to the base.","So I think that when you talk about decline, you are talking about a function of the rock. And we understand a lot of rock really well. And through opportunities such as IOR in South Texas, which we're super excited about, and all the initial technical evaluation that we have that we're thinking about, there could be several hundred, if not thousands of well of opportunity there with IOR and to further enhance our recovery from the base and add additional value. And as you think about just the existing base and what we are doing with using these technologies across other assets, I expect to see really good value from that. So there really, really is a lot of opportunity, but we don't see the base decline in the \u2013 from the rock perspective technically changing, it's how we are going about with our additional optimization operations that will help to improve that and add further value to our free cash flow.","Brian Singer","Thanks helpful. And then I had a follow-up to, I think with David Heikkinen question earlier with regards to the TIL schedule. From a total company perspective, you have that on Slide 5, showing that step-up in Q3. And I wondered if trajectory of your CapEx by quarter matches the trajectory of a TIL schedule or if there is a \u2013 if the TIL schedule lagged to the actual CapEx i.e. should third quarter be the high from a CapEx perspective and second quarter be the low?","Doug Lawler","I mean, I think obviously the capital is going to be a function of the activity and I don't see it in the third quarter to be in a drastic change because keep in mind a lot of drilling and completion capital being stand across the first, second and third quarter. The turn-in-line schedules are more reflective of when we'll see initial production. So, it will likely be high for the year in the third quarter, but I wouldn't read anything into that. And just remember that the capital discipline focus we have, Brian is really strong as we proved in the past.","Brian Singer","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you very much. Our next question will come from Arun Jayaram, JPMorgan.","Arun Jayaram","Good morning. I do have a follow-up to David's question on the integration of the WildHorse assets. So I was wondering if you could give us perhaps some expectations for the asset in 2019 current rates and what you expect to deliver over the course of the year along with CapEx.","Doug Lawler","Yeah, Arun. So right now, we entered the year basically relatively flat to what was going on at the end of the year. First two quarters look strong. WildHorse had added some wells on the front \u2013 in the front end of the year or end of last year and the beginning of this year down in that Washington County gas asset area that are strong wells, but there not as strong oil. So oil is going to be a pretty flat going into the first and second quarter, but then it's going to start to take off because we will move all the rigs into Eagle Ford in Austin Chalk. So you're going to see a very focused effort on driving oil volumes in this asset going into the second quarter, third and fourth quarter. So we are going to start to see the oil ramp up as we go through the year.","Arun Jayaram","Great. And I just had one housekeeping question for Nick. Nick, if we look at the 4Q numbers relative to the street. Your EBITDA was about 5% above consensus, yet cash flow look like it lagged. So, I was just wondering if there is anything unusual in the cash flow line item that could explain that variance and as well I'd like to get your thoughts Nick. And when you think the company would reach a cash flow inflection point assuming strip pricing?","Domenic J. Dell'Osso","So I'll answer the second question first. Cash flow inflection point and strip pricing, we are pretty focused on getting through 2019 to have a higher level of production in there for cash flow, higher level of profitability which is what we've laid out today. And position ourselves for a much better answer in cash flow in 2020. As Doug noted before, there is a lot of dependence on commodity prices there, but at the strip we feel pretty good about that as we sit today. On the fourth quarter, the delta between EBITDA and cash flow, everybody's model is a little bit different. And as we looked at that ahead of the call, we really didn't see any significant driver that maybe hedged mark-to-market up, a few other things like that, but happy to spend more time with you after the call digging through any of that. We did not see a consistent driver across the street on that.","Arun Jayaram","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Thank you very much. Our last question will come from Jason Wrangler, Imperial Capital.","Jason Wrangler","Good morning. Just had one and you talked about in the release of dropping one rig in the Haynesville and I think you're speaking about in the Powder River looking at maybe picking up a rig. Just as you have the rig laid out now, do you think that's a pretty fair assessment of how we should look at it both of 2019 and going beyond that?","Frank Patterson","Jason, this is Frank. We continually manage our capital allocation and we move the capital to the best opportunities within the company. So this is our plan as we see it today. We went to one rig in Gulf Coast. We have a lot of locations there to drill. It's a great asset. It just happens to be an asset that that has one of the higher activation costs in today's commodity debt. So we are slowing down a little bit there. We're going to kind of keep a steady pace in Marcellus and I think you'll see us do that continually as long as the market is there for us. That's a really capital efficient asset. In that it doesn't take as many wells to keep our production flat as a lot of other assets because the rock which is so good. When we look at our oil assets, we could move rigs around between the oil assets depending on where we see the best value in a given year. So what we laid out for you here is our initial plan. I think it's a really good plan, five rigs in Powder. If we bought on a six rig, we might drop down a couple of rigs at the end of the year to keep our capital at the same level. I am not talking about expanding capital here. If we want to do that, I am talking about managing capital within our budget that we're laying out.","In South Texas I think four is a really good number and in Brazos we are at four today. We could absolutely go to more if that made sense, but we don't want to expand our capital plan today for sure. And we also want to see how effective can we be with four rigs. We might get the same number of wells with our drilling and completion team with four rigs that what five rigs would have been in our original plan. That is very much within the realm of possibility. So we just need to see how much efficiency we can gain there. But like I said, we do capital allocation every week. We take a look at where the value is and where the best place to spend the money is for the company and we can do that Mid-Con. We have one rig. I think that is a good run rate for Mid-Con until we get some of these other plays kind of the G&G and the reservoir engineering complete analysis there. So I don't see us moving off of where we are unless commodities change or we see a asset really take off and there is a better value proposition for us to pursue.","Jason Wrangler","I appreciate the color. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Speakers, at this time, we have no further questions in the queue. So I'll turn it over to you for any closing remarks.","Doug Lawler","Thank you operator, and thank you everyone for joining us today. 2018 was a great year for Chesapeake marked by the two significant transactions and as I mentioned upfront, the significant improvements across all aspects of our business. We are excited about the opportunity. We are excited about the momentum and excited about the business delivery that we have in front of us. If you believe in energy, you should believe in Chesapeake Energy because we are going to continue to perform and we look forward to sharing more results as we progress through the year. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time this now concludes our conference. You may disconnect your phone lines and have a great rest of the week.

Doug will begin the call and then turn the call over to Nick for a review of our financial results before we turn the teleconference over for Q&A.","So, with that, thank you, and I will now turn the teleconference over to Doug.","Robert Douglas Lawler - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Thanks, Brad. Good morning, everyone. I'd first like to reiterate this morning Chesapeake Energy's strategic priorities. They remain unchanged and drive all of our business activities in every investment. Improving our balance sheet is our top priority and indeed a journey. We've made great progress during the last few years reducing our total leverage through debt and obligation retirement, debt for equity exchanges, and refinancing. We intend to further reduce our leverage and improve our debt to EBITDA multiple through additional asset sales and accretive acquisitions in the near term.","Our stated target of free cash flow neutrality is critical to the financial strength of the company and is achievable within the next one to two years due to the quality of our assets and our industry-leading capital efficiency. Enhancing our returns and margins is also key to our financial stability and will be accomplished through increasing our oil volumes as a percentage of total production and aggressive cash cost leadership.","Now moving to our performance for the third quarter. I'm pleased to report our production has started to decline as forecasted following the previously announced weather-related operational delays experienced during the quarter. As of October 30, our fuel production reached a daily rate of 584,000 barrels of oil equivalent including 99,000 barrels of oil. Our fourth quarter volumes will be dominated by heavy turn-in-line schedule in South Texas Eagle Ford asset, and we remain on target to deliver our goal of averaging 100,000 barrels of oil per day in the fourth quarter.","On the operations front, our people, technology, and portfolio continue to combine to drive improvement in our productivity and value across all of our assets. This effort has most recently been demonstrated in the Marcellus where we've begun deploying enhanced completion techniques on the Upper Marcellus. Results have been impressive. Our two Upper Marcellus Maris pad wells placed on production in September have achieved peak rates of 30 million cubic feet of gas per day. Both wells averaged roughly 6,700 foot laterals where fracs were stimulated with over 3,000 pounds of sand per foot and were rate constrained by surface production equipment limits.","Not only are their rates over 50% higher than previous peak rates from our Upper Marcellus wells that were placed on production back in September of 2015, but these results confirm further delineation of our Upper Marcellus resource potential, significantly increasing our core position across the play. We plan to place the Keiper well (04:12), another Upper Marcellus well with enhanced completion, on line in December.","To update you on our Lower Marcellus McGavin well, which we placed on production in late July, with an enhanced completion and a booming 61 million cubic foot per day rate has produced 4.3 bcf of gas in its first 90 days with an average daily gross production rate of 48 million cubic feet of gas per day. This is an incredible well, which will pay out in roughly nine months, and it provides a glimpse of things still to come from this world-class resource. Our progress in the Marcellus is a continuation of our technology and learnings across the entire portfolio. It all started in the Haynesville about a year ago. We began these larger completion jobs with powerful results.","Accordingly, we believe the data we have in-house and the technology we are utilizing today are revolutionizing the productivity in every one of our operating areas. Our Haynesville asset has evolved from an underappreciated asset to one of the most powerful gas basins in North America, rivaling even the Marcellus. Thanks to our unique ability to successfully couple long laterals with enhanced completions, an IP of 30 million cubic feet per day is now the new normal for Chesapeake. Just three years ago, our Haynesville wells had initial production rates of only 12 million cubic feet per day. While the production growth alone is impressive, I'm especially proud that our teams have accomplished this feat while improving our capital efficiency by 30%.","We turned 12 wells to sales in the third quarter, highlighted by four wells on our BSNR pad in De Soto Parish, which combined are making 134 million cubic feet of gas per day. Last week, our net production in the Haynesville hit 1 bcf of gas per day, and to reiterate, on a net basis, which is our highest daily gas rate since November of 2012.","In addition, we have a new 10,000-foot Bossier well that will be turned in line in a few days, and our first 15,000-foot Haynesville well will be on line early in the first quarter. We're excited about our progress in this redefined prolific play.","In South Texas, the Eagle Ford continues to drive our oil production growth. We placed 31 wells on production in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, we plan to place approximately 73 wells on production. We're seeing encouraging results from completions, targeting and longer laterals, highlighted by our best per unit well, which featured a three-mile lateral with an enhanced completion, resulting in peak production of more than 2,000 barrels of oil per day.","Additionally, we also turned in line two Austin Chalk appraisal tests in the third quarter and are pleased by current performance as both wells have been steadily climbing whole flowing (06:51), each well reaching over 1,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. We'll continue to monitor productivity and update you on the progress in the Austin Chalk.","Moving on to the Powder River Basin, and perhaps no asset better demonstrates our ability to create future differential value for our shareholders than this asset: technology, capital efficiency, geoscience expertise,and smart, creative employees have truly intersected in Converse County.","As you know, it's only a few years ago that we have moved all rigs and essentially all capital from the Powder. Our team made the most of the downtime, deepening our understanding of the tremendous stacked pay potential of our acreage, which ultimately will make the play the most promising oil growth opportunity in our portfolio.","In September, our third Turner well was completed with a 4,500-foot lateral and placed on production, achieving a peak rate of more than 1,700 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which 82% was oil. We recently placed two new Turner wells on production just two days ago and will have peak rates to report in a few days. We added a third rig in October and expect to place on production a total of 11 wells in the fourth quarter.","Looking to 2018, we expect to provide operational performance and CapEx guidance in early February. We anticipate reducing our capital expenditures during 2018 and still delivering a relatively flat to slightly increasing production profile for the year. Capital efficiency is a proven strength of Chesapeake, and the powerful combination of technology, high-quality assets, and talented driven employees will continue to deliver improving results for our shareholders.","A little over four years ago, we started a major financial and operational transformation here at Chesapeake. It was a significant challenge prior to the collapse in commodity price. Chesapeake continued to grow stronger every day, and the improvements over the past few years serve as a strong foundation for greater returns and competitiveness. I am more confident in the future of the company than I've ever been, and as you can expect, further differential improvements in value growth will come from Chesapeake Energy.","I'll now pass the call to Nick for some additional details regarding the third quarter financial results.","[0B432N-E Nick Dell'Osso]","Thank you, Doug, and good morning, everyone. As Doug mentioned, our total production during the third quarter grew 3% sequentially and 4% sequentially after adjusting for asset sales. We look forward to the acceleration of this rate in the fourth quarter as we see the benefit of our significant Q2 to Q3 capital investments come on line, and we are well on our way to averaging 100,000 barrels of oil per day, up 16% from our third quarter oil production.","On the cost side, our combined production, gathering, processing and transportation and G&A expenses decreased slightly in the third quarter compared to Q2. We have seen some pressure on LOE as we increase our oil volumes but have made room for that through our continued focus on G&A. We have seen and expect to see further synergies from volume growth on GP&T expenses this year and next.","In October, we refinanced various secured and unsecured debt with $850 million of longer-dated unsecured notes, resulting in a reduction of the principal amount of secured debt by $557 million. In total, we have reduced principal amount of our secured debt by approximately $1.2 billion this year to-date, and we'll look to further reduce our secured debt balances as the opportunities arise.","On the capital front, we have seen a high for the year with our third quarter CapEx and expect our fourth quarter CapEx to be approximately $500 million. As a result, we raised the bottom end of our total capital guidance to a midpoint of $2.4 billion, which is approximately where we expect to land for the year. As Doug mentioned, we are currently working our 2018 capital plan and will provide more color on this in February. As we consider our capital allocation for 2018, we remain focused on value versus volumes and believe that value for our shareholders will be enhanced by a more balanced cash flow profile. We will remain flexible with our capital should prices rise or fall dramatically, but we do not plan to chase capital higher as a result in the recent modest increase in the 2018 strip.","As a reminder, we had some large onetime events in 2017, including outlays of approximately $550 million to resolve legal issues, primarily the Bank of New York matter and approximately $400 million in buydowns of marketing and midstream contracts. But we do not project anything equivalent in 2018. As we look forward to 2018, we anticipate spending less capital than 2017 while keeping our overall production flat to slightly higher compared to 2017, again subject to change with market conditions.","On the A&D front, we have closed multiple producing property and acreage sales for approximately $1.2 billion to-date in 2017, which included our Haynesville Shale assets that closed earlier in the year and several smaller Mid-Continent packages. We continue to work other non-core asset packages particularly in the Mid-Continent as well as larger assets as we work toward our goal of removing $2 billion to $3 billion of debt from our balance sheet.","Finally and most importantly, we have 579 bcf of gas \u2013 of 2018 production gas hedged to $3.10 per mcf and nearly 21 million barrels of our 2018 oil production hedged at $51.33 per barrel. Further, we have significantly reduced two of our more volatile basis pricing exposures for 2018, in-basin Marcellus gas sales and LLS oil sales out of the Eagle Ford.","Marcellus' in-basin prices have strengthened significantly over the summer and into late fall due to anticipation of new takeaway pipeline projects combined with a slowdown in production growth. We have had roughly 50% of our Marcellus in-basin exposure for one year, which is the November 17 to October 18 period or about 190 million cubic feet a day. Average basis differential captured on these trades is $0.77 compared to our 2017 realized basis differential of $1.34 for this area.","We're also actively pursuing discussions with other parties on longer-term contracts to alternative markets, creating incremental demand in the region at competitive pricing. On the oil side, we sell approximately 60% of our total company net oil production on LLS-based contracts. The LLS index began the year trading at a small premium to WTI of around $1.50 per barrel, and it has climbed significantly in the past few months. Given the recent strength, we've hedged over 30% of our LLS-exposed volumes for 2018. Current LLS trades for 2018 average $3.20 basis differential to NYMEX versus average 2017 realized basis differential of $2.86 for our LLS volumes. This index and basis trades have given us a very strong level of protection on our 2018 cash flow.","Operator, that concludes my comments. I'll now turn the call over for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. At this time, we will start the question-and-answer session. And we'll go first to Neal Dingmann with SunTrust.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Morning, guys.","Robert Douglas Lawler - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Hi, Neal.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Doug, given that 2017 activity and your new comments on 2018 in the press release, you all have seemed to really lay out a plan that to me appears to show the stable 2018 production, yet as Nick \u2013 and you pointed out the moderate to materially lower spending. My question there is how much lower do you believe CapEx really can go next year while still growing oil and keeping overall production relatively flat.","Robert Douglas Lawler - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Yeah. Thanks, Neal. It's a great question. And while we aren't providing any guidance today on 2018 in absolute terms our percentage of reduction, what I would like to highlight is just that these capital efficiency numbers that we're providing and the capital discipline that you see across the company is \u2013 we're very encouraged by it. And as a result, that's what gives us that ability to further reduce the capital outlay and keep the production flat. So, I'm going to hold off on giving you any further detail other than that Frank, Jason and the teams are doing a really good job, and that's evidenced in each of these well results that we share with you: greater productivity, greater recovery, greater efficiency, and for a lower cost. And that will manifest itself into a lower capital program in 2018.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And then just one broader question, Doug. I'm just really wondering overall \u2013 I haven't asked this in a while \u2013 how satisfied you are now with the overall restructuring. Since joining Chesapeake about 4.5 years ago, where you sit now and where you want to be, if you could just give a little bit of broad color on that. Thank you.","Robert Douglas Lawler - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Yeah. Sure. Thanks, Neal. When we started this transformation roughly 4.5 years ago, we knew we had a number of significant challenges, and we hit it head on. And then you have low commodity price environment, which further exacerbates or increases that challenge. And what I'll tell you is the same way I felt the first day I walked into this company is that the energy and quality of the assets are outstanding and phenomenal. And while we're on a journey of restoring our balance sheet and working to improve our competitiveness, I'm as encouraged today as I've ever been, and I believe that the opportunity is as great as it's ever been. And while we have made great progress on the debt and made good progress on our profitability in each of our investments, I'll say that we still have a good way to go. And that's what creates the value for our shareholders, and that's what creates the value for other investors. And I think there's tremendous upside in the company, and we'll keep driving to capture that upside.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks so much.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Doug Leggate with Bank of America.","Unknown Speaker","Doug is on the other line, so please go on to the next speaker.","Operator","Thank you. And we'll take our next question from Subash Chandra. Sir, please check your mute button. We're unable to hear you. Mr. Chandra, we're unable to hear you. Please check your mute button at this time.","Robert Douglas Lawler - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Please go ahead and just take the next question, operator.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go next to Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","I think it's confirmed. I can confirm that my mute is off now. You guys can hear me?","Domenic J. Dell\u2019Osso - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Yeah.","Robert Douglas Lawler - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Yes, Charles (18:41). Thank you.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","I appreciate it. Hey. Nick, I appreciate you offered some prepared comments on the state of your divestitures, but I'm wondering if a question from me is enough to get you to elaborate a little bit more on where you are and what we might be thinking about for the next, I don't know, before year-end or into the first quarter of 2018 on that front.","Domenic J. Dell\u2019Osso - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Sure, Charles. Great question and happy to address. It's always difficult to be precise in talking about what we expect in the way of transactions, whether they be divestitures or any other form of transaction because they are hard to predict the timing, hard to predict exactly what will play out. I can assure you that we work tirelessly to continue to reform our balance sheet and the way that that's going to happen is through asset sales.","We have always considered asset sales in three buckets. There are truly non-core assets, which this company and every well-run E&P company should sell every year. There are assets that we own a significant position in where we can trim a bit of our position, and still own a good solid position going forward but accelerate value from a part of the play that we wouldn't get to in a reasonable period of time. A great example of that for this company would be the sale that we have had with our Haynesville position, which closed at the beginning of 2017. The last is a full-basin exit.","We work all three of those buckets of asset sales every day. We have active discussions going on on those types of transactions every day. Transactions through the middle of 2017 have been challenging. The availability of capital to this industry has been limited, while the broad capital markets across all industries have been very strong, and there have been brief windows where we and others have been able to access the high-yield capital markets and other forms of capital successfully. Broad-based access to capital for growth has been limited.","What that results in is a difficulty to bring transactions to fruition, but there are many motivated buyers out there seeking that capital, and we're talking to many of them, and we will remain laser-focused on delivering on our asset sales to reduce our debt. We'll stay away from deadlines that are ultimately somewhat artificial, whether they'd be at the end of this year or the beginning of next year. We'll get that done. We'll get it done at the right time for the right value. We won't be driving for the last dollar, so to speak. We're thinking of the big strategic picture here, but we have to get it done right.","Robert Douglas Lawler - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Just to add on top on that. Charles, just if you don't mind, just to add on top of that, so I think Nick answered that extremely well. And as we laid out that $2 billion to $3 billion reduction, we were very careful to note that it was over a few year timeframe that we are going to execute upon that. And the purpose in that timeframe is that we have an extremely strong asset base, and that asset base continues to get better. And while we balance capital, commodity price, and potential to drive the greatest value for our shareholders, we're not in the process of giving away these high-quality assets. We're not going to do it. And the financial strength and improvements in the company position is that we'll continue to work it, we'll find the right opportunity, and we'll execute upon it. As Nick has highlighted many times, we are prudently impatient at the pace in which we're attacking the balance sheet, but that doesn't mean that we're going to sacrifice value given the quality of these assets.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Doug and Nick, that's helpful, in fact, particularly in light of the success you guys have had in going to the capital markets yourselves. Doug, I wonder if I can ask my second question. You mentioned the success you've had in a couple of Austin Chalk wells in South Texas, and from the perspective of my seat, we've heard of a number of successes from \u2013 you guys have talked about it. Some other companies have talked about it, but it's kind of difficult to piece together a picture of how extensive that play might be and how repeatable it might be. So, I'm wondering if you could just talk a little bit more about what you guys saw with your most recent wells and your view on that looking into 2018.","Frank J. Patterson - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Hey, Charles. This is Frank Patterson. So, the Austin Chalk, we haven't talked much about the Austin Chalk. We've had the wells on for a couple of months. We went out and took all the industry data that we have seen in the play. It kind of covers the southwest portion or footprint of our acreage and designed a program just to test the concept, and we drilled the wells and put relatively large fracs on them. It took a while for the wells to come back. They were a little bit slow coming back, but now, they've just been climbing, and for the last month, we've seen really good response. We think we can change the frac program and get the same result. You're going to see us and look at potentially a Austin Chalk program that will augment our lower Eagle Ford program next year and the following years. But what it does is it basically gives us a STACK play within our Eagle Ford program, which we really can push on and have a lot of efficiency. It won't interfere with our Eagle Ford program. It will actually be supplemental to that.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","That's helpful. Thanks a lot, Frank.","Operator","And we'll move next to Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning. Nick, as you highlighted kind of a fourth quarter run rate in terms of CapEx at around $500 million, I think you're running 14 rigs. Is that something that we could think about for 2018, that kind of run rate in terms of about $500 million in CapEx, something around that level?","Domenic J. Dell\u2019Osso - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","We're going to stay away from any specifics about 2018 like that. All we're wanting to note this morning is that given the current market environment and given our goals, we see it prudent to have less capital in 2018 versus 2017. Remember, 2017, we really needed to restore our level of cash flow generating capability off of a very low investment in 2016. So, we needed to catch up a bit in some areas. We've done that. You can see those wells coming on line here in the fourth quarter. And so, exactly where we level out to a run rate, we're going to hold off. We're still running a lot of scenarios around that at this point, Arun, and prices remain somewhat volatile. We continue to hedge, which we are pleased about is that derisks how we think about that capital program next year. We'll continue to look at what we achieve in the A&D market and all of that will influence \u2013 we also look at our well results. All of that will influence the ultimate capital allocation for the portfolio next year.","The takeaway that we wanted to leave everybody with this morning is that the inherent capital efficiency of the underlying portfolio and what we've delivered so far this year is that we can spend less money than we did this year and still grow next year. We may not choose to spend that much. We may choose to not grow if prices were to fall apart. If prices were to really run and we could hedge them accordingly, we may choose to spend a little bit more. But don't look for us to chase the strip higher with every move. We are really showing internally that we can do better with some discipline here, and the scenarios we're running highlight that we need to be focused on delivery of these financial goals over time, which is going to result in a \u2013 at this point, we think pretty modest capital program next year.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great.","Domenic J. Dell\u2019Osso - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Again, we'll give more information on that as we get into 2018, and as we firm it up, things could change, but that's what we're looking at right now.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And, Nick, just as a quick follow-up, your limited comments on 2018 were growth relative to on a year-over-year basis, right, not relative to the 4Q exit rate?","Domenic J. Dell\u2019Osso - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","That is what I said, Arun, but let me be clear that we pay attention to what that means on an exit to exit. And we wouldn't be excited about a program that dives coming out of 2018, and yet, we could call it flat year-over-year. But I did refer to it as a year-over-year. I'll leave my comments at that, but we wouldn't set up a program that was declining in that way and be proud of that.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Great. A couple thoughts, you guys have highlighted some optimism around the Turner. We'll have to wait for details in the next couple wells. As you think about potential returns here, Doug, versus single-well NPVs, how do you think about potential returns for a rig line here relative to other opportunities you have in the Eagle Ford or in the Marcellus?","Robert Douglas Lawler - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","We love it. I think I'm going to let Frank share his passion and excitement about it.","Frank J. Patterson - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Yeah, Arun. This is Frank again. The Turner is one of the best-performing assets we have to-date. Now, it's early days. We only have a handful of wells, but the rates are good. The wells are holding in. We have a lot of running room. Just to give you a feel for where we are in the portfolio, we've moved the third rig in, and that rig. So, we'll have two rigs focused primarily on the Turner for our 2018 and actually, the remainder of 2017. I've got to give real kudos to the culture and especially the operations team in the Turner. As we went out there, we didn't know much about it. Wells were in excess of 35, 40 days, the initial wells doing some science, and the costs were a little bit higher than we wanted. Since we've gotten the program going, Jason's team has knocked these wells down to under 30 days. We've just bought two wells on this week, our most recent wells, and those two wells we've adjusted the completions, and we knocked $1.5 million off of each of those completions.","So, where we are today in the Turner is not where we're going to be tomorrow in the Turner. It's only going to get better. Kudos for the field team as well. They've been stretched pretty thin, and the culture of the company I think is so strong now. We've had people from Mid-Con and Gulf Coast volunteer to go up and help that team out. So, we've got people from all over the country helping us get that Turner program stood up. I'd love Jason to talk about his thoughts on that as well.","Jason M. Pigott - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Yeah. I mean, you hit most of the highlights there. We're really excited about the program just continuing to evolve. As Doug mentioned, one of our strengths is the way that we use data and information across the company to optimize the asset and each technology from Haynesville and Utica and Eagle Ford and transfer those to these new plays. So, there is nothing but upside and a bright future for. Again, we're early with that. We get better and better with our drilling and completion operations, the more swings we get at the play. So, excited about the future, and it's only going to get better.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks, gents.","Operator","And due to time constraints, we'll take our final question today from David Heikkinen with Heikkinen Energy Advisors.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Good morning, guys. Thanks for the time. Just wanted to hit on your capital efficiency in new well designs. Could you just speak through your completed well cost in each region kind of quickly in the third quarter?","Jason M. Pigott - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Yeah. Again, we're continuing to test our different designs, so those are something that evolved over time. When we start to look at 2018, lateral length is also a big driver for those as well. So, I mean, when we're talking Haynesville, for example, there are 10,000-foot wells that will cost about $11.4 million; Turner wells, 8,700-foot laterals for $9.5 million I'd say right now, but again, expect all those to improve. I'm mean, ultimately rather than going through each one of these wells, well by well, just give us a call back to Brad and we'll try to give you more information on those wells.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Yeah. Three more regions. That's great. Okay. Thanks. We got two out of six. Thanks. Go Astros.","Robert Douglas Lawler - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","That's right, Dave.","Operator","And gentlemen, I'll turn the call back to you for any additional or closing remarks.","Robert Douglas Lawler - Chesapeake Energy Corp.","Okay. Well, thank you all for joining our call today. As we've highlighted here, the company is focused on the capital discipline, improving our capital efficiency, and our priorities remain unchanged. Our strategic priorities are further reducing our debt, achieving free cash flow neutrality in the near term, and in further enhancing our margins. So, we thank you all for participating. Please feel free to call Brad with further questions. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And that does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."]}}
