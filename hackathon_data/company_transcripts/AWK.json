As a reminder, this call is being recorded and is being webcast with accompanying slide presentation through the company's website, www.amwater.com. Following this earnings call, an audio archive of the call will be available through November 14, 2013, by dialing area code (303) 590-3030 for U.S. and international callers.

The online archive of the webcast will be available through December 6 by accessing the Investor Relations page of the company's website located at www.amwater.com.","[Operator Instructions] I would like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Ed Vallejo, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Vallejo, you may begin.","Edward D. Vallejo","Thank you, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to American Water's Third Quarter 2013 Conference Call. As usual, we'll keep our call to about an hour. And at the end of our prepared remarks, we will have time for questions.","But before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that during the course of this conference call, both in our prepared remarks and in answers to your questions, we may make statements related to future performance. Our statements represent our most reasonable estimates. However, since the statements deal with future events, they are subject to numerous risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual performance of American Water to be materially different from the performance indicated or implied by such statement. Such risk factors are set forth in the company's SEC filings.","And now, I'd like to turn the call over to American Water's President and CEO, Jeff Sterba.","Jeffry E. Sterba","Thanks, Ed. Good morning to you all and appreciate you joining us on this call. Susan Story, our Senior VP and Chief Financial Officer, will join me in the brief presentation. And then we, along with Walter Lynch, who as you know, heads our Regulated Operations; and Mark Chesla, our controller, will respond to any questions that you may have.","As you've seen from the 10-Q and the press release that we filed last night, while mild weather impacted the quarter, I'm pleased to say that we have had a solid performance to date, with strong cost control, good growth in market-based operations and good acquisition success. So based on that, we are now narrowing the earnings guidance for the year from $2.15 to $2.25 per share, on a diluted basis, to a range of $2.17 to $2.22 per share.","For the quarter, we recorded decreases in income from continuing operations and earnings per share as compared to the same quarter in 2012. This was mainly due to decreased regulated business revenues, due to lower customer usage related to weather, in addition to the ongoing usage decline that we see on the residential front, as well as higher depreciation expenses due to additional utility plant in service. And that includes our business transformation, SAP conversion project.","In addition, as we mentioned last quarter, as you look on Slide 5, it appears in that slide that our 2013 year-to-date cash flow from operations is lower. But this is due to how our bank overdraft is being treated as a reduction to operating cash flow as opposed to a financing activity. And this is a result of the decision we made last year to internally manage our cash activities. Year-to-date, this change in cash flow classification amounts to about $35 million.","So going to Slide 6, let me take a minute to discuss the weather's impact on our business. The same type of weather that impacted our second quarter continued to pressure third quarter regulated revenues. As you can see by this cooling degree days chart from NOAA, which is most of you cover the energy size, so you're very well familiar with this. The country experienced cooler than normal temperatures throughout the third quarter.","Now we often talk about our geographical diversity across 16 states and how it helps mitigate things like weather impact. And that was certainly the case this quarter in states like California, where hotter weather caused higher usage. But even with that contribution, we did experience an approximate $0.02 to $0.04 decrease in earnings per share from weather for this quarter, which when you add that to the $0.01 to $0.02 impact last quarter, you've got a total of $0.03 to $0.06 total impact for the first 9 months of the year.","Turning to the continued growth of our business, we've had successes that we want to report on briefly in both our core and on our enhanced growth through the quarter. We completed 6 tuck-ins during the quarter, 4 water and 2 wastewater systems. These were in the states of Iowa, Pennsylvania, Illinois and Missouri. And so, for the first 9 months of 2013, these efforts have added approximately 6,500 customers to the regulated footprint, and we've got several Small tuck-ins that are currently pending approvals, and we expect those to close within the next 3 to 6 months or so.","Continuing on Slide 7. Relative to the core growth, for the third quarter, our Military Services Group received contract modifications for infrastructure investments in every single one of the 9 military bases that we serve. These are for design and construction of water and wastewater system components to be completed over the next 3 years. And they vary in scale from small water reuse projects at one of the Army Port Places, Fort Sill, that's in Oklahoma, to a complete replacement of the 2 wastewater treatment facilities in Fort Polk in Louisiana. I'll tell you that what we're still -- there are still some things moving, it's the largest amount of awards for modifications that we've received in the military operations since we started that business.","On the regulated front, we received a rate case decision in West Virginia that's worth an annualized $8.5 million. And after the quarter ended, about $7.2 million in annualized revenue from infrastructure surcharges became effective in Pennsylvania and Illinois. And also, after the quarter ended, we received a rate authorization in Kentucky for $6.9 million of additional revenues on an annualized basis.","So as of today, we're awaiting final rate decisions in 3 pending cases that request the total of $97.4 million in annualized revenues. In one of these cases, Pennsylvania, we have a settlement with the staff, the Office of Consumer Advocate and the Office of Small-business Advocate. This settlement for $26 million plus the $29 million of DSIC revenues that are currently being recovered under DSIC and which will become part of the base revenues under the proposed settlement, that settlement is currently pending regulatory approval with the rates geared to go into effect on January 1.","On the enhanced growth side, on October 30, we received approval from the Virginia State Corporation Commission to acquire Dale Services Corp., and we expect that transaction to close later this month. This regulated wastewater acquisition will allow approximately 20,000 customers, most of whom already receive their water service from Virginia American Water. The reason why this transaction, I think, is important is not just its size, but it marks the kind of transactions that we've talked with many of you about, where wastewater is only about 4% of our business. But we -- so at most places where we serve water, someone's providing wastewater, it's just not us. So this is the result of the kind of targeted focused acquisition efforts that we're moving on to expand our wastewater operation. And this transaction also marks our entry into the wastewater service arena in the state of Virginia.","Our Homeowner Services business continued to expand its water and sewer line protection programs to homeowners in Florida and Washington DC. In our Service Line Protection Program in New York City, we now have a total of about 1 out of every 7 eligible home owners is enrolled. And most of them, virtually all of them, have opted for both water line and sewer line protection. So far this year, we have added over 250,000 new contracts, for a total of more than 1.2 million contracts nationally.","So before turning the call over to Susan, let me just mention, what I think is really a historic initiative that launched in October. American Water and several other leading water industry organizations from both the public and private sector, as well as a couple of other companies, have come together under the name Value of Water Coalition. The coalition's education campaign is aimed at helping to increase the public's understanding and awareness of water services, the value these services provide us and the need to upgrade and maintain this vital infrastructure so that we can continue to rely on it now and for generations to come. This effort marks the first time such a broad coalition of water businesses and non-profit associations has come together in a single voice.","And we're doing so because it's critical to address the current state of water infrastructure and the need for significant investment to keep water services at the levels of quality and safety Americans have come to expect. And we're already hearing good feedback from this outreach effort from the regulator, staff and consumers.","Let me just also mention that we have been reconfirmed as a member of the Dow Jones Sustainability North American Index, which demonstrates recognition of our ongoing long-term commitment to sustainability. We're the only U.S. water utility on the index, and we're honored to be on it. And with that, let me turn the call over to Susan for more detailed report on our financials.","Susan N. Story","Thank you, Jeff, and good morning to you all. It's a pleasure to be here with you today to review the quarter and the year-to-date results ending September 30. Jeff has already reviewed many of the key highlights. I will now take a few minutes to discuss the drivers of our third quarter results in more detail.","Turning to Slide 10. We reported a decrease in our third quarter 2013 income from continuing operations and EPS over the third quarter of 2012. This decrease is mainly attributable to decreased regulated business revenue, due to lower customer usage related to weather, general taxes and higher depreciation expenses, due to additional plants license service, including expenditures related to our SAP implementation.","As Jeff mentioned, we had above normal rainfall and below normal temperatures in several of our states in June and July, which was followed by cooler weather in August, which impacted our sales.","These related decreases in usage and accompanying revenue, net income and earnings per share, were in stark contrast to the unusually hot and dry weather we saw in the summer of 2012.","Our consolidated O&M expenses for the 3 months ended September 30 decreased by $11.5 million, or 3.2% compared to the prior year period. The variance is primarily due to lower O&M costs in our regulated business segment of $7.1 million, mainly due to a reduction in employee-related cost and in our market-based segments of $3.7 million, mainly as a result of a $3.8 million release of contract reserves, due to the resolution of certain outstanding issues and uncertainty.","Now let's discuss, on Slide 11, the different components of our income from continuing operations, starting with revenue. I also encourage you to read our 10-Q on file with the SEC for a more detailed analysis of both revenues and expenses.","Overall, our operating revenues decreased $2.6 million or 0.3%, with revenues from our regulated business decreasing by $7.7 million or 1% from 2012. The decrease in revenues associated with a lower demand was approximately $35.2 million.","The year-over-year comparison was significant, due to the diametrically opposite weather effects of 2013 contrasted with 2012 that we all spoke of earlier. This demand decrease was partially offset by revenue increases of $18.4 million from rate increases obtained through rate authorizations awarded for a number of our operating companies and increased surcharge and amortization of balancing account of $9.9 million.","At a high level, our continued success in earning an adequate and timely return on the capital, we invest in infrastructure, as well as implementing alternative regulatory mechanisms, such as surcharges and balancing account help us to close regulatory lag and particularly, in this quarter, have helped us to mitigate the adverse impact of declining sales due to weather and declining usage.","For our market-based businesses. Revenues for the third quarter of 2013 increased by $4.7 million, mainly due to an increase in our Homeowner Services revenues of $5.4 million, resulting from contract growth, most notably in New York City. This increase was offset by lower Contract Operations Group revenues of $900,000, predominantly related to the termination of certain municipal and industrial operations and maintenance contracts, totaling approximately $2.4 million. These contracts were ended as part of our business optimization effort designed specifically to optimize margins in our contract operation system.","Further, these contract terminations were offset by a net increase of $1.7 million from price redetermination from our military contract. You may recall that price redeterminations are periodic adjustments to our monthly service fees for O&M cost, plus the systematic renewal and replacement of aging asset. These are prospects to price adjustment. But because price redeterminations can take many months or even years to finalize, the government makes a one-time payment retroactive to the effective date of that price redetermination period.","On Slide 12. Operating expenses for the third quarter of 2013 increased by about $1.1 million from 2012, roughly flat compared with the prior year period. Operation and maintenance expense in the regulated business decreased $7.1 million, mainly as a result of lower production cost and lower employee-related cost, including decreased pension expense and group venture.","The market-based business operations decreased, and total operating expenses of $3.7 million is mainly due to the termination of certain municipal and industrial operations and maintenance contracts in 2012 that I mentioned earlier, and a release of a portion of the loss contracts reserve in the third quarter of 2013.","In the third quarter, we also reported a higher consolidated depreciation and amortization expense of $6.5 million, and higher general tax, parent elimination and other expense of $5.4 million. The increase in depreciation and amortization was principally as a result of additional utility plant, place in service, including Phase 1 and Phase 2 of our business transformation SAP project that went into service during the third quarter of 2012 and the second quarter of 2013, respectively.","The increase in general tax expense is primarily due to higher property taxes incurred, partially as a result of the inclusion in 2012 of credit adjustment to our Indiana and Missouri property taxes.","Turning now to Slide 13. To more clearly explain the period-over-period difference in our earnings per share figures, we have broken these out per category similar to our presentation to you last quarter. As you can see, we have adjusted for the positive $0.06 to $0.08 impact of weather for our 2012 results. Taking the mid-point of this adjustment for the unseasonably hot and dry weather, we have a normalized earnings starting point for the third quarter of 2012, $0.80 per share. From there, we lay out the various elements that explain the difference in our year-over-year earnings per share results. I think these are pretty straightforward, so I'm not going to go through these. But I'll be happy and others will be very happy to provide further clarification during our question-and-answer today if you do have questions.","Going to Slide 14, we show our O&M efficiency ratio. For the 12 months ended September 30, we maintained a 40.3% ratio, which is in line with the 40.4% ratio we had last quarter for the 12 months ended June 30 and the earlier annual period shown here.","And on Slide 15. As Jeff has already said, we have narrowed our guidance to $2.17 to $2.22 diluted EPS from continuing operations, which reflects our year-to-date performance, and assumes no unusual events that would impact water sales volume for the remainder of the year. This includes the impact of the release of the loss contract reserves in the third quarter of 2013 that I mentioned earlier, but excludes cost of our recent tender offer.","Slide 16 outlines some of the actions we have recently taken to increase our financial flexibility and reduce exposure to capital market volatility. To briefly summarize. On September 9, we announced we had increased our revolving credit facility from $1 billion to $1.25 billion under its original term. At the same time, we raised our commercial paper program from $700 million to $1 billion. The higher credit facility, along with the increased commercial paper program and cash from operation, provides to the company's near-term financial liquidity.","We also announced through our financing subsidiary, American Water Capital Corp., a cash tender offer for up to $300 million, a 6.085% senior notes due in 2017, which represents the portion of what we have typically referred to as our parent company debt. On October 8, we retired $226 million of these notes, meaningfully reducing our exposure to the capital markets in 2017.","Also, as a result of the retirement of this debt and based upon our current commercial paper borrowing rate, we would expect to have a pretax interest expense savings of $13 million in 2014. On November 1, we issued a notice of redemption of security with 8.25% and 10% coupon aggregating to approximately $150 million. These notes will be retired on December 1. Additionally, we have debt maturity of $101 million on December 21.","We're really pleased with the results of our ongoing debt management program. And from time-to-time and as market condition warrant, we may engage in additional long-term debt retirement via tender offers, open market repurchases or other viable transactions.","Turning now to Slide 17. And just mentioned several of these, I'll just go back through some of the highlights. A number of our rates-related regulatory activities occurred during the third quarter of 2013. On July 1, 2013, additional annualized revenue of $3.7 million and $4.0 million, resulting from infrastructure charges in our Pennsylvania and New Jersey subsidiaries respectively became effective.","Also, on July 1, 2013, we filed an update to our proposed application in California that was originally filed on May 1 of this year, requesting $33.5 million of additional annualized revenue, which includes increases in 2016 and 2017 of $8.3 million and $6.7 million respectively.","On October 9, California Americans filed an update to the final general rate case application adjusting the request to $32.4 million. On July 9, 2013, our West Virginia subsidiary entered into a joint stipulation for their water and wastewater general rate case that was filed on December 14, 2012. On","September 26, 2013, a final order consistent with the stipulation agreement was approved and provides for additional annualized revenue of $8.5 million effective October 11, 2013.","On August 30, 2013, our Missouri subsidiary filed for an infrastructure surcharge amounting to $2.4 million in additional annualized revenue. The surcharge is expected to be approved and would become effective in the fourth quarter of this year.","On September 16, 2013, our Pennsylvania subsidiary, as Jeff said, reached a settlement in principle for its general rate case filed on April 30 of this year with the PUC staff, the office of the Consumer Advocate and the Office of Small Business Advocate. The settlement agreement, if approved, will provide $26 million in additional annualized base rate revenue effective January 1, 2015. And as mentioned previously, this is in addition to the $29 million of DSIC revenues, currently being recovered, which will become part of base revenue. This agreement is pending regulatory approval.","Turning now to developments, which have occurred following the end of the third quarter. On October 1, 2013, additional annualized revenue of $6.7 million and $500,000 resulting from infrastructure filings in our Pennsylvania and Illinois subsidiaries, respectively, became effective. Also, on October 1, our Indiana subsidiary submitted an infrastructure charge filing to increase revenue by an additional $4.4 million on an annualized basis.","On October 4, 2013, our Tennessee subsidiary filed 4 alternative mechanisms requesting to increase revenues on an annualized basis of $500,000. These alternative rate mechanisms were filed in compliance with Tennessee House Bill 191, that was signed into law in April of this year.","Finally, on October 25, a final order was received for new annualized revenue of $6.9 million for our Kentucky American subsidiaries. So in summary, we've had a lot of regulatory activity in the third quarter, and we are currently awaiting $97.4 million in requested additional revenues in Pennsylvania, Iowa and California from formal rate cases we filed this year.","Last quarter, we created a new slide, which you can find in the appendix, Slide 25, entitled \"Regulated Utilities - Rate Base and Allowed Return on Equity,\" which shows detail regulatory information for our 10 largest state. Many of you had requested this data showing each of our regulated businesses, authorized rate base, authorized ROE, authorized equity and the effective date of the rate case that we use. These are historic cases, and we advice you to review the footnote for a fuller understanding of the particular case in question.","While, you can never project how any new case will be determined, we hope this will help you understand better our rate environment.","Finally, as a part of our commitment to shareholder value, on October 27, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend payment of $0.28 common share, payable on December 2, 2013, to all shareholders of record as of November 15, 2013, which continues our commitment to an annual dividend payout goal of 50% to 60% of net income.","And now I'll turn the call back to Jeff for his closing comments and your questions.","Jeffry E. Sterba","Thanks, Susan. If you go to Slide 19, this is the slide on expectations for the year that you've seen we use every quarter. We've really already spoken about the progress on each of these efforts, which will anchor our long-term earnings per share growth of 7% to 10%. Let me just expand on one item that Susan briefly talked about and that is our business transformation effort.","In October, the last phase of this effort went live. This has been a 4.5-year project to install SAP platform systems as we've talked about before. I've got to tell you, while these kinds of conversions, and this is the third one I've been through. They're never pretty. There is always impact on productivity. So they talk about averages of 30% to 40%. We certainly haven't incurred that kind of a loss of productivity. But they're -- so they're messy, but I am just really tickled and pleased with how well it has gone. And when you step up and look at it from the broad perspective, we implemented new financial systems, new supply chain systems, new customer service systems, and new asset management systems, and it has gone quite well. So kind of hats off to all of our folks because its impacted every single one of our employees.","Before we open the call for questions, I want to remind everyone that we are hosting our 2013 Analyst Day at the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday, December 17. To confirm your interest in attending, please call the Investor Relations phone number you see in this slide. We certainly hope that you'll be able to join us that afternoon and we'll talk about the future in that session.","So with that, we'd be happy to take any questions you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from the line of Neil Mehta of Goldman Sachs.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Congratulations on being able to give guidance despite this unfavorable weather here. I guess that's my question here is in the sense of that the big part of the reason you able to maintain the guidance was cost management. How sustainable are those cost cuts? Or were you just put them on the expenses this year to kind of offset the weather?","Jeffry E. Sterba","No, Neil, as we've talked about before, our whole focus in cost management is around driving excellence through business process and continuous improvement. So the things that we're doing, they're not one-offs, they're not slash and burns, they're not -- they're not just headcount reductions, they're geared around changing, what we supposed as the 3 questions. Is what we're doing adding value? If not, stop doing it. If it does add value, is it being done through an efficient process? If not, let's change the process. And once it's being done through an efficient process, what's the error rate and how do we reduce the errors to 0? That helps create a systematic approach to the way in which we think about our cost and cost drivers. And one other thing, and Walter may want to make a few comments about it, that we're still working on is this integration across all of our states to take the best practices that we find one place and move them into in a standardized way across the other states.","Walter J. Lynch","Yes, thanks, Jeff. This is Walter. Yes, we are, as Jeff said, taking best practices because we're doing things wonderfully in many parts of our company and we are expanding that across our entire footprint and reg operations and throughout the entire business because we can learn back and forth [ph] in the market-based businesses to regulated operation. One of the other things, too, is the continuous improvement culture, really focused on driving improvements long-term. And we have a lien leader program. We have more than 100 people throughout our company looking at ways to improve our processes and looking at ways that we can reduce errors. That's contributing significantly now and will contribute significantly in the future, as we root out errors and we become more efficient.","Jeffry E. Sterba","And Neil, just one other thing, while that's the -- that's our baseline and we believe that provides us a great deal of ability to minimize operational cost increases and add more capital to the base, and that's the basis for rate increases. As we implement SAP, just as the end of last year, we had some additional expenses incurred because of that recovery and that reduced productivity, we'll see some of that, and we have seen some of that this year. You don't necessarily see it because we are even doing a better job and reducing our other costs. So net, we're still down. But we will see those kinds of things and will make sure that we pay attention to it.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Perfect. And then another question is around dividend growth strategy. Obviously, a double-digit dividend step up this year. How do you think about the pace of dividend growth from here and where you want to be relative to that 50% to 60% payout ratio?","Susan N. Story","Yes, Neil, this is Susan. As we said before, we have 2 guiding principles. One is that we correlate the growth of our dividend, along with our EPS growth. And we've been very transparent about that, and we have a target of staying between 50% and 60% payout. And as you know, we're on the low end of that so we have headwind.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then final question on the California project in Monterey. Can you provide an update of where you stand there?","Jeffry E. Sterba","Yes, I'll ask Walter to add a few things. Let me put a few on the table. Frankly, things are moving well. It's always -- this is a project that will cause rates to increase in a double-digit fashion. So it's under a lot of scrutiny. The -- it's obviously a water constrained area, particularly in Monterey. But this project is, in fact, moving forward quite well. We would expect that the mission recommended decision by August next year.","Walter J. Lynch","August 2014, right, Jeff. And there's -- along the way, obviously, there are lot of things and have to occur for that to happen. But there's an informal hearing scheduled for early December. And we've come to settlements with a number of parties out in the Monterey area. And during those hearings is when everyone will be able to put their case forward. But we feel confident that we're working cooperatively with the people in Monterey to get the right solution.","Jeffry E. Sterba","2 other things. We're in the bid process right now for the constructor for that project. And so that is going along quite well. And the testing, the initial results of testing relative to the upper, have been very promising. So the pins that kind of stand in the way are getting knocked down. We still have a few to go.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Jonathan Reeder of Wells Fargo.","Jonathan Reeder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Following up on Neil's question just a bit. So should we interpret the guidance revision or narrowing today as implying that results would have been in the upper half of the original range had it not been happen for the weather impact?","Jeffry E. Sterba","Well, you could probably look at it that way. I mean, we said that weather is worth $0.03 to $0.06 a share, and we narrowed it to basically the mid-point of the range.","Susan N. Story","What we prefer to say that we have -- we're closer to the end of the year, have a little more look into where we'd end up. And so we're good with the range.","Jonathan Reeder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. But essentially, what's keeping you in the mid-point of the range isn't unsustainable stuff?","Jeffry E. Sterba","Well, no.","Jonathan Reeder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Like you mentioned before, right?","Jeffry E. Sterba","Right. When, I think, Jonathan, about some of the things we have gotten done this year, and both on the cost control efforts, the growth in the market-based business and the success we're having on the tuck-in and acquisitions side, those are going along exceptionally well.","Susan N. Story","Yes, and to add to that, Jonathan, and Walter and Jeff talked about this. The BT implementation, the SAP implementation. As Jeff mentioned, we actually had, and we've shown this through the year, disclosed in the Q. We've actually had increased costs in the contract services because we've had to backfill a lot of positions to get the ERP system working to a level that we want it to work to get to the point where it could generate the data and we could do more value added analytics. That will go away next year. And as they both mentioned in addition to the process improvements, the ability to have an integrated system throughout our company, we're just now starting to look at some of the efficiencies and enhancements we can make as a result of that implementation.","Jonathan Reeder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","So when we look at cost next year, I mean, from I guess the OEM efficiency ratio standpoint, but just an absolute basis with those implementation costs following off, I mean, where do you expect to be? Is it flat? Is it still modestly up?","Jeffry E. Sterba","I assume -- I trust that you'll be with us in December 17, and we'll talk about that.","Jonathan Reeder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","How did I know that answer was coming. Okay, quickly, just going to the military services group and the contract modifications. It sounds like they're kind of meaningful, something that's going to provide a boost in '14, maybe in '15 results. Is that accurate? And then does that kind of cause a headwind potentially in 2016 or so, if you don't get similar sized contracts moving forward?","Jeffry E. Sterba","Well, I guess, 2 things. You're right about the timing. Most of these projects are 2 -- 1 to 2 and occasionally, 3 years. So for example, the major rebuild on the wastewater system at one of the installations, that could slip beyond 2 years. So -- but we always are hoping and looking and working with our customers on the basis. So what will occur in the next years. But the other piece is, as we said before, there are a number of military installations that are out for bid today. Now we don't go after every single military installation. We go after the ones where we believe we truly can add value, and that value can be recognized through the size of the contract. Because we've got quite a lot going on in that area. We want to make sure that the ones we take on, we can truly excel at. And we have a number of those out in the bids stage today with awards that could happen as early as, let's say, early, first of next year through 2014. So what we look to is to be able to expand the base of business with through the addition of new basis to the portfolio and that this additional modification capital is really supplemental to the fundamentals that we have within the business.","Jonathan Reeder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So any kind of falling off from the contract modifications you think would be replaced by a larger just number of basis operated and everything?","Jeffry E. Sterba","Yes. And probably more than offset.","Jonathan Reeder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then last question on the parent debt balance. The -- what is it, I guess, it's not associated with subsidiary rate base? Where are you going to be at year-end? And how does that compare to where you were, say, at Q2 before taking some of these actions?","Susan N. Story","Right. Well, Jonathan, if you remember, it was about $1.2 billion, which we reported $750 million matured -- matures in '17 and another $450 million matures in '18. What we did was take out $226 million of the $750 million that was set to mature in 2017.","Jonathan Reeder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then you said later in the quarter by year-end, you're going to take out some more. Is that correct?","Susan N. Story","Well, what we -- not necessarily of that parent company debt. What I mentioned is that we have -- we issued redemption notices on November 1, last Friday, for about $149.8 million, $150 million of bonds that are -- debt to have coupon rates of 8.25% and 10%. So that's going to be a nice pickup. And we have maturing debt of about $101 million by December 21.","Jonathan Reeder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So you will be refinancing that, not taking it out?","Susan N. Story","Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Cole of Credit Suisse.","Kevin Cole - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I guess with homeowner services becoming increasingly important and a bigger part of your business, can you talk a little bit about the risk profile of the business? Meaning, are you wearing the event risk or are you simply offering a product that is wrapped by like a third-party insurer? And then do your policies cover like systematic or any catastrophic events that could impact a large number of your customers at once?","Jeffry E. Sterba","Good questions, Kevin. A couple of things. No, we do not use third-party reinsurance. We have basically self insure. But most of these are capped. So there's a cap on the total amount that we are exposed to. So we will do the repair or replacement up to x dollars. So that's the way that we manage the ultimate exposure. But really, the math -- the primary exposure is our contractor management process, which is a very thorough vetting of both what's done, how it's done, the oversight of that and who's doing it. So we don't have unlimited exposure for situations. We also obviously will look at -- we price differently in different areas. So this isn't a uniform price across the United States. And that's because systems are different. Their age is different. The soil chemistry will be different. So they'll have different risk patterns. That gets taken into account, as well as the cost of repairs, gets taken into account in that pricing strategy. And are there limitations on the coverage? Absolutely, and then they run from things like you have to have been a customer for usually a 30 days, sometimes it's longer than that before any claim can be processed, and that's to help ensure that we don't have somebody who realizes they have leak and try to pick insurance for it. I'm sorry, I didn't use that word. Warrants for it. And then it also goes to certain limitations relative to acts of God and things of that nature. So we protect ourselves in a variety of different ways relative to what that exposure can be.","Susan N. Story","And added to what Jeff said, we have a robust system where we evaluate frequency and severity of each of the events, and we look at where those events are, we look at severity. In fact, this year we disclosed in an earlier Q at the end of the first quarter, that we had a spike in severity. So we started managing looking at where that was, evaluating contractors. And we were actually able to remedy that and in fact to its historic rate. So we have a, I think, a really strong system around managing those risks by looking at what's happening, where it's happening, and to Jeff's point, how we price it.","Jeffry E. Sterba","Some of you have met Sharon Cameron who runs our market base business but she came out of homeowner services and was instrumental in its start-up and bringing it to this level. And she'll be with us at the December 17 meeting. So you get a chance to visit with her.","Kevin Cole - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just on clear on the final part of what you said. So you do not insure against like act of God, right, like hurricanes, earthquakes and large-scale events like that?","Jeffry E. Sterba","Yes, there's always definitions about what's included and which kind of thing. But -- the answer to that is generally yes.","Kevin Cole - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Do you have like a notional like value at risk measurement that we could follow?","Jeffry E. Sterba","That's a good question. We do not put one forward. But you know what, Kevin, I -- that's something we want to think about. Because there are things that we look at but we do not make those available. And part of it is the business side. But we want to think about that. Good job.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Heike Doerr of Robert W. Baird.","Heike M. Doerr - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","It should come as no surprise, but I would like to talk about regulatory strategy. If I look the last 2 years, the amount of rate awards you've gotten in total has been 100 to 120 of rate cases separate from the surcharges. Even if we assume that the Pennsylvania settlement is completed, we're looking at a total amount of rate increases awarded of only about 1\/3 of that. I'm wondering, is this just an off year? Are we looking at the new normal? How should we think about your rate case cycle and how you manage rate increases versus infrastructure surcharge increases?","Jeffry E. Sterba","Good question, Heike. And let me pose it, I guess, in 3 ways. Remember, if I go back 3, 4 years ago, the amount that we were generating from automatic adjustment clauses was about 13% of the capital investment every year. And that was a lower level of capital investment that we're at today. And today, it's about 40% of all invested capital is coming back through those mechanisms. So the importance of those mechanisms has, and this has been very targeted and strategic, has increased relative to the total amount of rate relief, if you will. So the second one is, we went through a period of rate case catch-up, as we've talked about before. And we're largely out of that today. And our focus is in moving the rate cases that we do file through a much higher percentage of capital cost recovery rather than operating cost recovery. So you'll remember the slides that Susan used that would show, if you go back through 2008 through 2010, the, I think it was 56% of recovery was really our operating cost and only about 44% was capital cost, whereas now it's about 94% is capital cost. So I guess the point there would be, I'm not sure it's effective to look just at the dollars of rate recovery, it's what's driving those dollars. Is it capital or is it operating cost? And also then, what are the other ways in which that revenue is being picked up? Because one of the things we're very focused on is to ensure we can drive efficiency in our business to minimize the rate of rate increase while getting the capital investment that needs to be made on the ground.","Susan N. Story","Right. And remember, if most of your the rate case is capital, as a more of that you can actually recover through surcharges, then you can extend out your general rate cases. And again, not to be another advertisement, but on December 17, we'll give a look into that we think can be recovered next year.","Heike M. Doerr - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Great. And kind of as a follow-up question, we used to think of you as loosely on a 2-year rate case cycle for most states outside of California. Has that strategy been revisited now? Or if we're really capital focused on rate increases, does a 2-year cycle still makes sense?","Jeffry E. Sterba","Well, it's not just -- it also involves what's the DSIC treatment in that state, et cetera. So I think you will see slightly longer because we really were on more on 18 to 24 months. You will, see slightly longer periods. In some states, it may go to 3 years. In other states, it will be 2.5. Some states will still -- will have -- may stay in a 2-year range because we don't have those kinds of cost recovery mechanisms, or we also have an issue of it's not a future test years state, we've got declining usage. So it'll vary by state. But I think that drumbeat of 18 to 24 months is broken. That's not our future.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question will come from the line of Steven Fleishman of Wolfe Research.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC","Just a little more color on the military business and the Homeowner Services. Relative to your plan for this year, could you give us some answer how they're coming through? Are they kind of on plan, ahead of plan? Just a little color there would be helpful.","Jeffry E. Sterba","Well, I think Homeowner Services has done better than we really expected in terms of the rate of subscriptions in the New York area. It's just -- we really didn't expect that it would be as well-received as it has been. And I think part of that is because of the strength of the partnership with New York City and the administration that it has been -- they've done a lot to help promote it. And then picking up Nashville, which is another opportunity for our 175,000 customers. We're pleased with the way Homeowner Services has come along and their strong performance. On the military side, I tell you, the folks that we have that run that business do a very, very strong job on behalf of their customers, the military. And both in terms of holding cost down and also in terms of quality of performance and bringing home enough of a return that we say this is a good business to be in. I would say that the issues of federal budgets, sequestration, to some extent, and then the stand down for a while does -- did impact some timing issues. And so for example, there's an award we thought may have already -- originally it would have been made by now, it's delayed a bit. And it's got nothing to do with policy. It's all got to do with people being able to be at the office and do the things necessary to issue awards. So it has that side maybe has moved a little slower, but it really hasn't impacted the performance of our overall business. And as I said, the mods that we received recognize that these basis are old and they need capital investment, and we're going to be there to provide it. So we're pleased with the kind of awards that we received in that regard. So both of those business lines have had a very good year so far.","Susan N. Story","And to add to that, Steve, after the first quarter, we talked about that some of the capital projects were delayed. There still will be a certain amount of those that will roll over into 2014. We have made up some of the ground. But we feel, our folks in that area feel like that which won't get done this year will all roll over into 2014.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC","Okay. One other question. We saw, over the last, I think, few weeks, an Illinois law that might support more privatization of distressed water companies and then Indiana might be looking one. Can you talk more about, is that something that you're seeing it could be significant for you or more marginal?","Jeffry E. Sterba","Steve, one of the things that we've got built into our strategy, and we will talk a little bit about this in December, but it is -- we've got our key strategic objectives and metrics associated with it. But we have enablers. And it's the enablers that we strategically focus on. Because without those enablers, that objective is really interesting, but you can't get there. So for example, having legislation passed that allows the -- a premium to be paid on the troubled system in order to get that under good control and under the state's oversight is one of the enablers. Another enabler is the law that we've got passed in Pennsylvania that was geared around being able to roll wastewater rate basis into overall rates to be able -- so that the repair work that you have to do with a newly-acquired wastewater system doesn't cause such rate shock by 100% rate increase just on the few customers that are served by that wastewater system. Or the legislation that we got past this year down in Tennessee, which opens the door for, frankly, the filing that we just made requesting a number of different elements of cost recovery and capital recovery. So these enablers are very targeted. We look at each state. We have -- so we have general theorems about what we want to get done but what you need to do in each state will be different. And in some states, we may not make it the first time, so we go back. Or we work with the commission and find out that the commission understands it, they may not be willing to do it, unless the legislator speaks, okay? So we go work with a legislator. So it's a very specific plans around those items, and they're all gear to open up the pathways for what we believe can be that continued strong growth, not only of our business, but of, frankly, better service to customers.","Operator","And Mr. Sterba, there are no further questions at this time. Please continue.","Jeffry E. Sterba","Well, thank you all very much for joining us today. Have a great rest of the week. And for those of you that we see in December, we look forward to talking then.

All statements in this call related to earnings and earnings per share refer to diluted earnings and earnings per share. ","And now I would like to turn the call over to American Water's President and CEO, Susan Story. ","Susan Story ","Thanks, Ed. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Today, our CFO, Linda Sullivan, will cover our first quarter financial results, and COO, Walter Lynch, will give key updates on our operations. The employees of American Water delivered strong results in the first quarter of 2018. Our earnings per share were up 13.5% compared to the first quarter of 2017. This includes excellent growth in both our regulated business and Market-Based Business. And consistent with our previous guidance, on April 20, our Board of Directors approved a 9.6% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.455 per share. This marks the 6th year in a row that our dividend increase was at or above the top of our long- term EPS CAGR of 7% to 10%.","We believe that long-term financial success depends on effectively executing the fundamentals of our business every day. These fundamentals include, engaging our employees deploy provide excellent service to our customers; building constructive and transparent regulatory relationships; growing our business and becoming even more efficient in our operation to ensure affordability and value for our customers. The foundation for our earnings growth continues to be the capital investment we make in our regulated operations to provide clean, safe and reliable service to our customers. ","We invested $343 million this quarter, with $302 million of that for our regulated infrastructure. We minimized the customer bill impacts of these investments through a continued focus on controlling O&M costs, optimizing capital spend through both value engineering and value procurement and through constructive regulatory mechanisms. Our regulated business closed several acquisitions during the quarter for a total of 3,700 new customer connections. We also added about 1,500 more customers through organic growth in our footprint. ","We have an additional 47,000 customer connections under agreement, including the recently announced Alton Waste Water System. This one agreement will add 23,000 new wastewater customers in Illinois. We have served water in this great city for over 140 years, and our employees live, work and play there. So this acquisition is very special to us. Walter will discuss this as well as our strong pipeline and potential regulated acquisitions in a few minutes. ","Earnings were also up in our Market-Based Businesses. This was due in large part to an increase in results from our homeowner services organization, where we saw growth in customer contracts along with benefits from cost management efforts. As you are also aware, we recently announced our agreement to acquire Pivotal Home Solutions, which will nearly double our home warranty business. Pivotal is highly complementary to our homeowner services group. We have been in this business for 16 years and we're excited to welcome the great many women of Pivotal to the American Water family upon close of the transaction, which we expect in the second quarter. ","With this strong start to 2018 and our continued execution of strategies, we are affirming today our 2018 guidance of $3.22 to $3.32 per share. As we shared with you last month, given the Pivotal acquisition and the effects of tax reform, we expect our long-term growth to be in the top half of our 7% to 10% target EPS CAGR. American Water will invest $8 billion to $8.6 billion over the next five years excluding Pivotal, with more than $7.2 billion spend to improve our existing infrastructure. ","Under this plan and normal operating conditions, no new equity is needed. We see line of sight to our 32% target O&M efficiency ratio by 2022. And we affirm our earlier guidance of dividend growth at the high end of our 7% to 10% EPS CAGR also through 2022. ","Walter will now give you his update on our regulated business.","Walter Lynch","Thanks, Susan. Good morning, everyone. As Susan mentioned, our Regulated Businesses had a strong first quarter, making capital investments to ensure clean, safe and reliable water service while continuing to improve our operating efficiencies to benefit our customers. We also had tremendous growth driven by acquisitions. ","Let me start on Slide 9 with an update on our Missouri rate order that we just received yesterday afternoon. As you know we filed the Missouri rate case last June, requesting an increase of $64 million in annual revenue adjusted for tax reform. The request was driven by more than $250 million in investment in our systems since our last rate order in 2016. On May 2, the Missouri Public Service Commission issued an order approving new rates resulting in approximately $38 million in additional annual base rate revenue, which includes $5 million of previously approved infrastructure revenue. Our calculated return equity for this black box settlement is 10% with a 52.8% equity ratio. New rates are expected to take effect in late May or early June.","Turning to Slide 10. Let me provide an update on our ongoing rate cases. In New Jersey, we filed a rate case last September, seeking recovery of $868 million in infrastructure upgrades made in less than three years since our last rate adjustment in 2015. At this point, all parties have engaged in settlement talks and we're currently analyzing the recently filed position. While settlement discussions may resume at any point, the company is preparing for a debenture hearings scheduled to begin in June. ","Our customers have already received the rate decrease of almost 6%, effective April 1 of this year, to reflect the impact of the board of public utilities Tax Cuts and Jobs Act docket New Jersey. The company is in act to participate in the tax docket, which is expected to be resolved in June of this year. In West Virginia, we filed an application to adjust rates with the Public Service Commission on Monday, requesting an increase of approximately $29 million in annual revenue already adjusted for tax reform. ","The primary reason for the rate request is the approximately $200 million that the company will invest in, in system improvements to replace and upgrade aging infrastructure since its last rate order in 2016. Our team in West Virginia has worked hard to keep operating expenses relatively flat for the last 10 years by working more efficiently, improving processes, utilizing technology and leveraging economies of scale. The filing also proposes and proactive approach to addressing lead services lines, which is part of our commitment to maintain excellent water quality and protect customer health and safety. ","Moving to the California general rate case for 2018 to 2020. The California public utility commission is considering the impact of the recent tax reform, and we now expect the commission to issue both and proposed decision in a vote on a final decision in the third quarter of this year. Rates will be retroactive to January 1, 2018. ","Turning to Slide 11. Let's continue discussing regulatory matters in California. In March, final decision was issued which authorize California American Water a return on equity of 9.2%, with an equity ratio of 55.39%, up from 53%. I want to thank our California team for working in a collaborative way with all parties to get that result. Lastly, in California, the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary and the California Public Utilities Commission released a favorable final environmental impact report or EIR in March related to our desal project. This is the final plan for the project that meets both the National Environmental Policy Act and California Environmental Quality Act standards. ","It's been six years in the making and after reviewing environmental impacts, the federal and state government believe this is the right project at the right location. The commission will accept final comments and may consider approving the final EIR likely in the third quarter of this year. On the legislative front, Senate Bill 362 is enacted in Indiana during the quarter. This act is part of Indiana's commitment to water is similar to [indiscernible] enacted inNew Jersey in 2017. It sets new standards and requirements for water and wastewater systems in areas such as capital asset management, cost-benefit analysis and cybersecurity programs. ","We believe this legislation along with the legislation in New Jersey is in the best interest of all water customers. And recently, in Iowa and Maryland, fair market value legislation has been enacted, which allows communities to receive an appropriate value for the systems. This legislation provides an independent expert appraisal system that removes roadblocks for communities to solve their water and wastewater challenges. Our state teams have done a great job working with many stakeholders to replicate meaningful legislation across their entire footprint, all to benefit customers. ","Turning to Slide 12. We added 3,700 new customers to-date and have another 47,000 customers through signed agreements. In addition to the 1,500 we added through organic growth. In April, we announced an agreement to acquire Alton's Regional Wastewater System, which will add 23,000 new customers. Illinois American Water has owned, operated and maintained the water system serving Alton for the past 140 years. This is another example like Scranton [indiscernible] where we will deliver efficiencies by providing wastewater services where we already provide water services. ","Alton Mayor Brant Walker said that this agreement, \"puts our wastewater system in its ongoing needs and professional hands with Illinois American Water, a company that's familiar with Alton and its residents. The deal will give existing city employees more training, career advancement and professional development opportunities.\"","And just yesterday, Pennsylvania American Water announced an agreement to acquire the wastewater assets of Stansberry Township in Chester County, which serves approximately 1,000 customers. Here too, our company and our employees have been the long time water service provider for this community and we\u2019re excited for the opportunity to be the future provider of wastewater service to our Stansberry customers.","Moving to Slide 13, doing right by our customers is key to our ability to grow. This means smart investments, balanced by efficient operations and capital deployment. We invested $302 million in our regulated operations this quarter. This was critical to reliable service but it\u2019s also about affordable service. We continue to make progress towards our long-term goal of 32% by 2022 because of our employees and their commitment to our customers.","Let me give you some examples. We continue to see O&M savings associated with the enhanced functionality and integration between our work management systems and our primary asset management systems. Creating, editing or retiring an asset record was historically very cumbersome.","Now our people can access asset records directly through our more user-friendly system called, MapCall. It reduces our time spent on basic asset control functions by approximately one-third. Across the business, this will translate to about 10,000 hours saved per year. We also continue to realize savings in our telecommunications spending. For example, we\u2019re migrating from dedicated leased lines for data to cellular solutions at a fraction of the cost. In New Jersey alone, we\u2019ll save approximately $200,000 in 2018 and we plan to roll this out system-wide in the near term.","Finally, I want to acknowledge the tremendous effort by our employees to deliver exceptional customer service and to manage costs during a brutal winter in the Northeast and Midwest, which as you know, puts tremendous stress on our underground infrastructure. To give you an idea of their challenge in the first quarter, our Missouri team has rest 1,700 main breaks, which is triple the normal rate. And our West Virginia team handled 1,100 main breaks, which is double their normal rate.","I want to thank all of our teams for working safely in frigid and dangerous weather conditions to keep life flowing in our communities. That was a good quarter with continued growth, smart investments and engaged employees driving efficiencies and quality results all to benefit our customers.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Linda for more detail on our financial performance.","Linda Sullivan","Thank you, Walter, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019ll start on Slide 15. We had a strong first quarter. Earnings were $0.59 per share at $0.07 or 13.5%over the first quarter last year. The regulated businesses were up $0.05 or 9.4%. The Market-Based Businesses were up $0.03 and the parent was down $0.01.","Let me walk through our results by business segment in more detail. As I mentioned, our regulated operations were up $0.05. Revenue was up $0.03 in total, and included two major components. A $0.16 increase from authorized rate cases, infrastructure mechanisms and acquisition, including the Pennsylvania rate case settlement, which became effective on January 1 of this year.","Partially offsetting this increase was a $0.13 reserve, which represents the estimated amount of revenue that will benefit our regulated customers as a result of the lower federal tax rate.","Next we had higher production cost of $0.03 per share, mainly from purchase water price and usage increases in California. O&M expense increased $0.06 per share from regulated acquisition growth and higher main breaks resulting from the frigid weather conditions that Walter discussed. Depreciation was higher $0.02 driven by our investment growth. Also our income tax expense was favorable $0.13 mainly from the lower federal tax rate.","Turning to our Market-Based Businesses. The full $0.03 increase was from our Homeowner Services Group due to operational efficiencies from improved management of key contractor partnerships as well as customer growth and the favorable impact of a lower federal tax rate.","Our Military Services Group was flat compared to the prior year as operational improvements offset the impacts from lower capital upgrades for the first quarter of this year, and Keystone was slightly positive compared to the same period last year. And lastly, the parent decreased $0.01 mainly from the lower tax shield on interest expense.","Turning to Slide 16. Let me provide an update on the impacts of tax reform. From an earnings perspective, we continue to see tax reform as largely earnings neutral in 2018 with the lower tax rate benefiting our customers in our regulated businesses and the benefit in our Market-Based Businesses being largely offset by the lower tax shield on interest of the parent.","From a cash flow perspective, we have had some positive developments. In late March, a bill was passed that clarified bonus depreciation eligibility for projects that began before September 27, 2017. With this clarification, we expect to be able to increase estimated bonus depreciation in the range of $150 million to $300 million, which would increase expected cash flow in the range of $30 million to $65 million. This impact is expected to push the timing of when we become a federal cash tax payer into the beginning of 2020.","Now we continue to work through the regulatory process of tax reform with our 14 regulatory jurisdiction. In terms of status, we have adjusted rates to reflect the benefits of the lower tax rate in two states, New Jersey and Illinois. 4 of the remaining 12 states have agreed to address the impacts in their next general rate case. We will continue to work with our regulators on the best approach to return these benefits back to our customers.","And in all of our jurisdiction, we are working to defer amortization of the remeasurement of accumulated deferred income taxes until we receive further clarification. This is the portion required to be normalized or return to customers over the remaining life of the assets. And to date, a few of our jurisdictions have agreed to this deferral.","So overall, we are trending positive on cash flow from our original estimated tax reform impact. In addition, we expect to have a positive impact to operating cash flow from the Pivotal acquisition, which, once closed, is expected to increase overall cash flow from our Market-Based Businesses by 30%. The excellent progress we have made so far this year is due to the tremendous efforts of many employees across our company, especially our finance tax and regulatory teams.","Turning to Slide 17. Let me provide an update on our regulatory filing. We have $110 million in annualized new revenues effective since January 1 of this year. This includes $95 million from the Pennsylvania and Missouri rate case settlements and $15 million from infrastructure mechanisms. We have also filed requests and are awaiting final orders on three rate cases and one infrastructure surcharge for a total annualized revenue request of $165 million after adjustment for the lower federal tax rate.","Turning to Slide 18. Today, we are affirming our 2018 earnings guidance range of $3.22 to $3.32 per share. Although we are off to a strong start this year, we still have nine months of the year to go and as you are all aware, generally, the most significant variable to earnings is weather with the largest impact, typically occurring in the summer months of the third quarter of each year.","Turning to Slide 19. We are committed to continue to deliver value to our customers and shareholders so you may have confidence in our disciplined financial approach. We have consistently delivered strong total shareholder returns far outpacing the UTY index of the one, three and five year period and the S&P 500 to the three and five year period. We\u2019ve been a top leader in dividend growth for six consecutive years, with dividend growth at about 10% and we expect to grow our dividend over the next five years at the top of our 7% to 10% EPS growth range subject to board approval.","And we continue our targeted dividend payout ratio of 50% to 60% of earnings. Our adjusted return on equity improved from 9.7% to 10% for the 12 month period ended March 31. Our weighted average authorized return on equity across our regulated footprint remains approximately 9.8%. And we continue to execute on our commitments and drive value through a continuous improvement culture that focuses on O&M efficiency, capital efficiency and constructive regulatory outcomes. Through this disciplined financial management, customers and shareholders may be confident that American Water will continue to deliver value.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Susan.","Susan Story","Thanks, Linda. I mentioned in my opening remarks that we believe long-term financial success is an outcome of doing everything else right, of successfully executing on the fundamentals of our business. What this means to us is not only developing solid strategies, but also clearly communicating our basic beliefs and philosophies on running a business. What we do and how we do it. Our strategies are in the areas of safety, customers, people, growth and technology and operational efficiency. Our values or how we accomplish these strategies include safety, which is both the value and the strategy, trust, environment leadership, teamwork in high-performance.","So why should you care about any of these? Because this is our core and what we continually evaluate our actions by, not just a bunch of words on a piece of paper. We continually ask ourselves key questions. First, are we providing a safe environment for our employees and the public with all that we do? Are we developing our people to the fullest potential in their jobs? How are we implementing technology to improve customer service and reduced our costs? What are we doing to protect our natural resources and water supply? Are we a respected voice for clean and safe water throughout the U.S.? Will these initiatives lead to higher trust in us by our customers, communities and regulators? Our story is pretty simple and straightforward.","We know and love the business of water and water services. We\u2019re committed to finding and delivering cost-effective solutions to problems and challenges with water supply, water quality and water infrastructure for our customers and communities throughout the country. We truly believe in the importance of values and purpose in all that we do, including and achieving financial results. The world and yes, even the water industry can be a chaotic place at times. Our customers and our investors have plenty of things to worry about. Our goal is not to be one of them. With that, we\u2019re happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from Angie Storozynski with Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Angie Storozynski","Thank you. Two questions. One is a bigger picture question so we\u2019ve seen a lot of corporate M&A involving water utilities and a recurrence of water utility at the big two potentially acquire gas utilities. If you could share your thoughts about it given that you have announced that a number of municipal deals as of late, and again, what\u2019s your take on what\u2019s going on in the industry?","Susan Story","First of all, good morning, Angie and thanks for listening in. It\u2019s interesting. So we don\u2019t really comment on what other companies do, but we are happy to talk about the way we look at things. We constantly survey the environment for opportunities but at the end of the day, we're very comfortable with our growth strategy. And it's very transparent in the triangle, the 5% to 7% from infrastructure investment and we've laid out clearly our plans for that. ","And as we said, we have decades of investment needs and through tax reform and our continuing O&M efficiency, we're finding ways to make that much more affordable for our customers. As you mentioned, the 1% to 2% that we put in our growth triangle is strictly our history of these regulated acquisitions, the stress municipalities being a solution provider for those entities that need help, and then our Market-Based Business, while very limited in what we want to get involved with. We want to do really well in those businesses we know. Like we've mentioned before, homeowner services, military and Keystone. ","So it's interesting, we watched, we're interested, but at the end of the day, as I mentioned in my concluding remarks, our core is water and wastewater services. We think that's what we're really good in. We believe there's lots of opportunities for investment in getting better with investment. And we think that this highly fragmented industry and sector with 53,000 water providers and 17,000 wastewater and so if you are actually managed from an overall coordinated standpoint with an entity as large as we are where we can basically leverage volume procurement and our technology and our size, scope and scale. We think that's very attractive. So we watch, we survey but we're comfortable with our strategies as we have laid them out.","Angie Storozynski","Perfect. And my second question to Linda. So given your updated views on operating cash flow especially in light of the Pivotal acquisition, have you been in discussions with credit agencies and do you think that this improvement is going to be sufficient for you guys to avoid any potential credit downgrades.","Linda Sullivan","Yes, and we are constantly working with our credit rating agencies. We have meetings set up on an annual basis and we would expect to continue to hold those meetings. We were also in discussions with our credit rating agencies with regard to the Pivotal acquisition. And so we're continuing to work through that. As we mentioned, when tax reform was implemented, that we would expect our FFO-to-debt metrics to drift a bit lower as a result of tax reform. ","We've been making positive improvements on the cash flow front since then and we'll continue to look in and to manage our cash flow very carefully. And we do have to remember that, that is one metric that the rating agencies look at. Probably the bigger item around ratings is the risk profile of the water and wastewater industry. And that has not changed, and so -- and we sit very well within that in the industry here.","Angie Storozynski","Okay, thank you.","Linda Sullivan","Thank you, Angie.","Operator","Our next question comes from Richard Verdi with Atwater Thornton. Please go ahead. ","Richard Verdi","Hi, good morning, everyone, and thank you for taking my call and great quarter too. ","Susan Story","Thanks, Rich.","Richard Verdi","I'm quite clear on everything but I have a question on another area outside of the quarter and it pertains to safety culture. As you guys all know, I'm pretty active with presenting on the conference circuit and for about the past two years, I've noticed the topic of safety and protection has become the more and more prominent area discussed by other presenters at these events. And originally, it could be considered filler but it really does appear that this is an emerging trend with some potential for positive impact. I was at the Southwest Infrastructure Water Summit earlier this week and [indiscernible] of American Water, which is discussing how the companies at the forefront of ensuring employee safety.","It was interesting because he was delivering remarks stating that Americans basically considering a bunch of different technologies, one of which is robotics. And so I was just wondering if you could share with me what implementing these technologies could mean for employee safety and what that could do for both the American Water financials as well as for the customer because thinking about depending on how that's implemented, it could be a cost and not an investment.","Susan Story","Great, that's a great question. First of all, I will start with and we tell this to all of our almost 7,000 employees. Number one thing that every employee goes home to his or her family and it's good a shape as they came to work with. I don't believe that any company can be a great company if people get hurt or killed at work period. Nothing else you do. I mean, it sends a message as to what value you put on humans, people and the nature of our business. I think that's a core value that we all have to have. That's why it\u2019s a value and I mentioned its also a strategy. ","Strategically, as you mentioned some of the things we've done on technology we're very excited. We actually launched an internal safety app last week. What this app does is it allows people in the field to be able to go and say and some of this is already functional and the rest will be functional in a few months. I go out to a location and it's a meter or a pump or something I'm not accustomed to. I can take a picture of it. It will code in and show me exactly what I need to do in terms of operational processes. It will let me take a picture and send in and say, this looks stranger. I need additional equipment. ","Can someone send me equipment out? There is an investment in the technology but the savings in terms of just fundamentally getting the job done right the first time, avoiding injuries, avoiding the cost that come with injuries. Number one, it's the right thing to do to focus on employee and by the way safety for the general public. If when you're a water company safety is not number one not just for employees but also for the public in terms of the services as you provide and how you provide it, then I think that company is not going to be long-term financially successful. ","So we're very excited about what we're doing and in terms robotics, for example, a lot of the work that our folks in the front line have to do is very manual, very physical. We're investing in technology for example, putting devices on trucks that will open up some of the valve, that will open up and list some of the meters that weigh 50, 60 pounds, with aging workforces others have, finding ways to reduce those tissues, those strain sprain. So yes, it is an upfront investment, but it is an investment that's paying off from a people standpoint and it's also we're finding paying off from a financial standpoint. Walter, you might want to add something.","Walter Lynch","Yes, thank you, Susan. Safety is number one in our company and the safety culture is just taking off for our company because as Susan said, there's nothing more important than our employees going home at the end of the day in the same condition in which they came in. And we talked about it but it's also important that we go out and we demonstrated with new technology. And one of things we're doing, we've talked in the past about drones. We're using drones to do things that before we used to do with people, climbing on water tanks to inspect water tanks and now we're using drones to inspect water tanks. Also above ground water lines, we're using drones to inspect those. So we're looking at every available technology to make sure that what we're doing is in the interest of our employees and we're doing it in the safest way.","Richard Verdi","That\u2019s interesting. Thank you very much guys. I appreciate the time. It\u2019s really interesting and again great quarter, I appreciate it. Thank you.","Susan Story","Thanks, Rich.","Operator","And our last question today will be from Claire Zeng with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Claire Zeng","Hi, great quarter. Thank you so much for taking the question.","Susan Story","Thanks, Claire.","Claire Zeng","Yes. So I wanted to do two quick housekeeping items on the Market-Based Businesses. So the first is, I think with the Pivotal transaction, you guys are coming pretty close to the 15% mark for EPS contribution from your unregulated businesses. Just wanted to get your thoughts there on, is that how you think about that 15% or is that metric has little more flexibility and the timing for that?","Linda Sullivan","Yes, Claire, thank you for the question. And the way that what we disclosed is part of the Pivotal acquisition is that although this acquisition really kind of nearly doubles the size of our HOS business. We expect over the next five years to continue to see the entire Market-Based Business representing less than 15% of our total earnings per share. And so you're absolutely right there that, that's what we see. And when we stepped back and strategically looked at the overall risk profile of the company, the 15% to 20% of our Market-Based Businesses is where our comfort zone is, and only up to 20% if it is something that has a regulated type risk profile. So more regulated like in that regard. And so that's where we are. It does not change our fundamental strategy at all in terms of our Market-Based Business or the overall outlook of how large those businesses could become.","Susan Story","And Claire, this is Susan, and to add to that, when you think about how small market base is for our total business, when we talk about doubling Homeowner Services as Linda said, it's still such a small part of our overall business because regulated currently is about 90%. It takes a lot to really move that. So something like this really, as Linda said, over the next five years, it can move as closer to the 15% but that's given that we don't do other things. So our goal is, we really prefer the 15%, which you said regulated like. That's something like military where you get the 50-year contracts. So that you have some certainty there. That's what we consider to be regulated like. So right now, we're very comfortable with it being right at and below 15%.","Claire Zeng","Got it. That\u2019s really helpful color. Thank you. And the second question is, since you've had a bit of time to review the Pivotal transaction. Just to be sure that you guys are still saying it will be ratable in terms of earnings contribution as in it will be 0 maybe 3, 6, 9, 12. Just wanted to get some color on that.","Linda Sullivan","Absolutely. So what we disclosed was that, we would be earnings neutral in 2018 after transition costs. And this is assuming that we closed in the second quarter. We'll be accretive in the first full calendar year 2019 and then that accretion would steadily grow to about $0.12 per share by 2022. Now that said, we will do a purchase price allocation upon closing and these businesses, as you are aware are capital light. But they do have some capital investments and operational and customer system. And we plan to integrate those systems over time and that will likely require accelerated depreciation as we move to integrate the system. And that's why we built in this gradual accretion. We need to close it first and then we'll detailed integration plan.","Claire Zeng","Got it. That\u2019s all for me. Thank you.","Linda Sullivan","Thanks, Claire.","Operator","This will conclude the question-and-answer session. So with that, I'd like turn the conference back over to Susan Story for any closing remarks.","Susan Story","Thank you, Brian, and thanks to everybody for participating in our call today. Please know again that we value you as our investor owners and as the financial analysts who research our company for the benefit of your clients and their futures. We always want to be open and transparent in all of our discussions and dealings with you so you can have confidence in your decisions around our company and the investments in our stock. If we've not been able to address your questions or if you have additional questions, please call Ed and Ralph and they will be happy to help. I'd like to remind everyone that our annual shareholders meeting will take place next week from Friday on Friday, May 11.

Mr. Vallejo, you may begin.","Edward Vallejo","Thank you, Phil, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for today\u2019s call. As usual we will keep the call to about an hour and at the end of our prepared remarks, we will open the call for any of your questions.","During the course of this conference call, both in our prepared remarks and answers to your questions, we may make Forward-Looking Statements that represent our expectations regarding our future performance or other future events.

Now all these statements of this related to earnings and earnings per share refer to diluted earnings and earnings per share.","And with that, I will now turn the call over to American Water\u2019s President and CEO, Susan Story.","Susan Story","Thanks, Ed. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us. Today our CFO, Linda Sullivan will cover in detail the fourth quarter and full-year financial results, and our COO, Walter Lynch who will give key updates on our operations.","2018 was a very eventful year for American Water, beginning with historic tax reform, the conclusion of several key rate cases and active acquisition year in both regulated and market based businesses, the sale and its continuation of a few market based business lines and a sharp focus on deploying smart technology and excelling at business fundamentals.","Through it all, we further strengthened our loan risk and predictable growth story. We experienced continued growth in our regulated businesses from investment, acquisitions, and organic growth. Our market based businesses achieved very strong year-over-year growth led the Keystone impairment and provided increased cash to our overall business.","Our $3.30 adjusted EPS is an 8.9% increase over adjusted 2017 EPS. We are affirming our 2019 EPS guidance range of $3.54 to $3.64 per share and we continue our focus on achieving the top half of our 7% to 10% EPS growth CAGR guidance though 2023.","Our fundamental story at American Water remains the same and our performance is consistent as we report another strong year of results for 2018. The capital investment we make in regulated operations continues to be the foundation for our growth. $1.5 billion of the total of $2 billion that we invested in 2018 was for regulated infrastructure improvement with almost $400 million for acquisitions including our acquisition of Pivotal.","Let me mention a few of our 2018 highlights. First, and most importantly we continued to be a safer Company in which our employees work. We finished 2018 with fewer employee injuries than in any other year recorded in our Company's history. But we won't be satisfied until we have zero injuries throughout our business.","We continued our commitment to the highest levels of water quality, the environment and our customers safety by leveraging new and groundbreaking technologies. We had installed additional surface water monitoring panel at all of our major surface water intake and we are working on a comprehensive data analytics strategy that will enhance our ability to detect issues and respond accordingly.","This one hits the protections we provide to our customers. Phases 2 and 3 of these systems scheduled for this year will utilize Artificial Intelligence and machine learning. We are also implementing technology tools for our front line employee that will enhance communication and mobility to empower our people to significantly improve our customer experience.","And as we invest, we work to lower O&M cost and deploy capital as efficiently as possible while also leveraging our buying power and strategic sourcing to drop cost savings. Walter will talk a bit further about these in just a moment.","We also experienced strong customer growth. We added 25,000 new customers in the reg business through closed acquisitions and organic growth. We have an additional 61,000 customer connections under agreement for acquisitions pending regulatory approval.","Our portfolio of market based businesses also provided strong growth by leveraging our core competences, using little to no capital and generating healthy cash flows.","We completed the $365 million acquisition of Pivotal, welcoming 650,000 new customers. In our legacy home owner services organization, we launched partnerships with Philadelphia and Fort Wayne, Indiana and received intent to award notices for new partnership with San Francisco, Toledo, Ohio and Pinellas County Florida.","We also added our 14th military base with the addition of Fort Leonard Wood army base in Missouri, and we took steps to optimize our market based businesses, selling the majority of our contract services and narrowing Keystone Clear Waters operations to its more predictable and profitable water trends for business.","With that, I will turn it over to Walter.","Walter Lynch","Thanks, Susan and good morning, everyone. As Susan mentioned, our regulated businesses had a strong year all around with historic capital investment, strategic acquisitions and continued O&M efficiency that benefits our customers.","Turning to Slide 8. There was a significant amount of progress in the regulatory front throughout 2018 and continuing into 2019. Let me start with the New Jersey rate case. In October New Jersey American Water received in order to finalizing its rate case which was driven by more than $868 million in capital investment since our last rate case in 2015.","The new rates represent a $40 million annual increase in water and waste water revenue with an authorized return in equity of 9.6% at an equity ratio of 54% up from 53% in the last case. The Board of Public Utilities also approved the rolling of $35 million distribution system improving charge.","New Jersey American Water is providing breeze on single issue not covered by the settlement mainly the rate recovery of the acquisition adjustments for [indiscernible] acquisitions. We expect the decision by the end of the second quarter.","Pennsylvania American Water received in order for its rate case with an authorized return on equity of 10% at an equity ratio of 53.75%. These new rates were effective in January 1st, 2018 and represent approximately $1.3 billion in investment to protect public health in more than 400 communities served by Pennsylvania American Water.","In May, Missouri American Water received in order to finalizing their rate case resulting in approximately $38 million in additional annualized revenue with an authorized return on equity of 10% at an equity ratio of 52.8%. The new rates were driven by approximately $255 million in investment since our last rate case.","In mid-December, California American Water received an order finalizing its rate case for the period 2018 to 2020. The order approved approximately $171 million in capital investment during this three year period.","As a reminder, the return on equity of 9.2% at an equity ratio of 55% were approved in a separate cost of capital proceeding. These rates are retroactive to the beginning of 2018. We also received approval of our request for a pilot program which waves the customer service fee for payments made by credit card.","Rate consolidation of several systems in northern and central California and a continuation of our low income rate payer systems program. In a separate preceding, we received approval for the Monterey Peninsula Water Supply Project, which is a critical water supply solution for more than 40,000 customer connections.","Moving to 2019, in West Virginia. We received approval of the settlement agreement earlier this month, with an authorized return on equity of 9.75% at an equity ratio of 48.4%. This case was driven by the Company's ongoing infrastructure investments of more than $200 million into flash rate case in 2016.","Additionally the Company's distribution system improvement charge or DSIC will be reset to provide for additional investment. This DSIC surcharge will be offset by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.","In Maryland, we received approval of settlement agreement for new water rates earlier this month, with an estimated return on equity of 9.9% at an equity ratio 48.66%. The case was driven by $18 million of investments made since 2015.","During that time, the Company constructed a new 90 million gallon reservoir and intake. This new reservoir is now is service and provides a long-term safe and reliable water supply and economic opportunity for that region.","On Slide 9, you can see that there continues to be substantial progress in the legislative side as well. In Indiana, ACT 362 the Indiana Water Commitments Act was approved in 2018. It focuses on environmental permitting and state revolving loan funds with periodic reviews for the utilities, ensuring adequate investment, rates and environmental compliance.","In Pennsylvania, the redevelopments on three separate acts, ACT 120 became effective in December of 2018 and allows a water utility to include the replacement cost per customer owned lead by service lines in rate base.","ACT 58 clarifies the public utility commissions authority to approve alternate rates and rate mechanisms, such as decoupling mechanisms, performance based rates, formula rates and multiyear plans.","ACT 12 pertain the fair market value was constructively clarified and allows for communities to monetize their assets and redirect the proceeds for other projects, like streets, parks and equipment for first responders.","Illinois fair market value legislation was expanded and extended from five years to 10 years continuing to allow utilities to acquire systems and streamlining regulatory approval process. Maryland and Iowa have also enacted similar fair market value legislation.","We now have eight states within our regulatory footprint with this enabling legislation. In California, three bills were signed that benefit communities and water and wastewater customers by removing barriers for the communities to seek solutions.","On the Federal side, the Water Infrastructure Act was signed into law in 2018. The result of this law include policies that set a course for enhanced water compliance and improved management for water systems across the country. All these efforts held by our Company to provide solutions in water and wastewater challenges across our footprint.","Turning to Slide 10. 2018 was also a great year for growth. We welcomed more than 14,000 customer connections through closed acquisitions, most recently in Roxbury New Jersey and Sheridan Indiana.","We also welcomed 11,000 customer connections to organic growth and we will welcome another 61,000 customer connections through 23 signed agreements in 10 different states. This again highlights our ability to grow across our footprint as we continue to provide solutions for our communities.","Turning to Slide 11. Our smart investments must be balanced by efficient operations and capital deployment. In 2018, we invested $1.5 billion on a regulated operations. Investment remains critical to ensure reliable service, but for us it's also about affordable service.","We continue to make progress towards our long-term O&M efficiency target of 31.5% by 2023. You can see the progress we made in our O&M efficiency ratio going from 46.1% in 2010 to 35.6% in 2018.","To put this out in the perspective, our adjusted O&M expenses only slightly higher today than they were in 2012, with the compound annual growth rate of just 0.6%. During that time, we have invested more than $7 billion in infrastructure and added about 150,000 customer connections. We are extremely proud of how we are managing our O&M expense.","For example, our corporate supply chain we are partnered with our technology and innovation team in 2018 to deliver $1.4 million in [indiscernible] account savings through improved contract terms. We expect these savings to continue through 2019.","On Slide 12, we are pleased to announce a few of our notable accomplishments during the final quarter of 2018. Our water supply project in Monterey received two distinguish awards. It was chosen as the environmental project of the year by the local chapter of the American Public Works Association.","And it also won an award from the Association of Environmental Professions, each year this organization rewards projects that best align with California's environmental focus. Also our reservoir in Maryland is now finals for the Maryland Engineering Excellence Award.","And finally, Missouri American Water recently received funding from the EPA's WIFIA program for projects in Joplin and St. Louis. The project in Joplin is a much-needed 12 billion gallon reservoir and ensure reliable water supply for the 240,000 people in that service area.","In St. Louis, we will be replacing 100 miles of lanes and lead service lines. WIFIA program accelerates investment in our nation's water infrastructure by providing long-term low-cost supplemental loans for regionally and nationally significant projects.","With that, I will turn the call over to Linda for more detail on our financial performance.","Linda Sullivan","Thanks you, Walter, and good morning, everyone.","Let me start with our fourth quarter and full-year 2018 financial results on Slide 14. For the quarter, GAAP earnings were $0.62 per share compared to a loss of a penny in the same period last year. In the fourth quarter of both years, we adjusted GAAP earnings for the remeasurement of differed taxes resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.","You may recall that due to the complexity of the Act the SEC provided companies a one year window to finalize their estimates. We have now completed that process and recorded a $12 million or $0.07 charge in the fourth quarter of 2018 for the final remeasurement.","Excluding this item in both years, adjusted fourth quarter earnings was $0.69 per share flat to the prior year as we expected mainly from a $0.05 favorable depreciation adjustment in the fourth quarter of 2017 and I will discuss the quarter in more detail in a moment.","Our full-year GAAP earnings was $3.15 per share in 2018 which includes several adjustments, the remeasurement of differed taxes I just discussed, the gain from sale as the majority of contract operations, the impairment at Keystone and the final favorable insurance settlement related to the Freedom Industries chemical spill. Excluding these items and similar items in 2017, our adjusted earnings was $3.30 per share up 8.9% over adjusted earnings in 2017.","Turning to Slide 15. Let me discuss the fourth quarter adjusted results in more details. Our regulated businesses were up $0.05 in total. Revenue was up $0.18 from rate authorizations to support capital investments acquisitions and organic growth. This revenue was reduced by the $0.16 impact from the lower Federal tax rate expected to benefit regulated customers.","O&M expense increased $0.05 in total, with about $0.02 supporting regulated acquisitions and growth and the remainder related to timing of certain maintenance and repairs including a penny expenses in New Jersey.","Depreciation expense increased $0.09, $0.04 from investment growth and $0.05 from the benefit recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 to reflect the full-year new depreciation rates approved in Illinois as I mentioned earlier. And income tax expense was favorable $0.16 from the lower Federal tax rate.","Turning to our market based businesses. They were down a penny in total, with the impact from Keystones final close out at the construction business more than offsetting growth in our homeowner services group.","The parent company was down $0.04 from queue items, half from the lower tax yield on the interest expense from the lower Federal tax rate and about half from the tax return true up in the fourth quarter of 2018.","Turning to Slide 16. Our full-year 2018 adjusted earnings were $3.30 per share an 8.9% increase over 2017 adjusted earnings. We had strong growth across the Company in 2018 with our regulated operation up $0.23 per share from investment and acquisition growth, our market based businesses up $0.09 primarily from growth in homeowner services including the Pivotal acquisition and the positive impact from tax reform. And the parent was down $0.05 mainly from the lower tax yield on interest expense.","Overall a strong year with consistent execution across all businesses and that can only happen with the dedicated commitment of our employees across the Company.","Turning to Slide 17. Walter reviewed our rate case activities for 2018 and 2019 and that activity resulted in a total of $201 million in new annualized revenues effective since January 1st, 2018. This includes $171 million of new annualized revenue in 2018 and $30 million from new annualized revenue so far in 2019. We are also awaiting final orders on three rate cases and one infrastructure charge for a total outstanding revenue request of $45 million.","Slide 18 highlights our key financial performance metrics that continue to create customer and shareholder value. We invested capital of $2 billion in 2018 including $1.5 billion of regulated system improvements to better serve our customers and $33 million in close regulated acquisitions that added 14,000 new customer connections.","These investments increased our estimated rate base at year-end 2018 to $12.6 billion an 8.7% increase from the prior year. We also completed the $355 million acquisition of Pivotal and the remaining $100 million was primarily for our new headquarters building and as a reminder our headquarters building is eligible for up to $154 million in New Jersey tax credit that will be paid out over the next 10 years. And importantly we estimate this move to be revenue neutral for our regulated customers.","Our cash flow from operations held steady even with the impacts of Tax Reform. This was due to our strong adjusted net income growth and the increase in cash flow from our market based businesses mainly from the Pivotal acquisition.","Also we continue to expect to begin to pay cash taxes late this year and be a full-year cash tax payer in 2020. So what does that mean from the cash flow perspective? It means that given the continuation of accelerated depreciation, repairs and other deductions, we expect cash taxes to be roughly half of our book taxes beginning in 2020 under our long-term plan.","Our adjusted return on equity improved from 9.9% to 10.1%. Our weighted average authorized return on equity across our regulated footprint is approximately 9.8% with a weighted equity ratio at about 51.5%. and I would like to note that the equity ratio represents an increase of more than four percentage points from year-end 2017.","Our actual adjusted ROE of 10.1% reflects the continued value of our market based businesses and our regulated businesses efforts to narrow the gap between authorized and achieved returns through a continuous improvement culture that focuses on both O&M and capital efficiency.","We have been a top leader in dividend growth, we have grown our dividend at\/or above 10% for six consecutive years and we expect to grow our dividend over the next five years at the top of our 7% to 10% EPS growth range subject to Board approval. Also we continue to target a dividend payout ratio of 50% to 60% of earnings.","Turning to Slide 19. We are today affirming our 2019 EPS guidance range of $3.54 to $3.64 per share. At the guidance midpoint that represents an 8.8% increase over 2018 adjusted EPS. The major variables included in our guidance range are consistent with what we have shown you before with plus or minus $0.06 of normal weather variability being the most significant. Events or variations outside of these ranges could cause our results to differ.","In our 2019 through 2023 financial plan, we are affirming EPS growth in the top half of our 7% to 10% compound annual growth rate while investing capital in the range of $8 billion to $8.6 billion mainly for our regulated customers and with our strong balance sheet we do not see a need to issue additional equity under normal operating conditions.","With that, I will turn it back over to Susan.","Susan Story","Thank you Linda. America Waters has created a foundation based on continued execution of our strategies and this navigates us through market ups and downs and drives our long-term success. At a recent business dinner a non utility colleague asked me directly, \"So with your evaluations why should I invest in American Water?\" I laid out our investment thesis as summarized on this slide which many of you are familiar with, but which we are never tired of discussing.","There are too many of these to address on this call, but as always we will be happy to engage with you at a later time on any or all of these factors. And all this is deemed to the 7100 people who are American Water.","Once again when subzero temperatures hit in early January of this year, our folks were out there working 24 hours a day so that our customers have the precious resource of water at their faucets as well as critical fire protection and sanitation services.","We had many great challenges throughout the Midwest, Mid-Atlantic, and northeast, but none were dramatic than in Iowa and Up State Michigan where temperatures dipped to minus 25 degrees with minus 50 degree wind shield.","While we only worked emergencies during this brutal cold, we doubled and tripled crew sizes to enable very short work cycles and we provided the best protective equipment possible to ensure employees safety as they heroically work in this temperature into spring. These folks are amazing and they are the heart and soul what makes us successful.","It is our firm belief that companies do well by doing good. More and more employees customers and inventors think to align themselves with companies who have responsible policies, make a positive impact in their communities, lead in protecting the planet, investing their employees and operate in an open and transparent manner. We believe when you do these things responsibly long-term financial sustainability follows.","It was just announced last week that for the second year in a row American Water was named to Barron's 100 most sustainable companies. This year, we ranked highest of all utilities of any type coming in at number 23 up from 36 last year.","It was also announced last month that we were selected for the 2019 Bloomberg Gender Equality Index one of only 230 companies globally. And as shown on this chart these recognitions joined others such as our inclusion in last year\u2019s NAACP inaugural index line.","We have in business for 133 years and we want to be in business for at least that many more. We have succeeded through world wars, market swing, company ownership changes, macro and technology disruptions and the full continuum of political and regulatory policy.","We have provided our shareholders with 140% PSR over the past five years. We have provided clear and transparent insight into our future with decades of needed investments. We have a strong history of executing on our strategy through efficiencies in both O&M cost and capital deployment.","Our regulated capital investment is low risk, consisting of over 100 different water projects per year reducing the overall risk of any single project to our plan. And our commitment to our shareholders continued through dividend growth guidance at the high end of our 7% to 10% EPS growth guidance.","History matters, experience matters, and predictability matters, and that is why we are confident in our business and growth for the future.","Thank you. And we are happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Angie Storozynski with Macquarie Research. Please go ahead.","Angie Storozynski","Thank you very much. Great results as always. I have a question about your market based businesses. How is the Pivotal acquisition or its integration into your business going on versus your original growth plans for this platform? I mean what are you seeing now? And secondly, how should we think about Keystone\u2019s earnings contributions embedded in your 2019 guidance? Thank you.","Susan Story","Well I will start and Angie and then Linda can pickup. So the Pivotal integration has grown - really going exceedingly well, better than actually we thought it would. Culturally a great fit. As you saw from the numbers that Linda presented a very, very good year for the entire homeowner services organization and Pivotal was part of that as well as the legacy homeowner services which actually won five key partnerships which adds a tremendous impact on the future profitability and cash that we get from that business.","And before I turn it over to Linda to talk about the financials, just quickly on Keystone. So as we mentioned on the third quarter call, so we had shutdown the trucking of water business and the construction business. And we are focusing on water transfer only and as we pointed out it was the most predictable and profitable.","One thing to-date even this year we are seeing that hypothesis prove out with a very strong year to water transfer thus far in 2019. And as Linda said, you saw a little bit at the end of 2014 impact financially as we are taking finally closing out the entire construction business.","Linda Sullivan","Yes, and I can add to that Angie. In terms of the Pivotal integration as Susan said its going very well. And in terms of our financial projection they are coming in as expected. And so we stand by our original projections that are included in the five year plan.","From the perspective again as Susan mentioned, we closed out the construction business in the fourth quarter. So the bulk of that was impacted fourth quarter. We are seeing early this year the results as we anticipated and so we are excited about that we will update you more in the first quarter.","Angie Storozynski","Great and my follow-up question maybe a little bit unfair, I admit it. So you are another large water company is about to have a very big equity issuance granted that it is to finance a gas acquisition. But do you think that will have a negative impact on your stock or you evaluation? Do you think that is just too early from the funds flow perspective this money would be coming in from your stock? Or you think that this diversification into the gas utility sector is actually going to attract the different source of money?","Susan Story","Well, Angie as always we don\u2019t comment on other companies, but I will tell you in terms of American Water, the space for water is very scarce as you know and also for us we are seeing a significant growing focus on ESG and being a water utility positions us very strategically in that space.","We are seeing a lot of interest as you probably notice globally, not just with utility fronts, but global infrastructure, global environment front. So there is a lot of money looking for good places to go.","We think we are the best place for that money to go and so we are just going to continue to telling our story and we think there is a lot of interest given the story that we have got and the proven execution on these strategies and the fundamentals that we trying to exhibit every year, every quarter, every day.","Angie Storozynski","Very good. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Durgesh Chopra","Hey team, good morning. So just to start off, I have two questions. First in the quarter, Linda just is it fair to assume that when I look at the parent other segment quarter-over-quarter, majority of that $0.04 lower earnings contribution is Tax Reform related to that sort of a one-time event and as we are looking to do our 2019 models that should pretty much go away?","Linda Sullivan","Yes, absolutely. $0.02 in the quarter was associated with Tax Reform and then when you move into 2019 that will be comparable year-over-year. And the other $0.02 was associated with the tax return true up that we had in the fourth quarter. Generally we true up either in the third or fourth quarter of each year.","Durgesh Chopra","Perfect, thanks. And then just going back to Walter. Any color on the acquisition adjustment here, any more color. I don\u2019t know if you can provide maybe perhaps what rate base that is. And then just what are we assuming in 2019 guidance as it relates to what might be the outcome of those hearings?","Walter Lynch","Yes, Durgesh, just briefly on the adjustments, we submitted briefs and we are going to continue to work with the Board of Public Utilities to provide our side of the stories to why there should be recovery on those acquisitions. And as I said, we are looking at the end of the second quarter for the decision to come out from VP. I can't give a whole lot more guidance on that at this point.","Durgesh Chopra","That is fair. Thank you guys.","Susan Story","Thanks Durgesh.","Operator","The next question comes from Richard Verdi with Coker & Palmer. Please go ahead.","Richard Verdi","Hey good morning guys. Thank you for talking my call and great quarter. I wanted to follow-up actually on your first callers first enquiry, I had a very similar question, but I want to bring it back to the fourth quarter the way it was reported and kind of just give a little bit of an explanation for it.","So on a consolidated basis, the Company beat our top-line estimate, but when I break it down and I look at the regulated revenue America reported $717 million, that's exactly what we have and the $30 million outperformance came on the non-regulated side. And my thinking is well maybe I didn't capture, maybe there were sales in there from the Keystone trucking and construction sale that maybe I should have picked up or it could have come from added strength from Pivotal that it just came in better than expected.","So I'm wondering if you could just share and give a little bit more detail. How much of that non-regulated sales for the quarter? How much of that was from the Keystone construction and trucking? Did we just pick it up for October? And then how much of it was really from that Pivotal strengths? Because you know going forward modeling, I don't want to underestimate Pivotal obviously, and I don't want to add in trucking construction when it\u2019s no longer going to be there.","Linda Sullivan","Yes, Rich this is Linda. And if you look in the appendix to the slides, on Slide 30 we included additional detail on revenue, because of all of the moving parts in the fourth quarter. And you can see on that slide deck HOS from a revenue perspective was up $76 million of revenue and that was due to the better results for HOS as well as the integration of Pivotal.","Keystone was up $6 million year-over-year from a quarter perspective, I\u2019m sorry this is the full-year. $6 million Keystone was up and that is primarily from the increase in the water transfer business. And then we had lower revenue results from military services just from lower capital upgrades as well as our contract services group from the sale of that group this year. So that is included in the breakdown for revenue on Page 30 and I think that will help you.","Susan Story","For a clarification Rich, we did not sell Keystone's construction business or trucking. We shut it down. There was no revenue, that was related to that. And in our non-GAAP earnings we did not include the benefits from the sale of CSG. We simply did not include that, nor did we include a positive outcome from an interim sale. So what Linda said is, you look at that chart, this is truly from ongoing operations, this does not include any revenues from one-time sales.","Richard Verdi","Got it, okay. I'm sorry, I meant to say shut it down, I'm sorry I misspoke, I'm trying to think. Got it. okay, thank you for that. And then the second question is for the regulated acquisition front. I'm just wondering if there are any states where the Company is more heavily focused the next five years?","And the reason why I asked that is because I noticed just the other day that the New Jersey assembly and the Senate approved a bill where local governments are going to be allowed to tax homeowners and companies that have very large paid surfaces because the pollutants from those surfaces are seeping into the water systems and so the extra tax revenue is going to be used for upgrading water systems and what have you.","But thinking about it I mean no one want extra taxes right, higher taxes. So that is going to be very supportive of privatization. And then when you think about - so you think about that New Jersey you think about WIPA you think about the Water Accountability Act, you think that American Water is headquartered in New Jersey. You would think logically well, this is very supportive on the regulated acquisition front for American to really dive deeper into New Jersey. But at the same time the Company also wants to remain diversified.","So just wondering if you could give us just some sort of color on that regulated acquisition front. Its maybe you are leaning more towards New Jersey or if there are any other states maybe who are more heavily focused on in next five years?","Walter Lynch","Great question Rich, thanks for that. We are focused on growing really across our footprint and I think as I said, we closed 23 acquisitions in 10 states, which shows that we are focused on growing across our footprint.","Our state teams are leading this charge and they are focused on again providing solutions for communities in need and that's really what we are focused on. Yes, there are some great space New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Missouri, Indiana, Illinois that really have advanced I think the notion of private water companies providing solutions and you look at all the fair market value legislation out there that is encouraging us to do these kind of acquisitions.","So we are really excited about the growth opportunities. As we said before, we have over 500,000 customer opportunities in our pipeline and that is because we are providing solutions and our communities recognize that and it\u2019s just something we are very, very proud of.","Susan Story","And Rich you bring up a really good point and I think is going to be an ongoing policy move throughout the United States which is the actions the New Jersey is taking with all the concerns about contaminates and with all of the focus on the [perfluoro] (Ph) chemicals especially.","We think that with the Water Quality Accountability Act with the things that are happening you are correct this does position us not just in New Jersey but in all of our states. Because for example on the perfluoro chemicals and that is the generic name for whether you are talking about PFOAs or PFNAs or name any of these type of chemicals.","And why that is interesting is that while there was a lot of discussion around the EPAs position to not immediately form a maximum contaminant level, what most people may not understand is EPA does currently have a non-enforceable health advisory a [70 parts per trillion] (Ph).","Well at American water we don\u2019t wait for maximum contaminant levels, when the EPA has health advisories, we actually ensure that our systems are consistent with that. So we are already meeting the existing EPA health advisory. We test for it, we check for it, before it even becomes an MCL.","Now I don\u2019t know what that number is for municipalities, I don\u2019t know what that number is for the companies, but I think your broader point which is as we see this in New Jersey, you see this as we think that that will become an issue everywhere, in all of our states we are starting to see a lot of concern about these contaminant.","And as Walter said, when we talk about being a solutions provider, it\u2019s not just buying answers and providing hopefully better service when we go in, because this is all we do water and wastewater, but it\u2019s also providing critical health solutions for things like emerging contaminant.","And also as Walter said in his comment, in some of states we are actually seeing the ability for us to go in and replace customer led service lines even if the lead's not in our pipes, because we can do it more cheaply as we are replacing our pipes.","So that is the broader story around us being a solutions providing. And I think what you mentioned is going to be an increasing theme across this country as there is more and more concerns in all the states about these contaminants.","Richard Verdi","That is very interesting and excellent color. I really appreciate the time guys. Great quarter, great color and thank you very much.","Susan Story","Thank you.","Operator","Okay. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Susan Story for any closing remarks.","Susan Story","Thank you, Phil. And thanks everybody for participating in our call today. As always, we value you as our investor owners and as the financial analysts who research our Company for the benefit of your clients and their financial futures.","We will always be open and transparent in all of our discussions and dealings with you, because we want you have to complete confidence in your decisions around our Company and the investments in our stock.","If we have not been able to address your questions or you have additional questions, please call Ed or Ralph, and they will be happy to help. We look forward to talking to you again in our 2019 first quarter earnings call that will be on May the 2nd and our Annual Stock Conference meeting which will take place on Friday May the 10th.","Thanks again for listening. We hope everybody has a great rest of your week.","Operator","The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

As a reminder, this call is being recorded and is also being webcast with accompanying slide presentation through the company's website, www.amwater.com. Following the earnings conference call, an audio archive of the call will be available through August 15, 2014, by dialing 1 (412) 317-0088 for U.S. and international callers.

The online archive of the webcast will be available through September 7, 2014, by accessing the Investor Relations page of the company's website located at www.amwater.com.","[Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Ed Vallejo, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Vallejo, you may begin.","Edward D. Vallejo","Thank you, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for today's call. As usual, we'll keep our call to about an hour, and at the end of our prepared remarks, we will have time for questions.","But before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that during the course of this conference call, both in our prepared remarks and in answers to your questions, we may make statements related to future performance. Our statements represent our most reasonable estimates. However, since these statements deal with future events, they are subject to numerous risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual performance of American Water to be materially different from the performance indicated or implied by such statements. And such risk factors are set forth in the company's SEC filings.","With that, now I'd like to turn the call over to American Water's President and CEO, Susan Story.","Susan N. Story","Thanks, Ed. Good morning to everyone and thanks for joining us on this call. As you know, this is the first earnings call with our new leadership team in place. I'm joined today by Linda Sullivan, our Senior VP and CFO, who will be going over the second quarter financials; and Walter Lynch, our President and COO of Regulated Operations, who will give us updates on key matters in our Regulated Business.","We're very fortunate to have such a talented management team, and I'm also glad to report that through the hard work of all of our employees at American Water, we've once again delivered a quarter of strong performance.","Before I go any further on our results for the quarter, I do want to touch on 2 recent events. It's not often that water makes national headlines, but it did twice last week. One event centered on the major water main break on the campus of UCLA, and the other event was an algae bloom that impacted the drinking water of over 400,000 people in Toledo, Ohio. While neither event impacted American Water directly, both of these events highlight the importance of water supply sources and infrastructure. For many years, American Water and folks throughout our water industry had been raising the challenges that our country faces when it comes to our water systems and supply. Later in the call, I'm going to mention several efforts that we've got underway at American Water so that we can find solutions to these challenges.","It's our hope that in the near future, it will be the solutions that are making the headlines and not the problems. Last week's events show the risks in our industry, but they also open the door to increased collaboration among all sectors to improve our nation's water future.","So now on to our performance for the quarter. We achieved increases in revenues and EPS. We completed 3 acquisitions. We continued strategic growth on the market-based side. And importantly, for our customers, we found ways to be even more efficient and effective in our services.","As you can see from Slide 5, our operating revenue increased about 5%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share, which excludes the second quarter impact of the West Virginia event, was $0.63 per share, up approximately 9% from the weather-normalized $0.58 per share last year. This increase is due mainly to higher revenues in our Regulated Business through rate authorizations and infrastructure charges, as well as additional revenues from acquisitions. Our market-based revenues also increased, mostly from capital projects associated with our military contracts and growth in our service line protection program.","We also reported an increase in cash flow from operating activities of approximately $65 million. Linda will give more detail on these financials shortly. Our adjusted ROE for the last 12 months ended June of 2014 increased 80 basis points to 8.65% compared with the same period last year.","Turning now to Slide 6. Our mission is to provide clean, safe, affordable and reliable water and water services to highly satisfied customers. You can't do that without maintaining and improving the pumps, plant and pipes that deliver water and water services.","This quarter, we invested about $213 million in needed improvements. Because our first quarter capital spending was hampered due to a very cold winter, our year-to-date spending is just a bit behind, but we are still planning to spend up to $1.1 billion by year's end.","And as we stated previously, we anticipate investing approximately $5.8 billion in our business in the next 5 years, including around $700 million for regulated acquisitions and strategic opportunities.","As you all know, for 2014, one of our goals is to actively address regulatory lag and promote constructive regulatory frameworks. I'm happy to report that more than $9 million of additional authorized revenues became effective in the second quarter due to step increases, infrastructure charges and rate cases.","To address affordability for our customers, we continue to improve our O&M efficiency ratio, which when we adjust for the West Virginia event and weather, is 37.7% for the 12 months ending June 30, 2014, compared to 40.7% for the same period last year.","A key part of driving efficiency comes from our focus on developing and implementing innovative technology. I'll go into the detail on this towards the end of the call, but I do want to give you just a few examples right now.","In 2009, American Water launched its innovation development process, or IDP, to assess and bring new innovations to our company and the water industry. Since then, more than 600 technologies have been examined through IDP, and a number of these initiatives have been implemented.","One of these is NPXpress, for which American Water has been awarded 3 patents. This technology reduces up to 50% of aeration electricity consumption, which is the biggest wastewater treatment energy user, and it reduces supplemental carbon additives by up to 100%. American Water has implemented this technology at 7 of our plants, and we're in the process of installing it in additional locations. These are real savings for our customers.","Another example is our partnership with ENBALA Power Networks. By connecting our plant assets to the electric grid through ENBALA, we've been able to generate a new revenue stream to mitigate our electricity costs. Our program at our Pennsylvania Shire Oaks pumping station has offset 2% to 3% of that site's total energy bill. And remember that labor, power and chemicals are our largest expenses. As we drive efficiency in our operations, we can use those resources to fund more needed investment in aging water infrastructure without putting undue burden on the water bills of our customers.","So moving on to growth. From April 1 through June 30, we completed 3 acquisitions, adding approximately 700 metered customers to our regulated footprint. On the market-based side, Homeowner Services has expanded its service offerings into 8 new states since the beginning of the year. We expanded into 4 of those 8 in the second quarter, as well as we launched our exclusive partnership with Metro Water Services in Nashville in April. Homeowners Services currently has nearly 700,000 customers and more than 1.3 million customer contracts and operates in 43 states and Washington DC.","Moving to Slide 7, which illustrates our commitment to shareholder value. On July 30, 2014, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend payment of $0.31 per common share payable on September 2, 2014, to all shareholders of record as of August 11, 2014. This continues our commitment to an annual dividend payout goal of 50% to 60% of net income while growing dividends at a rate commensurate with earnings per share growth.","And finally, we are reaffirming our annual earnings guidance to be $2.35 to $2.45 per share, excluding the impact of the Freedom Industries chemical spill in West Virginia. While we are reaffirming this guidance, we do see our performance trending toward the upper end of the range, assuming normal weather patterns for August and through the remainder of the year. Given that our third quarter is normally our largest for revenue and net income, we will continue to monitor and provide any changes which might be appropriate on our third quarter call.","As Walter and Linda will discuss in just a few minutes, the impact of the Freedom Industries chemical spill was $0.02 in the second quarter, and year-to-date through June 30, it is approximately $0.04 per share. We estimate that this number will stay relatively stable through the rest of the year, unless there are additional legislative changes requiring immediate action or if a civil trial were to begin earlier than expected.","Based on our performance, we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our long-term EPS growth goal of 7% to 10% through execution of our growth strategy and continued operational efficiency gain.","Walter will now give an update on our regulated business.","Walter J. Lynch","Thanks, Susan. You mentioned weather, so we'll start there. We've mentioned in the past our geographic diversity mitigates the impact of regional weather. We saw that clearly in the second quarter. The map on Slide 10 provides the precipitation for the second quarter in the states where we operate, with our service areas indicated here as well. You'll note that this map does not include the West Coast, which is making the news with record drought. I'll get to that in a moment, but for now, I want to focus on the weather in the Northeast and Central states.","As you know, Pennsylvania and New Jersey are our 2 largest states, and you can see while Pennsylvania had above normal precipitation for the quarter, a good part of New Jersey had normal precipitation, as well as parts of Missouri, which is also one of our larger states. This geographic diversity contributed to the second quarter not having a significant weather impact on our operations. Having said that, we've seen some cool and wet weather in July, specifically in our New Jersey service areas. We'll update you on any weather effects in the third quarter earnings call.","On the next slide, let me start with an update on California. As we moved into summer and drought conditions continued across the state, California American issued a call for a 20% reduction in usage in accordance with the governor's emergency drought declaration. In June, we're able to report that our Sacramento District reduced usage by 23% compared to 2012 and 2013 levels. We thank our customers there for successfully conserving water. Also, I want to mention here that thanks to constructive regulatory treatment during this drought, we've been able to maintain revenue stability during a period of decreasing sales through the various regulatory mechanisms that are in place.","Of course, part of addressing water challenges in California is our efforts related to our desalination facility known as the Monterey Peninsula Water Supply Project. In July, we announced that data gathered from bore holes drilled along California's central coast show that an alternative way of collecting seawater for desalination may be feasible.","Without getting to too much detail, California American Water has proposed subsurface intake wells or slant wells that would collect sufficient ocean water to produce nearly 10 million gallons of potable water a day to supply to the Monterey Peninsula. Subsurface intakes have become the preferred technology for desalination plants among state regulators and environmental groups because unlike an open pipeline to the ocean, they don't trap and harm marine life. There have been some concerns about the quantity and quality of ocean water these produce -- wells will produce, and as I've said, the data gathered and collected so far looks very promising.","The basis of design report for the desalination facility is now complete and under review. Design is scheduled for 60% completion by September, and again, we'll keep you updated on our progress.","Also in California, as in all of our regulated states, we continue our work on receiving a reasonable return on vital infrastructure investments we make. So I'm happy to report in California, we've signed a proposed settlement agreement with the Office of Ratepayer Advocates and other interveners in our general rate case in the amount of $13.6 million for the first year of a 3-year step increase. The proposed settlement is scheduled to be voted on by the California Public Utility Commission later this year.","In New Jersey, on June 18, the Board of Public Utility staff proposed modifications to the consolidated tax adjustment when determining utilities tax expense for rate-making purposes. Under the BPU proposal, it limits the look-back to 5 years from the beginning of the test period. In addition, 75% of the savings would now go to the company and 25% to utilities customers. While we're pleased with the progress that is being made by the BPU to address the consolidated tax adjustment issue, we still believe the adjustment should be eliminated entirely as it has been in most other jurisdictions. And comments to the BPU are due August 18.","Lastly, let's move to an update on the Freedom Industries chemical spill in West Virginia. On the cost side, as Susan mentioned earlier, we've incurred $0.04 on an EPS basis during the first half of the year. Since our last call, our filter change is complete, and to further demonstrate our commitment to our customers, we took the additional step of testing water samples across the 1,900-mile Kanawha Valley water distribution system. We're pleased to report that there are no traces of MCHM detected in any samples taken from the replaced filters.","As we've said since day 1, we are extremely proud of our team there and what they've accomplished. It's one thing to hear it from us, but it's also been reported from external parties as well. In fact, the head of the U.S. EPA's office of groundwater and drinking water recently said that West Virginia American Water, \"did what they absolutely had to in that circumstance by not cutting off the intake to ensure that there was water available for fire suppression and other emergencies.\" We agree.","On Slide 12, continuing our commitment to be more transparent, let me give you a brief update on our shale activity as it relates to Regulated Operations. Our sales for the last 12 months ended June 2014 were 7% higher than in 2013, and gallons sold have increased close to 60% over the last 2.5 years. Again, this is on our regulated side. We continue to evaluate other opportunities, as we've said in the past, such as water treatment and disposal on the nonregulated side.","So now I'm going to turn the call over to Linda for a more detailed review of our financial performance.","Linda G. Sullivan","Thank you, Walter, and good morning, everyone. I'm excited to be here, and I look forward to working with all of you.","Let me now walk through the second quarter financial results in more detail. Turning to Slide 14, second quarter 2014 was yet another quarter of strong financial results with increasing revenues and continued progress on improving operating efficiency. For the 3 months ending June 30, 2014, we reported operating revenues of $759.2 million, which is a $35 million or about 5% higher than the second quarter of last year.","Operating income rose to $253.8 million or about $12 million higher than the same period last year. We reported second quarter net income of $109.3 million or diluted earnings per share of $0.61. This compares to net income of $101.3 million or diluted EPS of $0.57 for second quarter of 2013.","As Susan mentioned previously, included in the $0.61 is a $0.02 charge for the quarter related to the Freedom Industries chemical spill in West Virginia. Excluding this impact, our adjusted EPS for second quarter 2014 was $0.63 per share.","We also paid a dividend of $0.31 per share during the quarter, which represents an approximate 11% increase over the $0.28 per share payment in the second quarter of 2013.","For the 3 months ended June 30, 2014, we reported cash flow from operating activities of $205.7 million compared to $140.6 million in 2013 or a $65.1 million increase. This increase in cash flow from operations was primarily due to 3 things: first, stronger cash flow from core growth in the business; second, a decrease in pension and postretirement benefit contributions; and third, changes in working capital driven by higher cash collections this quarter, as earlier this year, we largely caught up on the delayed billings that resulted from implementation of our customer information system.","Turning now to Slide 15. I want to highlight the key items impacting earnings this quarter compared to the same period last year, and I will cover more details on the revenue and expense breakdown slides. On the left side of the page, our starting point is second quarter 2013 recorded earnings per share of $0.57. Last year was cooler and wetter than normal, so we have adjusted up $0.01 for weather, which gets us to what we consider a normalized earnings starting point for the second quarter of 2013 or $0.58 per share.","Next, we outlined the various earnings per share drivers contributing to the $0.05 per share increase in our second quarter 2014 EPS of $0.63 after adjusting for the impact of the Freedom Industries spill in West Virginia.","The key items contributing to the $0.05 increase in adjusted EPS this quarter include: higher revenue in our regulated business of $0.09 per share, partially offset by higher depreciation of $0.03 per share driven by regulated growth and higher O&M of $0.01 per share. The O&M increase includes several offsetting items, and I'll discuss each of these items in more detail on the revenue and expense breakdown slide.","On a GAAP basis, diluted earnings per share were $0.61 for the 3 months ended June 30, 2014. And as I mentioned earlier, we have added back the West Virginia event impact of $0.02 to bring our adjusted earnings per share to $0.63.","With regard to the cost associated with the West Virginia event, we indicated last quarter that we expected these costs to be in the $0.03 to $0.04 per share range for the year. We have now recorded $0.04 per share and expect these costs will remain relatively stable for the remainder of the year. Also included in this estimate are costs associated with the general investigation by the PSC, which were not included in our original estimate.","In the second quarter of 2014, we recorded approximately $5.9 million associated with the spill, bringing the total for the year to $10.9 million, which includes operating related costs that have largely returned to pre-event level and the estimated cost for the year related to the civil lawsuits filed to date based on known facts and current circumstances. These costs are subject to change, and as Susan mentioned, do not include incremental cost associated with potential legislative changes or civil trial costs.","Now let's discuss the different components of our EPS growth starting with revenues on Slide 16. I encourage you to read our 10-Q on file with the SEC for a more detailed analysis of both revenues and expenses.","Overall, operating revenues increased $34.9 million or 4.8% with revenues from our Regulated Business increasing by $30.2 million or 4.7% compared to second quarter 2013. Regulated revenues were higher, primarily due to the first 4 items you see on the slide: First, authorized rate increases for a number of our operating companies was $20.8 million; second, a $3.5 million increase due to acquisitions with the most significant being Dale Services Corporation in Virginia in fourth quarter of 2013; third, increased surcharge and amortization of balancing account of $3.1 million; and fourth, a $2.1 million benefit due to higher consumption and other items compared to last year.","Continuing with our Market-Based Business, revenues for the second quarter of 2014 increased by $4.6 million. Half of that increase was from an increase in Contract Operations revenue, primarily due to capital project activities associated with our military contracts, partially offset by price redeterminations of $2.3 million recorded in the second quarter of last year; and a reduction in revenues from terminated municipal and industrial O&M contracts as part of our portfolio optimization efforts.","Homeowners Services revenue increased by $3.8 million in the second quarter as a result of contract growth, mainly with our New York City contracts as well as expansion in other geographic areas.","On Slide 17, total operating expenses for the 3 months ended June 30, 2014, increased by about $23 million compared to the same period in 2013. Operations and maintenance expense in the regulated business increased $11.8 million or 4.3%, which is included in the regulated box on this page. Within the regulated O&M expense category, production expenses were the single biggest contributor and increased by $9 million or 13.8% for the quarter. This increase is a result of purchased water cost, principally from price increases in our California subsidiary, which are recovered through various regulatory mechanisms. We incurred approximately $5.9 million for the Freedom Industries chemical spill, as I discussed earlier.","Customer billing and accounting expenses increased $4.1 million or 33.8% from higher uncollectible expenses associated with an increase in the aging of our accounts receivable due to slower-than-normal collection pattern. With the implementation of our customer information system in 2013, we made temporary changes in our collection process which resulted in an increase in our receivables' aging. We are focused on returning our collection process to pre-implementation levels, and we're making steady progress. However, we expect it to take a bit more time than originally anticipated, and as a result, we expect to continue to experience higher uncollectible expense this year, and we have factored that into our reaffirmed earnings guidance range.","Maintenance materials and supplies, which include emergency repairs, as well as costs for preventative maintenance, increased $3.6 million for the quarter, mainly due to increased tank painting in New Jersey and higher paving and backfilling expenses. Employee-related costs, which include salaries and wages, group insurance and pension expense, decreased $7.7 million for the second quarter due to decreased pension and postretirement benefit cost, mainly from the change in the discount rate. Also, partially offsetting this decrease were severance costs, as we continue to drive efficiency in the business.","The operating supplies and services and other category decreased $3.1 million. This decrease was primarily due to lower contracted services as 2013 included additional cost from backfilling positions using contractors on certain projects and incremental costs attributed to the continued maturity of our enterprise resource planning system implementation.","Moving to the Market-Based Business, O&M expense increased for the quarter $6.3 million, mainly due to the increase in construction project activity for our military contract, which corresponds with the increase in revenue.","In second quarter 2014, we also reported higher consolidated depreciation, amortization and other expense of $4.9 million. This increase was principally from placing additional utility plants in service, including Phase 2 of our SAP project that was placed into service in 2 waves during 2013.","On Slide 18, this shows our O&M efficiency ratio. Despite higher uncollectible expense and severance cost recorded this year, we continue to see progress in this metric. For the 12 months ending June 30, 2014, we achieved a 37.7% ratio, which is a considerable improvement from the 40.7% ratio we had for the same period last year. This ratio is adjusted for weather and excludes the West Virginia expenses related to the Freedom Industries chemical spill.","As we have shared with many of you previously, our long-term stretch goal is to achieve a 35% O&M efficiency ratio by 2018. There is a full calculation of this ratio in the appendix section of this earnings call slide deck.","Now let's look at recent regulatory highlights on Slide 19, which shows formal rate increases awaiting final order, as well as step increases and DSIC filings, which impacted the quarter or are still pending.","In terms of pending rate cases, as of August 6, 2014, we are awaiting orders for the general rate cases in 2 states, including California, where we now have a settlement with the Office of Ratepayer Advocates and other interveners, as Walter mentioned, as well as a step increase.","For rates that became effective in 2014, we had a $1.2 million in step increases from a prior rate case in New York effective April 1, 2014. Infrastructure charges awarded to be effective in the first and second quarters of 2014 totaled $18.2 million annually. And in addition, effective July 1, 2014, we received approval of $7.4 million in annualized DSIC revenue in our new -- in New Jersey, for a total of $25.6 million.","These infrastructure mechanisms represent the ability to more timely recover capital when we invest to improve our infrastructure and customer service. Additionally, we implemented new rates effective January 1, 2014, in Pennsylvania and effective April 18, 2014, in Iowa, for a combined annualized total of $29.8 million.","These are the highlights of these cases, and we advise you to review the footnotes for a fuller understanding of particular cases. While we can't predict how any new case will be determined, we hope that this will help you understand our current rate environment. And in the appendix, you will also find an updated version of our largest 10 states with their authorized rate base and allowed ROE.","Going to Slide 20, on June 2, 2014, Standard & Poor's Rating Services revised American Water's outlook to positive from stable. These highlight -- This highlights our commitment to managing the overall financial strength of the company, and we are really proud of that.","Lastly, as Susan mentioned, we are reaffirming our annual earnings guidance to be in the $2.35 to $2.45 per share range. While we are reaffirming this guidance, we see our performance trending toward the upper portion of the range, assuming normal weather patterns for August and through the remainder of the year. This guidance excludes the impact of the Freedom Industries chemical spill in West Virginia.","And with that, I'll turn it back over to Susan.","Susan N. Story","Thanks, Linda. We'd like to conclude each of our earnings calls going forward by giving you expanded color on some of our initiatives and efforts outside of what we might typically cover in an earnings call. It's our hope that you'll find this information useful in understanding how we are moving forward as a company. Just let Ed know if you think it's helpful.","This quarter, I want to speak very briefly in the topic of water energy and innovation. I spoke a little bit about innovation earlier. In the past, we briefly discussed the critical dependency between water and energy. In recent months, we've seen the level of national discussion on this topic increase dramatically, and we're excited about it.","Why are we excited? Well first, we see it as a way to improve efficiencies in both water and energy usage and address key water challenges in energy production. Second, it plays to one of the strengths of our management team, which reflects a mix of seasoned water professionals and experienced professionals from the electricity and energy industry. The Department of Energy issued a report last month on the water-energy nexus. As we all know, water is essential for human survival, prosperity, and whether that's for drinking, sanitation, industrial use, irrigation or power generation.","For example, for every gallon of gasoline that you put in your car, it took 13 gallons of water to produce it. Each shale well requires from 3 million to 7 million gallons of water in the hydraulic fracturing process. Thermal electric plants require substantial water for cooling, although the majority can be returned to its source.","And in turn, electricity plays a critical role in producing, treating and delivering clean water. For example, about 4% of the electricity consumed in the United States is used for collecting, treating and moving water and wastewater. That number is much higher in California. So the future of water and energy is fundamentally intertwined.","This DOE report frames the integrated challenges and opportunities surrounding water and energy, and specifically, it lays out 6 pillars to address this constructive way forward for the nexus. These pillars include: Energy efficiency in water treatment and distribution; resiliency and reliability of water and energy systems; using nontraditional water sources in a sustainable and productive way; and linking synergies among water and energy.","As the first U.S. water and wastewater utility to join the EPA's Climate Leaders Program, American Water is discussing with U.S. Energy secretary Ernest Moniz and DOE staff the multiple efforts we have underway that address the DOE's 6 pillars. American Water's efforts range from: Developing and implementing new technology to reduce energy use during treatment, to connecting a smart water grid with a smart electric grid, to using renewable power in water treatment and the use of recycled water and new water supply sources such as desalination.","The DOE paper discusses our RDD&D, research, development, demonstration and deployment. We at American Water are involved in all 4 stages in different water and wastewater technologies. We know that through our expertise and research capabilities, our customers will benefit through increased reliability, water quality and increased cost efficiencies, while we also bring valuable new technologies to the rest of the water industry.","As new challenges in the water industry arise, so will the opportunity to increase collaboration with the energy industry. And think about it from a regulators' point of view. If water and energy companies work together to increase efficiencies to have a positive impact on customers, that's a win-win for all of us. Together, we have the potential to bring about smart solutions that are resilient, sustainable and affordable.","We put our specific efforts on each DOE pillar in a new document that can be found on our website. I invite you to go and check out all the innovations that we have here at American Water. As I said, this is an exciting time to be in our industry and especially at American Water.","And now we're happy to take any questions you might have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question will come from Ryan Connors from Janney Montgomery Scott.","Ryan M. Connors - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","I wanted to talk about kind of rate strategy a little bit. I mean, obviously, we've seen a pretty big shift in where the top line gains are coming from, from base rates over to kind of DSIC and otherwise. And especially, I guess, that looks particularly acute in New Jersey. So I wonder if you could talk about your CapEx and rate strategy in New Jersey in particular, given that obviously, the recent peer rate cases suggest we're looking at lower returns on equity there going forward. You're leveraging DSIC to the extent you can, but that only goes so far. Can you just give us your thoughts on how you manage through the challenge of capital allocation going forward in New Jersey, given that the environment seems to have shifted in terms of ROEs?","Walter J. Lynch","Brian, it's Walter. Thanks for the question. What we're doing in New Jersey, as in other states, we're maximizing use of DSIC and other mechanisms. So that we continue to invest and addressing infrastructure challenges and we get recovery in the shortest period of time without going through a rate case. And as you know, our focus on cost, we've been able to keep our costs flat over a number of years. So the real focus for us is where do we invest and the timing of our investment. And we just think the DSIC mechanisms are the perfect mechanisms in each of the states, particularly New Jersey, to invest in our infrastructure.","Linda G. Sullivan","And Brian, if I could add to that. This is Linda. So when we look at the DSIC mechanisms, they really provide us additional flexibility in terms of the timing of filing our rate cases. And in New Jersey in particular, we're also looking at, from the lower ROE issue, the impact of the consolidated tax adjustment. So if that were to be final, there'd be somewhat of an offset from that as well.","Susan N. Story","So one thing to kind of overall like what Walter and Linda said, Ryan, I think it's a great question for any utility in today's market, where we have interest rates continue to be pretty much artificially held low, is that through all of the alternative mechanisms we've worked so hard to get in the past few years, it provides us more flexibility and optionality and ensures that when we do go in for rate cases, we don't have the bigger rate increases or rate shocks.","Ryan M. Connors - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay. And I mean, I guess, boiling that all down to kind of the target growth rate, so I guess you don't believe that having to achieve growth through alternative methods like DSIC will have a negative impact on your ability to meet the 7% to 10% kind of target range over the long term -- over the intermediate term, let's say.","Susan N. Story","No. In fact, our growth triangle we shared last year, we looked at the CapEx investment, and again, as Walter mentioned earlier, we look in all of our states. We look at where we need to invest. We look at the ROEs. We always provide a level of funding to ensure that we're able to provide the clean, safe, affordable and reliable service. And then we look at other capital that's a little more discretionary and where that goes. But also, when we look at that on top of the CapEx, you have the regulated acquisitions, you've got the market-based. So we have a diversified portfolio for growth, just as Walter said, we benefit from the geographic diversity we have with our states.","Operator","The next question will come from Dan Eggers of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Daniel L. Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Listen, good job again on the improvement in the operating and efficiency ratios. Can you just maybe give your thoughts on what the trajectory of improvement looks like from here to '18 to get to your 35% goal? And are you now, as you've succeeded and moving in that pretty fast, are you reevaluating maybe where you could ultimately get to?","Susan N. Story","Well, Dan, if you looked at the O&M efficiency ratio as a straight line for improvement, that might be the case. But we've gone from 44.2% in 2010 to the 37.7% in the last 12 months. But really, the O&M efficiency ratio is more like an exponential curve as opposed to a linear line. And the further along that curve you get, the harder it is to make even smaller increments of change. So I don't think you can look into a straight line rate and think that, that's going to hold. We've been very successful. We have other opportunities, especially through automation and technology, but we stand to our stretch goal in 2018 of 35%.","Daniel L. Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Well, I could try at least.","Susan N. Story","And that was a night nice try, also.","Daniel L. Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","How much -- if you flip around the other way, how much of the improvement in earned ROEs this year versus last is a function of efficiency gains relative to maybe kind of the regulatory relief and mechanisms helping to put some revenues back in the business?","Susan N. Story","We know the calculation is basically O&M over revenues. And you can look at our revenue growth and you can look at our expenses and know that we've made significant improvements on expense management. You all ask us frequently, \"Well, do you think there's more to get?\" And the fact is that as Linda mentioned earlier, we're just now stabilizing our SAP system, the implementation from last year. We see opportunities there, and the innovation and technologies I talk about, we think will provide us even more opportunities in the future. So we have done a lot of things. What we do in the future may be a little bit more of that, but also some new areas.","Walter J. Lynch","And I can say that our drive for efficiency throughout our business has really taken hold. We've got, as I said on prior calls, we have a number of yellow belts that are looking at improving processes and eliminating errors. We have a supply chain that's so engaged with the business on looking to reduce the materials that we purchase. And our entire team is really focused on driving our cost down because they understand the why. The why is so that we can continue to invest in our infrastructure and do so with minimizing our customer impact. So we've made great progress. And as Susan said, we're going to continue to make progress to get below the 35%.","Daniel L. Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And I guess just kind of one last question just to put in context your kind of -- from a weather expectation for the rest of this year. What conditions would you like to see in August and September to help you shore up the upper end of guidance range? And what is the risk as you look at the forecast today? Seemingly mild temperatures most places.","Walter J. Lynch","Well, what we'd like is hot and dry weather. But our business is based on normal weather. So as long as we have -- and it's hard to determine what normal weather is, but as long as we have normal weather, that's what we're looking for.","Daniel L. Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So a little more heat and a little less wet from here would be good?","Susan N. Story","Through at least December.","Walter J. Lynch","Yes.","Susan N. Story","Through at least December.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The next question will come from Walter Liptak of Global Hunter.","Walter S. Liptak - Global Hunter Securities, LLC, Research Division","I wanted to ask about the O&M expenses. And I understand that it's not going to be linear and all that. But I wonder, as you go work -- as you work with your ERP system and on projects, if you can better pinpoint the timing of any step change in expenses?","Linda G. Sullivan","So let me start there. So as you implement an ERP system, it takes a little bit of time to go through stabilization and then optimizing the system and then being able to really drive the improvement and get the efficiency out of the system. We are seeing, this year, we implemented our ERP system in 2012. We're seeing that efficiency coming through. This year, we implemented in 2 phases the customer information system as well as our work management system in 2013. So we would expect to move through those same stages through time and begin to continuously drive improvements and optimization.","Walter S. Liptak - Global Hunter Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So it sounds like you got some projects that are going to start bearing some fruit as we get into next year.","Susan N. Story","Yes. I mean, the SAP, and also, as I mentioned, the NPXpress. Again, labor and power and chemicals are our largest cost drivers. So the more we can find ways to save on the power cost, which, by the way, just 3 years ago, our power costs were $110 million last year. For 2013, they were $94 million. So we're finding ways to reduce those large cost drivers, including the NPXpress also reduces the need for chemicals, that's up to 100% of the carbon additive. So and as Walter mentioned, the SAP system is allowing us much more visibility into inventory. For example, where we at one time could not see between state, what we had an inventory. Now we can do more inventory sharing, which is making us much more cost effective. Now those things, as Linda mentioned, don't happen overnight, but we see a steady building of the ability to do this. Some will be over the next year, some the next 2 to 3 years, but we see a path forward for continual improvement.","Walter S. Liptak - Global Hunter Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. Sounds good. I wanted to ask an unrelated question, but going back to the DSIC. Can you help us review just on which states are -- have that mechanism in place and where we are with DSIC for some of the other states that you operate in?","Walter J. Lynch","Yes. We have DSIC in a number of states. But our top 5 states: New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Missouri, Illinois and Indiana all have DSIC. So again, a significant amount of our investment moves through those mechanisms to get recovery in the quickest amount of time.","Walter S. Liptak - Global Hunter Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And what does the pipeline look like for the rest of the states?","Susan N. Story","Well, we're always -- we look at several alternative mechanisms. We look at DSIC, we look at future test year. We're looking at mechanisms to address declining usage. So for all of our states, we're constantly evaluating the regulatory construct and which variations of these type of mechanisms could work best in every state. So we're always looking at all of our states and ways to address these issues.","Walter S. Liptak - Global Hunter Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. And I may have missed this, did you publish CapEx for this year?","Susan N. Story","We did. We said that we would spend around $1.1 billion.","Operator","The next question will come from Jonathan Reeder of Wells Fargo.","Jonathan Reeder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just building on Ryan's first question. Is there a specific timeline for the BPU to finalize the CTA issue? And how does that affect the timing of your next New Jersey rate filing? Or more specifically, when do you expect to file next in the state?","Walter J. Lynch","Well, as I said in my prepared remarks, the comments are due back in August 18. And then there's no published timeline, but we'd expect something maybe by the end of the year. No guarantee, but that's what we think.","Susan N. Story","And Jonathan, to the second part of your question, we constantly evaluate in all of our states the appropriate timing for any rate cases.","Jonathan Reeder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. I mean, do you need, I guess, the BPU to finalize that before you can file the case and actually get the implementation of the new CTA treatment?","Linda G. Sullivan","Once the BPU makes the decision, then it will be effective in your next rate case filing.","Jonathan Reeder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Are you at liberty to say how much that would increase New Jersey's underlying rate base value if the staff proposal is adopted?","Linda G. Sullivan","No, we're not. We had -- our last rate case was a black box settlement. And so each of those components are confidential.","Jonathan Reeder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Moving on to the O&M. Is the run rate of 37.7%, is that indicative of where you think the full year will come in?","Susan N. Story","We believe that we will continue to make progress on the O&M efficiency ratio from now through 2018 and get it to the stretch goal of 35%.","Jonathan Reeder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. I'll leave that one alone. So I think Q2, based on what you're saying that weather was normal when you kind of balance your university of regulatory jurisdictions, is that correct?","Walter J. Lynch","Yes, that's correct.","Jonathan Reeder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, so the trend towards the upper end of guidance range is no way weather driven?","Susan N. Story","When we look at a range, there is some degree of weather variability that we build in there, but does not account for any extreme weather variability, which is why just in water, just as you see in electrics, the third quarter has such a big impact on our year that we just like to see what happens in the third quarter before we're able to address the range again. And I will tell you that again, we expect some weather variability. That's why you have a range in the first place, that's one of the components, but we need to look and see what happens. We're getting preliminary numbers for July, but that's not final. We've got to look at August and September to kind of see where we end up.","Jonathan Reeder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So I guess just continuing with the weather theme a little bit and looking at your consumption numbers. It looks like, I guess, the residential and commercial are maybe down a little more than I would expect, specifically if Q2 last year was slightly negative due to weather. Is there anything you're seeing there that's exacerbating the decline from just the normal, I guess, 1% to 1.5% we've seen annually over the years in the industry?","Linda G. Sullivan","There's really nothing there. We have to remember, too, what we put out is billed and unbilled revenue and then billed sales volume. So what you're looking at is the billed sales volume piece of it, but we're seeing what would be expected from a usage decline.","Walter J. Lynch","Yes, Jonathan. We're still seeing the 1% to 2% decline as we have over the last several years, nothing out of the ordinary there.","Jonathan Reeder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then last question on the military base side, one of your competitors recently has indicated a desire to perhaps pursue contracts on the electric side of bases, not just the water and wastewater. Is that something that you're interested in as well?","Susan N. Story","The 10 bases that we serve, we are partners with those bases. And we know our business is water and wastewater, but we also, as I mentioned earlier, have a lot of opportunities and projects at our plants that do look at the whole water-energy connection. So we are not planning that specifically for any base, but we are open to options in the future based on what we think we can deliver in a cost effective and performance, superior performance standpoint, to our partners.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The next question will come from Tim Winter of Gabelli.","Timothy M. Winter - G. Research, Inc.","I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the $700 million placeholder for acquisitions and development. Maybe, are there any specific opportunities out there? Is there a particular region you're focused on? Is the environment for municipal acquisitions improving? And why $700 million? Just any color there would be helpful.","Susan N. Story","When we set up the capital budget for this year, for the first time, we wanted to say, here is the amount that we want to look at regulated CapEx investment in our plant, pipes. And the other part was we said for regulated acquisitions, we want to make sure that we plan for a budget, and then we had the strategic initiative for those opportunities that might arise so that we didn't have to then scramble if something came up. So for example, for this year, as we look at regulated acquisitions, and as we've talked in the past before, Tim, they're very spiky and they don't happen overnight and they're in the pipeline and things come up, referendums, different things that may change the timing of some things. So for us, it's a placeholder. And then we got the strategic initiatives. As we've said before, there are things that we look at. Walter mentioned all of our work in the shale play, for example, is all regulated, but we continue to have discussions if we can find a nonregulated shale play that will not require us to take a risk or change our risk profile because we're not going to take a risk on invested capital in the ground. We want to have a return of at a minimum for any of those ventures. So it was a placeholder, but what we also have the ability to do is as we go into a year, we have the ability to shift some of those funds from one place to the other. For example, if we see one area we may not spend as much, we have the opportunity, if we have a need, for example, in the state for additional investment, we can shift it over there. So that's why Walter mentioned, and I and Linda all, we still see a path to the $1.1 billion this year. At the end of the year, it may not be quite in the buckets that we talked about at the first of the year.","Timothy M. Winter - G. Research, Inc.","Okay. And then are the -- so you say the drought conditions in the West -- are just the economic conditions leaning to an easier environment for acquisitions? Or are things sort of status quo?","Walter J. Lynch","Well, we're -- we do discuss with municipalities and others out in California the opportunity to become part of American Water. We'll continue to do that. I think that would probably play into it long term.","Susan N. Story","One of the benefits that we've got, Tim, to that point is, we have the ability to raise capital. We are -- as Linda mentioned, we have a strong credit rating. We have a strong balance sheet. So where, regardless of the state, there are opportunities for systems that have huge demands on their resources and choose to not deploy them in water or wastewater, we provide an option for those folks.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to American Water's President and CEO, Susan Story for closing remarks.","Susan N. Story","Well, thank you all so much. I have to tell you, this is an interesting call, as you heard different voices on here. It has -- I don't think there's ever more an exciting time to be part of American Water. We have an amazing team of people. We've got 6,600 employees that every day, their focus is on making sure that we deliver water and wastewater and all of our services in a way that's clean, safe, affordable and reliable. And we understand what our business is. We're going to stay true to our business with a risk profile you know but also find ways to grow.","So thank you for being part of this, and I just want to say that I'm just thrilled to death with the team we've got. Our new CFO is just doing a terrific job, much better than her predecessor. And again, Walter and the continuity we have, with the tremendous expertise we have through our state and our Market-Based business. I'm just proud to be part of this team, and we appreciate you all as investors and analysts.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, the conference has now concluded.

The access code for replay is 10063598. The online archive of the webcast will be available through June 8, 2015, by accessing the Investor Relations page of the company's website located at www.amwater.com.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Durgesh Chopra, Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Chopra, you may begin.","Durgesh Chopra","Thank you, Allison. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for today's call. As usual, we'll keep our call to about an hour. At the end of our prepared remarks, we'll have time for questions.","Now before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that during the course of this conference call, both in our prepared remarks and in answers to your questions, we may make statements related to future performance. Our statements represent our most reasonable estimates. However, since these estimates deal with future events, they're subject to numerous risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual performance of American Water to be materially different than the performance indicated or implied by such statements.

We will be happy to answer any questions or provide further clarification, if needed, during our question-and-answer session. All statements in this call related to earnings per share refer to diluted earnings per share.","And now I'd like to turn the call over to American Water's President and CEO, Susan Story.","Susan N. Story","Thanks, Durgesh. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. With me today are Linda Sullivan, our CFO, who will go over the first quarter financial results; and Walter Lynch, our COO and President of Regulated Operations, who will give us updates on our Regulated Business.","Once again, we delivered solid results for the first quarter of 2015 despite challenging winter weather in some of our states. This is a direct result of our employees, who are out there every day working for our customers to make these financial results happen.","Turning to Slide 5. Our quarter-over-quarter revenues increased 2.8% to $698 million. Earnings from continuing operations were $0.44 per diluted share. This is a 7.3% increase over the 2014 adjusted EPS of $0.41, excluding the $0.02 cost impact from the Freedom Industries chemical spill in the first quarter of 2014.","Turning now to Slide 6. You see our growth triangle and highlights of the progress we're making on delivering on our strategy. Our foundational base for earnings growth continues to be the capital investments that we're making in our Regulated operation in order to provide clean, safe and reliable service to our customers.","Through March 31, 2015, we've made about $167 million in infrastructure investments. We plan to invest $1.1 billion in our Regulated Business this year in order to improve our water and wastewater systems, with another $100 million budgeted for acquisitions and strategic investments. Since the start of 2015, we have received rate case approvals and infrastructure surcharges in several of our states. We also filed general rate case requests in 3 states, and we have a pending settlement in Maryland. We're able to make needed infrastructure investments that are good for our customers and which minimize their bill impact through both our continued focus on controlling O&M costs as well as the constructive regulatory mechanisms, which are in many of our states.","As we've previously discussed, we increased our 5-year capital spending plan by an additional $200 million to $6 billion total. Walter and Linda will discuss capital investments and O&M efficiency results more fully.","Moving to Regulated acquisitions. The agreements we made in 2014 continue to move toward approval and closing. We recently received regulatory approval for the purchase of the wastewater system in Arnold, Missouri. And we're on track for the closing of this and other pending acquisitions by the end of this year. We also announced last week the proposed purchase of Environmental Disposal Corporation, or EDC, adding 5,300 wastewater customers in New Jersey subject to BPU approval.","Moving to our Market-Based Businesses. We continue to deliver solid results. Our Homeowner Services business recently launched its exclusive partnership with the Orlando's Utilities Commission offering a warranty service program to its more than 200,000 residential customers. We also announced the renewal of our exclusive contract with the City of Burlington, Iowa and continue to grow enrollments in New York City, Nashville and other areas of the country. If you remember, we entered this business several years ago to address an unmet need that our regulated customers had with regards to the water pipes that were their responsibility, and this business has grown to leverage those competencies. Also, as we look to our Market-Based Business growth, we put special focus on those businesses like Military Services that have a regulated-like risk profile.","On our nonregulated shale. There has been a lot of discussion within the oil and gas E&P sector regarding capital reductions and prioritization of the remaining capital. This could potentially provide an opportunity for us, as some of these companies recognize the value of American Water's expertise and our capabilities in developing long-term water supply solutions. While we are continuously evaluating opportunities in this space, we are disciplined in our approach, and we don't have to rely on shale to meet our EPS guidance.","Slide 7 illustrates our ongoing commitment to our shareholders. The American Water Board of Directors last week raised the dividend about 10% to $0.34 per share. This is the third consecutive year of double-digit percentage increases to our dividend. Comparing the dividends paid from 2010 through 2014, we're in the top quartile of dividend growth compared to the Dow Jones Utility Average companies and to our water peers.","Based on our performance year-to-date, we reaffirm our 2015 earnings guidance from continuing operations to be in the range of $2.55 to $2.65 per share. We're off to a good start this first quarter, and we remain committed to delivering on our long-term EPS growth goal of 7% to 10% through 2019, anchored from our 2013 earnings.","So with that, Walter will now give us an update on our Regulated Business.","Walter J. Lynch","Thanks, Susan, and good morning, everyone. As Susan mentioned, we're off to a great start in 2015, continuing our commitment to investing in our infrastructure while focusing on improved O&M efficiency to mitigate the rate impacts for our customers.","Turning to Slide 10. In recognition of the investments we made to ensure clean, safe and reliable service for our customers, we received a rate order in California providing $5.2 million in incremental revenues effective January 1, 2015. This rate case outcome continues to demonstrate constructive regulation in California, allowing recovery of SAP costs, sharing of onetime proceeds from groundwater contamination litigation and a forward test year approving $126 million in new investments through 2017.","Susan will be speaking in more detail later on the call about California water supply challenges, but I wanted to emphasize that we're working hard in California and our other states to balance needed investments with what customers pay for service.","In West Virginia, last week, we filed a rate request for $35.6 million. The primary driver in this request is the investment of approximately $105 million in system improvements made since 2012 as well as an additional $98 million that the company plans to expend on recurring and investment projects through February 2017. These capital investments include upgrades to the water distribution system, water treatment facilities, storage tanks and pumping stations. All are necessary to maintain and improve water quality, reliability, fire protection and customer service for approximately 1\/3 of the state's population served by West Virginia American Water. The request also includes a reduction in operations and maintenance expenses of $1.1 million when compared to the last rate filing. In fact, the current operations and maintenance expenses are at their lowest levels since 2010. This rate case does not include the costs incurred from the Freedom Industries chemical spill. West Virginia American Water is seeking to defer the recovery of costs related to the Freedom Industries chemical spill to a separate future proceeding. We believe that by moving these spill costs to a separate proceeding, stakeholders can better focus on our ongoing provision of safe, clean and reliable water and wastewater service to our customers.","As you know, one of our goals is to pursue constructive regulatory mechanisms and legislation, and we've made some great progress on that front in Indiana. I'd like to highlight 3 of these bills signed into law in the last few weeks.","The first is an amended DSIC bill, which increases the DSIC revenue cap from 5% to 10%, further allowing us to replace our aging infrastructure before problems occur. The other 2 bills signed into law include a referendum bill that provides extra time for public education during the sale of a water or wastewater system as well as new legislative authority for the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission to approve the recovery of a reasonable purchase price of a distressed utility.","Another highlight in our Regulated operations is our 2014 water quality reports, also called consumer confidence reports. I'm proud to say that, once again, American Water scored well above industry averages for compliance with strict federal standards for water quality and more than 99% compliance with Safe Drinking Water Act standards or approximately 15x better than the industry average for compliance with drinking water quality standards and 20x better than the industry average for meeting all drinking water quality standards. This exceptional water quality record is directly attributable to the dedication and expertise of our people and the investments we make into our systems.","Moving to slide 11. We continue to improve our O&M efficiency ratio, achieving 36.3% for the last 12 months. And as we've said previously, our stretch target is to achieve an O&M efficiency ratio of 34% or less by 2020. This translates to our disciplined approach to capital investments to help us maintain reliable service while minimizing customer bill impacts.","So in closing, and it can't be said enough, our efforts to improve operating efficiencies while ensuring high-quality service and reliability delivers the best value for our customers.","And now I'll turn the call over to Linda for more detail on our first quarter financial results.","Linda G. Sullivan","Thank you, Walter, and good morning, everyone. I will start on Slide 13, which is our new format intended to expand the transparency of our disclosures by showing the contribution to earnings per share by each business segment.","On the left side of the page, we show our consolidated first quarter results. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations was $0.44 per share, up 7.3% over the same period last year, after adjusting for the 2014 costs associated with the Freedom Industries spill.","The Regulated segment continues to be our largest contributor towards earnings in the first quarter at $0.45 per share. Our Market-Based Business contributed $0.04 per share. And our parent company drag, which is primarily interest expense on parent debt from the RWE period, was $0.05 per share. These solid results increased our consolidated adjusted return on equity for the 12 months ended March 31, 2015, by 40 basis points to 8.88%.","Now let me discuss the different components of our first quarter adjusted EPS growth from continuing operations on Slide 14. Our starting point is first quarter 2014 EPS from continuing operations of $0.41 per share, which is adjusted for the Freedom Industries chemical spill. We reported first quarter 2015 results of $0.44 per share or $0.03 above 2014 adjusted EPS. The major drivers of this increase were, first, $0.02 from higher incremental regulated revenue from rate increases and infrastructure surcharges for a number of our operating companies, partially offset by decreased demand from declining usage.","Next, Regulated O&M was lower by $0.02 due to lower production costs mainly from lower fuel and natural gas prices as well as the positive impacts of the California rate case settlement, which allowed recovery of certain SAP implementation costs previously incurred. Partially offsetting these decreases were higher employee-related costs due to higher pension expense as well as higher uncollectible expense. Depreciation, taxes and other was higher by about $0.01 per share principally from growth associated with our capital investment programs in the Regulated Business.","I would also like to note that the operating income of our Market-Based Business was relatively flat in the first quarter compared to last year as the revenue growth was offset by the timing of expenses and higher claims in the Homeowner Services segment due to harsh winter weather. Also due to weather, we experienced delays in some construction projects within the Military business segment, but expect that to pick up in pace in the balance of the year as the backlog of approved projects is currently at approximately $120 million. In the appendix of the slide deck, we have included our revenue and expense bridge slides to provide more details to the variances I just discussed.","Now let me cover regulatory highlights on Slide 15, which shows rate cases and infrastructure filings awaiting final order and new rates that became effective since April 1, 2014. In terms of pending rate cases, we are awaiting orders for general rate cases in 3 states, with the largest being New Jersey and West Virginia, for a combined total rate request of $101.9 million. As Walter mentioned, these rate cases demonstrate our disciplined approach to investing. In fact, our 2 large rate cases request recovery of over $975 million in much-needed capital infrastructure investments while reducing requested operating costs by $20 million combined.","Also, we continue to await a proposed decision in our Maryland rate case settlement for an additional $0.5 million in revenues, and several of our operating subsidiaries filed for additional annualized revenues from infrastructure investment charges for a total of $4.4 million. For rates that became effective since April 1, 2014, through today, we received a total of $55.4 million in additional annualized revenues from general rate cases, step increases and infrastructure surcharges. These are the highlights of these cases, and we advise you to review the footnotes in the appendix for a fuller understanding of particular cases.","Turning to Page 16. I am pleased to announce that in late April, Moody's Investors Service changed American Water's outlook to positive. This highlights our value offering as a geographically diversified regulated utility and our commitment to managing the overall financial strength of the company while maintaining our disciplined approach to investing. And we're really proud of that.","Slide 17 is a summary dashboard of our performance in the first quarter. During the first 3 months of 2015, we made capital investments of approximately $167 million to improve infrastructure in our Regulated Business. For the full year of 2015, we continue to estimate our total capital plan to be $1.2 billion, most of which will be in our Regulated Business.","The decrease in cash flow from operations during the quarter reflects changes in working capital. A significant portion of the change was related to higher cash collections in the first quarter of last year as we delayed some 2013 billings into the first quarter of 2014 when we implemented our new customer information system in late 2013.","In terms of our dividend increase, we increased the dividend by about 10%, which is in line with 2014 EPS growth. This annualized increase puts our payout ratio at 52% when compared with the midpoint of our 2015 earnings guidance range or at the lower end of our target payout ratio of 50% to 60%. And building on the 7.3% increase in earnings per share this quarter, we are reaffirming our 2015 earnings guidance from continuing operations to be in the range of $2.55 to $2.65 per share.","With that, I'll turn it back over to Susan.","Susan N. Story","Thanks, Linda. In closing, we're going to highlight American Water's leadership in delivering innovative solutions to address the 2 key water issues facing our nation today: water supply and aging infrastructure. These are very real issues that will affect our economy, our standard of living and other basic life functions into the future if we don't plan well and execute the right actions now. Unlike electricity, where you can build a plant to create more, if you have reduced surface water or groundwater supply and you've optimized conservation, your remaining options are pretty much desalination and water reuse. American Water is leading in all of these supply options as well as in conservation efforts.","California offers us the opportunity to utilize this wide array of expertise. As many of you know, with the drought worsening, the Governor of California issued a 25% mandatory reduction of water usage. Our Monterey Peninsula Water Supply Project is a critical part of addressing the ongoing drought there while reducing our dependency on the Carmel River for supply. This project includes a total investment of about $300 million, which includes a desalination plant, which will be owned and operated by California American Water as well as 30 miles of pipeline, 2 booster stations and a reservoir. This energy can be up to 55% of the cost of operating a sea water desal plant. We will employ energy recovery devices to lower the plant's power use, and we hope to purchase half of the power needed from an adjacent landfill site. The plant will also include an innovative subsurface intake system, which uses slant well technology that draws sea water underneath the sand near the shoreline and avoids the harming of marine life posed by traditional open-ocean intakes.","Lastly, we're adding 2 additional Aquifer Storage and Recovery wells to capture excess winter flows from the Carmel River, which can be used during the dry summer months.","Conservation is also critical in California, and we've been a leader for years in educating our customers, offering rebates for water-efficient appliances and fixtures and providing incentives for drought-tolerant landscaping. Our customers have already reduced their water usage significantly statewide and as much as 17% in Sacramento since 2013.","In addition to further promoting and educating customers on our current conservation programs and efforts, we are piloting a unique program in Monterey using advanced water meter technology that will enable customers to more proactively manage their water use. They will be able to download individual daily water consumption information to monitor their use, set up text or e-mail alerts to let them know if a leak is detected or let them know when they are about to enter a new price tier or exceed a self-determined budget amount.","All of these efforts are supported by constructive regulation that balances the long-term sustainability of the water supply and the utilities that treat and deliver that water.","We realize that as the nation's largest investor on water and wastewater utility, we have to take the lead in solving our country's water and wastewater challenges. Our 6,400 employees take that responsibility very seriously, and we will ensure that our customers have the water services they need every day to live safely and comfortably.","And with that, we're happy to take any questions you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Daniel Eggers from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Daniel L. Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just looking at Slide 11, you guys are showing kind of progression toward your stretch target on the efficiency ratio. Is 34% feeling like a stretch given the fact that you've got 4 years to get there? Or is that number going to keep pushing lower and you're going to surprise us again?","Walter J. Lynch","Well, the 34% is our stretch target. And as you know, as you get closer to that, it gets a little bit more difficult. So we still see that as achievable. But it's also a stretch target, so we're working towards that.","Daniel L. Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So the rate of improvement is going -- we should be assuming in our numbers the rate of improvement is kind of coming to a much slower move than what we've seen in the last few years?","Walter J. Lynch","Yes, I'd agree with that.","Daniel L. Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. On the -- on Slide 33 in the back, where you guys show the acquisitions completed last year and then what's kind of in process this year. Can you just remind us how much money was spent on the acquisitions capital investment-wise in '14? And then what is the total amount that you'd be putting forth in '15 to close the deals that are ongoing?","Linda G. Sullivan","Dan, we had about $8.4 million that we incurred in 2014 for the closed acquisitions. And then we are -- currently have approximately $100 million that we have set aside for strategic acquisitions and regulatory acquisitions for the full year this year for these acquisitions as well as other pending.","Daniel L. Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So Linda, you're going to have to find some more deals than what's on here to get to the $100 million dollars. Is that right?","Linda G. Sullivan","Yes. And remember, Dan, we also have some flexibility in terms of the capital spend to deal with some timing issues there as well.","Daniel L. Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then, I guess, just one last question on the nonreg side. Revenues are up fairly nicely in the quarter, but the expenses moved in step. Did you guys prefund some of the military work in the first quarter so that there'll be more profit ongoing? Or is that -- or just maybe explain why those things kind of moved at the same rate.","Linda G. Sullivan","Yes. So we do see an increase in the costs associated with the military contracts that is tracking with the revenue that we recorded. We also had some timing issues in the HOS business as we had some marketing and start-up costs with Orlando and other contracts. And then we also -- as we continue to optimize the Contract Services business, we had some onetime adjustments last year.","Daniel L. Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So if I were to think about normalizing out kind of the Orlando upfront and some of those contract adjustments, how much extra cost was that in the quarter? Just to try and get our variance right.","Linda G. Sullivan","So I don't have those numbers right in front of me, Dan. But I think we can -- the way that we look at it is that we've included all of those costs in our reaffirmed earnings guidance.","Operator","Our next question comes from Shar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","So the delay that I think we mentioned in the prepared remarks for the military contracts, was that more administrative? Or maybe just a little bit of color there.","Linda G. Sullivan","It was actually more weather-driven.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, got it, got it. That's helpful. On the E&P business, I think this has sort of been highlighted as a potential opportunity for some time. Are we sort of still in the early phases? Or are we kind of getting to the point where we'll see some inflection points?","Susan N. Story","Shar, this is Susan. We are -- there are a lot of changes, as you know, in the E&P space. What we have found, interestingly, is that as a lot of the E&P companies are reducing their capital, they tend to look more toward their core business. And for the ancillary services, we found that there are more who are willing to sit down and talk. The real issue becomes the ability to do a partnership that is mutually beneficial. And as we have said before, we are not going to go with a high-risk profile to get into that business. So anything we enter would have to require the -- we would have to get the return of any capital we expend in a short period of time, so we are in discussions with different groups. I think it depends on the deal. And we also want to make sure that it leverages the core competencies we have in the water business and doesn't get far outside of that. So yes, we continue conversations. In terms of are we close or not, it just depends on the deal and as we see the rest of this year unfold. One thing we do know is in our regulated side on shale, in 2015, we actually -- looks very good for us. Because as -- while they are not opening as many wells, the ones they have are much more productive. So on the regulated side, we're seeing some movement there. On the unregulated, we just have a different way of looking at it to ensure we remain disciplined.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Got it, got it. That's very helpful. And then just top level, pretty good growth in the nonregulated business. Is this sort of a refreshed viewpoint on how large you sort of want this business to be as a percentage of consolidated results?","Susan N. Story","Shar, as we've said before, currently, the revenues from the Market-Based Business is about 10% or 11%. And so our goal is for the revenues or even net income to -- really, let's talk about revenues first -- not to be over 15% to 20%. And we would only be comfortable over 15% if that was the growth in Military Services and those parts of market base that are very regulated-like because we are constantly looking at the overall company risk profile to ensure that we don't move that profile.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ryan Connors from Boenning and Scattergood.","Ryan Michael Connors - Boenning and Scattergood, Inc., Research Division","I wanted to ask a big-picture question regarding the overall national regulatory landscape and specifically, regulated returns on equity -- awarded returns on equity, which have been kind of on a downward trend in the last several years. I wanted to get your view on the outlook for ROEs. In particular, whether you think that an improving economy and potential increase in interest rates could actually lead to a rebound in awarded returns over the next 12 months plus.","Linda G. Sullivan","So if we look out from ROEs, they are largely driven by changes in interest rates. And so if interest rates go up, we would expect to see some increase in ROEs as well. In terms of recent decisions, we have had our cost of capital decision in California, extended at 9.99% through the end of 2016. We did have our Indiana rate case approved with an increase from 9.7% to 9.75%. So we are seeing just slight movements in the ROE.","Ryan Michael Connors - Boenning and Scattergood, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Well, that's encouraging. And then my next question has to do with the California situation. We're kind of trying to get our arms around, conceptually, how the decoupling mechanism will be impacted by the conservation declines. And I guess, my question is, in theory, decoupling renders any consumption decline a nonevent. But obviously, the magnitude of these declines are -- exceed what the PUC might have envisioned when they designed the system. So my question is, does this or will this complicate the implementation of the decoupling mechanism over the next -- as these huge consumption declines work through the system? And I guess, specifically, could the WRAM balances get to such a -- so large that the PUC decides to extend the collection period over a longer time frame to eliminate rate shop, I guess?","Linda G. Sullivan","Right, Ryan. And we're looking at that very carefully in California as to what would be the cash impact and the recovery period to the -- for any delays in collections under the WRAM mechanisms. The WRAM mechanisms now, with the California rate case, are in virtually all of our areas. In California, they've been now approved. This has been a mechanism that California has supported for quite some time. And it really does drive the alignment of the utility companies and the customer to conserve and to work through the drought-related issues.","Susan N. Story","And also, one thing that's interesting is there's a national discussion about the price of water. And there are those who would say that out west, where you are having the scarcity, you're starting to see more appropriate value placed on water. And so as we look at this, we compare it to where we've been in the past. It will be interesting to see where this goes in the future, though, especially as in 50 of the states in the U.S., 40 water managers say that parts of their state, they believe, will be in drought in the next 10 years. So I think the wider discussion about the value of water and what we do in terms of putting a price on water is pretty important, and we may see that in California. We already are seeing that in California.","Linda G. Sullivan","Yes. And Ryan, to both your point on ROE as well as California, we do operate in 16 regulated states. So we do have a diversified portfolio here, and California represents just slightly less than 8% of our total revenue.","Ryan Michael Connors - Boenning and Scattergood, Inc., Research Division","Right, right. Okay. And just a quick question. Obviously, you can't disclose what the content of this would be, but are you engaged -- or has the PUC engaged yourself and other peers and to sort of discuss these issues and start to frame the regulatory response? Or is it sort of a black hole at this point?","Susan N. Story","I wouldn't say it's a black hole. I will tell you that our team at California American is always looking for ways to work with our customers, find ways that we can work to ensure that the regulatory process is operated as they're intended to operate. And so we sit down at the table and open forums. Our President, Rob MacLean, participates in a lot of the water forums and water conferences. So we're engaged in the dialogue throughout the State of California.","Ryan Michael Connors - Boenning and Scattergood, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then just one final -- just quick one for me is, the increase in claims on the Service Line Protection, I assume that cold weather was a factor there. But was there anything else going on that we need to be aware of in that respect?","Linda G. Sullivan","An increase in the number of contracts as well as cold weather.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Spencer Joyce from Hilliard Lyons.","Spencer Everett Joyce - Hilliard Lyons, Research Division","Just a couple of quick ones here from me. First one, I want to ask about the New Jersey rate case. That $66.2 million of revenue asked, is that inclusive of amounts that are already being recovered via the DSIC?","Walter J. Lynch","No, that's outside the DSIC mechanisms. They'll be included as part of the rate case in the end. But the $66 million is for other things, investment. As you know, if you've been following closely, we reduced our costs by $19 million since the last rate case. We invested $775 million in the infrastructure, and that's more than we've ever spent in New Jersey. And so asking for 9.9%, we think, is a big win considering it was 3 years since our last rate filing.","Spencer Everett Joyce - Hilliard Lyons, Research Division","Yes, absolutely very helpful. And also, sticking with the New Jersey DSIC, we'd gotten on a pretty good semiannual cycle there. With the rate case in progress now, is it safe to assume that we may have a bit of a stay-out from the DSIC asks? Or would those be totally separate items there?","Walter J. Lynch","No, we timed the DSIC with the rate case. So we filed in early January. Typically, it takes 9 to 12 months for the rate case to make its way through the BPU to get an order. We're right in line with that. And again, we timed the investment in DSIC with the timing of the rate case so that we're-- we can continue to invest up to the cap.","Spencer Everett Joyce - Hilliard Lyons, Research Division","Okay, perfect. Separately, and from kind of a broad standpoint, have you seen, perhaps, the California drought discussion have any ripple effects across some of your other jurisdictions? And I guess, specifically, I was surprised to see residential volumes down 6% on a firm-wide consolidated basis. Is that -- perhaps more of that's California than I'm expecting, but are you seeing any other usage declines that may be outside of drought-stricken areas?","Linda G. Sullivan","Yes, Spencer, there -- if you look at Slide 27, it shows our billed volumes for this quarter compared to last quarter. And there's a lot of noise in those billed volumes because we were implementing our customer information system in late 2013. And as a result of that implementation, we held some of our bills to ensure that we had a thorough review and we verified that they were accurate. And so we had higher bills that went in -- that went out in the first quarter of 2014, which is what's really causing that difference. If you look at the actual revenue piece of it, that's where those differences are trued up in the unbilled revenue line item. And the year-over-year declining usage was actually $3.3 million.","Spencer Everett Joyce - Hilliard Lyons, Research Division","Okay, perfect. I did notice the revenue didn't quite decline with the volume, but that makes a lot of sense.","Susan N. Story","And Spencer, from a big-picture standpoint, people are watching California. I think Texas is the next state that would be closest to that in terms of dealing with water supply issues. But we also know that in several states, especially the Mississippi, we tend to have rainfall amounts that have been more normal. So unless -- it's pretty local. So when we're in these national conferences and we talk to folks, they're mindful of what's going on in California, but they're not really doing some of the same things. They're just kind of checking to make sure they have adequate water supplies. And it actually helps us in terms of the replacement of aging infrastructure, where in the country, overall, we lose 25% of all treated water every year through aging infrastructure, through leaks and all. So this actually helps our case on the aging infrastructure replacement because as we move into a time where they may be less water supply, we cannot afford to lose our water through leaks.","Operator","Having no further questions, this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to management for closing remarks.","Susan N. Story","Thank you so much. So before we conclude our call, I want to remind everyone that our second quarter earnings call will take place on Thursday, August 6, at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time. We also would like for you to save the date for our 2015 Analysts Day, which will be held on December 15 in New York City. We'll provide you more information about this as we get closer.","We appreciate your interest in American Water, and we commit to continue to be responsible stewards of your investment and the confidence that you place in us. We look forward to speaking with you all again soon. Thanks.","Operator","The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

Sterba","Thanks, Ed, and good morning to you all, and appreciate you joining us this morning. Before going into the main topic for our call today, which is to discuss 2013 results, it could be useful to provide you some summary information on the Freedom Industries chemical spill into the Elk River in West Virginia. So let me ask Walter Lynch here, President of Regulated Operations, to provide a brief summary of what happened, how West Virginia American Water responded and the current state of the system. Walter?","Walter J. Lynch","Okay. Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. As most of you have found this event over the last month, I'm not going to go into the timeline and details of the Freedom Industries spill. I'd rather want to provide you a brief overview, as Jeff said, of how West Virginia American Water responded and where we currently stand.","And as you may know, this is a very complex system with over 175 pressure zones, while the average water system has about 2 to 5 different zones. We're extremely proud of how our people responded in a difficult situation. Throughout the period following the Freedom spill where federal and state emergency declarations were in effect, we provided our approximately 95,000 customers or about 300,000 people in 9 counties with water for basic sanitation and fire protection. And this was done while dealing with the impacts of the spill. Being able to provide this critical services our customers was one of the reasons that it was necessary to keep the plant up and running during the event.","On January 9, the date of the Freedom Industries chemical spill, we consulted with the West Virginia Bureau for Public Health, and together, reached a joint decision to issue a Do Not Use order for drinking, cooking or washing to our customers in the Kanawha Valley system, again, affecting approximately 95,000 customers or about 300,000 people.","During this time, West Virginia American Water also consulted with state and local public health officials and the Centers for Disease Control. This quickly led to an interagency team being formed in West Virginia, comprised of West Virginia American Water employees, National Guard members and representatives from the West Virginia Bureau for Public Health, the Department of Environmental Protection and Kanawha County officials. Now internally in American Water, we formed an event management team to leverage our scale, expertise and resources from around the country.","To give an example of some of the things we were able to do, we deployed water tankers and truckloads of bottled water to assist at the bulk water distribution sites. We also secured large quantities of activated charcoal and potassium permanganate for use in the treatment process in addressing the chemical spill and the chemical there at Freedom Industries. We added resources at our 2 national customer service centers, and we gave our West Virginia American Water customers priority service during this time. And were able to get 40 water quality specialists from throughout the American Water, working with our customers to address the water quality questions that our customers in West Virginia had.","We conducted extensive and continuous testing of water in the impacted areas, and this included the river's wild water, finished water leading the Kanawha Valley Water Treatment Plant and hundreds of points across our distribution system. Working closely with federal and state health agencies and regulators in this massive sampling and testing program, we were able to lift this \"Do Not Use\" order in stages over a 5-day period beginning on January 13. As of today, all points of testing throughout the water distribution systems showed that levels of MCHM from the Freedom Industries spill are below 10 parts per billion. Now 10 parts per billion was established by the interagency team as a non-detect level of MCHM in the water distribution system. This was based on the measurement capabilities of the multiple laboratories used during the event. And this is 100x below the 1 part per million standard established by the Center for Disease Control that was used as the basis for the lifting of the \"Do Not Use\" restriction.","We continue sampling water in the distribution system, and since February 14, we've been working laboratories to measure levels down to 2 parts per billion as we help address the remaining odor issues from the Freedom spill. We know that odor has added a customer concern regardless of levels, and we're going to continue to test and flush our distribution system to address this issue.","We've also decided to provide our residential customers with a 1,000-gallon credit to allow them to flush their water system without cost. This equates to approximately 10 days of normal water usage for our average residential customer in West Virginia. Additionally, to aid small businesses in this difficult time, we're providing a financial credit equivalent to 2,000 gallons to approximately 5,300 commercial customers.","Throughout this event, our primary focus has been and remains the safety of our customers and our employees. We remain fully committed to working with the federal, state and local officials to provide information, address concerns and protect our customers' tap water. I want to thank our West Virginia American Water team. They've worked around the clock since this event began in January 9, and they continue do so because of their dedication and their commitment to our customers.","With that, I'll turn it back to Jeff.","Jeffry E. Sterba","The Freedom Industries chemical spill, as you all know, is a serious event, and it placed the water supply to almost 300,000 people at risk. And as Walter said, we're very proud of our folks at the West Virginia American Water and how they responded to help ensure fire protection and basic sanitation, as well as bottled and bulk water for consumption starting the next morning and through the recovery period.","This incident should be used as a catalyst for public policy discussion about protecting source waters from contamination from fixed and mobile sites. As a water utility, we take our responsibilities to meet or exceed all regulations very seriously, and we're proud of our record doing such. It is not our role to establish those regulations. That belongs to governmental agencies. But we do hope that constructive engagement can occur on increased tank safety, provision of greater information to water utilities on tank contents and stronger communication linkages between regulators, tank operators and water utilities.","As you may know, there's over 100 known contaminants that are regulated and that we protect customers from, and about the same number of what are called emerging contaminants, which are being evaluated and we are actively studying. But there are also about 85,000 unregulated chemicals in the EPA's toxic inventory and hundreds of thousands of other compounds not registered, including ones stored in fixed and mobile tanks like the MCHM and PPH involved in the Freedom Industries chemical spill. Water systems cannot detect, much less protect, customers from all of these. That protection must come from ensuring such leaks, if they ever do occur, cannot enter source water.","So with that as a kind of a brief summary, let's turn to our 2013 year-end results. And if you go to Slide 6, you can see that the continued to advance not only our numbers but our strategic growth initiatives, improve our operational efficiency and generate strong financial performance despite cooler, wetter weather across much of our service areas. You can see our operating revenue increased year-over-year to $2.9 billion and our adjusted earnings from continuing operations, excluding a onetime charge of $0.14 per share, was $2.20 per diluted common share compared to $2.11 per share in 2012.","If you take into account the weather differences between the states, 2012 earnings were benefited by hot, dry weather that was worth about $0.14 per share, while 2013 earnings per share was adverse due cool and wet weather to the tune of about $0.05. In addition, we reported cash flow from operating activities of almost $900 million compared to about $950 million in 2012. This decrease was primarily driven by some working capital changes, and Susan will cover this in more detail.","The adjusted ROE decreased slightly from 8.42% in 2012 to 8.29% due to the weather difference. If the difference in weather is taken into account, as we talked about earlier, the 2013 ROE exceeded the earned 2012 ROE by about 56 basis points.","Turning to Slide 7. Let me just speak briefly on how our results compare with the goals that we set out to achieve at the start of the year. On the regulatory front, the company received authorizations from general rate cases for an annualized revenue increase of approximately $41.5 million. We also received about $49 million in additional annualized revenues from infrastructure surcharges in several states. This is the first time that the amount of surcharge revenue has, in fact, exceeded the amount of rate case-related revenue, which ties, as we've talked before, to moving to a much higher percentage of our CapEx being recovered through infrastructure surcharges, looking at something in the 60% range as we move into this year. As of now, we are awaiting final orders in 3 states in response to our request for additional revenues on an annualized basis. Those cases amount to about $58.4 million.","On the cost side, we achieved our O&M efficiency ratio goal of under 40% system-wide by 2015, 2 years early, with a ratio of 38.7% for the 12 months ending December 31. The commitment to continuous improvement and process excellence is really becoming ingrained in the fabric of our culture. Just last year, we had more than 400 employees applying new skills in more than 180 specific projects that were completed last year, generating savings of over $10 million annually. And that doesn't include the $12 million of savings coming through supply chain initiatives. In fact, as we've talked about in December, our 5-year plan will generate operating cost savings of over $900 million in the 5 years from 2014 through '18, compared to business as usual. And our goal is to further reduce the O&M efficiency ratio on average across our system to 35% by 2018.","Capital expenditures for the year totaled $950 million for needed system improvements to provide reliable service to our customers. We know that as we drive efficiency into our operations, we can enable more of the needed investments in the aging water infrastructure without putting undue burden on the water bills of our customers.","Lastly, 2013 was a year marked by growth, as evidenced by adding about 30,000 customers to our regulated customer base through the acquisition of 10 water and 5 wastewater systems. It's also important to note that 20,000 of those customers were obtained through an acquisition of Dale Services Corporation wastewater business, where we already provided water. And as we've talked about, that's one of our key strategies going forward.","And we also expanded our Homeowner Services business into 10 more states and launched our service line protection partnership with New York City, as well as announcing partnerships with Houston and Nashville.","So as we look to 2014 on the next slide, we are reaffirming our annual earnings guidance that was provided on December 17 to be in the range of $2.35 to $2.45 per share, excluding the impact of the Freedom Industries chemical spill. The impact of that spill through earlier this week, February 26, 2014, is estimated to be $0.02 per share. We remain confident in our ability to deliver on our long-term EPS growth goal of 7% to 10% through the execution of the growth strategies that we discussed in December and continued operational efficiency gains.","So with that, let me turn the call over to Susan Story for a more detailed report on our financials.","Susan N. Story","Thank you, Jeff, and good morning to you all. It's a pleasure to be here with you today to review the year-end 2013 results. Jeff has already reviewed many of the key highlights. So I'll just now take a few minutes discuss the drivers of our 2013 results in more detail.","Turning to Slide 10. As Jeff mentioned, our 2013 results reflect the wetter, cooler weather conditions in 2013 as contrasted to the hot and dry weather we had in 2012. Despite the unfavorable weather conditions, 2013 was another year of solid financial results, with increasing revenues, as well as continued progress in operating efficiency.","For the year ended December 31, 2013, we reported operating revenues of just over $2.9 billion, which is approximately $25 million higher than in 2012. The increase was mainly a result of rate case resolutions and infrastructure mechanisms in place, which allow more timely recovery of capital investment in infrastructure. As we mentioned previously, this was partially offset by decreased consumption, which was significantly driven by the wet, cool weather of the year.","This past year, we recorded net income from continuing operations of $369.3 million or diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $2.06. This compares with net income from continuing operations of a little over $374 million or diluted EPS from continuing operations of $2.11 in 2012. As Jeff mentioned previously, net income for 2013 included a charge recorded in the fourth quarter for the execution of a debt tender offer that we had announced in September of 2013 and that we closed on in October. Excluding this $24.8 million or $0.14 loss per diluted share for the tender, our adjusted EPS for 2013 was $2.20. The main drivers for our growth in 2013 were increased revenues due to rate increases, including the surcharge mechanisms that Jeff described, and lower O&M expenses. These increased revenues were partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization expense and general taxes.","For December 31, 2013, we reported cash flow from operating activities of approximately $896 million compared to $956 million in 2012. There are a few reasons for this reduction in cash flow from operations given changes in working capital, which can be viewed in more detail in the 10-K. However, a special note, with the ERP implementation in 2012, we were delayed in executing accounts payable at normal volume, and this was contrasted with the CIS implementation in 2013, which had the opposite effect and resulted in some delayed billing and receivables. This was due to the intentional decision we made to hold and review some billings in order to ensure the accuracy of the new system that we're sending these bills to our customers. We expect our billing operations to be more normal as we progress into 2014.","Now let's discuss the different components of our income from continuing operations, starting with revenues on Slide 11. Again, I encourage you to read our 10-K on file with the SEC for a more detailed analysis of both revenues and expenses.","Overall, operating revenues increased $25 million or 0.9% with revenues from our Regulated Business increasing by $29.5 million or 1.1% from 2012. Regulated revenues were lower by approximately $64.5 million, associated with lower demand year-over-year, in large part due to the unseasonably hot weather in 2012 that both Jeff and I talked about. However, revenues increased approximately $72.4 million, primarily from rate increases obtained through rate authorizations awarded for a number of our operating companies. Additionally, surcharge and balancing account increased revenues by another $16.4 million.","Revenues were also higher by almost $10 million, $9.9 million, as a result of regulated acquisitions. The most significant was our New York acquisition in the second quarter of 2012, which brought an additional 4 months of revenue in 2013. Additionally, the acquisition of Dale Services by our Virginia subsidiary in the fourth quarter of 2013 also contributed to this increase in revenue.","For our Market-Based Businesses, revenues for 2013 decreased by $4.9 million, mainly due to lower revenues of $17.3 million related to the termination of certain municipal and industrial O&M contracts, which mainly occurred in 2012. Most of these contracts were ended as part of our business optimization effort, which we designed specifically to optimize margins in our Contract Operations business.","Additionally, revenues from capital project activity associated with military construction decreased $8.4 million compared to the prior year, resulting from delays in project work, which we believe will resume in 2014. These decreases were offset by net increase of $4 million from price redetermination for several of our military contracts, as well as an increase of $16.6 million in our Homeowner Services revenues associated with contract growth mostly in New York City. Parent elimination and other was $4.3 million lower compared to 2012.","On Slide 12, totaling operating expense for 2013 increased by about $4.1 million from 2012, roughly flat compared to the prior year. Operation and maintenance expense in the Regulated Business decreased $24.5 million or 2.2%. Within the regulated O&M expense category, customer billing and accounting expenses increased $3.4 million. This increase is primarily due to uncollectible expenses associated with aging of receivables, most of which is due to our CIS implementation and to a lesser extent to rate increases during the year. Operating supplies and services and the other category increased $7.3 million. Operating supplies and services costs increased $4.8 million, mainly due to higher contracted temporary labor costs associated with the stabilizing and leveraging efficiencies for our ERP system that we implemented in 2012.","The other expenses, include casualty and liability insurance premium and regulatory costs, which increased $2.5 million, primarily due to higher casualty insurance costs as a result of historical claims experienced and retroactive adjustment.","Production expense decreased $3.6 million or 1.3% for the year as a result of lower water production and sales during 2013. Employee-related costs, including salaries and wages, group insurance and pension expense, decreased $16.4 million or 3.5% for 2013 compared with the prior year, primarily due to decreased pension expense. This employee-related cost represent approximately 41.2% of O&M expense for 2013.","Maintenance, materials and supplies decreased $15.2 million or 18.8% for the full year 2013. This decrease is mainly attributable to increased preventive maintenance expenses throughout our regulated subsidiaries that we performed in 2012, and we realized a positive impact of those expenditures in 2013. The Market-Based Business decrease in total operating expenses is mainly due to the termination again of those certain municipal and industrial operations and maintenance contracts in 2012, as well as the release of the lost contracts reserves of $3.8 million in 2013.","In 2013, we also reported a higher consolidated depreciation and amortization expense of $26.2 million and higher general tax, parent and other of $12.8 million. The increase in depreciation and amortization was principally as a result of additional utility plants placed in service, including Phase 1 and Phase 2 of our business transformation projects. You remember Phase 1, our ERP system, was placed into service during the third quarter of 2012. And Phase 2, our CIS or customer information system, as well as our EAM or enterprise asset management system, was placed into service in 2 waves, during the second and fourth quarters of 2013. The increase in general tax expense is primarily due to higher property taxes of $5.2 million, most of which is the result of incremental taxes associated with our New York acquisition.","Turning now to Slide 13. To better explain the period-over-period difference in our earnings per share figures, we have the EPS bridge we began showing you last year. As you can see, we normalized our 2012 diluted EPS from continuing operations for weather and the foundation contribution, as we have shown you consistently. Next, we outlined the various financial drivers, which get us to our 2013 year-end number, most of which I've already described in the revenue and expenses discussion.","For the 2013 GAAP diluted earnings per share, it's $2.06. We've added back the onetime debt tender impact of $0.14, which brings our adjusted earnings per share to $2.20. Just as we adjusted the 2012 reported EPS of $2.11 to $1.99 to reflect weather impact, we felt that for a weather normal reference, we should now show the 2013 weather impact on our EPS. The midpoint of our 2013 weather impact is approximately $0.05, which we described in both second and third quarters. This is the number we will use for inclusion on our long-term EPS guidance wedge showed on Slide 21 in the appendix.","As I mentioned, the other components were discussed earlier, and we will be happy to answer any questions to provide further clarifications if we need to during our question-and-answer session.","Slide 14 shows our O&M efficiency ratio. For the full year 2013, we achieved a 38.7% ratio, which is a considerable improvement from the 40.1% ratio we had for the full year 2012. As we shared with many of you at our Investor Day this past December 17, our goal is to achieve a 35% O&M efficiency ratio by 2018.","Let me just talk just a moment about the impact of these cost efficiencies. This is demonstrated in our Indiana rate case, which we filed last month. Our filing in Indiana by Indiana American Water reflected a $7 million reduction in O&M expense just from 2010 to 2015. If we had allowed those expenses in 2010 to rise just at inflation, it would have been a 23% increase in O&M or $15.7 million rather than a $7 million reduction. We're very proud of that. The team in Indiana has done a great job, as have been the teams across our entire services.","Now let's look at recent regulatory highlights. Slide 15 shows the expanded rate case template that we introduced last year, showing formal rate cases awaiting final order, as well as listing any step increases or DSIC filings, which impacted the quarter or are still pending. As you can see from the chart, we received resolutions in rate cases in Michigan, Kentucky, West Virginia and Pennsylvania in 2013 for an annualized revenue increase of approximately $41.5 million. Additionally, $7.5 million in step increases from prior rate cases became effective in early 2013. Infrastructure charges awarded in 2013 and in January of 2014 totaled $49.2 million and represent the ability to recover capital, which we invest to improve both infrastructure and customer service. As the February 26, 2014, we are awaiting orders for the general rate cases in 3 states, infrastructure charges in 3 states and a step increase in 1 state.","Last year, we created a new slide, an updated version of which you can find in the appendix, Slide 22, entitled Regulated Utility, Rate Base and Allowed Return on Excess. Many of you have requested this data showing each of our regulated state's authorized rate base, authorized ROE, authorized equity and the effective date of the rate case. These are historic cases, and we advise you to review the footnotes for a fuller understanding of the particular case in question. While you can never project how any new case will be determined, we hope this will help you understand our current rate environment.","And finally, as part of our commitment to shareholder value, on December 13, 2013, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend payment of $0.28 per common share, payable on March 3, 2014, to all shareholders of record as of February 3, 2014, which continued our commitment to an annual dividend payout goal of 50% to 60% of net income while growing dividend at the rate commensurate with earnings per share growth.","And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Jeff","Jeffry E. Sterba","Thank you much, Susan. On Slide 17, you'll recognize the growth triangle that we introduced at the Analyst Day event at December to give you a sense of the components of our growth and their approximate size. The triangle components, as we discussed then, will change over time, and what you see here is our projected 2014 earnings that achieved our estimated guidance of $2.35 to $2.45 per share, excluding the impact of the Freedom Industries spill. The impact of that spill, as we talked about, is estimated to be about $0.02 per share through February 26 of this year.","So this is roughly a 7% to 10% growth rate from 2013 results. We also are reiterating our comfort level with the guided 7% to 10% long-term earnings per share growth rate. As we've done more detail in our planning and progress the way we have, we can see the pathway much more clearly about what where we'll be able to generate that kind of growth, provide better service our customers at an average annual rate increase across all of our states of about or below 2% per year.","Slide 18 was also in the Analyst Day presentation and provides the identification of specific things that you can hold us accountable for achieving during the year and that we will report progress on. At this early date in the year, all things listed there are moving forward on schedule.","Last, for those of you who may not yet have talked with him let me take the opportunity to introduce Durgesh Chopra, who is now working with Ed in Investor Relations. Durgesh came out of our New Jersey Rates group, and I know he will do a great job working with all of you over the next set of years.","And so with that, we'll be happy to take any questions you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Shivangi Tipnis from Global Hunter Securities.","Shivangi Tipnis","My first question is there was nice growth for your industrial volume in Q4 sequentially, as well as year-over-year. What are the drivers for the industrial volume growth in quarter 4? And do we expect to see kind of the same positive growth even in 2014?","Jeffry E. Sterba","I'm sorry. We're having real trouble hearing your question.","Shivangi Tipnis","Okay. So there was a nice growth in your industrial volumes in Q4 sequentially, as well as year-over-year. So what are the drivers for the volume growth in industrial? And do we expect to see the trend ahead in 2014 as well?","Susan N. Story","So if I understand your question correctly, you said the quarter-over-quarter fourth quarter, the growth, what was driving the growth and do we expect to see that to continue, is that what you're asking?","Shivangi Tipnis","Yes, I mean, I'm talking about the industrial volume growth.","Susan N. Story","Yes. So what happened with the industrial volume, I mentioned the customer information system implementation. We held several of the more complex sales, and it impacted industrial and the public sales more than it did commercial and residential. So what we do is if you look at our 10-K, while we looked at billed and unbilled revenue on water volume, we just report billed water volume. So as we were holding bills, we had somewhat of a delay in terms of the amount of industrial volumes that we were able to bill. So that's where you might see a little bit of a disconnect. So we do expect that to normalize through the year. We have gone through those sales that are complex, ensured that the new system was generating accurate bills, and we've released the majority of those. Now we had 2 waves of implementation. The first wave was in May. Those bills, we released those, we're on the normal billing cycle. Our second wave was on October 20. That's when we implemented it. So after the first quarter, we should see more normalization there.","Shivangi Tipnis","Okay, okay, that sounds helpful. So my second question is on the O&M side. You did a great job lowering it down some 40.1% to 38.7%, the expense ratio. So I mean, the run rate of 35% is already -- which is expected on 2015, was already achieved. So do we expect to see kind of like a gradual slowdown in the run rate going ahead? Or if you look at the same run rate, then I think we can expect you to achieve the 35% run rate even before 2018? So can you provide some color here?","Jeffry E. Sterba","Yes. I guess the way to answer that is we have established the goal of 35% by 2018. We're not driven by that metric so much as by doing the right thing in managing our cost structure. That may enable us to get there earlier, but we certainly wouldn't forecast that at this stage. As you move up the tree collecting fruit, it does become a little more challenged and difficult, but that's why our whole process is around continuous improvement and process excellence and the reason why we are trying to engage as many of our folks as possible so that this becomes self-sustaining. So yes, I think we've had great progress. I think when I came here it was about almost 48%. So we've cut it actually by 10 basis -- 10 percentage points or over 20%, almost 25%. But going forward, we probably won't see it go down at nearly the rate that it has over the last 5 years. But we're still going to stay focused on it. Walter, you've got anything you want to add?","Walter J. Lynch","So we're addressing is, as we know, on multiple fronts. And Jeff, you talked about the yellow belt programs and the savings they're driving there. But we continue to look at our costs. The biggest costs we have are power, chemicals, fuel. And we continue to address those. And one with labor cost. So as you said, we're geared towards 2018 at 35%, and we're working right now to get there.","Shivangi Tipnis","So my next question would be in case you get this 35% quite earlier to 2018, so what would be -- what would you say would be a sustainable ratio? I mean, you would definitely not keep looking at lowering the ratio in terms of cost. So what would be a ratio that makes you happy and you would say, \"This is the ratio that I would like to maintain\"?","Jeffry E. Sterba","One of the things that you get when you really go through all the data that we, from the management side, look at, you see that there are differences by state. So for example, California has a higher ratio just by operating in California because, well, it's an extended process to operate in California and so every utility that operates there has higher ratios. We happen to be very good in California, and so we have a lower ratio than others. But it's higher than it is in many other states. So a lot of what is the right ratio will depend on where our growth occurs. So if we have -- if we see growth occurring in some states that are -- have higher cost structures because of the way they operate or their regulatory approach, then we think about it in that way. We look at the 35% on the basis of where we expect to see growth but also in the basis of our current business. So I don't think you can say here's the optimal percentage.","Susan N. Story","But Shivangi, I think I get your point though. There is a point at which it's very difficult because remember, when we talk about cost efficiencies, these are long-term efforts to take cost out of the business. These aren't quarter-to-quarter, year-to-year cuts. So as we look at more automation, more innovation, there are levels that you could sustain. But you're right, at some point, you look and say, \"Are we doing all we can do?\" But then there's usually a step change in something we can do in technology that maybe will help us further, but we don't know what that is.","Shivangi Tipnis","Okay, okay. And maybe my last question, and then I'll get back in line. So the estimated costs that you're expecting out of the Freedom chemical spill would be about $0.02 at this point in time. So I hope, as Walter mentioned, you have been doing a smooth execution, and it was really great. But then are there any headwinds that can still drive the costs ahead? And when we get a clear understanding if it's not just $0.02 and maybe a little more over $0.02?","Jeffry E. Sterba","Susan can maybe give you a little more detail about what's included in the $0.02 in the costs we have incurred so far. Going forward, it's really dependent on how the legal process goes because that's really the thing that will continue for some period of time. And that's really hard to estimates. We think a lot of the claims that have been made are easily dismissible. Other claims will have -- may have to go a little further before we can get free from them. But that's what's probably the biggest unknown is how the legal process will go forward. So for example, we recently filed on some of the claims to have them move into federal court. We won't know whether that's successful for a while because people will try to get them -- may try to get them back into the state court. Those kind of things can help drive what those legal costs will be. So that's why there's uncertainty around that.","Susan N. Story","But you are correct, this is a first quarter event. And when then we look at the charge for the credit that we mentioned earlier, when you look at the extra production costs, the labor, you look at O&M, you look at the cost of the tankers, bottled water, the legal expenses, the $0.02 that we reported reflects the expenses through February 26. So going forward, as Jeff said, we see the predominant being mostly the legal. Now because it's a first quarter event, we will have more information at the first quarter earnings call where we should be able to be a little more specific.","Operator","The next question comes from Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I have a couple of easy questions here. So at the Analyst Day, you outlined several wastewater acquisition targets. I just want to get a status update in terms of how that process has fared.","Jeffry E. Sterba","Well, I think we're moving forward on a number of fronts in acquisitions and discussions and negotiations, which obviously we can't talk about who or where they are, both in the wastewater and water arenas. And as we get to a point of any of those being signed, we will obviously let you know. So that's probably about all I could say, Neil, at this stage.","Susan N. Story","Except for, as you know, we really benefit the following year from the acquisitions we made in previous year. We mentioned in our acquisition increase revenue a large part of that was from New York that we had the full year and not just 8 months. So for '14, we'll be benefiting from acquisitions we made in '13.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","All right, fair enough. And as you think about your dividend, you've got a payout that's below your long-term target, and you've got above-average EPS growth. So can you talk through your dividend growth expectations as you look at '14 but then also beyond that?","Jeffry E. Sterba","Well, yes, Neil, as we've talked about before, we have a series of criteria that have been what we've established as our dividend philosophy, which is the target of 50% to 60% payout ratio and have a growth rate in dividends that's more in line with our earnings growth rates. So we are still -- we are slightly below the 50% to 60%. So in one sense, that gives us some flexibility. And we still believe in the long-term growth rate of 7% to 10%. That's really kind of the guidance that we have relative to dividends. Obviously, we just announced the last one. The next one is, if you follow our track record, is typically the one where we have announced an increase. So we'll let you know what that will be when we announce it.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And in California, the Monterey Peninsula, you've got a couple of big projects out there. Can you give us a status update on those?","Jeffry E. Sterba","Yes. Let me ask Walter to do that.","Walter J. Lynch","Okay. First, on the dam, we're working through our timeline of the dam, and we expect to have that torn down and the river rerouted sometime in 2015, according to our schedule. So that's progressing on time. The team has done a great job out there. Also, on the Monterey Peninsula Water Supply Project, we're working through the issues out there, and we're working cooperatively with the municipalities and with the commission. And we're working with the commission to look at the environmental impact report, which we expect now in the first quarter of 2015, and things are going according to plan.","Operator","The next question comes from Mike Gaugler from Brean Capital.","Michael E. Gaugler - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division","Jeff, you spoke about total contaminants, those you test for, those EPA has under consideration and some others. Given that it wouldn't be cost effective to test for all contaminants as a company, has AWK ever attempted or proposed to regulators to expand testing beyond state, federal guidelines to encompass all contaminants in a region within a specific radius of a watershed? On the surface, it would seem possible by scanning MS Data Sheets in the region, and my thought behind the question is that would appear to be a win-win scenario, greater public safety and also an additional avenue for CapEx investment.","Jeffry E. Sterba","Very good question, Mike. Let me raise a couple of points with you. There are -- for example, on the Ohio River, there is, as a result of the, I think it was the Ashland spill back in the '80s, there has been a network of testing. And some of it's automated. Some of it's still not automated. But a network of testing over, I think it was over 200 miles of the Ohio River, where each of the entities plus some federal monitoring that's being done is checking. But now it is not checking all elements. Part of the problem is that even if you have the sheets, every -- what they put in these tanks changes. And so we even once we can get to a point of having the required disclosures of what are in these tanks, then it's also a matter of keeping up with any changes that occur. Today, the -- take the tank in West Virginia. When I was meeting with the governor of West Virginia and also with the former governor who's now the senator, Manchin, one of the things that they said is, \"Look, this tank, this is a material that was deemed nonhazardous. They don't even have to tell us what's in that tank.\" So the first thing we got to do is get more transparency on what the heck is in the tank. Then it's a question of, okay, how, for all of these other compounds, can you develop or can you develop readily testing mechanism. And you also have to establish a standard. So take for example arsenic or mercury. We know those are contaminants, but they're naturally occurring. And so the regulations say you can't have more than x in water. It doesn't say 0 because frankly, you can't -- it's been naturally occurring for thousands of years. But they are concerned about it going above a certain level because there's been epidemiological study to determine what's the level at which it can create harm for people. So the first thing you've got into these 86,000 toxic chemicals and all the others is figure out what the heck a standard is. So I think we are -- there's quite a ways to go, Mike, in -- before we even can think about testing. That's because you don't have a standard and you don't even know what all the compounds are. I agree with your point that there needs to be examination of what other kinds of testing can be done for broad-based contaminants that you know may be upstream, but it's a bit more complicated just because we don't even have standards for most of these chemicals.","Operator","The next question comes from Andrew Weisel from Macquarie Capital.","Andrew M. Weisel - Macquarie Research","I'm filling in for Angie. The only question we have is wondering about the warranty business you have on water pipes given the deep freeze that's winter in so many of your states. Have you seen any increase in the activity in terms of people either requesting to add warranties in protection or in terms of actual claims filed?","Susan N. Story","This is Susan, Andrew. We have -- when we talk about the warranties, we offer water sewer and in-home. We have seen an increase in, in-home, not so much on the water-sewer because they're buried deeper in the ground. But the in-home is such a small part of our warranty business. It may be 6% of the Homeowner Services revenue. So really, yes, we've seen an increased incident in in-home, not necessarily the others, so we have been able to manage through that. And in terms of offering it again, we have a robust disciplined process before we ever bring on a new contract. We have a system of contractors. We have a master contractor who coordinates that. We go out to ensure before we institute a contract that there's not preexisting conditions. We also look for any indication that there could be, if a week later, there's a problem. So yes, we saw an increase in it, and it's one small part of the business. We've been able to manage it, but we have a robust process to ensure that when we do take on new contracts, that they are actuarially sound.","Operator","The next question comes from Heike Doerr from Robert W. Baird.","Heike M. Doerr - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Wondering if we could talk about New Jersey and if there's any update on pending CTA decision?","Jeffry E. Sterba","It is still in process. I think New Jersey has had a number of other things occurring that may have taken a little bit of a focus off this. We do continue to expect that it will occur, that we'll get some clarification out of the commission. We don't have control of the timeline. And again, at this stage, Heike, we don't have a good sense. I would hope that it will be in the next 3 months.","Heike M. Doerr - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And assuming that we would get some kind of a favorable ruling that makes the way that the commission treats this a little bit is more fair, is that something that you would recognize in the next rate case cycle? Or what would be the process once we have a decision?","Jeffry E. Sterba","It will be recognized in the next rate case cycle, absolutely.","Operator","The next question comes from Jonathan Reeder from Wells Fargo.","Jonathan Reeder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Susan, if I could. Would you, I guess, talk about some of those regulated O&M expenses of the drivers? It sounded like 2 of the increases, there was a lot of unsustainable components to it that we'll see probably drop off in 2014. But more importantly, the 2 accounts that dropped by wider margin and employee-related costs and the maintenance, materials and supplies, how sustainable are those decreases going forward?","Susan N. Story","First of all, in the increase, you're right, the 2 big increase areas were the billing and the uncollectible. And the majority of that was due to the implementation of the new system, which as of '13, we stabilized ERP. We see '14 as the year to stabilize even further CIS and EAM. Also, the other increase, as you noted, that was temporary labor that we used and leveraging efficiencies of ERP. In terms of the decreases, we continue to look at preventative maintenance. We continue in terms of the implementation of automation, for example, across our system, looking at our -- the fastest and smartest technology for communication protocol of ensuring that we can commoditize the purchase of meters. We can tie it into reading pressure flows, et cetera. So in terms of decreases, we're working on all of those. Let me back up a little bit though. Remember the goal, the chart we showed at Investor Day. It's to hold O&M as flat as we can, and in order to offset the increased depreciation and amortization, which was $26.2 million incrementally higher in '13 and '12, and because we're investing, the capital significantly in '14 will also increase, we're having to look at all of the O&M expenses. So if I look at each category, there are certain things we can do in each category, but all of our employees and our teams have the goal of trying to keep O&M flat so that we can have experiences like I described in Indiana in the rate case. And we have the implementation of CIS, EAM. We have not seen the efficiencies yet from that because the implementation was in '13. This year, in '14, we will be looking to leverage those systems the way we are looking to leverage ERP and start seeing some of those over the next 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 years. So we're just at the beginning of that process.","Jonathan Reeder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And so the overall goal was to just hold O&M flat and I guess grow the revenue side, and that's what's going to cause the decrease in the efficiency ratio?","Susan N. Story","Yes.","Jonathan Reeder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just a point of clarity, the 7% to 10% growth rate, is that now off of the $2.25 weather-adjusted 2013?","Susan N. Story","No, the wedge starts at $1.99, and the wedge will $1.99 for the rest of this year also. And next year and in '16.","Jonathan Reeder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Got you. Anticipating future questions. I like it. And then lastly, congrats on getting that military base contract. Do you know what the timing might be on the next determination from the military? Is there a few more decisions that we might see in 2014? Or do you have any clarity there?","Jeffry E. Sterba","Well, it's the last question really said it clearly. Do we have any clarity? The answer is no. We never really know when they're going to go forward. We know what are typical schedules, and they seem to be moving forward on the more typical schedule now. And because we've said we have about 6 or so bids that are currently outstanding, we would hope to see 1 or 2 of those come out as decision this year. On Fort Hill, it's an 8-month transition, which is a pretty quick transition. And it has already started, so we'll start to see the revenues from that transaction this year. And we would hope to see a couple more decisions this year. But if I can't tell you, we have intelligence that, that's going to occur.","Operator","The final question comes from Steven Fleishman from Wolfe Research.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC","Just on the West Virginia, Jeff, could you give us a sense of do you expect to see additional costs throughout this year from that? Or you're just not sure?","Jeffry E. Sterba","Well, Steve, I think as Susan said, the lion's share of our system-related costs are a first quarter occurrence. And a lot of that, I think, has already been incurred in January and February in terms of chemicals, overtime, bottled water, tankers, all the things that go along with -- plus the revenue credits that we're providing customers. I think beyond that, beyond the first quarter, frankly, it would largely be legal costs associated with working through the suits that have been filed that name us, working with our customers because we're going to aggressively work to have them not just understand but get comfortable with the water. One of the learnings out of this is -- and it's different than a lot of other chemicals. In this instance, it isn't what is -- how much can someone drink without putting themselves at risk. It really is can they smell it. And so what we're finding is there's so much lower concentration that someone can smell way below 200x, 300x below what's been determined as the acceptable level by the CDC. And that's a different challenge, and that's both in people's homes, as well as within our system. So we're contributed to do flushing, and you have that cost that will push in water, treated water, through systems. But I'd say the lion's share of operating cost impacts, the onetime operating cost impacts, will really just be in the first quarter.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC","Okay. And just any, I mean, any bigger picture kind of thought in terms of highlighting more of the -- obviously, this is not directly related to something with the water system, but just did this kind of refocus on the story you push about needing to replace and upgrade the system that we have overall?","Jeffry E. Sterba","I think it absolutely does. I mean, one of the challenges that we had in West Virginia, Steve, when it occurred is, if you'll remember, this was right after the polar vortex, so we had that enormously cold period and then warm. And when happens, you get line breaks. We had a lot of line breaks in our West Virginia system, which is an old system that's under a lot of duress because of the elevation changes within the system. And so pipes -- what we find is the pipes in West Virginia, frankly, don't last as long as they do elsewhere because of the stress that's placed on them. At the same time, our West Virginia customers have higher bills than most of our other systems because of density of population and the -- which is very low, and the cost associated with operating such a complex system. That is probably the most -- well, it is the most complex system we have anywhere in our 30 states, regulated and unregulated. So I think one of the things that does speak to is the costs that can be incurred with aged infrastructure. On the water plant side, our folks have done a great job operating that plant. We're going to continue to look at ways to help improve that plant. One of the issues that's been raised is whether there should be a second intake off another water source. If we look about that across our systems, some 20%, 25% of our systems, water treatment systems only have a single intake. That's something that has to be looked at in the context of what's the cost. So I think what it does is it opens the door for good conversation with all of our regulators about the trade-off between cost and the greater levels of investments, how can we manage that so that we don't push rates up too high. But we recognize that these systems are old, and that's really separate from the issue of how do we protect against the, hopefully, not bad actors like I think we had in this situation but potential contaminants dumped into a river or other water body.","Operator","There are no further questions. I'd now like to hand back to the management team. Thank you.","Jeffry E. Sterba","Well, let me thank you all for joining us today, and we look forward to talking with you at our next quarterly call.

In fact, our systems were 21 times better than the industry in drinking water quality and compliance as measured by the EPAs drinking water database. This is absolutely foundational to our business.","Our customer base is growing by a record 82,000 customers through closed and pending regulated acquisition. This is in addition to the13000 customers added from organic growth in our existing service areas in 2016. Our Military Services Group completed two price redeterminations in the fourth quarter for a total of $3.75 million in annual fee adjustment.","Keystone Clearwater ended 2016 as we projected. For 2017, natural gas prices have rebounded and both the drilling rig count and well completion activity have increased significantly. Keystone continues to increase market share, but offering total water management solutions at competitive pricing to Appalachian Basin E&P. At the same time, they expanded their overall services outside the oil and gas industry to the municipal water services market.","As you can see on Slide 7, operating revenues were $802 million during our fourth quarter. We experienced continued growth in our regulated businesses from investments, acquisitions and organic growth. And while we faced headwinds throughout the year in our market-based military services group, we benefited from due price redeterminations in the fourth quarter and four in the full-year. Linda will discuss the quarter's drivers in more detail in just a few minutes.","Operating revenues for the year increased 4.5% over 2015, and our 2016 annual earnings with all the effect of the Freedom Industries binding agreement in principle were $2 84 per share, up 7.6% over 2015 EPS.","Turning now to Slide 8, today we affirm our 2017 guidance of $2.98 to $3.08 per share and continue our progress toward achieving 7% to 10% EPS growth through 2021. Additionally, we project we will grow our dividend in 2017 at the top of our long-term EPS growth range following the double-digit growth we have had for dividends over the past four years. In summary, it was another really good year and we thank all of our employees who made it happen.","With that, Walter will now give his update.","Walter Lynch","Thanks, Susan. Good morning, everyone. As Susan mentioned, our regulated businesses had a strong year all around with historic capital investment, strategic acquisitions and continued O&M efficiency gains that benefit our customers.","Let's walk through some of the regulatory highlights of the fourth quarter of 2016. In December, we received an order adjusting rates for Illinois American Water. The case was driven by approximately $340 million and infrastructure investments across Illinois to ensure reliable service.","The order will result in$35.2 million in additional annual base rate revenue. Additionally and included a volume balancing account, which is a type of revenue stabilization mechanism. We would also like to note that Illinois American Water was rated the top water utility and customer satisfaction in the Midwest by J.D. Power.","In West Virginia, we received approval for a distribution system improvement charge, which will enable us to accelerate our infrastructure replacement reliability program, through DSIC, West Virginia American Water will make approximately $29 million in system-wide upgrades in 2017, which remain a 40% increase of pipeline replacement from 2016 and only impact our average customer by about $0.52 per month.","We're also weighting the West Virginia Commission's decision of an agreement related to the PFCs review of the Freedom Industries chemical spill. The settlement recognize the important changes made over the past three years to improve customer confidence in the water system and additional efforts plan in areas like source water monitoring, protection planning and public communications.","We believe this resolution is in the best interest of our customers, our employees and our company. As always, we'll continue to bring our customers the best service possible and we believe that we're positioned to be an industry leader in source water protection and planning.","In addition, California American Water is requested an extension of its current cost of capital and is awaiting a response from the California Public Utility Commission. This would affect rate starting in January 2018 and of course, we'll keep you updated. I also want to mention that last week, we announced multiple promotions and state leadership positions. From time-to-time, we talk about our commitment to developing talent with in, leveraging our internal expertise and having robust and sustainable succession plan.","Last week was a perfect example of that. Long time leaders with proven record of accomplishment were promoted the take on new challenges American Water, having a strong bench as critical part of any company's success. We believe that our efforts in this regard to position American Water very well for the future from a talent perspective. I congratulate all our newly promoted leaders.","On Slide 11, our employees drive legislative and regulatory relations and through their efforts, we made additional progress in 2016. Fair market legislation continues to expand most recently in Indiana and Pennsylvania. And in the past five years, legislation has been enacted in five of the states we serve that directly help communities address distressed water and wastewater systems. Our employees will continue to work with state and federal officials to help the nation and our states tackle serious water infrastructure challenges beyond our own Company.","Turning to Slide 12, 2016 was also a great year for growth. We added 13,000 customers to organic growth in our existing service areas and through pending and close acquisitions will add approximately 82,000 customers in our regulated businesses. This includes our newest wastewater customers in Scranton and Dunmore. We completed the acquisition of Scranton last December and we were so pleased to welcome the 31,000 new customers as well as the new employees who joined our Pennsylvania American Water team.","Moving on to Slide 13, doing right by our customers is key to our ability to grow. This means smart investments balanced by efficient operations and capital deployment. As Susan mentioned, we invested more capital this year than in any other with $1.3 billion going into our regulated operations. This is critical to reliable service, but it's also about affordable service. We spoke about this at our Investor Conference. You can see the progress we made in our O&M efficiency ratio going from 44.2% in 2010 to 34.9% for the last 12 months ending December 2016.","We established a new target of 32.5% by 2021. And our success here is 100% due to our employees, and a culture of continuous improvement and a commitment to our customers. For example, in our Pennsylvania operations, we found and repaired more than 5 million gallons per day of unknown non-surface leaks using sell loggers. This technology provides remote alarming and automatic data uploads from any location where self service is available. We estimate that will save $75,000 per month in just one operating area. We will now look to expand this across our footprint saving money and valuable water for our customers.","Finally, on Slide 14. I just want to highlight some of the examples of how our operations really demonstrate our vision clean water for life every day. In both New Jersey and Tennessee, we help the area struggling with water source challenges. A local leader in the surrounding county, Bledsoe as Tennessee American Water, if we can help a small community and private wells during the exceptional drought of 2016. We are able to quickly mobilize water tanker and delivered to local volunteer fire department. As soon as we arrived, residents were lining up to fill containers for use in their homes.","In New Jersey, we transferred 4 million gallons a day through the northern part of the state under a drought watch. We are able to provide assistance here because of our expansive distribution network, and the interconnects throughout the state. We are also completing an internal project that will increase our capacity to transfer volumes greater than 10 million gallons a day in cooperation with the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection.","In California, our project to remove the San Clemente Dam and reroute the Carmel River was named Green Project of the Year by The American Infrastructure Magazine. This project was a win for the local people and the environment. The removal of the dam and restoration of the river has many benefits, including the recovery of threaten wildlife, the preservation of more than 900 acres of coastal watershed lands and the permanent removal of the public safety risk posed by the San Clemente Dam. And of course, we are proud of the excellent water quality results as Susan mentioned.","These results give our customers' confidence in the water they drink and use everyday. So it was a great year of growth, smart investments and engaged employees, driving efficiencies and quality results also benefit our customers.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Linda for more detail on our financial performance.","Linda Sullivan","Thank you, Walter and good morning everyone. We reported earnings of $0.57 per share in the fourth quarter of 2016, up $0.02 over the same quarter last year. As shown on Slide 16, our Regulated segment and market-based businesses were each up $0.001 and parent was flat to the prior year.","For the full-year, we reported earnings of $2.62 per share, excluding the $0.22 charge from the binding agreement, our adjusted earnings per share were $2.84, up $0.20 or 7.6% compared to the prior year. These adjusted results were driven by our regulated segment which was $0.23 or 8.7%. Our market-based businesses were down $0.01 and parent was down $0.02 as expected.","Turning to Slide 17. Let me discuss the quarterly results by business segment compared to fourth quarter last year. Our regulated operations were up $0.001 overall, revenue was up $0.12 from authorized rate cases and infrastructure mechanisms to support investment growth, acquisitions and organic growth. O&M expense was higher by $0.05, $0.03 of which was due to timing.","As we mentioned in our third quarter earnings call, we expected about $10 million of certain maintenance, repairs, and tank painting expenses to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2016. We also had higher depreciation and general taxes of $0.03 each driven primarily by our investment growth.","For our market-based businesses we were up $0.001 mainly from the 2016 addition of Vandenberg Air Force Base in our Military Services Group and price redeterminations at several military basis. We recorded price redeterminations related to prior periods in the quarter they are completed.","Turning to Slide 18. Let me walk through our 2016 adjusted earnings per share, compared to the prior year. The regulated businesses adjusted earnings were up $0.23 or 8.7% with four major drivers: First, revenue was higher by $0.43 per share of this $0.43, $0.32 was from infrastructure surcharges an authorized rate increases to support investment growth, $0.08 was from acquisitions and organic growth and $0.03 was from balancing account and other.","Second, adjusted O&M expense increased $0.06 from several factors. We have higher production and employee related costs to support growth in our business. We also had a $0.05 negative impact from several non-recurring items including a judgment on a contract dispute, a technology write-off, and the 2015 benefit from finalization of the California General Rate Case. These increases were partially offset by lower casualty insurance claims and lower uncollectible expense.","Third, depreciation expense increased $0.09 from investment growth. And finally, general taxes, interest and other increased $0.05 again attributable to our investment in infrastructure to provide reliable service to our customers. I would also like to point out that although there was no year-over-year weather impact in our regulated business. We did have a favorable weather impact $0.05 in 2016. Mainly from the dry weather conditions in New Jersey that well to discuss.","Next, the market based businesses were down $0.001 year-over-year. We previously shared with you some headwinds; we were facing from lower capital upgrades in our Military Services Group, and Keystones efforts to manage their business to be earnings neutral despite a very challenging natural gas market. With that said, the Military Services Group ended the year flat compared to last year.","Although revenue was down $21 million due to lower capital upgrades compared to 2015. The impact was offset by the addition of Vandenberg Air Force Base price redeterminations in the fourth quarter. In our Homeowner Services Group revenue was up $11 million compared to last year, but it was more than offset by higher claims, increased marketing expenses and costs associated with investment in a new Homeowner Services Group customer information system.","And lastly, Keystones results for the year were essentially earnings neutral as we anticipated. Parent and other costs were higher by $0.02 primarily from higher interest expense on long-term debt, higher short-term debt balances and increased interest rates on short-term debt compared to the prior year. Also in 2016, we contributed $2.3 million to the American Water foundation a 501c3 organization which exists to help the communities we serve offer a better quality of life to their citizens.","Turning to Slide 19. We have a total of $125.4 million in annualized new revenues effective since January 1, 2016. This includes $92.2 million of new authorized revenue in 2016 which about two-third was from infrastructure mechanisms with the remaining one-third from rate cases. And we have another $33.2 million in new annualized revenues that have been authorized since the beginning of 2017. We have also filed and are awaiting final orders on four rate cases, a California-step increase and two infrastructure surcharge request for a total outstanding revenue request of $71.7 million.","Slide 20, highlights our key financial performance metrics that continue to create customer and shareholder value. You heard Susan and Walter talked about our record level of capital investment this year of $1.5 billion. This includes $1.3 billion of regulated system improvements to better serve our customers. These investments increased our estimated rate base at year-end 2016 to $10.7 billion a 7% increase from the prior year. The remaining $200 million was for acquisitions, with Scranton being the largest acquisition with an adjusted net purchase price of $151 million.","Our cash flow from operations grew 8.2% to $1.3 billion in 2016. This was driven by our strong adjusted net income growth and higher working capital. Working capital increased from lower capital upgrades in our military services business, continuous improvements in collection efforts in our regulated businesses and the timing of expenses. Our adjusted return on equity improved from 9.4% to 9.6%.","With the conclusion of our Illinois rate case, including the 45 basis point improvement in the authorized ROE in that state. Our weighted average authorized return on equity across our regulated footprint remains approximately 9.9% and we continue to narrow the gap between our authorized and achieved return through a continuous improvement culture that focuses on O&M efficiency, capital efficiency and constructive regulatory outcome.","Returning to Slide 21, and looking forward to 2017, we are affirming our 2017 earnings guidance to $2.98 to $3.08 per share. The major variables included in our guidance range are consistent with what we've showing you before was plus or minus $0.07 of weather or what we consider normal weather variability being the most significant. Events or variations outside of these ranges could cause our results to differ.","We also continue to be a leader in dividend growth, compared to the Dow Jones utility average, the UTY and our water utility peers. In fact, over the last four years, we have had dividend increases at the top end of our long-term 7% to 10% EPS compound annual growth rate. Subject to Board of Directors approval, we project our 2017 dividend growth to be at the top of that 7% to 10% long-term EPS growth range.","With that, I'll turn it back over to Susan.","Susan Story","Thanks, Linda. Before taking your questions, I want to highlight very briefly our Company value of environmental leadership and what it means to our customers. As the Company that relies on environmental protection for the services we provide, American Water is naturally focused on sustainability, not just because it's the right thing to do, which is certainly is, but also because it's our business imperatives.","It is more than just compliance with laws and regulations. Although we are proud that our systems are 21 times better than the industry. It extends to partnerships with environmental groups in our local watershed, the faster protection and education on water issue. It also means that we are front and center, national policy issues around sustainable water supply, water quality and replacing aging infrastructure. There are approximately 53,000 water treatment plants in the United States with about 400 of those participating in the EPA and AWWA partnership for safe water program.","In 2016, only 33 plants receive the President's Award, the programs highest honor. Pennsylvania American Water was awarded nine of these 33 out of a total of 53,000 water treatment plants. Also in 2016, American Water was recognized by the Environmental business journal for our water quality and sustainability and named by news week, as one of America's top green company.","Our efforts have also translated into eight patents, most dealing with water treatment technology as well as $43 million of research grant awarded over the years and of course that is because of the people we have at American Water. Our R&D group of 15 employees includes eight Ph.D. and four people with other advanced degrees.","They work hard everyday with researchers across the globe to find better ways to sustain, treat, deliver, and recycle our precious water resources and our 6,800 employees, including operations, engineering, water quality, and environmental lab professionals are always finding better ways to serve our customers and protect our environment. While awards are good, the best recognition is highly satisfied customers in their peace of mind.","With that, we're happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from David Cader at Baird.","David Cader","Hi, guys. Thank you for taking the question.","Susan Story","Hi, David.","David Cader","I was hoping that you could comment a little bit on Keystone\u2019s ability to continue to take market share even if especially in light of rising natural gas prices?","Susan Story","Right. So our Keystone operations are in the Appalachian Basin and we're the only water services provider that does the cycle of water management except, of course, we do not at the end the cycle take the waste at the site and put them into the deep wells that have been controversial. So because of that we're finding that more and more of the E&P\u2019s want to deploy their capital for their own. For example, development of pipelines and for their own services. So we can step in and basically handle providing the water and recycling the water on the site and they don't have to worry about it.","So we've gone from 20% when we purchased them in July 2015 to 35% now, we still believe that there are opportunities for growth in the area. And in fact what we're finding now is that there's so much work in the area that we're seeing some of the pre-kind of 2016 downturn, we're seeing some of the pricing come back for the services and the need for the large E&P\u2019s especially to feel comfortable that they have a partner who has a very strong commitment to environmental sustainability. So we do think that there is further room to grow in Appalachian Basin.","David Cader","Excellent. Thank you. And you guys touched a little bit on this in your prepared remarks, but I was hoping you could maybe talk a little bit about some of the levers you have to continue to improve O&M efficiency?","Walter Lynch","Hi, this is Walter. Yes, we're continually working on reducing our expenses, as you know when we talk about, I think a big enabler is the technology and that's why I highlighted the technology we're using in Pennsylvania. One of the big advantages we have as a Company is we're able to deploy technology in one area, take the learnings of that technology and then applied across American Water to realize significant value.","So I would say the technology, I highlighted the technologies, I highlighted in the past around non-revenue water and finding leaks in West Virginia doing things like using technology to streamline our routes, so that our people in the field are more efficient. Those are the things we're going to be doing across American Water to drive efficiencies. And a lot of the low hanging fruit we've already gotten, but the technology is going to be a key enabler.","Susan Story","One of the things we're excited about. For example, there's a lot in the press about drones and delivering packages. We are actually in New Jersey, American utilizing drones and infrared to actually go over pipes in the ground from the air and we are finding that we're able to spot leaks and find leaks before they ever occur in main breaks and you don't have to dig up the ground or anything, it's pretty cool some of the things we're doing.","And there was an FSR that I was out within Northern New Jersey a you months ago, David, and he had the smartphone and when I\u2019d say we went into a house I would say the royal. He went in and change the meter and I was with him in the house and we walked outside and this gentleman has been with the Company 38 years and he looked, watch this, he said I can read this meter immediately on my smartphone.","So there's a lot of really need things going on in terms of deploying technology in very practical way, not just the high-tech level ways, but things that make it easier for our frontline employees to serve our customers better and we're just at the beginning of that we believe.","David Cader","Excellent. Thank you, guys. That was helpful.","Operator","The next question is from Angie Storozynski of Macquarie.","Angie Storozynski","Thank you. So since your Analyst Day that's been a lot of updates that could have had impact on your M&A prospects. Right we had a little bit more clarity around the Trump\u2019s infrastructure plan and what type of water infrastructure you would actually focus on we have a New Jersey build that seems to be pushing for similar CapEx requirements on municipal water utilities versus investor-owned utilities.","Could you talk about those trends and also we seem to be having a little bit more movement on the corporate water M&A. If you could just give me a sense of how you think about M&A since the Analyst Day?","Susan Story","Sure, Andy. Thank you for the question. I will start and then Walter can talk specifically about the New Jersey situation. So interestingly, I've been involved with the Bipartisan Policy Center working on looking at the whole infrastructure issues around the administration in their efforts. And it's interesting, there are a lot of parties are interested we have a coalition, with the U.S. Chamber and NAM and several groups that are looking at this I think the question is remains as were is the money coming from.","So for us on the infrastructure we are very excited that there is a focus on infrastructure. We like that there is a lot of interest from both sides of the aisle and public-private partnerships. So we just have to see how that plays out, but the good news for us is, regardless of what plays out nationally we have such a strong capital investment program and being an investor-owned water utility.","We can see about that for us we're just continuing to do our business which is robust and as we said, we continue to invest more and more capital. So there could be something, the other we're monitoring it closely and hopefully we will see something come from that. The last question you ask and then Walter can talk about what's going on in New Jersey with the issue of municipalities.","We are constantly as we said in Investor Day we survey the landscape of all municipalities and companies that are out there that meet our guidelines and our discipline in terms of acquisition, but we are very disciplined. So when we look we don't see the need to grow for the sake of growing unless it is a good - it's a good investment for us for the long-term.","Our financial models we're always looking at so what will this mean in five years, 10 years, 15 years and ensuring that we have a discipline around those acquisitions. But that doesn't mean we're not looking or that we don't have substantial data and information on these opportunities it just means that we will not get out there and do something for the sake of just saying that we have an acquisition.","And I do think, it's interesting we've been waiting as you know following the Water industry as long as you have. Everybody keeps talking about there will be [indiscernible] the floodgate is open our municipalities to be privatized, but it's a one-by-one battle, it's as municipalities have to look at their own particular circumstances.","And they bet at all the options that they have available to them. So our entire strategy is we're in these communities, we're on the ground, we're there to be a solutions provider. We think in many cases we can provide services at a lower cost and we believe that we can improve water quality improves service and give predictability of cost in many locations better than what exists there and it's incumbent upon us to make sure that we tell our story. And the New Jersey situation a very interesting Walter if you were talk about that.","Walter Lynch","Yes, thanks Susan. Yes, what we're referring to here is, Water Quality Accountability Act and it was introduced by center Sweeney recently and New Jersey working its way through the Senate. It's going to work its way through the Assembly obviously and then get signed by the governor. But what it does is really requires the same things for municipalities and investor around utilities.","Let me give a couple of examples of what they're looking at. The testing of valves and hydrants per New Jersey Board of Public Utilities requirements would be not just required of investor-owned, but we required of all the municipalities with the New Jersey, cyber security program requirements, action plans for any notice of violation, developing a comprehensive capital long-term capital plan and a replacement rate for pipe targeted about 150 years.","These are all the things that were required to do in the investor-owned side in this really going to have the same requirements for municipalities throughout New Jersey. And the whole purpose is to make sure that the water quality is protected in New Jersey and that's really the focus of centers Sweeney\u2019s\u2026","Angie Storozynski","But you think on back of it municipalities will basically face incremental CapEx and that could actually push them to potentially privatize their systems?","Walter Lynch","Well, I think it will cause them to take a look. Do we want to do this as a municipality or do we call on American Water who has been doing it for decades and decades in New Jersey with great success and leverage our expertise. I think that's something that they are going to have to take a look at and we would be glad to talk to them about it because we are a solutions provider.","Susan Story","I thank the thing this points out Angie is not just EPA, what we have found in the past it's whereas we would immediately need to and would address issues that came up in terms of any non-compliance in wastewater for example, that there are many municipalities and cities that have had non-compliance items for decades.","And there was just a different standard holding them accountable then us and I think one of the things we learned from plant Michigan is, safe water is for everybody and regardless of who provides that water, whether it's private or public. There should be the same standards towards safe clean water and that we have great wastewater services and sanitation service.","So I think that as some of these things that happened, people have realized, it doesn't matter who the provider is. There needs to be standards that everybody follows. And for us, it's the ability to have a level playing field.","Angie Storozynski","Great, thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Ryan Connors at Boenning & Scattergood.","Ryan Connors","Great. Thanks and good morning.","Susan Story","Hi, Ryan.","Ryan Connors","I had a question with regard to the Scranton and McKeesport transactions. I\u2019m just trying to get a better handle on kind of how this impacts the guidance for 2017, as you do these larger transactions? Can you just walk us through kind of a Layman's back-of-the-envelope on how that impacts returns this year?","In other words if presumably until you get in for your next base rate case in Pennsylvania. There's some kind of a drag there on the returns coming from those systems in particular and that would be may be trued up once you do get rates and be a tailwind beyond 2017. Is that a fair way to think about that or can you just give us \u2013 walk us through the dynamics on that?","Susan Story","Absolutely Ryan, so in the investor material and in our slides, we outlined kind of the overall acquisition process, and if you look at Page 12 of our slides, really starts with the agreement process. So when we look at the Scranton acquisition, we have now closed Scranton as of December 2016. That means that we take on the customers we begin to integrate them into our system and generally from a financial standpoint during the timeframe between when we close and when we get through the final rate case decision.","We finance those acquisitions with shorter-term debt and we would expect these acquisitions to meet certain financial metrics, including being accretive to earnings, and so that is kind of the process that we go through until we file our next rate case decision - rate case, in the rate case process, then we will coming out of that process have our authorized amount that is included in rate base upon, which we would have the opportunity to earn full return.","Ryan Connors","Okay. So if I can paraphrase that, it\u2019s accretive right away, but then it becomes more accretive once you actually get base rates in place. So that a fair statement or not?","Susan Story","It\u2019s different for every acquisition, but yes, once you get that full amount in the rate base, that's what you would generally expect.","Ryan Connors","Okay, good. And then my other question was just big picture, I know we had the NARUC winter meetings recently and I wasn't able to get there, but I'm sure you had a number of people there. I think I saw the agenda. You had some folks on panels and things. Any takeaways there in terms of big picture emerging themes what's around the corner from a regulatory standpoint?","Susan Story","This is Susan, Ryan. I think everybody is just kind of wondering what's going to come out of Washington. They're looking at the issue of infrastructure what that mean. They're looking at any potential changes in the EPA for the electric side, the clean power plant, and what does this mean and the waters of the U.S. and I think everybody's also carefully watching for the tax issue.","So I think there are state issues that continue to be state to state, but I think it may just like everywhere else, we're kind of watching to see what is going to happen on the new landscape and we're all kind of speculating and we can draw general models. But at the end of the day, we're waiting to see even proposals. If we have proposals, we can model and see what the impacts are. At this point, we're just kind of guessing and I think everybody's pretty much in that situation.","We continue though to look at investment opportunities regardless MYR Group does with the President of MYR Group, Rob Patterson, of course, Pennsylvania has always been very innovative in the way that they look at infrastructure and ensuring that their citizens are taken care of, that are our customers. So I think it was kind of the same thing, but an uncertainty of \u2013 so what will the new rules be and how long will it take for us to know with those new rules are.","Ryan Connors","Got it. Thanks for your time this morning.","Operator","The next question comes from Spencer Joyce at Hilliard & Lyons.","Spencer Joyce","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my call.","Susan Story","Hi, Spencer.","Spencer Joyce","A couple questions here, jumping back to Keystone. Have you all disclosed or would you disclosing a capital budget for \u2013 or specifically for Keystone for this year?","Susan Story","No, we don't do that because it\u2019s so small, basically they were extremely capital-light. We are open to looking at design build on a five-year basis and we would actually look at that five-year for any capital investment from a depreciation standpoint, at least for our models. But right now, it's just not significant in that and we're just not really disclosing it because it's so small.","Spencer Joyce","Okay. And with the rebound in net gas prices, is it possible that 2017 could be kind of a \u201cnormalized year for Keystone\u201d or is it too early to say that?","Susan Story","Well I think it depends on your definition of normal, what normal is I think going back to the low turn we've had from the middle of 2015 say through the end of last year, we know things are picking up. I mean, you can just look at natural gas prices even though they've come down a bit, because of the really warm weather we've had this winter, we know that, of course, going into the summer 2015 natural gas was 33% of power generation, coal is 33%, nuclear was 20%.","Now we're starting to see as gas prices are so affordable that that will probably continue and we will probably see gas increase in those of you all who cover electric also know that regardless of what happens to the clean power plant and lot of plants are already underway and people are already building significant new combined cycle facility. So we believe that we\u2019ve turned the corner. We see activity tremendously growing, as I said in my comments, we're seeing rig counts up, we are seeing well completion activities up along with the natural gas prices.","We believe that we're getting back to a more normal, what that normally is. I think we're going to have to see over the next few months and we will continue in our quarterly discussions to say is it higher than we thought or less than we thought, but we do as we always are want to be conservative and make sure that we have a few more months under us to see what can we look at that more predictable. So it's much better than last year. Will that be back to 2013, 2014. I think we'd just have to wait and see.","Spencer Joyce","Okay. Fair points there. Very helpful. Switching gears, more of a housekeeping question, I know few months back when we got the West Virginia binding settlement or agreement there, there was kind of an outstanding piece with your own insurance companies that could ultimately notice some cash. Is that still outstanding or has that been settled? Is that possible we get a bit of an influx at some point this year?","Susan Story","Well, it's not settled and we had two different firms, who do not participate. And so we currently \u2013 one of them requires arbitration and we have begun the arbitration process. The other we have filed a lawsuit in West Virginia against and that's public information. So we are continuing. As you know these things don't happen quickly, but we are in process.","On October 28, we actually filed in Knott County against our indemnity and that one is public record. And then the other insurers we have actually started arbitration process as they are located offshore there was mandatory arbitration. And we actually have had the panel; the Chairperson of the panel has been selected. So we're continuing that process in both of those, that level of insurance together is $50 million, $25 million each.","Spencer Joyce","Okay. And that would be, I guess, simply a cash flow adjustment or an item perhaps at some point, I guess, obviously, if it were to be on the income statement we can adjust that pretty easily.","Susan Story","Yes. It would be both and if it were as you know the entire settlement was on West Virginia American Water's books, because they were the ones that the lawsuits were against. And so if we do recover any additional fund, it would go back to West Virginia American.","Spencer Joyce","Okay. Perfect. That's all I had. Congrats on a really nice year and look forward to seeing you all soon.","End of Q&A","Susan Story","Thanks, Spencer. And I would tell you that for those that we have not been able to answer your questions, our Investor Relations will get back with you. We appreciate all of you participating today. We appreciate those of you who were at our Investor Day. If you have any questions, again, please call Ed and Ralph, they will get back to you, if we didn't get a chance to answer your questions. I'd like to remind everyone that our 2017 first quarter earnings call will be on May 4 and our annual shareholders meeting will take place on Friday, May 12. Thanks again for listening. We hope you had a great spring and we will talk to you again in May.","Operator","The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending.

I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Ed Vallejo, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Vallejo, you may begin.","Edward D. Vallejo","Thank you, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for today's call. As usual, we'll keep our call to about an hour and at the end of our prepared remarks, we will have time for questions.","But before we begin, I'd like to again remind everyone that during the course of this conference call, both in our prepared remarks and in answers to your questions, we may make statements related to future performance. Our statements represent our most reasonable estimates. However, since these statements deal with future events, they are subject to numerous risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual performance of American Water to be materially different from the performance indicated or implied by such statements. And such risk factors are set forth in the company's SEC filings.","And now I'd like to turn the call over to American Water's President and CEO, Jeff Sterba.","Jeffry E. Sterba","Thanks, Ed. Good morning to you, all, and I appreciate you joining us today. Before Susan Story, our CFO, goes through our financial performance in detail, let me just set upon some highlights. As you've probably seen from yesterday's press release, our year-over-year second quarter results were influenced by the above average rainfall and cooler temperatures we've been experiencing versus the record-breaking drought and heat that was seen and felt in the second quarter of 2012. As you can see on Slide 5, this caused the decrease in revenues and earnings per share as compared to the same quarter in 2012. Other items that impacted the quarter-over-quarter comparison include higher depreciation expense, which Susan will touch on; and a retroactive regulatory adjustment that occurred in the second quarter of last year. In addition, looking at Slide 5, it appears that our 2013 year-to-date cash flow from operations is lower than the first half of last year, but this is really due to how our bank overdraft is now being treated as a reduction to operating cash flow as opposed to a financing activity. This is a result of a conscious decision last year to internally manage cash activities as part of our continuous improvement efforts. Year-to-date, this change in cash flow classification amounts to about $35 million.","Now obviously, the weather has a significant impact on our business. Our quarterly results really reflect a tale of 2 springs. Much of the country experienced above average rainfall and cooler temperatures in the second quarter of 2013, in sharp contrast to the same quarter in 2012 when much of the country was experiencing record-breaking drought and heat.","As if you look on Slide 6 at the precipitation charge, which by the way come from NOAA, the same large swath of the northeast and midwest that experienced severely dry weather in the second quarter of 2012 had either normal, or as is the case with the better part of the northeast, much wetter than normal and even a record wet weather this April to June. So clearly, this has an impact on customer usage. However, due to our geographic diversity across 16 states, that impact was somewhat mitigated by increased water consumption in other states. Nonetheless, we do attribute approximately $0.01 to $0.02 decrease in earnings per share from weather when compared -- which when you compare that to the $0.06 to $0.09 increase in earnings per share we attributed to weather during the second quarter of '12, that results in a total $0.07 to $0.11 impact of weather when you compare second quarter last year to second quarter of 2013.","Now turning to the continued growth of our business. We introduced Slide 7 to you last quarter to illustrate our growth drivers. We have core growth, which includes efforts to reduce regulatory lag and achieve appropriate returns on capital investment, as well as the tuck-in acquisitions that we make and the continued improvement of our regulated O&M efficiency ratio, as well as the execution in our current military contracts in the Homeowner Services business. Enhanced growth includes larger acquisitions, new expansion into the military business, as well as expanding into new territories and providing new services in our Homeowner Services business, providing products and services that are new in the municipal and industrial space, as well as continued expansion of the shale gas opportunity that we see in certain territories. Combined, these are the opportunities that we are confident will deliver 7% to 10% long-term earnings per share growth goal.","On the core growth side, during the quarter, we completed our wastewater tuck-in at Koppel Boro, tuck-in in Pennsylvania, which has got about 400 customers and received regulatory approval on the water acquisition of Whitwell Tennessee, that's about 2,800 customers. And in July, we received regulatory approval for the Pratt, West Virginia water system acquisition of about 450 customers. Those last 2 we expect will close later this year. We also made progress on regulatory approval of our pending acquisition of Tri State Utility, which provides water service to about 3,500 customers in the growing branch of Missouri area.","On the regulatory front, as you know, we filed rate cases in California, Iowa and Pennsylvania for a total of about $98 million in annualized revenue. While the final rate authorizations have not yet been received, we reached a settlement agreement in West Virginia for an $8.5 million increase in revenues. That's sitting before the regulatory for approval. And we implemented interim rate increases in Kentucky for the full $12.3 million, just at the end of July; and in Iowa for $2.7 million of that request. We've also received a total of $16 million in additional annualized revenues from infrastructure surcharges that become effective in Pennsylvania, Missouri and New Jersey in the April through July period.","On enhanced growth, in May, we announced an agreement to acquire Dale Services Corporation. This is one of the larger acquisition, that's a medium-size wastewater utility that serves 20,000 customers. We expect that transaction to close late this year.","On the Homeowner Services front, recall that the name of that -- of the company, our subsidiary, it's American Water Resources. It announced a nonexclusive partnership with the city of Houston to offer water and sewer line protection programs to more than 550 homeowners. And last month, American Water Resources was notified by the city of Nashville the intent to award the company an exclusive partnership to provide these protection programs to approximately 176,000 eligible homeowners. That's very similar to what we've done in New York, the program that we launched earlier this year. And just as an update on the service line protection in New York, recall that's being offered in partnership with the city's Department of Environmental Protection. We've seen just really good growth in that program. We've now got close to 100,000 customers enrolled. So that's a penetration rate of getting close to 20%. And nearly all of the customers are opting for both water and sewer line contracts.","Moving to Slide 8, we've made some significant progress in 2 large projects in our California subsidiary since our last call that I want to raise to your attention. Last week, California American Water reached formal settlements with a number of parties, including major environmental stakeholders, in our plans is to bring a stable water supply to the Monterey Peninsula. These settlements recognize the value of the portfolio approach to the water supply challenge that's presented in that area, which includes an offer for storage and recovery, groundwater replenishment and a desalination plant. The range of capital investment that's reflected on the slide reflects the ultimate sizing of the desal plant and whether groundwater replenishment moves forward, as well as contingencies on the capital cost estimates. The next step is a prehearing on the settlement which happens in a couple of weeks. And then going forward with the PUC approval, which we would not expect until towards the end of the summer next year. But we're very pleased to have this moving forward and real progress being made on this very critical project for the Monterey Peninsula area.","In addition, in June, we broke ground on our landmark San Clemente dam removal and Carmel River reroute projects. And if you think that's not a mouthful for a project name, they were challenged on how many words they could fit in. This will be a 3-year construction project and is the largest dam removal project ever to occur in California. That's something we're really pleased to be involved in. It includes an innovative engineering approach of rerouting the river around accumulated sediment to restore to its natural state. Removing the seismically unfit dam will provide many benefits to the region and its residents. First and foremost, it obviously removes a public safety risks posed by the potential collapse of the dam in the event of a large flood or earthquake, but it also aids in the recovery of threatened South Central California coast steelhead -- and as a fly fisherman that's something I'm particularly -- care about. By restoring the natural sediment flow and providing an unimpaired access to over 25 miles of essential spawning and rearing habitat. The neat thing about this, is it's it really is an innovative partnership between our company, state and federal governments and NGOs. Our hats and thanks go out to the California State Cultural Conservancy, the National Marine Fishery Services, the Planning and Conservation League, the Nature Conservancy and a number of others that we've worked with. We're grateful to our partners in this effort and pleased to see it moving forward. Between these 2 California projects, we will invest around $200 million or more over the next 3 to 5 years.","Now turning to Slide 9. Combining our performance in it the second quarter with the strong results of the first quarter, we are reaffirming our 2013 earnings guidance range of $2.15 to $2.25 per diluted share for continuing operations. This represents an 8% to 13% increase over the weather-normalized earnings per share for 2012 at about $1.99.","And with that, let me turn the call over to Susan for more detail on our finance.","Susan N. Story","Thank you, Jeff, and good morning to you, all. It's a pleasure to be with you here today to review the quarter and year-to-date results ending June 30. Jeff has already reviewed some of the key highlights. I will now take a few minutes to discuss the drivers of our results for the second quarter in greater detail.","Turning to Slide 11. As Jeff mentioned, our second quarter results reflect the impact from unusually cool wet spring weather with related decreases in revenue, net income and earnings per share. During the second quarter, we reported operating revenues of approximately $724 million compared with $746 million reported for the second quarter of last year. Looking back at the exceptionally hot, dry spring we experienced in 2012 versus the weather in spring 2013, and so far this summer, this year-over-year impact on demand is not surprising. Also impacting this quarter's results versus last year's corresponding quarter was a significant onetime retroactive adjustment due to the California rate case effective in June 2012. Additionally, this past quarter, we experienced increased depreciation expenses due to additional utility plant placement service, including approximately $3.3 million in expenses related to the implementation of our business transformation project.","Lastly, the decrease in revenues is also attributable to a decrease in market-based operations, primarily due to the termination of certain municipal and industrial O&M contracts, as result of our ongoing business portfolio optimization efforts. Our consolidated O&M expenses for the 3 months ended June 30 were roughly flat, decreasing $300,000 or 1.3% over the same period last year.","Now let's discuss, on Slide 12, the different components of our income from continuing operations starting with revenues. I also encourage you to read our 10-Q on file with the SEC for a more detailed analysis of both revenues and expenses. Overall, operating revenues decreased $21.3 million with revenues from our regulated business decreasing $19.7 million or 3% from 2012. The decrease in revenue associated with a lower demand was approximately $31 million. The year-over-year comparison obviously impacted predominantly by the weather effects, which we spoke of earlier. This demand decrease was partially offset by revenue increases of $15.8 million from rate increases obtained through rate authorizations awarded for a number of our operating companies and additional revenues associated with acquisitions of $2.2 million. Additionally, as I mentioned earlier, in the second quarter of 2012, we benefited from a retroactive adjustment totaling $7.2 million as a result of a California rate case.","For our market-based businesses, revenues for the second quarter of 2013 decreased by approximately $2 million. The net decreased in revenues is primarily attributable to lower contract operations group revenues of $5.1 million. These decreases are predominantly related to the termination of certain municipal and industrial operations and maintenance contracts, which amount to around $6.9 million for the 3-month period. These contracts were ended as a part of our business optimization efforts, designed specifically to optimize margins in our Contract Operation business. Additionally, revenues from capital project activities associated with military construction decreased $900,000 for the 3-month period due to lower levels of work as compared to the prior year. As we mentioned last quarter, when the military construction revenues were more significantly impacted, the majority of this work should take place later in the year and we have every reason to believe that these projects will be completed as they already been awarded and approved for construction. Also contributing to the decreases were lower revenues in our residual operations group of $1 million for the 3 months ended June 30, 2013 compared to the same period in 2012 due to lower levels of work performed. These decreases were offset, however, by a $2.3 million increase due to price redeterminations for 3 of our military contracts, as well as increases of $4.5 million for the 3 months ended June 30, 2013 in our Homeowner Services revenues associated with those customer and contract growth, most notably in New York City.","On Slide 13, total operating expenses for the second quarter of 2013 increased by about $7.4 million or 1.6% from 2012. Operation and maintenance expense in the regulated business increased $2.3 million or about 8\/10 of 1%, roughly flat compared with the prior year period. Production expense decreased approximately 3.4% for the 3 months ending June 30, as a result of the lower production and sales during the quarter. Operating supplies and services increased $8.6 million or 18.3%. It's important to note, this is primarily due to higher contracted services, resulting from about $6.2 million of incremental temporary labor costs related to the continued maturing of the ERP process implementation related to Phase I of our business transformation project. These enhancements are necessary for ongoing and future efficiency improvements resulting from our new SAP system. Also contributing to increases and operating supplies and services in the second quarter of 2013 were operating costs associated with the New York acquisition. Partially offsetting these increases were lower transportation expenses due to a reduction in leased vehicle costs.","Maintenance materials and supplies decreased $1.8 million or 11.1% for the 3 months ended June 30, 2013, mainly due to lower tank painting [ph] costs in our New Jersey subsidiary of $1.4 million.","Employee-related and other, decreased $2.2 million, primarily due to decreased pension expense. The decrease in pension expense for the 3 and 6 months ended June 30, 2013 was primarily due to decreased contribution in certain of our regulated operating companies, whose costs are recovered based on our funding policy. Which is a fund at least a minimum amount required by the Employment Retirement Income Security Act or ERISA Act of 1974.","Other operation and maintenance expenses include casualty and liability insurance premiums and regulatory costs. For the 3 months ended June 30, 2013, cost decreases was primarily driven by lower casualty insurance costs as a result of historical claims experienced and retroactive adjustments. In the second quarter, we also reported a higher depreciation and amortization expense of $8.8 million and a higher general tax expense of $2.1 million. The increase in depreciation and amortization is primarily due to additional utility plant placement service, including a depreciation expense of approximately $3.3 million for our business transformation project, which has a much shorter depreciation schedule than most of our other utility assets. None of our basic costs have been disallowed from rates at this time. The increase in general tax expense is primarily due to higher property taxes incurred as a result of our New York acquisition in the second quarter of 2012.","The market-based business operations decrease and total operating expenses corresponds with the decreases in revenue, which I have previously described.","Turning now to Slide 14. We have included a new side to better explain the period-over-period difference in our earnings per share figures. As you can see from this chart, we have broken out the positive $0.06 to $0.09 impact of weather for our 2012 results, as well as the net impact of the retroactive adjustment of $0.03 from the California rate case, which was booked in June of 2012. After taking these extraordinary events into account and using the midpoint of our weather impact, we get to what we consider a normalized earnings starting point for the second quarter of 2012, $0.555 per share or $0.56 rounded up. From there, we have laid out the various elements that explain the difference in our year-over-year earnings per share result. I'm not going to go through each one, but I do want to point out a few things here.","First, just for clarification, you do note here a $0.02 impact to earnings due to depreciation, and we had shown a $9 million expense increase in the expense line. For all of you modelers out there, the impact of the $9 million in depreciation expense is split on this slide between the $0.02 decrease in the depreciation bar, as well as being reflected in the 2012 California rate case decision and the New York acquisition bars. Second, we have broken out the weather impact for the second quarter of 2013 from declining customer usage from other factors on this chart.","And lastly, you also see a $0.01 increase quarter-over-quarter due to lower interest expense. And this is due to us taking a proactive approach to looking at refinancing alternative. For the quarter, our interest expense was reduced $2 million. For the June 30 year-to-date, it has been reduced by $3.5 million.","Now let's look at the regulatory highlights for the quarter. Slide 15 utilizes the expanded rate base -- rate case input we introduced last quarter, showing formal rate cases awaiting final order, which we separated between those filed for 2013 versus those filed in 2012. And also, any step increases our DSIC filings, which impacted the quarter or are still pending.","Including Pennsylvania, Iowa and California, we now have approximately $98.5 million in requested additional revenues from formal rate case we filed this year. And looking at the timing of these rate cases versus previous years, the rate cases we expect to resolve in 2013 should be towards the end of the year versus midyear in 2012 when we had 3 rate cases finalized in the second quarter.","As Jeff noted earlier, West Virginia's water and wastewater cases have a settlement agreement in place reached by West Virginia American Water, the PSE stack and the consumer's advocate division, subject to the formal TSC ruling expected in the fourth quarter. Kentucky rates were increased $12.3 million on an interim basis, subject to refunds effective in July. Under Kentucky regulation, if an interim increase is put into effect, only the full amount of the rate increase request is allowed prior to the formal PFC decision, which we expect in October of this year.","Of note, our first infrastructure charge in New Jersey took effect on July 1 for $4 million in additional annualized revenue. In our continuing efforts for transparency, we have created a new slide, which you can find in the Appendix, Slide 25, entitled Regulated Utility Rate Base and Allowed Return on Equity. Many of you have requested this data showing each of our Regulated Businesses authorized rate base, authorized ROE, authorized equity and the effective date of the rate case used. We have included this information for our 10 largest regulated subsidiaries on the slide. These are historic cases and we advise you to review this footnote for a fuller understanding of the particular case in question. While you can never project how any new case will be determined, we hope this will help you understand our rate environment.","Turning now to Slide 16. This is a slide we introduced to you last quarter, which illustrates our commitment to keep our cost structure efficient and utilize the majority of our requested customer rate increases to fund capital investment, which includes infrastructure, system resiliency and customer service. This is also a validation of our continuing efforts to meet our O&M efficiency ratio goals, as shown on Slide 17. You will note that despite the revenue challenges we faced in 2013 second quarter, we have maintained a 40.4% ratio for the last 12 months ended June 30.","And finally, as part of our commitment to shareholder value, last week, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend payment of $0.28 per common share payable on September 3, 2013 to shareholders of record as of August 19, 2013. This continues our commitment to an annual dividend payout goal of 50% to 60% of net income.","With that, I'll turn the call back over to Jeff.","Jeffry E. Sterba","Thanks, Susan. If you go to Slide 19, this is a slide on expectations for the year that we use every quarter. Nothing is changed. We've already really spoken about our progress on all of these efforts, which will anchor our long-term earnings per share goal of 7% to 10%, which we continue to be committed to and believe is achievable. Let me call your attention to 1 item, and that's the issuance of our new corporate responsibility report, which covers the years 2011 and 2012 in terms of data. And you can find this on our website. Our commitment as a company from the board level down, the corporate responsibility and sustainability, is truly one of our company's guiding beacons and we're proud to be the only water company the U.S. that's included in the Dow Jones Sustainable Index.","Lastly, let me also just remind you, as I know a number of you probably have it already marked up in your calendars, but we will be hosting our 2013 Analyst Day at the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday, December 17. And we'll provide you more information about this in the coming months.","With that, we'd be happy to take any questions you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Mr. Kevin Cole from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Kevin Cole - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I see in June, the EPA released another study indicating that the U.S. will require about $400 billion in clean water infrastructure, I think, over the next 15 years or so. But I guess if I look back, those dollars are rarely spent. Do you see any changes in federal or state policy, either on the policy front or the enforcement front to actually require action going forward? In either clean wastewater side?","Jeffry E. Sterba","Yes, Kevin, I think, frankly, it's enforcement actions being taken largely through consent decrees on the wastewater sides that are really starting to create some challenges and tension for a lot of municipalities. On the water side, the drinking water side, probably a little less so. There isn't a driving issue like arsenic was a few years ago that's mandating investment, although probably the next one that has attracted some attention is the chrome 6 issue, which is one that we've really got our hands around already. So again, it's this notion of -- as that infrastructure is out of sight, out of mind, the level of investment is trailing. I mean, that's why you see the average investment cycle of 250 years really going up to 350 years, whereas we as a company, are about 125. It's an issue that's attracting attention, but I don't think there's a solution. Well, there's not necessarily a solution that a lot of municipalities are yet facing up to. And that solution is really, you got to bring private capital in because the federal money is just not going to be there.","Kevin Cole - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I guess I saw I think a couple of weeks ago, like San Antonio, I guess EPA forced San Antonio to, I think, spend around $1.2 billion given they were -- they didn't scale up their system to population growth, so they're distributing wastewater, I guess, just raw waste into water. So are you using that as the most actionable vehicle of growth given the EPA is actually fining those systems?","Jeffry E. Sterba","Yes. The wastewater side is the one that is more susceptible to enforcement. And you've got, gosh, I can't -- I saw recently the number of cities that are under enforcement action. I don't remember the number, but whether it's Kansas City, which is a large metropolitan area or a smaller city like Chattanooga, Tennessee, they've got multi $100 million dollar enforcement actions. The challenge will be how strongly does the EPA enforce the timing of it. Do they give them slack so that instead of it needing to be done in the next 5 years, oh, well, we'll give you 7 or 10. That's where we've seen slippage in the past. I would say one of the things that Sandy brought to light was the risk. When you have increased volatility of weather and the risk of flooding and the like, whether it be from storm surge or rain or what have you, is the amount of untreated or only partially treated wastewater that got dumped, that gets -- and that is, I think, the risk that is starting to attract a lot more attention. Just with Sandy it was over 11 billion gallons of raw sewage that was dumped. And so that's a broader base challenge, but it puts a focus on the issue of adequate wastewater treatment and doing the right things relative to storm water. So I'm hopeful that the EPA will keep the pressure up to ensure that we, as a country, are doing the right things. I think it's important that environmental groups and others help support that.","Kevin Cole - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Actually just -- I have an obnoxious question for Slide 23. Just because I know someone's going to ask you this question later. So is your 7% to 10% -- is it right to think about your 7% to 10% EPS growth rate being anchored to 2012? Or if I'm looking at 2014, should I re-anchor it to the midpoint of 2013?","Jeffry E. Sterba","Yes, we've always talked about it as a long-term growth rate and so that's the anchoring in 2012. I know every year, we get pushed about, well so is it off a new base. And we're trying to say, look, 7% to 10% is a long-term growth rate, and yes, we're anchoring it off 2012. Even though our range is above that, and, of course, we'll provide you a range for 2014 as we get a -- probably in the December session.","Kevin Cole - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then is this chart to scale? Because if I look at -- if I apply 10% growth rate to $1.99, I get $2.19, and that's kind of to closer to midpoint of this year's guidance, not at the bottom. And so am I not just understanding the chart or is it just not the scale?","Edward D. Vallejo","Kevin, it's Ed. Yes, it should be up to scale. So let me know when you have that service that sees if it is to scale, if it doesn't work out enough, but in our side, it is.","Jeffry E. Sterba","I always get nervous because we've got those engineers and financial players and whether it's something they put it on logarithmic paper or what, I always get a little very nervous, but just kidding.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mr. Ryan Connors from Janney Montgomery Scott.","Ryan M. Connors - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","So I wanted to get some thoughts on the regulatory side and I guess, we're coming off the recent May [indiscernible] summer meeting, I'm sure you had folks there and you got some briefings, Jeff. Anything jumping out of you in terms of the evolution of the regulatory environment in water, either positive or negative, and either specific to any mechanism, a specific state or just the terms of the overall tone?","Jeffry E. Sterba","I guess, the ones -- a couple that I just touched on. I mean, we are getting increased understanding and recognition about the issue of declining use. And I think this is one where the industry was slow on the uptake, but is rapidly trying to move this forward. So frankly, there hadn't been much of anything done up until really probably the last 3 years or so. So, except in California, where there's an overall policy mandate. So I think that's on the positive side. I think on the risk side is, okay, so what does -- where do returns go and how successful are we in helping people understand that when you have artificially held down risk-free rates, it -- that doesn't necessarily change the cost of equity. And I think we've seen what's probably best described as mixed results. There are some states that have gone fairly low. I think the majority of our states have approached that with a more reason than tempered response in thinking about what that cost of -- what's an appropriate cost of equity. I think the 2 things that we keep a real ear on are the issue of degree of rate change, so that we don't push that frontier too hard, yet at the same time, we have great reception to the investment of capital. And so as we've talked to regulators about the chart that Susan has talked to you all about, about how we shifted, how much of our rate increases are capital versus O&M base, that's something that they receive positively. But I think those are the issue of declining use. And now, frankly, you're starting to hear a lot of electrics say, oh we no longer have growth. And so they're starting to scramble on that issue.","Ryan M. Connors - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","And how do you see that evolving, Jeff? I mean, will it be -- is the talk of a California style RAM-based decoupling or are there other approaches that you see prevailing?","Jeffry E. Sterba","I think each state has to approach this on the basis of its own regulatory background and on a philosophy. There are some that they look at the California RAM mechanism and they wonder if it's too complex for them, is there a different way to do it, is there a way we can kind of build it into base rates, what is it that we're trying to protect against, is it all changes in consumption or is it just the intrinsic ongoing reduction in use per customer, so what is it that we normalize? So I think we'll see, and we are seeing, states take a number of different approaches. I think the one that most states move to most readily is, okay, let's take into account what you've seen over the last set of years, 5 years, 8 years, whatever it might be, and build that into your future and let's try to step and then we negotiate how far forward do we step to get the building determinants, if you will, the denominator, right. I think automatic adjustment mechanisms create some nervousness of regulators unless they come out of that mechanism. For example, Florida has a number of mechanisms. California has a number of mechanisms. And New York has a number of mechanisms that has just been part of their regulatory psyche. Other states appealing purchase prior adjustment clause. And on the water side, maybe an electric energy supply cost or something like that. That may be about all they're comfortable with. So I don't know how many states will adopt automatic mechanism as opposed to recognizing the pressing nature of the issue, but do it in a different way. Susan, do you have anything to add?","Susan N. Story","Yes, and I think consistent with what Jeff said, we take very seriously our responsibility on water efficiency and so we are proactively working with all of our states in terms of how we can promote water efficiency and address declining usage through, as Jeff has said, either decoupling type mechanism, looking at revenue adjustments for future test years, looking at performance incentive for some of the water efficiency program. So we're really looking at lots of different options to address this -- the same issue. And also on the key elements coming from [indiscernible] in looking at some of the commentary, as well as hearing from some of the people there, the commitment of state regulators to the replacement of aging infrastructure may be as strong as it's ever been. The recognition that this is something we have to address and that if we begin to address it today, that it would be far better than waiting until we have more severe problems in terms of main breaks, leaks and the economic impacts of that. So I think that we think increasing and growing commitment to that, and as Jeff said, what that means to us is, how do we find a way to promote that investment while also controlling price increases for the customers. And that is through our control of O&M so that any or most the majority of price increases will be for investment and -- CapEx investment and not O&M expenses.","Jeffry E. Sterba","One of the things that I think all that says is, of course, we may -- he have bias, but if I was going to focus on communities that have the greatest potential for growth and expansion, because they're going to be able to provide service to customers and it's -- and they're not going to have main breaks, et cetera, I'd look to those communities that are -- provided service by privately held companies that are regulated, because Susan's exactly right. We're seeing recognition of that on the regulatory side. Unfortunately, not at all communities, but in a number of communities. Your politician elected today, that's an out-of-sight, out-of-mind investment, it's a little harder to make, were a little easier to set a side and not necessarily keep up with that infrastructure. I think there are some cities, which -- and I commend -- I'll commend Chicago for what they're trying to do and Philadelphia for what they're trying to do in terms of their green cities initiative. And I don't mean solely them. I think New York is also there and there are others that are there. But boy, there is a whole host of that 50,000 communities or individual utilities that, that's not necessarily getting done.","Operator","Your next question comes Heike Doerr from Robert W. Baird.","Heike M. Doerr - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Can you share with us what are re-stipulated in the settlement that's pending in West Virginia?","Jeffry E. Sterba","Well, yes, sort of. What happens is that the party submits a -- as part of their testimony, a basis for the cost of service that's been agreed to. It is a black box settlement, so there isn't a formal ROE. What we have submitted and what -- and I'm trying to remember which party it is that joined us with that, just Consumer Advocate, submitted -- resubmitted our cost of service than the Consumer Advocate did that the ROE is at 9.9, 9.9%. Whereas the staff has submitted a cost of service that uses 9.75%. They get to the same revenue requirement, so it gets to the same rate levels, they just go about it in a different way. So I think it's -- we believe it's 9.9%, but it's in that range.","Heike M. Doerr - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. Can you give us an update on where you are on portfolio optimization? Are there still states you're weighing whether or not it makes sense to be in, and where on the contract operations side are we on that process?","Jeffry E. Sterba","Well, on a regulated side, as we said before, the lion share of any optimization has been done. We will remain open to looking at whether it's inter-state or intra-state opportunities. I can't tell you that there's the state -- we're not in the process of saying there's a state we want to exit. We're comfortable with what we've got, but we will always look at opportunities to optimize that. On the Contract Operations side, by and large, most of it has been accomplished, moving us into a set of contract that we can operate in a much more profitable way, starting to shift the way that we're thinking. We're looking at how that business expands and being very specific and focused about what we won't go back into. We had to work -- our people did a heck of a job in extracting ourselves out of some contracts and arrangements that just were not profitable and the last thing we'll do is go back into those.","Heike M. Doerr - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. How should we think about your CapEx budget and this Monterey Peninsula water supply project? Will that project -- I know it's spread over a longer time period. Will it just push you up within that band or may there be some years that you'll need to spend above that $1 billion that we've been talking about at the top end?","Susan N. Story","Heike, this is Susan. The expenditures for those projects are included in our forecast for -- we, this year, have said we will spend about $950 million in CapEx. We are looking -- and there is range you saw based on some things. It hadn't been decided yet the size of the plant, how we're going to approach, I believe it's 6.4 million gallons per day versus 9.6 million, and the 6.4 million would have bigger groundwater replenishment. So we're really working through right now what that will be, based on some of the final decisions on that project, but we anticipate those will be rolled in to our CapEx guidance for each year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jonathan Reeder from Wells Fargo.","Jonathan Reeder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Following up on Heike's question there a little bit. So on a going-forward basis, I mean, is $950 million, is that going to be the bottom end of the range or can we get above the $1 billion, especially when, I guess, you're looking at the rate cases that are driven more on the CapEx side and the O&M side, do you have room to get more aggressive with the CapEx budget?","Edward D. Vallejo","Jonathan, I guess, the answer I want to give you is, we're certainly looking at the level of CapEx given what we think our future expenditures level will be, that we can put in and maintain the kind of rate levels that we think we can sell with our commissioners and customers. We'll talk more about that in December in terms of what that really looks like. But is there a potential for an $800 million, the $800 million to $1 billion that we've used for the couple of years that shift over the next 5 years? The answer to that is yes. When it might shift to, and how much it shifts, if it shifts at all, we'll talk more about it in December. Right now, we've got a plan that, as Susan said, has got California included in it. Remember, one of the things that's happening is we've been spending about $100 million a year on BT. That disappears this year. So there's $100 million there that was going to that project which now is going to be available to go into hard infrastructure on the regulated side. And so that's still at the current -- at the same current level. But we are -- we're still not spending for 100-year replacement cycle, for example, and that's our goal, it's to get to 100-year replacement cycle. Because that's really kind of the outer limits of what we think the life of most of these systems are.","Susan N. Story","And there's a lot of things we look at, Jonathan, part of it, and not just a flat amount, but what does that mean in terms of our equity needs. We've gone on the record that we do not anticipate issuing equity under normal business operations for the foreseeable future. So we run a lot of scenario now. We also are looking, for example, to Jeff's point, of next year not having the BT expenditures. What does it mean in terms of our distribution system infrastructure charge, which reduces regulatory lag? This year, about 39% of our CapEx will be DSIC, just as a matter of the B2 rolling off which isn't eligible, that percent could go up next year. So when we run the analysis of the overall target, we look at a lot of factors including both the reg side and the market bases.","Jonathan Reeder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then I guess, as we're kind of looking out, the cash flows continue to improve if CapEx doesn't meaningfully increase. What's kind of the balance you're looking at between, I guess, equity -- appropriate equity ratio at the consolidated level, dividend increases, redeploying the cash, everything like that?","Jeffry E. Sterba","Well, you kind of gave what the basket of opportunities are. I mean, we are clearly not going to weaken our cap structure, but as we've talked about before, we don't necessarily see an overriding need to strengthen it necessarily either. So the 44% equity that we're at today, will by nature, go up a bit. But it's just we've got room to issue debt to the extent that our total CapEx or other expenditures, for example, with the kinds of acquisitions like the one we're doing in Virginia, that's a little larger, more of those. So we've got headroom to do that. If you're poking around, so is there a stock buyback on the horizon, those are things we do not have a stock buyback plan at this stage. Those are things that is an ongoing part of the business. We're focused on the right amount of capital first to invest in the business. And that's a function of both what we can afford through the rate-making process and the amount of free cash flow that we have in our headroom on the debt side. So I kind of leave it there. We'll give you more color about a forward look on the 5 years as we hit December.","Susan N. Story","And that's on the 17th Analyst Day.","Jonathan Reeder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, Jeff, you're right. And then I guess last question, maybe more for Susan. As we look at, I guess, the operating expenses and everything, why weren't production costs may be down a little more than they were given more the large decrease in customer demand?","Susan N. Story","Most of our biggest expenses in production is in energy and chemicals. And we did see a decrease in both of those. Chemicals, we did have, in some areas, a little bit of an increase due to just some of the operations, but they were consistent. Production cost decreases were relatively consistent with the sales decrease. And remember, on the revenue, the $15.8 million makeup in the revenue, we only showed $8.6 million on the slide because that netted out the $7.2 million from 2012 from the California retro. So in terms of -- anything else on the production?","Jonathan Reeder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So, I mean, you're saying the production costs are down in line with the decreased customer demand, as you would have expected?","Susan N. Story","They were down in line mostly energy chemicals. Chemicals may not have gone down as much on a straight-line correlation because we did have some chemical increased cost in a few areas, but energy was, and chemicals were down. And those are the 2 predominant components of those expenses.","Operator","Our next question comes from Spencer Joyce with Hilliard Lyons.","David A. Paz - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Two, hopefully, pretty concise questions for you. One, on the New Jersey DSIC that we had going into effect in July, how often should be looking for reops on that? Is it going to be a little bump every 3 months, kind of like PA or maybe semiannually like the eastwest and Missouri, just how often can we look for a bump there?","Susan N. Story","That's a great question. I'm glad you asked. The regulations say that we can file up to twice a year in New Jersey for the DSIC. Some of you may have noticed there were some earlier material that we filed for $6.3 million. And I just noted that we have annualized increase to $4 million. Because of the way that the regulation is worded, it appeared that we could go in. And so we had anticipated during 7 months on our first filing, 5 months in our second, the staff really and rate counts, so really preferred that we do 6 and 6. So that accounts for the difference in the $6.3 million and the $4 million. But rather than being effective August 1, it was effective July 1. So short answer, it's twice a year, up to twice in 12 months. And we have further guidance that the preference is every 6 months.","Spencer E. Joyce - Hilliard Lyons, Research Division","Okay, fantastic. Second other question, totally switching gears. What's kind of the rollout time on those? How soon can we -- or should we be expecting some material revenue impact from those?","Edward D. Vallejo","Well, Nashville, we've got to go through the formal contract, and so that can take 30, 60 days, something like that. So it takes a little while. And then we have to put together the plan with the city because in that instance, this is an exclusive arrangement and it will go on their bill. So that -- it won't be until close to the end of the year before it could get rolled out. On Houston, frankly, I think that's already out there. We are starting to take customers into it. We've had advertisements and releases that have gone out and it's hit the newspapers in Houston. It is nonexclusive and so it's a little easier. They're basically just endorsing a couple of programs, so that one is moving forward. The Nashville one, because it is exclusive, has more potential, probably it won't really be out and customers are signing up until the end of the year.","Spencer E. Joyce - Hilliard Lyons, Research Division","Okay. Another question just kind of popped up. On the exclusive or nonexclusive, looking over some of the historical places you've serviced, what's the penetration rate difference between places you serve exclusively and non-exclusively?","Jeffry E. Sterba","In those areas where we are on the bill, so we're on the water or wastewater bill, we see penetration rates that are up into the 30s. And we have disclosed that before. So in the low-30s kind of range. When you're not on a bill, it noticeably drops off, but we don't get specific penetration.","Operator","Your next question comes from Angie Storozynski from Macquarie.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research","I wanted to talk about 2 things about your enhanced growth. So first of all, the military contracts. I know that you are awaiting a number of them to be announced. Do you see an impacts from the federal sequestration on the timing of those tenders being announced?","Jeffry E. Sterba","Well, it's always hard to tell on the timing. The schedule -- the optimistic schedule is 18 months from the time first bids are made to the time that awards are made. And that hasn't necessarily ever happen. So honestly, we are still seeing strong activity. In fact, it's picked up. The challenge is, now, there's a 20% sequestration in the number of areas that we work with, so -- because they didn't do it unto the second half. So they're having -- they're a little higher on the furlough side. And so we are seeing a little bit of a slowdown, but it doesn't seem like it's significant. Things are still moving forward and we're seeing a pickup of activity particularly in the airports. So in one sense, I wish I could tell you, we're still seeing strong response, but we keep the eye out about -- are they really going to be able to keep the schedule?","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research","Okay. And secondly, you've mentioned potentially larger acquisitions as the way to the enhanced growth of earnings going forward. Could you put a bit of a context, you mean, we have some sour memories from the large acquisitions and how dilutive they used to be, equity needs, regulatory lag, how can you avoid these, and also, how can you convince the big sellers to give you their assets at book value without any goodwill issues and things like that?","Jeffry E. Sterba","It is a very good question and it has a couple of pieces to it. The example I would give is the Dale services. In the sense of how big our company is, it doesn't seem large, but 20,000 customers is a large acquisition in this world. Those kind -- these acquisitions, we're very disciplined about the ability to get what we pay in rates. If we don't think we can get it into rates, we are not paying it. Now that does not mean there won't be a premium because there are some states that allow a premium under certain circumstances. So if we're able, by virtue of that acquisition, to avoid a capital investment or 2 lower overall cost, then acquisitions can be allowed. Now we're still sitting on acquisition premiums made with citizens, for example. You're not going to see something like that and neither Susan or I or anybody else in this company has any appetite for paying major premiums that you're just, you're basically going to be accepting a lower return on. That's just not our philosophy about this. But things you are seeing certain communities that get into, they get challenged and we have a very disciplined approach about what is it that, that state will specifically allow. If they want more than that, well that's interesting, we're not going to pay more than that.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research","Is it easier for you to buy large wastewater systems as opposed to fresh water?","Jeffry E. Sterba","Easier, none of the stuff is easy because it's got politics wrapped around it and all sorts of other stuff. To me and I think to us, wastewater is much more of an area that's got greater growth potential because wherever we serve water, someone's providing wastewater. And so we're already known in those communities. And that, most of the time, is not us. So we think that provides a market particularly given that wastewater is not necessarily held as dear on the municipal side as drinking water is, even though it's all one water. So we think that wastewater has significant potential for us.","Operator","Your final question comes from Mr. Brian Chin from Merrill Lynch.","Brian Chin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I just have a quick one. On the Monterey Peninsula water supply project, obviously, this has been sort of a long-running project. Could you give us a sense on the settlement, to what extent you have cost overrun protections and\/or are there monitoring requirements as the project is underway that help give regulators and yourself a sense of how expensive the project costs is projected to be?","Jeffry E. Sterba","Yes. At this stage, we only have estimates and that's what's reflected in the agreements. And part of that is because there are some -- a couple of outstanding issues in terms of the recharge project. So there isn't the ability to have certainty on what those costs are yet. So once -- as we get those resolved, those kinds of significant issues resolved, then I would expect that we'll have much firmer, that's why we're giving you a range at this stage, so there isn't a number that someone can say, oh, well you can't exceed this because specifics of the projects are not yet fully resolved.","Operator","Thank you, sir. That was your final question.","Jeffry E. Sterba","Well, let me just thank you, all, very much for your questions and for your interest. And we look forward to talking to you next quarter and don't hesitate to call us if you got any questions in the interim. Thanks much.","Operator","Thank you.

Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us. As always, after my opening remarks, you will hear from our COO, Walter Lynch on regulated business highlights. And then our CFO, Linda Sullivan on third quarter financial results. However, Linda will join me in a few minutes as we talk a bit more about our Keystone operations before turning it over to Walter.","We\u2019re pleased to report another strong quarter of performance. Our third quarter adjusted earnings per share were up 11.1% compared to 2017 and our nine months year-to-date grew 11.5% year-over-year. The foundation for our growth continues to be the capital investment we make in regulated operations. We invested a total of $1.5 billion during the first nine months of the year with $1.1 billion for regulated infrastructure and $383 million for acquisitions, which includes our acquisition of Pivotal.","We had several positive events this quarter, which Walter will discuss more fully in just a few minutes. To mention just a few, we received a BPU approved settlement in our New Jersey rate case and reached a stipulated agreement with a consumer advocate and PSC staff in West Virginia. We received a unanimous five to zero vote by the California Public Utilities Commission for our Monterey Peninsula Water Supply Project, which includes both water reuse capabilities and a desalination facility.","We\u2019re also pleased to get clarifying legislation to exempt water and wastewater utilities from the 2018 New Jersey tax law changes. We continue to have strong regulated customer growth. To date, we have welcomed about 16,500 new customer connections through closed acquisitions and organic growth. We have an additional 56,000 customer connections under agreement for acquisition. Walter will give you more detail shortly.","Our adjusted earnings increase of over 11% was also driven by growth in our market-based businesses. We\u2019re pleased to share that our homeowners services financial results to date are above projections with both excellent operating performance and Pivotal integration expenses favorable compared to our plan. We look forward to fully integrating the business and realizing synergies in the future.","Our legacy Homeowner Services Group has had several wins this year. Most recently we announced formal partnerships with the city of Philadelphia and Fort Wayne, Indiana. We also have received notices from San Francisco and Toledo, Ohio of their preliminary intent to award partnerships to us following final negotiations.","Additionally, we were pleased to announce last month that our Military Services Group won a 50 year, $591 million contract to serve Fort Leonard Wood army base in Missouri. We are very proud to grow to 14 basis, where we serve quality water, fire protection and sanitation services to the incredible men and women and their families who serve our nation and defend our liberties. And as we have already shared, we sell the majority of our Contract Services Group to Veolia in July. We are recognizing a positive $0.06 of benefit from that sale this quarter as a non-GAAP item.","Now, let\u2019s move to Keystone. As you saw in our press release late yesterday, we have taken an after tax impairment charge of $40 million for Keystone this quarter. This is a result of our efforts to streamline the business and focus on the operations that we believe will deliver the most predictable and stable margins going forward.","The original structure of Keystone consisted of three businesses, water trucking, construction services, which focused mainly on permanent waterline pipeline construction for oil and gas companies and water transfer, which involves the mobilization and operation of temporary piping and pumping systems to transfer water to storage locations and well pads.","As you know, we were able to manage the business to be neutral to earnings during the overall market downturn in 2016 and we closed last year slightly positive in net income. This year consistent with what we have noted in the past few earnings calls, the water services market in the Appalachian Basin has been growing and in fact our revenues through the second quarter showed a steady increase, three quarters in a row. However, this increase in revenues did not flow to the bottom line due to the operational challenges in the construction business.","We discontinued the very small water trucking business earlier this year and are now exiting the construction business as we have determined in the past month that it is simply too small and volatile for the management time that it was consuming. Going forward Keystone will be a water transfer services business, which has demonstrated continuing operational success and better margin predictability. These low capital mobile piping and pumping systems enable water recycling and reuse in order to reduce both fresh water consumption and reduce the waste disposal needs for our customers.","We are continually evaluating the performance and contributions of our market-based businesses to determine which ones both leverage our core competencies and deliver appropriate risk adjusted returns. At this point in time, we believe that narrowing the focus to water transfer is the best way to determine whether Keystone should continue to be part of our portfolio for the future.","Linda will now discuss the financials around Keystone a bit further.","Linda Sullivan","Thanks, Susan. Regarding the Keystone impairment, we recorded a $40 million after tax impairment charge this quarter or $0.22 per share. And there were two primary drivers to the impairment. First, as Susan mentioned, although we saw higher revenue trends this year in both water transfer and construction, the operational challenges in our construction business led to several financial adjustments this quarter that overshadowed the solid margins in water transfer.","Let me talk about the financial adjustments. In the third quarter, we had a total of $2.6 million after tax associated with the operational issues in the construction business. This included charges to discontinue work on two large projects, one of which we\u2019ll need a longer transition time, and a write-off of a supply chain contract. As a result our third quarter results at Keystone are negative just over $0.01 per share.","Importantly, we have also made key leadership changes at Keystone, including hiring a new CFO and Key Operational Personnel. They have been reviewing the business in detail and help to identify and quantify these adjustments over the past few months. With these adjustments, we now expect the Keystone\u2019s annual 2018 results to be negative just over $0.01 per share. Second, as Susan mentioned, we have narrowed the business to focus solely on water transfer where we have seen revenue growth and consistently delivered margin.","So in summary, due to the operational challenges in the construction business that lowered our 2018 projected results along with the strategic narrowing of the business scope this triggered a review of our long-term valuation of the business, resulting in the third quarter impairment charge. In terms of overall impact on our long-term plan, as you know, Keystone is very small for us. The lower projections of the narrowed business scope do not materially impact our long-term compound annual growth rate. And in fact, we remain confident in delivering a long-term CAGR in the top half of our 7% to 10% EPS growth range. Susan?","Susan Story","Thanks, Linda. Moving to our long-term plan. We believe that sustainable financial success depends on effectively executing the fundamentals of our business every day and finding ways to be even better. These fundamentals include being the very best at our proven core competencies of water and waste water treatment and delivery, delivering the best service and experience to our customers, building constructive and transparent regulatory relationships, growing our business and becoming even more efficient in our operations to ensure affordability and value for our customers.","American Water will invest $8.4 billion to $9 billion over the next five years with more than $7.2 billion spent to improve our existing infrastructure. We see line of sight to our 32% target O&M efficiency ratio by 2022. Our regulated water and wastewater operations will continue to be our core and anchor business. Our market-based businesses will continue to provide strategic value and cash for the business. And our customers must remain at the center of every decision we make in everything we do because we know that long-term financial success is an outcome of doing everything else right.","With this strong performance and our continued execution of strategies, we are narrowing our 2018 adjusted earnings guidance to the upper portion of the range at $3.27 to $3.32. And as Linda said, we affirm our long-term EPS growth CAGR to be in the top half of our 7% to 10% range.","Walter will now give his update on our regulated businesses.","Walter Lynch","Thanks, Susan and good morning, everyone. Our regulated businesses had a strong third quarter or making capital investments to ensure clean, safe, and reliable water services, continuing to improve our operating efficiencies to benefit our customers and growing our business through acquisitions.","Let me start on Slide 9 with our New Jersey rate case. Our rate case settlement was approved by the Board of Public Utilities earlier this week. This case was driven by more than $868 million in infrastructure investment since the company\u2019s last rate increase in 2015. The settlement provides $40 million in increased annualized revenue with the acquisition adjustment portion being deferred to a separate proceeding. I\u2019d also like to point out that the previous return on equity level of 9.75% has changed to 9.6%.","More importantly, it is more than offset by the positive shift in equity from 52% to 54%. In addition, the Board of Public Utilities approved the roll in of an additional $35 million in distribution system improvement charge. Due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and this approved order most customers can expect to see a one-time credit in their bills beginning in November.","In our West Virginia rate case, we reached a joint stipulation settlement with the Public Service Commission staff and Consumer Advocate Division. Subject to final approval, the settlement includes a $23 million increase in revenues and 9.75% return on equity and adjust for two years of declining consumption. The settlement will also add several times of capital investments to the company\u2019s infrastructure surcharge program, which allows for a more timely recovery of capital investments outside of rate cases.","It also allows for the company\u2019s excess deferred tax amortization to be used to offset future programs surcharge to the benefit of our customers. Their current infrastructure surcharge will remain until new rates into effect in February 2019. I should note this case was driven by $200 million in investment, while operating expenses were kept flat. Details of the stipulated settlement are available in the West Virginia Public Service Commission\u2019s website.","Moving to California. We expect both our proposed and final decision on our general rate case for 2018 to 2020 during the fourth quarter. The ROE level was determined in a separate proceeding during the second quarter. If approved, we expect that this case will support approximately $230 million of capital investments in our system. In June, Maryland American Water filed a petition with the Public Service Commission seeking recovery of approximately $18 million in capital investments since our last rate adjustment in 2015.","The main component of this case is a new reservoir and intake that will help secure the water supply for our customers in Bel Air and parts of Hartford County and foster the economic development and viability of the area. We\u2019re expecting a ruling on a settlement before year-end following the Public Service Commission\u2019s public comment period, which concludes today.","In September, we filed our general rate case in Indiana seeking authorization to increase annual water service revenues by $38.9 million stepped over two years. This case is driven by more than $542 million of water infrastructure investment since our last rate case filing in 2014. A final ruling from the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission is expected by mid-year 2019.","On Slide 10, you can see that we\u2019ve had significant regulatory activity this year with $155 million in annualized revenues. We\u2019re awaiting final orders in three states as well as one settlement waiting regulatory approval for a total annualized revenue request of $67 million. Again, all these cases are driven by a significant capital investment to ensure reliable service.","Turning to Slide 11. Our smart investments must be balanced by efficient operations and capital deployment. In the first nine months, we invested $1.1 billion in our regulated operations. This investment remains critical to ensure reliable service, but for us, it\u2019s also about affordable service. We continue to make progress towards our long-term O&M efficiency goal of 32% by 2022.","To put this effort into perspective, our adjusted O&M expenses are only slightly higher today than they were in 2012. Since that time, we\u2019ve invested more than $7.2 billion in our infrastructure and added more than 150,000 customers, while our adjusted O&M expense compound annual growth rate is just 0.4%. This clearly demonstrates our singular commitment to controlling costs on behalf of our customers and keeping their bills affordable.","Moving to Slide 12, last month in a rare bipartisan win Democrats and Republicans in the House and the Senate came together to overwhelmingly pass a bill that supports critical upgrades to America\u2019s Water Infrastructure. The result of this law includes policies intended to improve water and wastewater system management and authorization for states to require that non-compliance systems explore consolidation options. It also provides equal access to low interest financing for private water providers and important benefit for our customers, as they also pay taxes.","In Pennsylvania, Act 58 were signed into law and provides the public utility commission the authority to approve alternate rates and rate mechanisms. The commission issued a tentative implementation order, and it\u2019s currently seeking comments and its interpretation and proposed implementation of the act. Also in Pennsylvania, Act 120 were signed into law that allows DSIC recovery for the replacement of customer side lead service lines subject to a commission approved program. As we\u2019ve communicated in the past, full service line replacement is one of the most effective ways to reduce exposure to lead.","In California, the Public Utilities Commission unanimously approved the certificate of public convenience and necessity for our water supply project in Monterey. This action, as we discussed last quarter, gives us the authority to move forward with this critical water supply project. I want to thank our California team, local leaders, and our customers for everything they\u2019ve done to make this project to reality. This project will provide a much needed water supply for the Monterey Peninsula, which will benefit our customers and communities for decades to come.","Also, in California, the governor signed three bills that benefit water and wastewater customers and their communities. One allows cities to sell wastewater systems with a majority vote. The second allow certain cities to sell their water systems without an election. And the third provides a path for the Sativa Water District to be sold to an investor-owned water company or others, through an RFP process.","New York American Water reached the $5 million settlement with the New York Department of Public Service and the New York Public Service Commission, as part of the self reported issue concerning a property tax error related to a 2012 acquisition and higher bills resulting from new tier conservation rates. With support from the governor\u2019s office, this resolution memorializes the settlement between the company and both parties, which provides rate relief and other benefits to our customers.","Finally, in New Jersey, key progress will be made this month is water utility serving more than 500 customers must submit their cybersecurity documentation as required by the Water Quality Accountability Act. I\u2019m pleased to report that New Jersey American Water is well ahead of the game by already fulfilling cybersecurity requirements issued by the board of Public Utilities and by voluntarily adopting the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework. The framework which we adopted in 2014 is consistent with the standards adopted by U.S. electric utilities and\/or greater than what the Water Quality Accountability Act requires.","Turning to Slide 13, we continue to have excellent growth this quarter. And as a reminder, when I say customers, I mean customer connections. We welcomed 7,600 new customers to date and we\u2019ll welcome another 56,000 customers through signed agreements. In addition to the 8,900 customers, we added through organic growth. Our acquisition activity spans across our entire footprint with 20 acquisitions occurring in eight different states.","And let me give you some highlights. In August, Missouri American Water completed its acquisition of the loss in water and wastewater system, adding approximately 1,000 new water and 900 new wastewater customers to which 480,000 statewide customers. In Pennsylvania, the Public Utility Commission approved the stipulated settlement that will add about 1,000 wastewater customers within the township of Salisbury, which is already in our water footprints. And in New Jersey, we have an agreement to acquire the Roxbury Water Company, which will add nearly 4,000 new water customers in Morris County.","These agreements represent our continued focus on providing regional solutions to communities with water and wastewater challenges. So again, a great quarter delivered by a regulated state teams all to benefit our customers.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Linda.","Linda Sullivan","Thank you, Walter, and Good morning everyone. Let me start with our third quarter 2018 results on Slide 15.","GAAP earnings were $1.04 per share, a decrease of $0.09 compared to the same period last year. We had non-GAAP adjustments in both periods. So let me start with it. In the third quarter 2018, we adjusted GAAP earnings for the $0.06 gain from the sale of the majority of the contracts in our Contract Services Group and the $0.22 charge from the Keystone impairment, both discussed at the beginning of this call.","Also in the third quarter of last year, we adjusted GAAP earnings for the benefit from the Freedom Industries insurance settlement and early debt extinguishment costs at the parent. Excluding these items, adjusted earnings were $1.20 per share, an increase of $0.12 or a 11.1% over the same period last year, with the regulated segment up $0.06, the market based businesses up $0.05 and the parent favorable $0.01. On a year-to-date GAAP basis, earnings were $2.53 per share, up 5.9%, and our adjusted earnings were $2.61 per share, up 11.5% of our adjusted earnings in the same period last year.","Let me walk through our adjusted quarterly results by each business. Turning to slide 16, adjusted earnings were strong in the third quarter of 2018. I\u2019ll start with the regulated operations that were up $0.06 in total. Net revenue was up $0.06, including a $0.23 increase from additional authorized revenue to support infrastructure investments, acquisitions and organic growth. This revenue was partially offset by the $0.17 impact of the lower federal tax rate expected to benefit our regulated customers.","Next, we had higher production expensive of $0.02 from higher chemical costs as well as purchased water price and usage increases in California. Next, O&M expense increased $0.12 from quite a few smaller items. Let me cover a few of them. First, we had higher costs of about $0.02 to support regulated acquisitions and growth. Second, we had $0.02 related to the timing of expenses, such as contracted services and labor related costs that were deferred from earlier quarters.","Third, we had higher property and general insurance expense of $0.02 from both the credit in the third quarter of last year and a higher claims trend this year. Fourth, we had $0.04 of one-time adjustments, including $0.02 related to the New York settlement and $0.02 of accelerated recovery of regulatory assets approved in the West Virginia tax proceeding with no bottom line impact. I will discuss both of these items in more detail on the next slide.","Next, depreciation increased $0.03 due to growth from regulated acquisitions and investments. Interest in general taxes increased $0.02 mainly to support growth. Also, our income tax expense was favorable $0.19 from the lower federal tax rate. Before turning to the Market-Based Businesses, I should note that weather variability did not affect our third quarter earnings. We did experience hot dry weather in Missouri, resulting in higher revenue of about $3 million, but this was offset by wet weather in New Jersey and Pennsylvania reducing revenue by a like amount, which demonstrates the benefit of our geographic diversity.","Turning to the market based businesses. The $0.05 increase was almost entirely due to Homeowner Services, mainly from the Pivotal acquisition. Our operating results at Pivotal through the third quarter are right in line with our expectations. However, integration expenses were lower than expected in the quarter, mainly due to timing and capitalization.","Also, as I mentioned earlier, Keystone was negative $0.01 for the quarter, and this impact was offset by the favorable impact from tax reform on our Market-Based Businesses. The parent company was favorable $0.01 as lower interest expense from our debt refinancing more than offset the lower tax shield on interest expense from tax reform.","Turning to Slide 17. As you know, we take a conservative and consistent approach when making non-GAAP adjustments to our earnings. We generally only adjust for large and unusual item. The smaller settlements, tax adjustments, et cetera are included in our adjusted earnings and we highlight them for transparency. This year, we\u2019ve had quite a few puts and takes in our adjusted earnings.","So on the slide, I would like to highlight a few items impacting the third quarter, provide an update on several items highlighted last quarter that had been resolved and discuss several items pending in the fourth quarter. First, in our regulated business, as Walter mentioned, we had a settlement in New York for $5 million. As shown on the slide, half of that settlement was recorded as a reduction to revenue to provide rate relief to customers and the other half was recorded in O&M expense. Also, we had additional legal costs and customer uncollectable expense of $1.5 million combined. That was recorded in O&M.","Next, in the West Virginia tax proceeding, we were authorized to use a portion of our tax reform savings for accelerated recovery of regulatory assets. This increased our O&M expense and our revenue about $4 million, with no impact to the bottom line. Now, last quarter, I discussed several potential headwinds that were resolved this quarter. First, in July, New Jersey passed legislation increasing corporate business tax rates. On October 4, a correction bill passed with language clarifying that water and wastewater utilities were exempt. As a result, we do not expect this legislation to have a material earnings impact.","Also, during the quarter, we worked on our purchase price allocation and related amortization of intangible assets for Pivotal. I had mentioned last quarter, we thought this could be a bit more frontend loaded than originally planned. We have now substantially completed our accounting analysis and we do not expect it to be frontend loaded. As the attrition rates for Pivotal, which are the key driver for amortization are largely aligned with our experience at HOS and with our original estimates.","Lastly, let me discuss some items pending in the fourth quarter. First, we have began to move into our new headquarters building in Camden and we look forward to hosting all of you at our Analyst Day there on December 11. As a result of the move from four separate buildings to one new headquarters building, we may incur up to $5 million in lease termination cost. We have already incurred about $900,000 in the third quarter and unless we are successful in obtaining subleases, the remainder could be recorded in the fourth quarter.","In Homeowner Services, we are also continuing to the best integration strategy for our duplicate customer and back office system. And we expect that strategy may be finalized by year end. In our Regulated Business, we have an expected $12 million in timing related costs that were deferred to the fourth quarter, mainly for repair and maintenance, tank painting in New Jersey and operating and technology costs.","Turning to Slide 18, let me provide an update on tax-related matters. We continue to make good progress in our 14 regulatory jurisdictions on the best approach to return tax reform benefits back to customers. Regarding the tax rate change, we have adjusted rates in eight states to refund all our portion of the savings to customers. In two states, we expect to offset these savings with further capital investments or accelerated recovery of regulatory assets. Proceedings remained pending in five states.","Regarding the amortization of the remeasured accumulated deferred income taxes, five states have agreed to defer to next year and the remaining are pending. Also, West Virginia took a constructive approach in our pending rate case settlement that if approved would allow us to offset the future amortization of deferred taxes with infrastructure investments. And they also expanded the infrastructure mechanism, as Walter discussed.","Turning to Slide 19. Based on the strength of our year-to-date results and considering the timing of O&M expenses in the fourth quarter, we are a narrowing our 2018 adjusted earnings guidance to the top portion of our prior range to $3.27 to $3.32 per share. Our adjusted guidance range excludes the non-GAAP adjustments outlined on this page.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Susan.","Susan Story","Thanks, Linda. All of the efforts, we discussed today drive our financial performance. We continue to be a leader in total shareholder return and dividend growth.","In April of this year, our board of directors approved a 9.6% increase in our quarterly dividend to $45.05 per share. This marks the sixth year in a row that our dividend increase was at or above the top of our long term EPS CAGR of 7% to 10%. And as you know, we have also guided our next five year dividend growth CAGR to the top end of that EPS range.","Our last 12 months adjusted annualized ROE for the entire company increased to 9.9%. We are very proud of these financial accomplishments and we know that they are very important to you. But for us, it\u2019s also about making a difference with engage people, who have a shared purpose and a heart to make the world a better place. There\u2019s a lot of focus in conversation today by investors regarding ESG principles in their broadest and most holistic sense. At the core is the question of whether a company can do well by doing good.","We, at American Water, believed that the answer to that question is an unqualified and resounding yes. We never forget that at the end of every water pipe, there\u2019s a family depending on us to provide life\u2019s most critical need. That at every fire hydrant lives could depend on us. That every wastewater treatment plant serves as a shield against potential disease and that every community should be stronger because we are there. We are a purpose-driven company. We are people powered and our employees live in and give back to the communities, we are privileged to serve.","As we have been saying for the past several years, we put customers at the center of everything we plan and do. Everyday are 7,100 employees take pride in delivering the critical services of water, sanitation and fire protection to about 14 million Americans in over 1,600 communities across the country. At the end of the day, we know that what we do in our customers and communities best long term interest will also be in our investors best long term interest. And that\u2019s what we believe it means to be a truly sustainable company.","With that, we\u2019re happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes with Durgesh Chopra from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead with your question.","Durgesh Chopra","Hey, good morning team. So two questions for me. First, high level strategy question for you, Susan. So obviously, your peer water utility announced a merging with a gas utility in Pittsburgh. And I know historically, you\u2019ve said it and you sort of reiterated today that your plan is 1% to 2% growth coming from acquisition of small water and wastewater systems, I understand it. So, I mean, I guess in light of the announcement from Aqua, what I\u2019m really asking you, simply put is, if there\u2019s a water \u2013 there\u2019s a electric and gas system in your footprint, would you consider merging, with a system like that? Where would that fall in your M&A strategy?","Susan Story","Thank you, Durgesh. And just the short answer is, no. We are \u2013 at our core, we are a water and wastewater utility. Even though we have several executives, who have a deep background in electric and gas, we know that, as a company, our core competencies, what we know best, what our employees know best, what is kind of second nature to us is water and wastewater. And we believe that there are significant opportunities in the U.S., not just \u2013 we\u2019re not interested overseas either. We believe that the United States, the market for water and wastewater is where we should focus and we believe that we will have plenty of opportunities there.","Durgesh Chopra","Excellent, thank you. And then just going back to the quarter real quick, Linda, the $0.04 one-time charges, the settlement and the West Virginia, the tax reform charge, I appreciate that these are one-time items, not excluded from your adjusted EPS numbers. I guess, would it be fair to say that, if you were to exclude those items, you\u2019d be guiding to the top end of the $3 \u2013 your EPS guidance range now, which is what like $3.27, $3.32?","Linda Sullivan","Yes, Durgesh. We are guiding to $3.27 to $3.32, and as you know, there\u2019s a lot of puts and takes every quarter. And so we are comfortable guiding to that range, which is the upper portion of our prior range.","Durgesh Chopra","Okay, awesome. Thanks guys. Great quarter.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Angie Storozynski with Macquarie. Please go ahead with your question.","Angie Storozynski","Thank you. So I have actually two questions. So I mean, you have had great results year-to-date, but if you look at some of the regulatory updates that you guys have provided us with, they should have been seemingly a drag against your original guidance, right? So, for instance, you had a delay in the implementation of conservation revenues in New York The New Jersey rate case, I mean, you told me how it compares versus what was embedded in guidance, but given that there is a refund of interim rates, I would argue that it was also slightly below expectations. The weather wasn\u2019t helpful. So what is the \u2013 I know that there are lots of puts and takes, but what is \u2013 what are the offsets to all of the things that I\u2019ve just mentioned?","Linda Sullivan","So, Angie, let me start with the New Jersey rate case. So we were authorized $40 million. We had interim rates of $75 million that we put into place. From an accounting perspective, what we do, when we put in interim rates is we continually assess our best estimate of the outcome and that\u2019s what we record on our books. And so we do not expect any material change in the fourth quarter associated with the New Jersey rate case. The difference between what we requested in that case and what the outcome was primarily driven by the change in ROE. We had requested 10.8% ROE and, as you know, we have 9.6%. We also requested the 54% equity ratio. And then the other changes were associated with changes in depreciation expense and O&M expense, which is typical.","Susan Story","And also, Angie, in terms of \u2013 so we had a few headwinds, but if you look and some of the things we mentioned. We had some really positive this year. Linda mentioned that year-over-year on adjusted, we were $0.06 up in Regulated, we were $0.05 up in Market-Based, almost predominantly Homeowner Services, which is doing really well. So it was \u2013 and then the parent was up $0.01 because of we\u2019ve done some significant refinancing. So I look at it, as just running our business well. I mean, we\u2019re trying to look at every lever and how can we be most efficient in our operations and make every part of our business count.","So we do have the takes, but we also had several puts and those add up. And to Linda\u2019s point, that\u2019s one reason that we\u2019re very conservative about what we do for non-GAAP is that, there\u2019s normal business puts and takes and sometimes they\u2019re up and sometimes they\u2019re down. And one of the benefits we have with the diversity of state and our size and our geographic footprint is they tend to offset each other or they have at least to date. So going through and we try to and hopefully what you all see is, we try to be very granular and transparent in these items in our slides and in our discussion. So you can see, what offset those items that you brought up.","Angie Storozynski","Okay. Just one follow-up and that\u2019s on the homeowner services. So two things, you mentioned that the integration of Pivotal is actually favorable to your original plan. If you could actually provide a little bit more color here. And the additional partnerships with cities, this is more the traditional homeowner services, i.e., wastewater line or warranty service, whatever you call it. We\u2019re not going into those additional businesses that Pivotal has been delivering along with the acquisition.","Susan Story","Yes. I\u2019ll take the latter question and then Linda can ask the first one. You\u2019re exactly right. These four partnerships, were actually responses to RFPs that our legacy homeowner services organization has been working on for several months before we ever actually bought Pivotal. So these are predominantly the water and the wastewater lines or sewer lines, you\u2019re exactly correct.","Linda Sullivan","Yes. And on the integration, it is going very well. We had guided, as part of the acquisition, that we were tracking to be near breakeven this year with Pivotal and as a reminder, our EPS neutral comments incorporated consideration of the modest share dilution. So we are on track there. What we are seeing is that we\u2019re a bit favorable in the third quarter associated with our integration costs and that\u2019s primarily due to some timing as well as some items that we had originally thought were going to be expensed are being capitalized. And so there\u2019s a little bit of positive there as well.","Angie Storozynski","Great. Thank you, ladies. Thanks.","Linda Sullivan","Thank you, Angie.","Operator","And the next question comes from Jonathan Reeder with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your question.","Jonathan Reeder","Hey, good morning you all. How are you doing?","Susan Story","Hi, Jonathan.","Jonathan Reeder","So just wanted to clarify, in the remarks, you said that I guess despite whittling down I guess Keystone to just one business, you\u2019re still potentially evaluating the sale of water transfer. Is that correct?","Susan Story","What I mentioned was that, we are \u2013 we believe water transfer is a good ongoing business and will allow us to decide whether in the future Keystone should remain part of our portfolio of market-based businesses or not. Jonathan, whether you are going to keep a business longer-term or whether you are considering other options for the business, it\u2019s always best to have that business operating very effectively and that\u2019s what our focus has been right now.","Jonathan Reeder","Okay. And then, I guess, can you just kind of describe what when Linda \u2013 I mean, I guess, were your hands kind of tied from the accounting perspective that you had to take that write-down as opposed to maybe just exploring the entire sale of Keystone prior to taking an impairment charge that that was maybe the best and the most efficient route?","Linda Sullivan","Yes. And, Jonathan, this is Linda. In terms of the impairment, we generally do our impairment testing in the November timeframe. But because of the operational issues and the negative earnings results in the third quarter, combined with our decision to narrow the scope of the business going forward, that triggered us to look at the long-term valuation and triggered the impairment analysis.","Susan Story","And that\u2019s regardless of what the strategic options are for the business. We would have to do that anyway.","Jonathan Reeder","Okay. And then you mentioned about Q4 expense timing. Are you pulling forward expenses from 2019, given kind of a strong year-to-date results or is this like the shift of some expenses from earlier in 2018 just into the fourth quarter instead?","Susan Story","It is the shift of expenses from the first nine months of the year into the fourth quarter and we saw some of that shifts come in the third quarter from the prior two quarters and then we have about $12 million that we expect has shifted from the beginning of the year into the fourth quarter.","Jonathan Reeder","Okay. And then lastly, Walter, can you expand on the DSIC mechanism change in West Virginia, did the cap increase or just the type of qualifying CapEx change? What exactly is it there?","Walter Lynch","Yes. What happened in New Jersey \u2013 or in West Virginia was they expanded what was qualified to go into the DSIC program there in West Virginia, everything else remain the same. But it is going to start over again once the rate case is effective in February of 2019.","Jonathan Reeder","Okay. And what\u2019s the cap in West Virginia, I don\u2019t recall? Do you know offhand?","Walter Lynch","Yes. Not offhand. We will get back to you, Jonathan.","Jonathan Reeder","Okay. I mean, I did see I guess that you can\u2019t file another West Virginia case until I think it\u2019s like May 2021. So I guess suffice it to say that capital allows for kind of a roughly three-year rate case cycle in the state. Is that fair?","Walter Lynch","Yes, that\u2019s fair.","Ed Vallejo","Hey, Jonathan, it\u2019s Ed. We\u2019ll get back to you shortly on that one, okay.","Jonathan Reeder","Yes. No, big deal. I mean, Walter\u2019s answer kind of covers what I need to know there, so. I appreciate it. A good quarter and let\u2019s hope Notre Dame keeps winning, right, Susan.","Susan Story","Jonathan, I\u2019d tell you, what the number four right, undefeated. Good job. I\u2019m not going to talk about much thing.","Jonathan Reeder","We will take it right back.","Operator","And this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Susan for any closing remarks.","Susan Story","Thank you, Karl. Thank you all for participating in our call today. Please know that we value you as our investor owners and as the financial analysts who research our company for the benefit of your clients and their futures. We always want to be open and transparent in all of our discussions and dealings with all of you, so you can have complete confidence in your decisions around our company and investments in our stock.

We executed on fundamentals by investing in our water and wastewater system to ensure safe and reliable service. We operated efficiently to reduce cost impacts on customers field. We continue to grow our business based on our reputation and core competency and we worked to provide excellent service to all of our customers.","As you can see on Slide 6, we reported second quarter operating revenues of $827 million, a 5.8% increase above second quarter 2015. Earnings were $0.77 per share, a 13.2% increase above second quarter 2015. Our results reflects some timing benefits partially offset by some one-time expenses. For the first six months in 2016, EPS increased 8.8% and revenues were up 6.1%.","Slide 7 highlights, how we are executing on our strategy. Our foundation remains capital investment in our regulated operations. During the first half of the year, we have invested $552 million in capital including 24 million for regulated acquisitions. The majority of the remaining $528 million was in regulated operation primarily to improve water and wastewater system improvement for the benefit of our customers.","We plan to invest $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion for the full year, mostly for regulated infrastructure investments. That level of investment is balanced by our continued focus on controlling O&M cost as well as utilizing constructed regulatory mechanisms. Walter will cover this in greater detail, but we never lose sight of our customers and what they have to pay. This quarter was no exceptions and our employees continue to improve efficiency.","We had excellent growth during the first half of 2016. We have added approximately 7,600 new customers from closed acquisitions and 5,300 customers from organic growth. We have agreements in place, pending regulatory approval, which would add 47,800 more customers that include both the previously announced Scranton Sewer Authority, which led 31,000 wastewater customers as well as our recently announced acquisition of Shorelands Water Company adding more than 11,000 water customers in New Jersey.","I also want to mention acquisition activity that exemplify my earlier comment about growing our business based on our reputation and core competency. On Tuesday, the citizens of Blue Grass, Iowa voted in over whelming 86% majority to join the Iowa American family. Subject to a final agreement and regulatory approval, this 720 customer connections in Blue Grass would join this 730 new customers in yes community Iowa, which close earlier this year.","These two additions result in a 2.3% growth from acquisition over the 63,000 customer we had in Iowa at end of 2015. We are very proud of the dedication, reputation and customer commitment of our folks Iowa, as well as in all of our other state that we are privileged to serve.","In the market base businesses in the second quarter, we launched a municipal partnership to Homeowner services in George Town South Carolina. Our contract services grew kind of 10 year O&M agreement in July with the township of South Orange, New Jersey, which has 4,700 customers. Our Military services grew, began service to our Military and their families at Vandenberg Air Force Base on June 1.","As we noted in the first quarter earnings call, we continue to see headwinds in AWE for the remainder of the year. primarily due to lower fixed capital upgrade on our existing military installation compared to previous years. Linda will discuss this a bit more in her comments. Many of you know that drilling activity is picking up in the Marcellus and Utica formation where our Keystone Clearwater subsidiary provides water services.","As noted on the slide as of today we continue to see Keystone as being EPS neutral for the year. However, we will continue to evaluate the market and services demand and provide any update on our third quarter call. As noted on the slide our market share continues to increase and is now around 35% of the water services market in the Appalachian Basin.","As Linda will discuss in more detail we experienced an increase in our medical costs during the second quarter some of which we expect to impact us through the second half of the year, I would raise some of the more innovative ways we are looking to manage these costs in the future in my closing remarks.","As you can see on Slide 8, based on the results during the first half of the year we remain on track and we are affirming our 2016 guidance of $2.75 to $2.85 per share. We also continue our progress toward achieving our long-term goal of 7 to 10% EPS growth through 2020.","And with that, Walter will now give you his update on our operation.","Walter Lynch","Thanks Susan, good morning everyone. We are really proud of the results our employees have delivered this year. We had strong growth, we made smart investments, we meet or surpass all standards as shown in our annual water caller report and we continue to realize efficiencies across the business.","Through June 30 we have invested more than $535 million in our regulated business. Of that total, we have invested $511 million to maintain and improve the service we provide and another $24 million for regulated acquisition. As Susan said this investment is balanced by our focus on cost management, constructive regulatory mechanism, and legislation that enables us to assist communities with challenged water and wastewater systems.","Our commitment to invest in our infrastructure while focusing our customer affordability is clear in the rate cases filed and closed this year. In Missouri our rate case settlement was adopted and we received an order for $4.5 million of additional annualized revenue.","As part of the rate order the PSC further consolidated water and slurry to the geography regions, going from 19 water rate regions to three and 13 wastewater regions to two. This creates economies of scale by spreading costs over a larger group of customers, reduces company administrative costs and mitigates the volatility of our customers' bills.","During the second quarter, Iowa and New York requested an additional $13.6 million in combined annualized revenue and lowered operating expenses by $3.6 million collectively. In California on July 1, we filed an application that set new rates in each of our service areas for 2018 through 2020.","This application seeks a revenue increase statewide of $51 million over the three year period. Also the State Water Resources Control Board approved a five year time extension to California American Water to comply with a 2009 order to significantly reduce withdrawals of water from the Carmel River.","This action by the board recognizes our significant progress in building cooperative alliances among California American, local governments and communities and environmental organizations. With these alliances, we are pursuing projects in water recycling and reuse that augment our water needs both before and after completion of our planned desalination facility.","On Slide 11, you can see the success we have had in working with state governments and our commissions either in legislation or policy that enables water solutions for water in which would have chance. For example, the Pennsylvania legislature eliminated a consolidated tax adjustment in setting the utility rates.","The new law now requires a calculation of the public utilities federal income tax expense on a standalone basis. Separate from any gains or losses of unregulated affiliates. Prior to this law, Pennsylvania was one of our few states that had a consolidated fact adjustments.","In Illinois over the last several months, the Illinois American Water has worked to find solutions that help our customers having more reliable water system more quickly. The Illinois Commerce Commissions adapt with new roles in June, which removes the 5% cap between rate cases and instead permit rate that can increase in average of 2.5% a year with no year to increase more than 3.5%. This will be a big help in a state with big infrastructure challenges.","Finally in Kentucky, the Governor signed House Bill 309 into law. This law establishes a framework for public private partnerships in Kentucky. For the first time ever, the state and local governments can leverage private investment to complete necessary infrastructure projects to better serve to public. This law has been referenced as the most comprehensive P3 Legislation to-date in the nation.","As you can see on Slide 12, during the first half of the year. In addition to our organic growth, we welcomed about 7,600 new water and wastewater customer connections, which is about 20,000 people. We have pending acquisitions, which represented another 47,800 new customers. This includes the Shorelands acquisition, which is more than a 11,000 water customers. This is another example of how we are able to provide solutions.","Shorelands service area is in the part of the state that is designated by the New Jersey department and environmental protection as a critical area in terms of water supply. Once the purchase is approving close, we welcome our new employees and our new customers. We are also working to close our acquisition of the Scranton Sewer Authority by September 30. Here we will welcome 31,000 new wastewater customers who will benefit from our operational and engineering expertise and our commitment to make necessary capital investments.","You can also see in this slide how legislative efforts are helping us to provide water and wastewater solutions for people across our footprint. Out of the nine states where we have pending our close acquisitions, five have fair market value legislation. The importance of this legislation is evident when we look at the numbers. Nearly 97% of the customers we have closed or pending are one of these fair market value states.","Moving to Slide 13, we continue to improve our own and efficiency ratio achieving 35.2% for the last 12-months. We remain on track to meet our owned and efficiency target of 34% by 2020. It's a great effort by our employees across our business, and it's all about bringing value to our customers. As I did last quarter, let me provide you with you couple of examples of what we are pursuing to drive these results.","The first example is in our customer service centers, where we recently introduced new features to our customer soft service sight. These changes improve the customer experience by using easy and understand language for reoccurring payments and enabling our customers to change the bank account they use to pay their bills without the need to contact us.","For the month of July, more than 17,000 customers signed up for paperless billing and that's more than three times the amount of customers have signed up in a month of June. These changes are a true win-win to make it easier for our customer to do business with us and they enable us to drive down costs.","In New Jersey, in energy deregulated state, we have taken advantage of reverse auctions to reduce our electricity cost. We first did it in 2011 and completed another auction this past fall. To do this process, New Jersey American Water will save the total of $9 million for the next three year in energy cost, benefitting our customers.","When we reduce $1 in operation and maintenance expense, we can invest $6 in capital. The $9 million cost reduction would translate into an additional $54 million in capital improvements without impacting our customers rates.","Finally, we think our employees in West Virginia for the way they have responded to the devastating floods there this past June. Once again our team rose to the challenge, working safely and getting our service restored as quickly as possible. Additionally, they assisted statewide emergency response efforts.","For example, we loaned two water tankers to the West Virginia Department of Home Land Security and Emergency Management to provide portable water for flood devastated communities outside our service area. We also provided three large generators to run critical facilities in neighboring communities without power, it was a great effort by employees there and we are very, very proud of them.","And now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Linda for more detail on our second quarter financial results.","Linda Sullivan","Thank you, Walter and good morning everyone. In the second quarter of 2016, American Water delivered strong financial results and year-to-date, we remain on-track. Slide 16 shows the earnings per share contribution from each of our businesses. We reported earnings of $0.77 per share in the second quarter, up $0.09 or 13.2% over the same quarter last year.","Year-to-date, we reported earnings per share of $1.23, up $0.10 or 8.8% over the same period last year. For the quarter, the regulated businesses were up $0.08 and the market base businesses were up a penny. Parent which is primarily interest expense on parent debt was flat compared to the same period last year.","Turning to Slide 17, let me walk though the components of our quarter-over-quarter increase in earnings per share. The primary driver for earnings growth was in our regulated business, which was up $0.08. Regulated revenue was up $0.10 from authorized rate increases, infrastructure surcharges and the new revenue from recently completed acquisitions and organic growth.","O&M expense was down $0.01 per share, this represent continued improved O&M efficiency that Walter discussed and some timing impacts, including a one-time $0.02 benefit from settlement of the general rate case that will be offset during the remainder of the year. Largely offsetting these positive items were higher medical and prescription drug insurance cost of $5 million pre-tax that are managed through our [Aviva Trust (Ph).","These higher cost are the result of three items, first we have been managing down the over funded status of our Aviva Trust and this year the funded status went from been overfunded to been fully funded. Second, we are seeing an increase in claims cost; and third which would of our liability based on our claim experience.","As I mentioned, the second quarter impact was about $5 million pre-tax or $0.02 per share. For the remainder of the year, we estimate increase in claims will add another $3 million pre-tax, putting the full year increase at about $8 million pre-tax or $0.03 per share. America Water like other employers is challenged by rising healthcare cost and later Susan will discuss actions we are taking to manage this cost going forward.","Next interest expense was up a penny and depreciation expense was up about $0.02, both driven by growth associated with our regulated system investment. Moving to our market based businesses, quarterly net income was up $0.01 per share, primarily from a favorable contract dispute settlement of about $3 million pre-tax, which we had expected to receive later this year. Absent this favorable settlement, the market based businesses were relatively flat.","Increases in home owner services as well as the acquisition of Keystone last July were largely offset by lower capital upgrades in our military services group. As noted in our first quarter call, we expect lower capital upgrades in 2016 from reduced federal budgets and because these capital upgrades can be lumpy year-over-year. One of the biggest reasons capital upgrades were lower in the second quarter was the wind down of an $85 million three year project at Fort Polk.","Let me now cover the regulatory highlights on Slide 18. We currently have six general rate cases and one infrastructure surcharge request in process for a combined annualized rate request of a $113 million. For rates effective from July 1, 2015 through today, we received the total of a $102 million in additional annualized revenues from general rate cases, infrastructure charges and step increases.","As you can see on this slide, our requested ROE in our outstanding general rate cases is generally 10.75% to 10.8%, with recent authorization at 9.75% in several of our states. Overall our weighted companywide authorized ROE was 9.9% at the end of this quarter.","Looking at the change in ROE over the past three years since 2013, the company\u2019s average authorized ROE has only moved about 10 basis points from a prior average of 10%, and during the same time period our weighted authorized equity ratio increased about 20 basis points. So even with sustained low interest rates over this period, changes in ROE have tended to be slow and gradual.","Slide 19 highlights our continued strong financial performance. We made total capital investments of $316 million during the second quarter of 2016 and $552 million year-to-date, primarily for regulated system investments, mainly for the replacement and renewal of transmission and distribution infrastructure. We expect total capital expenditures to be in the $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion range in 2016. Our capital expenditure range was updated to include our pending acquisition.","I would also like to point out that the Shorelands acquisition announced yesterday is a stock-for-stock transaction and the maximum number of shares to be exchanged at closing will be less than 500,000 with the final number of shares based upon American Water stock price. We expect to close the transaction in the first quarter of 2017.","For the second quarter of 2016 cash flow from operations increased $51 million or about 23% to $271 million mainly due to focused effort on improving the aging of our accounts receivables as well as the timing of account payable and accrued liability.","Our adjusted return on equity for the past 12-months was 9.55% an increase of 57 basis points compared to last year from continued execution on our strategies. We also announced in July a $0.375 common stock cash dividend payable on September 1, 2016 to stockholders of record as of August 8, 2016.","Turning to Slide 20, we are affirming our 2016 earnings guidance. I would like to point out a few items. First weather impacts in July are expected to be minimal as the hot temperatures across many of our states were also accompanied by rainfall. Second, our year-to-date earnings was strong across the business.","However, as I have noted they also include some timing related items including the favorable contract to receive settlement at AWV, which we had expected later in the year, and the $0.02 benefit from settlement of the Missouri rate case that will be offset during the remainder of the year.","Third looking forward despite the expected increase in group insurance cost and the headwinds we previously discussed at our military services group in Keystone, we affirm our earnings guidance range of 275 to 285 per share.","With that, I'll turn it back over to Susan.","Susan Story","Thanks, Linda. Before we move on to Q&A I would like to take a couple of minutes to talk about healthcare cost. Like other companies our healthcare cost are going up. This is especially true in utilities for we have been even more pronounced ageing workforce. We are currently partnering with our healthcare and pharmacy providers for better pricing, while strongly promoting a healthy and safe culture to our employees.","We continue to promote wellness and help management programs, preventative care screening and education for employees on being thoughtful consumers at healthcare, but were going a step further. Earlier this year, American Water was a founding member with 20 national companies, which you see on the chart to formed a health transformational alliance or HTA.","Since the initiatives we have kicked off in February and additional 13 companies have joined the alliance so within now 33 company representing more than 5.5 million people across the country. We are proud to be part of this cutting edge effort. The overall goal of the HTA is to create higher quality care by firs partnering with facilities and positions that have better outcomes, while also aggregating the purchasing power of all of the member companies to get cost down.","Additionally, HTA companies will improve our guidance without identifying individual information for better treatment options, better health outcomes and more reasonable and efficient pricing. The HTA is following a similar process for pharmaceutical purchasing and contracting systems.","The HTAs efforts have been highlighted recently in several media publications including the Wall Street Journal, Barron\u2019s and the Boston Globe. This is just the start of an exciting collaborative efforts. We will keep you updates as we work with leading companies throughout the United States to improve the quality of healthcare and slow the rising cost for our company, employees, and their family.","So, in summary, our year-to-date financial performance reflects the successful execution of our strategies, investing in our system, off riding efficiently, growing our business and remaining stead fast in our commitment to the highest standards of customer service and water quality.","And with that, we are happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now being the question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from Ryan Connors with Boenning & Scattergood. Please go ahead.","Ryan Connors","Great, thanks for taking my question. I wanted to talk a little bit about the infrastructure surcharge and the new rates coming on to the P&L and if I read the slides correctly you have got more than $40 million worth of DSIC and other surcharges there. Coming on to the P&L in the first half which puts that DSIC revenue is my calculations are right, upwards somewhere around 1.5% of total consolidated sales, which is a pretty high number relative to the historical average.","So can you just talk a little about transitioning those rates across your system from the DSIC and surge charges over the base. as it's becomes the bigger and bigger part of the business, DSIC and surge charges, is that a seamless process or will that create complications that were are not there in a traditional set up of regular general rate case cycle?","Linda Sullivan","Ryan, this is Linda. Thank you for question, great question. This is actually a pretty smooth transition from the DSIC mechanism to general rate cases, because generally these types of mechanisms are really set up for the purpose that we will be able to continue to make these investments in an ongoing basis in our much needed infrastructure upgrades. So that\u2019s really the purpose of that and then they roll into the general rate cases. It also allows us to spread up a time between general rate cases and smoothly impact of our capital investments on our customer rates.","Ryan Connors","Okay. And then I know that most of these DSIC type mechanism actually have a return in equity components to them, is that typically equal to what you expect to receive in a given state when you move from a surge charge over to a base rate?","Linda Sullivan","Typically it is, I mean every state is a little bit different, but typically it's the same.","Ryan Connors","Okay. And ten my other question was little bigger picture in terms of the new fair value legislation, obviously you have the Act 12 in Pennsylvania and Walter you mentioned five different states now. I\u2019m just wondering, whether this is really catching on more broadly, I mean we just have the new summer meetings, I believe Walter you were there. And curious whether that\u2019s something that\u2019s getting a lot of play in the hallways and what not and whether we might see other states move in a similar direction and whether this will maintain a pretty snitch oriented?","Walter Lynch","Yes Ryan, thanks for that question. We are seeing this catching on in many of the states. And you can see that by each of the state adopting it and what it really does is providing a center for municipalities to look to monetize their assets. To be able to provide a fair market data systems and before this we could pretty much only pay original cost minus appreciation and then anything above that was risk for us getting in rate base. It just works for everybody and it is getting a lot traction in each of the states where we operate and you can see that from the slide that we had up there, five of our big states have Fair Market Legislation.","Susan Story","And Ryan, so the driver for this just like Walter and Linda said, the reason that this is for water is because there is a recognition that with every increasing infrastructure needs, every increasing retirement, smallest distance increase in water quality standard. There is a general concern, do we have the ability to meet the need of water and wastewater system. And Public Service Commissions also are residents of the state they are in.","So even if in many states municipalities are regular about the PSCs. The recognition of water and wastewater challenges is shared by everyone. So we do find in many of our states, vacations are concerned about water quality, water issue along with their governmental institute. And the whole point here is to offer optionality to municipalities so that whatever works for them and their citizens they have the options to do, and Fair Market Legislation just helps us that whole situation.","Ryan Connors","That\u2019s very helpful thank you. And then one just last quick one is Walter you mentioned the Scranton acquisition, wanted to close that by the end of September. Is that pretty much buttoned up now or are there any lingering issues that could actually complicate that regulatory approval?","Walter Lynch","Well Ryan, we are working towards closing by September 30 and we will continue to work with the city on that.","Ryan Connors","Okay, thanks for your time.","Susan Story","Thanks Ryan.","Operator","Our next question is from Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.","Shahriar Pourreza","Good morning.","Susan Story","Hi Shah.","Shahriar Pourreza","Apologize if this was asked already, I had to hop on a little bit late. But so on the Fair Value Legislation, Susan, is there any other states you are thinking about where we could see some sort of passage? And I\u2019m thinking more like Illinois or New York, is there any opportunities there?","Susan Story","Actually Illinois was the first, when you look at the Fair Market Legislation at least in our service area it started with Illinois legislation, they were among the first to do that. The general question though is, I think today as you continue to see water and wastewater systems under distress across the country. This is a very viable solution that enables municipalities to benefit from water utilities like us and others to benefit and to solve - the main thing is to solve a problem for the citizens out there who are depending on the best water quality.","But also you have communities around the country who are doing an amazing job first of all, they have all of these different priorities. They have to provide for schools and for roads, and for parks, and you know the responsibilities that these municipalities have is so long and as we know a lot of the Federal funds aren\u2019t there anymore that were there during the 70s and 80s and even 90s, and because they are trying the very best they can to serve the systems of their communities.","So where it makes sense and this is an option for them and they choose to put their systems up for sale, you know having this type of legislation takes an obstacle away from that. In the past we have had situations where a municipality or governmental entity wanted to sell a system we wanted to buy it but because of the way things work between the book value and what were able to put in a rate base that wasn't considered premium it's stopped a lot of deals before they ever took place.","So I think this is an effort by state to have a win-win situation but at the end of the day the people in those communities need to be better off and the municipalities are able then to provide the critical services that they are responsible for.","Shahriar Pourreza","Got it. That's helpful. Then just around obviously there hasn't been any issues growing, and you have got organic opportunities, you have got acquisitions opportunities. But when you think about the next leg of growth, is there sort of where we at with storm water? And is that something we can see as a potential driver of that growth maybe next year or the year after?","Susan Story","I think that is a big open question right now Shar, I think one of the things we know is that on some of the military installations where we served water and wastewater a question has come up about storm water so that we provide services for the whole water cycle. So that's really the immediate issue that we are looking at and clarifying in Washington in terms of the role of storm water in the privatization legislation which by the way is actually there.","So I think it's one of those that as the entire country looks at water supply challenges and we look at the entire water cycle. It's not you know in the past we tend to say it's the drinking water, it's storm water, it's sewer water where you have drought situations, where you have the need and we need to promote water recycling reuse, we are going to start everyone looking at the whole cycle. So I think it's very early in this space to do that, but it's something because it's part of the water cycle that we have to look at.","Shahriar Pourreza","Got it, it's helpful. And then just lastly on Keystone, obviously you reiterated the earnings neutral and I think I would assume cash flow positive up until the second quarter, but obviously do you highlighted that drilling activities to pick up a little bit and you sounded a little bit more constructive. So if we cannot continue with the fundamental we are seeing right now on joining your activity, is it something that is there the opportunity to look at that earnings profile this year or is it or it's too late in the year to revisit that mutual status.","Susan Story","Shar what we know so we like to base our guidance on what we know. So market conditions have stabilized we know that and they have began slightly improve so we have seen some increases as rig count currently pricing as you all know and some customers have risen completion and drilling activity, but were looking at capital spending, how much of it we will hit at the end of this year versus 2017.","So I think it's really a timing issue that we are looking at. So what we want to do is to look over the next few months to look at how that had stabilized, what that means for 2016 versus 2017. But the good news, as you said is that we are starting to see activity, it is nice spread, we are starting to see our growth in market share.","The last we had shared with you before this call was about 30% we are now seeing about 35% with some of the smaller players have fallen by the [indiscernible] during they really tough times. So our customers are steady, we are not seeing any further deferrals of completion activities, we are picking up some new customers but we just need to monitor over the next few months and see what we have got.","Shahriar Pourreza","Excellent, thanks and congrats.","Susan Story","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Richard Verdi with Ladenburg. Please go ahead.","Richard Verdi","Hi good morning everyone. Congrats on another nice quarter and thank you for taking my call. My first question kind of is a follow-up on Ryan's question about the DSIC. I had asked it to [indiscernible] on their Q1 call. And so in early Q2 I had a conversation with one of the more prominent members in [indiscernible]. He told me that the consumer advocates are basically we are looking conveniently push back on the DSIC and similar surcharges in other states. Because the group kind of feels that DSIC is being abused for one filing after the next. And so I'm wondering if America Waters hearing this expecting it and if so I'm wondering how it could impact the company's strategy?","Susan Story","Well Rich I'm not going to comment on this because they need to speak for themselves, but I will tell you from our standpoint, in fact here is what we know. there is a recognitions by the EPA throughout the country about the infrastructure needs that we have in the United States. Our plans are very open in our state, and our DSIC in any of our infrastructure surcharge we present plan, we also go in who we have either quarterly sometimes semi-annually filing where there is a close monitoring of the projects we are working on, what we are spending.","In addition to our O&M efficiency at least for American Water we also have several efforts in terms of capital efficiency. And what are we doing not only to spend every O&M dollar, but are we doing to show that we are actually even improving how we spend every capital dollar, because for us it's this situation. We are faced with years of investment, we want to be as efficient with every dollar as we can possibly be, because that needs we can put more on the ground, not in impact to customer bills and to be able to get the infrastructure replaced more quickly which still is a decade going issue. So that one thing we know.","I will also tell you with the recent I'll say attention to water quality issues in a time when you have infrastructure, but you also have emerging water quality issues and we have seen what happened in different parts of the country when we don\u2019t invest in infrastructure. I\u2019m not sure that there is risk that we are willing to take.","Richard Verdi","Great thank you Susan. That\u2019s perfect. And then another question I have. I want to focus the rest of the questions on the Non-Reg segment. This kind of follows-up also on the last caller's inquiry. When you had laid it out to him, I just wanted to get some clarity though about the - let's call it, cautiously optimistic Q3 and Q4 for Keystone. I mean Oil is expected to pull back because of seasonality in late Q3 and into Q4. A lot of these guys go on vacation because of weather around Thanksgiving time and drilling activity dries up.","So I\u2019m assuming you are optimistic, because Q2 was probably strong and Q3 probably followed that strength, but what keeps you cautious? Is that seasonality potential for an oil pull back keeping you cautious, or are you now seeing customer indications where they are keeping you cautious on Q3? I am just looking for a little more clarity on that.","Susan Story","Sure, so first of all, understand that our Keystone executive and management spend a lot of time with our customers. We share with them and they share with us some of their plans or drilling plans. So the cautiousness is not really related to timing of holidays or vacations. You are talking about an E&P industry that\u2019s extremely cautious because of what they have gone through the past 18 months.","So you don\u2019t have people that have gone from being so far down to think we are going to pull it out the stock and ramp everything up immediately. They have a cautiousness, so we have cautiousness. And it is a testing of the waters. The foundations are becoming stronger with the natural gas prices, I think NYMEX closed yesterday at $2.84, for example, just in April it was a $1.90 per million BTUs.","We are starting see better pricing as the supply has been drawn down because of the heat across the country in this summer. We are starting to see some activities where people had not been doing drilling and now they are, we are starting to see some more drilling rigs come up. So our cautiousness is the timing. It is the spacing, it is how quickly we will see this come up, how quickly we will see the supply that basically is being drown and being replenished. What are the forecasts for the winter months, how cold will the winter be.","So we try to base looking at objective, third-party data like, price projections, like drilling projections we look at all of that, then we also look at our internal discussions we have with our customers and what their are drilling plans are. So the cautiousness is what you don't want for people to flip back and forth to say, it's not good, it's great, it's not. We just want to be very cautious as we look at the ramp up in the continuing string of the natural gas drilling markets and make sure that we are very careful in how we look at that emergence.","Richard Verdi","Great. That's excellent color. Thank you, Susan. And then staying on the Keystone here, it is in the Appalachian footprint, it is in the Marcellus and it is in the Utica. So I\u2019m curious, given market share the 35% market share you shared which I\u2019m very thankful for. In what basin do they focus on more over the others, is it the Marcellus or is it the Utica?","Susan Story","You know really it's both, so they are so close, I mean basically it's three state its Pennsylvania, it's Ohio and it's West Virginia. And of course the formations are beside each other and also importantly as we mentioned on the first quarter call, you know Shell has announced that they are going to build a cracker plant there south of Pittsburgh, which is right in the heart of where the Marcellus and Utica and some of the formations are very close together.","So we are excited about that, because what that will do is if they start construction as they have said in 2018 and finish in 2020, you are talking about even more valuable natural gas drilling where you can get the NGLs along with the natural gas. So we just see that area and the intersection between Utica and Marcellus being very rich.","The fact is we know that it is the cheapest to drill, for the drillers and it also requires a good bit of water, because of the depth of the formation. So we think that's the right place to be and we've been asking. Also at this point we are not interested in going into other formations, because we think that the Utica and Marcellus is where we have the most key areas for production growth in the future.","Richard Verdi","Okay. That actually helped answer my next question then. And then of that 35%, does Keystone work with Ontario Resources?","Susan Story","We do, we have right now I believe in this space somewhere between 22 and 27 different customers.","Richard Verdi","Okay that's helpful. And I guess the last question is this. When I think of the Marcellus, there are 10 rigs there. Six of them are Ontario Resources, which then means that their midstream arm who has a water business, that that water business is going to the midstream arm. And so then there is the four other guys there, and then the Utica there is only one Ontario Resource rig there, and of the 13 remaining they are all other players.","And so of those other players - I understand that oil prices are supposed to decline because of seasonality. But they are also expect to decline following that. And in addition to that, if you look at any upstream player, they are all counting about how they are expecting to use - I think they were using something like 1,500 pounds of sand per lateral or somewhere around there. And it is expected to go up to 2,000.","And so I\u2019m wondering if there is a potential to expand and capture more business in the Utica because it is open there? And then two, that increased sand it means increased needs for water there. So are you guys factoring that into your figures, and if so, how much of a positive impact? Because a year ago, that was a 1,000 pounds and now we are talking doubling that. So I mean that could be really meaningful for American Water.","Susan Story","Well a couple of things so Rich, in recent weeks the drill count has been about 36 in the Appalachian Basin and we are all natural gas by the way, we do very little to no support for oil actually for us it's mostly natural gas so that's one. Second thing you are exactly right, what we are finding is that in order to more efficiently utilize wells that have already been drilled, they are looking at higher pressure more sand, which does require more water, you are exactly right.","But those changes in the market and the efficiency are things that our folks at Keystone work closely with customers in terms of estimates of how much water we need. So you are right, there is changes, that's one of the reasons that the whales have become so much more efficient is they are doing the second third frac and they are also putting a lot more sand and lot more pressure with the sane when they go to those second and third fracs. So you are exactly right.","I would tell you there is a couple of other things we are involved in and one of them is we are working with a couple of customers on some automated pumping that really is not pretty standard right now. So we consistently look at working the A&P on how to make the production more efficient, how to get the most they can out of each individual well and to make sure that we are solutions provider on everything around water and water services.","Richard Verdi","Fantastic, and then thank you for that Susan that's great color. And then the very last question and I'll jump out and I'm taking up a lot of time. Last quarter I had asked Susan I think this is a great move on American Waters part, you know so I had asked this if American Water with the smart metering initiative that we are trying to team up with the electric companies, the user infrastructure and you have given some great color. I was just wondering if there is any sort of update on that if there has been anymore progress what have can you, just some color if there is an update?","Susan Story","Yes, we actually have an AMI team that we are working throughout the company to come up with a roll out unlike electric the water bills or so much like it's a business. Of course, we are looking at the ability to be able to justify them economically. One of the good things is we are seen a lot better technology with the meters that will allow us to actually put in AMR meters that we can then do software upgrade to actually make them AMI meters which is good.","We continue to work with some electric utilities on utilizing some of the same back haul infrastructure, so that our customers don\u2019t have to double the cost of those investments, we are working with Edison ComEd in Chicago area as well as there is a couple of other utilities that have expressed an interest. And we were very excited about that, because it's really as the win, win to our customers where we put in a water meter.","But the one reason that does push us to do AMI is interestingly still a lot of water meters across our footprint are in people's homes. So the ability to put in AMI that we don\u2019t have to actually send people out to peoples' homes. Instead of times to go into their home, is the real not just a efficiency improvement, but also a customer satisfaction improvement. So we are taking all of those factors, we have got a plan in place to roll out AMI over the next few years and where we can partner with electric utilities to offset some of that cost for our customers we are all for it.","Richard Verdi","That's great. Thank you, Susan, and congrats again on the success this quarter and moving forward. I appreciate the time, it's great color.","Susan Story","Thanks Rich.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Jonathan Reeder with Wells Fargo.","Jonathan Reeder","Hey, good morning all. I will try to be quick since this call has been extended a little bit recently. Could you give us an update on the military base RFP process? Obviously, your main competitor was awarded a pretty large base here recently, if you could just kind of say maybe what happened there on your end. And do you get the sense that any new bases are on the verge of being awarded?","Susan Story","Okay that's a great question, Jonathan thanks. It's that as we look at the military bases, there are several RFPs that are outstanding from the timely do and initial bid, it can be underground from three to five years before bases are awarded and we do have several outstanding bids. Again, we only bid on those basis that the 50 years contract value is from $250 million and above, because for us the normal base is - with the cost of bidding an all that.","So you are correct. The last one that was awarded was Eglin, and we did bid on it and American States Water did win that one and we are taking our lesson learned and seeing what we could do better next time. We do think that we know that there are others in the process, several we have already bid on, others that we think will come out for bid. It's an ongoing process and so we are just looking to get better every time we make a bid.","Jonathan Reeder","Okay. So no anticipation necessarily of any announcements in second half of the year at this point?","Susan Story","We don\u2019t foresee any announcements in the second half of the year. With that said however, one never know. So when you got a bid out there, that\u2019s going to out there for couple of three years depending on the particular installation and where the Department of Defense is. So it's very difficult to predict, but at this point we don\u2019t foresee any further rewards this year, but we could be wrong.","Jonathan Reeder","Okay. Great. And then, Walter, did you say the Illinois infrastructure surcharge changes removes the total cap in terms of how much revenues can increase under the program between rate cases?","Walter Lynch","Yes, that\u2019s right. It removes the cap of 5% between rate cases and it's allows us to increase rate no more than 3.5% a year. And it also includes a number of other things that we can invest in and get recovery not just pipes. So it was very favorable for the industry.","Jonathan Reeder","Okay. So a 3.5% annual cap, how does that impact the frequency of rate cases in the state for you now? Kind of stretch it out a couple more years given the broader application and the 3.5% annual cap?","Walter Lynch","It could lead to that, I mean we are going to continue work on our capital program to invest wisely within our systems and if that extends the rate cases that\u2019s great, but we are going to continue to invest per our capital management program.","Jonathan Reeder","Okay. Do you think it expands the overall CapEx budget in the state, where it moved the needle at all on the consolidated budget going forward or too soon to say?","Walter Lynch","Yes, it's really too soon say, but it is favorable for us to continue to invest again at timely recovery. We will consider that as we are working for our capital plan for the next five years.","Jonathan Reeder","Okay. And then last question, and I think I already know the answer. But I guess year-to-date, weather hasn't really had a meaningful impact. Is that correct?","Susan Story","Jonathan that is correct. We have looked at the weather impacts through July across all of our state, and although we did see more heat in those states and hot weather, it was offset by also having rainfall in those areas as well.","Jonathan Reeder","Okay, great thanks so much for the time this morning.","Susan Story","Thanks Jonathan.","Walter Lynch","Thanks.","Linda Sullivan","Thank you.","Greg Panagos","Operator, I think that\u2019s concludes our question-and-answer session for this morning.","Operator","Yes. I would like to turn the call back over to Susan Story for any closing remarks.","Susan Story","Well, thanks everybody for participating on our call today and as always if you have any questions, please give Greg or Melissa a call. They will be happy to help. We want to thank everybody for participating, look forward to see you in November. And thank goodness in one month, football season starts.

Mr. Vallejo, you may begin.","Ed Vallejo","Thank you, Anita. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us for today\u2019s call. We will keep the call to about an hour and at the end of our prepared remarks, we will open the call for your questions.","During the course of this conference call, both in our prepared remarks and in answers to your questions, we may make forward-looking statements that represent our expectations regarding our future performance or other future events. These statements are predictions based upon our current expectations, estimates and assumptions. However, since these statements deal with future events, they are subject to numerous known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual results to be materially different from the results indicated or implied by such statements.","Additional information regarding these risks, uncertainties and factors as well as a more detailed analysis of our financials and other important information is provided in the earnings release and in our March 31, 2017, Form 10-Q, each as filed with the SEC.","Reconciliations for non-GAAP financial information discussed on the conference call, including adjusted return on equity and our O&M efficiency ratio can be found in the appendix of the slide deck for this call.

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Today, our CFO, Linda Sullivan, will cover the first quarter financial results and our COO, Walter Lynch, will give key updates on our operations.","The employees of American Water again delivered solid results in the first quarter of 2017. Our strategies include providing excellent service to our customers, building constructive regulatory relationship, growing our business and becoming even more efficient in our operation to ensure affordability and value for our customers. The foundation for our earnings growth is the capital investment we make in our regulated operations.","We invested $242 million this quarter, with $223 million for regulated infrastructure. We plan to invest about $1.5 billion this year with 1.3 billion dedicated to water and wastewater system improvement and upgrade. We minimized our customer bill impacts while making these investments through a continued focus on controlling O&M cost and through constructive regulatory mechanism.","Our regulated business closed several acquisitions during the quarter and in April. The largest was Shorelands Water Company and we are pleased to welcome these 11,000 New Jersey families and businesses to the American Water family. We have added around 16,700 customers since the start of the year through closed acquisition and organic growth. Earnings were up slightly in our market-based businesses. We saw increases in our Homeowner Services Group as well as our Keystone Clearwater subsidiary.","However, as we noted at both our December Investor Day and on February\u2019s yearend earnings call, Military Services continues to experience a downturn in ongoing capital projects on basis. This is due to previous sequestration mandate and their effects on base budgets. The sequestration was lifted earlier this year and we could see the benefits of this in the DOD\u2019s next fiscal year, which starts October 1st. Linda will discuss the financial implications of this in more detail in just a few minutes.","Keystone is continuing to see a pickup in business with more well completions and drilling rigs operating in the Appalachian Basin. We expect to see fuller financial impacts in the second half of the year. As Slide 6 summarizes, our results were solid with first quarter 2017 earnings per diluted share up 13% compared to last year. As Linda will discuss in more detail in just a few minutes, this includes excellent year-over-year growth in our Regulated Businesses, year-over-year improvement in our Market-Based Businesses and a $0.02 positive impact from a parent related tax accounting treatment of equity compensation. She will also outline a second quarter onetime income tax headwind from our New York operations which will likely more than offset the anticipated equity compensation pick up this year.","On April 21, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend payment from $0.375 to $0.415 per share, a 10.7% increase. This increase is the fifth consecutive year that dividend increases are at the very top or above our long term 7% to 10% EPS growth range. We are also affirming our 2017 guidance of $2.98 to $3.08 per share.","Walter will now give you his update on our Regulated business.","Walter Lynch","Thanks, Susan. Good morning, everyone. As Susan mentioned, our Regulated businesses has had a strong first quarter, making capital investments to ensure clean, safe and reliable water service while continuing to improve our operating efficiencies to benefit our customers.","Let\u2019s walk through some of the highlights of the quarter. In Pennsylvania, we filed a rate case in April 28, requesting an increase of $108 million and a return on equity of 10.8%. We\u2019ve invested approximately $1.3 billion in Pennsylvania infrastructure and slightly decreased O&M expense since our last rate filing in 2013. This is a great example of increasing our system reliability and making it affordable for our customers.","California American Water\u2019s cost of capital filing was not extended, so on April 3, we filed an application requesting 10.8% return on equity, along with 55.4% equity and 44.6% debt. The outcome of this proceeding with affect rates starting in January 2018.","In Virginia, on April 5th, the legislature and governor enacted new legislation that will benefit our customers. Senate Bill 1492 allows for statewide single tier pricing, one for water and one for wastewater for proceedings after July 1, 2017. Consolidated rates, which we have now in nine states allows us to spread the cost of infrastructure investments across a larger customer base and helps ease the financial burden in any one community.","In Tennessee, the Public Utility Commission approved the infrastructure surcharge for 2017 projects. We\u2019ll invest almost $16 million in projects that improve service and reliability and will only impact our average residential bill by about $0.77 per month. This type of constructed regulatory policy allows our subsidiaries to make needed improvements while reducing the possibility of large rate increases.","The Iowa Utilities Board issued an order, adjusting rates for Iowa American Water. We invested approximately $38 million in water system improvements and reduced operating expense by almost 10% since our last rate filing in 2013. We also received approval for [indiscernible] which is the basic mechanism in Iowa. This helps us make improvement, while limiting customer bill impact. This is a great job for our Iowa team. Again, for every dollar we save, we can invest seven in our systems with no customer bill impact.","Turning to Slide 10, as Susan mentioned, we added 16,700 new customers through April through completed acquisition and organic growth. The largest acquisition was Shorelands Water Company, adding 11,000 customers in Mammoth County, New Jersey. This is another case where we leverage our scale and size by acquiring a system adjacent to systems we already own and operate. We can now connect the new system with our existing union beach system. It will enhance our supply and increased liability for all of our customers in that county.","We also have a number of pending acquisitions, which when closed, will add about 33,000 customers. Just last week, we announced the California American Water entered into an agreement to acquire the operating assets of the Fruitridge Vista Water Company for approximately $20 million and to become the new water provider to its approximately 4,800 customers.","Moving on to Slide 11, doing right by our customers is key to our ability to grow. This means smart investments, balanced by efficient operations and capital deployment. As Susan mentioned, we invested $223 million in our regulated operations this quarter. This is critical to reliable service but it\u2019s also about affordable service. Our talented people continue to make progress in our O&M efficiency ratio, down to 34.6% for the last 12 months ended March 31, 2017. We keep making progress towards our long term goal of 32.5% because of our employees and their commitment to our customers.","Let me give you two examples. Pennsylvania American Water\u2019s comprehensive energy efficiency program has been delivering positive results for many years. Activities include competitive electricity sourcing, pump and motor upgrades, lighting upgrades, demand response programs and utility rebates for energy efficiency projects. At a high level, from 2010 to 2016, their fuel embarrassment as a percent of total revenues dropped from 3.1% to 2.1%. This improved efficiency amounts to about $24 million of cost avoidance over the last six years.","In California, by partnering with the Sacramento Ministry of Utility District, California American Water was able to save 2.5 gigawatts hours of electricity each in the past three years. To put that into perspective, 2.5 gigawatts could power about 230 average household annually. By improving efficiency and enhancing equipment reliability, this unique partnership has helped us achieve an almost 11% reduction in yearly electricity usage with annual savings of about $150,000.","I also want to recognize our customers in California for their response to the drought. They collectively reduced water use by more than 15 billion gallons in just under two years. To help customers save, California American Water launched award winning communication campaign that included heavy emphasis on personal outreach, social media and smartphone applications as well as traditional communications. It was a tremendous effort by our customers and our California team.","So it was a good quarter with continued growth, smart investments and engaged employees, driving efficiencies and quality results, all to benefit our customers. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Linda for more detail on our financial performance","Linda Sullivan","Thank you, Walter, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will cover the first quarter results and key financial metrics that bring customer and shareholder value.","Turning to Slide 13, we had a solid first quarter. Earnings were $0.52 per share, $0.06 above the first quarter last year. The regulated businesses were up $0.04 per share, the market based businesses were up $0.01 and the parent was also favorable $0.01. I\u2019d like to point out that our first quarter results include a $0.02 per share tax benefit related to the new accounting standard for stock-based compensation. Excluding this benefit, first quarter EPS increased 8.7% over the same period last year, again representing solid quarterly result.","Let me walk through our results by business segment. Our regulated operations were up $0.04 per share. Revenue was up $0.08 per share from authorized rate cases and infrastructure mechanisms to support growth and acquisition, partially offset by slightly lower demand. ","Next, we had higher depreciation and general taxes of $0.04 per share, also driven by our investment growth. I\u2019d also like to point out that O&M expense was flat in the regulated businesses compared to the prior year, as our employees across the company continue to focus on driving efficient operation that help make capital investments affordable for our customers.","Turning to our market based businesses. They were up $0.01 compared to the same period last year. Homeowner Services was up $0.01 on revenue and contracts growth and Keystone was favorable from continued cost management. And as Susan mentioned, we are seeing improved market condition that are expected to impact results in the second half of the year. These increases were partially offset by lower capital upgrades in the Military Services Group of $0.01 per share, which includes the quarter-over-quarter impact from completion of the major project at Fort Polk in mid-2016.","Lastly, the parent was up $0.01 in the quarter from the tax benefit of about $0.02 related to the new accounting standard for stock based compensation. This was partially offset by higher interest expense of $0.01 to support growth.","Turning to Slide 14, let me provide an update on our regulatory filings. We have $46.9 million in annualized new revenues effective since January 1st of this year. This includes $34.2 million authorized through general rate cases and $12.7 million from infrastructure mechanisms. We have also filed requests and are awaiting final orders on four rate cases and one infrastructure surcharge for a total annualized revenue request of $169.5 million. This includes the Pennsylvania rate case Walter discussed that was filed on April 28.","Slide 15 highlights our key financial metrics that continue to create customer and shareholder value. Revenue was 756 million for the first quarter, an increase of 13 million or 1.7% compared to the first quarter last year. Regulated revenue increased 25 million or 3.9%, partially offset by a decrease of 11 million at the market-based businesses, due mainly to the lower capital upgrades. It is important to note that our regulated revenue growth is [Technical Difficulty] than earnings growth due to the continued improvement in O&M efficiency across our Regulated Businesses.","Total capital investments for the quarter were $242 million, primarily in our Regulated Businesses for replacement and renewal of transition and distribution infrastructure. We expect capital investments, including regulated acquisitions, to be about $1.5 billion in 2017. Our cash flow from operations grew 6.5% to $277 million in the first quarter of 2017. This was driven by net income growth and higher working capital. Working capital increased from lower capital upgrades in the Military Services Business and continuous improvements in our collection efforts in the Regulated Businesses.","Our adjusted return on equity improved from 9.4% to 9.7%. Our weighted average authorized return on equity across our regulated footprint remains approximately 9.9%. And we continue to narrow the gap between our authorized and achieved returns through a continuous improvement culture that focuses on O&M efficiency, capital efficiency and constructive regulatory outcome.","Turning to Slide 16, today we are affirming our 2017 earnings guidance range of $2.98 per share to $3.08 per share. I would like to call out a few items included in the earnings guidance range.","First; as we mentioned at our December investor conference and February\u2019s earnings call, we expect to lower capital upgrades in the Military Services Group to continue through 2017 due to the completion of the large project at Fort Polk in mid-2016 and reduced military budget. To give you additional transparency, included in our 2017 earnings guidance range is an expected net income reduction from 2016 of approximately 5 million to 6 million or about $0.03 per share from these lower capital upgrades. More than offsetting this reduction is continued growth expected in both our Homeowner Services Group and Keystone Clearwater Solutions.","Second, on April 11, New York passed legislations that will no longer allow water utilities to use a zero percent tax rate for manufacturing activity. Previously, the electric and gas utilities were excluded from the 0% rate. This will result in an increase our effective state tax rate in New York of approximately 5% beginning January of 2018. Although this rate change will not occur until 2018, we are required to record a one-time cumulative adjustment to re-measure our deferred taxes in the second quarter of 2017 or the period of the tax law change. The portion of this cumulative adjustment calculated on a stand-alone basis for our New York regulated subsidiary is expected to be recovered through future customer rates and is not expected to impact earnings. However, the remaining portion, which is allocated through our state tax proportionate factors is expected to negatively affect second quarter 2017 earnings. Our preliminary estimate of this one-time noncash charge is about $0.03 to $0.04 per share. Now this negative tax impact will be partially offset by the $0.02 tax benefit already recorded in the first quarter related to the change in accounting for stock-based compensation. And then finally, we also included in our earnings guidance range plus or minus $0.07 for weather variability. Again, these items are included in our earnings guidance range and we are calling them out today of additional transparency.","Transitioning to dividends on Page 17. We continue to be a leader in dividend growth compared to the Dow Jones Utility Average, the Philadelphia Utility Index and our water utility peers. On April 21, we announced a $0.415 common stock dividend, which represents a 10.7% increase over the previous dividend. This dividend is payable on June 1, 2017, to stockholders of record as of May 5, 2017. This increase represents the fifth year in a row that we have had dividend increases at or above the top end of our long term 7% to 10% EPS compound annual growth rate.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Susan.","Susan Story","Thanks, Linda. Before taking your questions, many of you have asked about the Trump administration\u2019s infrastructure plans and how they might impact us. So I\u2019ll speak to that very briefly. As you know, tackling our nation\u2019s infrastructure challenges for roads, bridges, airports and water infrastructure is a priority for the administration. And for a good reason. First and foremost are the safety and health of our citizens and there are also compelling economic and competitive justifications. We know reliable infrastructure is foundational for communities and businesses to thrive and investment also stimulates the economy through job creation. For example, every 1 million in water infrastructure investment yield 16 jobs. So American Water\u2019s $1.3 billion invested in water and wastewater infrastructure this year will support 165,000 jobs. The details of an infrastructure package are still not clear, but the administration has been clear on the need for private sector involvement.","For us, a focus on the need to invest in infrastructure is a good thing. For as long as you have been listening to our calls, we\u2019ve been talking about the need for and our efforts to upgrade and maintain our systems to ensure clean, safe and reliable water services, all while running our business safely and efficiently so that our customer bills are affordable. So as we applaud these efforts by the administration and are actively involved in this policy development efforts to support our customers\u2019 interest, it doesn\u2019t really change our ongoing investment\u2019s scope, plans or commitments. Regardless of what happens in Washington, we will continue to focus on serving our customers, assuring water quality and strengthening our infrastructure. And we will do this as we also partner and assist communities seeking help with your own water and wastewater service challenge.","And with that, we\u2019re happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ryan Connors with Boenning and Scattergood. Please go ahead.","Ryan Connors","I\u2019d like to just talk about Pennsylvania. The related issues of the Pennsylvania rate case and sort of acquisitions there. And obviously the rate cases as sort of hot off the press. But can you tell us about how the -- well first of all, whether or not that includes Scranton addition, which I assume it does. And if so, whether if there\u2019s any unique elements to how that\u2019s being treated in terms of that being a wastewater system and it being a pretty large implementation of Act 11 and just unique dynamics or things to watch for in terms of how Scranton will be now pulled into the rate orbit for Pennsylvania.","Walter Lynch","Brian, it\u2019s Walter. The Scranton acquisition is included in this rate filing. And because of Act 11, it\u2019s going to be integrated into the preceding and with the same way that the water systems would. So it\u2019s going to take, again, eight to ten months to work for the preceding and we just -- we\u2019re going to work with the commission to make sure that the Scranton customers are represented in the right way.","Ryan Connors","Okay. So you don\u2019t anticipate any unique or any kind of unique sort of push back in terms of the scale of that system and that being causing an issue in terms of single pricing or anything like that? I mean, you\u2019re going to be pretty straightforward and be treated similarly than any other rate case?","Walter Lynch","That\u2019s what we expect, Ryan. And again, when you consider the size, $1.3 billion worth of investment over the last four years. I mean, this is a significant investment, but still as part of the much bigger capital program that we have in Pennsylvania.","Ryan Connors","Right. Good point. Now what about the broader Pennsylvania? I mean, it seems like the deal flow, at least that announced deal flow, has slowed little bit. I mean, you have Scranton, it was obviously a big one, the key support, but lately, there haven\u2019t been really any additions. I mean, should we interpret that as meaning there is a little bit of a deceleration? Or are there whole lot sort of in the hopper that we\u2019re not seeing yet and the cadence remains really strong.","Walter Lynch","Well, let me say that we continue to work with communities to address their issues and be a solution provider for them. And again, we know that we\u2019ve got a compelling story and we can add tremendous value to our customers.","Ryan Connors","Okay. And then one last one, just more of a sort of housekeeping, short-term issue. But we are, Linda, you mentioned the variability on weather and I appreciate the transparency there in terms of the guidance. But any early read on 2Q? We\u2019re almost halfway through and whether that will be a headwind or a tailwind for the second quarter results.","Susan Story","This is Susan. Before Linda answers, we\u2019re able to project what the weather\u2019s going to be, none of us may be sitting around this table. But Linda, what do you think?","Linda Sullivan","In the first quarter, Ryan, we did see a little bit of lower demand but it was really in line with declining usage that is normally expected.","Susan Story","And if you have any inside information, we would love to hear it.","Ryan Connors","We\u2019re five weeks into 2Q, so I\u2019m just trying to get an idea whether there\u2019s any sense of whether it\u2019s been in the first five weeks of 2Q, whether it\u2019s been a headwind or a tailwind to sales.","Linda Sullivan","Yes, and we\u2019re not really seeing any large indicators through the April timeframe. I will say that when we look at weather variability, historically, we have seen the largest variability occur in the late summer months or in the third quarter of the year.","Susan Story","And Ryan, one of the things that really helps us, if you remember over the past couple of years, especially because of our geographical diversity, even when we may see, unfortunately, as we have flooding at different times in the Midwest and drier weather in the Northeast, they have tended to offset each other. So one of the benefits in terms of not -- quality of earnings or being able see through the weather is the geographical diversity we have. So you bring up a good point with all the rains that Missouri has had, we\u2019ve not seen that in the Northeast. So that kind of helps us kind of net out and we think that\u2019s good.","Operator","The next question comes from Angie Storozynski with Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Angie Storozynski","So continuing on the M&A fronts. So I\u2019m wondering, you have made two relatively high profile hires in your business development department. Is this a signal that maybe you might consider corporate M&A in addition to municipal M&A? Or those are completely unrelated?","Susan Story","So the quick answer is it really -- there\u2019s no changes to our strategy. And just as some background, I\u2019m really glad you asked the question. So if you look at American Water, in the past four years, we\u2019ve actually doubled our market capitalization. We\u2019ve increased our regulated acquisitions, we\u2019ve also increased our capital investment. And you also pair that with the fact that we have an aging workforce. And so we\u2019ve, over the past two to three years, been looking at strengthening an already really strong team, and we have so many professional, who have worked here for a long time. But for example, last year, we brought in a new Chief of Innovation and Technology Officer, Radha Swaminathan, because he brought some unique capabilities from his time in electric utility industry and what they had done in technology. ","We brought in a new Head of R&D and emerging technology because Dr. Mark LeChevallier is retiring as at the end of this year. We brought in a new Controller, Melissa Wikle and we also promoted several people inside to bigger and higher jobs. So really with Eric and Brian, it\u2019s a continuation of that. And Eric is actually in business development and Mark Strauss group. And that group, as we talked about at Investor Day in December, that group supports the regulated acquisitions strategies that are state employ, but also we are always looking at the landscape of are there any states we want to enter. And we\u2019ve talked about the conditions that we would have to have before we did that. ","And we also look at are there other opportunities, but that\u2019s not the basis of our growth triangle and that\u2019s not the focus mainly of what we\u2019re doing. And with Brian, actually, it\u2019s a different role than that is that as we\u2019ve gotten bigger and as we look at our corporate strategies and our financial strategy convergence, we\u2019re bringing in talent that has decades of experience of looking at creative financial planning, how you integrate corporate strategy with financial planning, being able to look at financial modeling, how we evaluate, making sure we make really good smart financial decisions. And I\u2019ll tell you, with the addition of Melissa and Brian and the continued outstanding work that Ed Vallejo bring, our VP and Treasurer Jen Gamble, our team here, really, we brought these hires in to really make us even stronger than we have been in the past. And it\u2019s pretty exciting.","Angie Storozynski","Very good, thank you. And but again, can you -- we don\u2019t obviously see the backlog of municipal deals that you\u2019ve been working on, and I\u2019ve heard the comments from Walter, but is there anything more you could let us know. I mean, you have a number of high-profile cases in your service territories or close to them with all kinds of issues, water related issues, lead poisoning or high levels of lead. We would have thought that those would have led to more imminent announcements regarding at least public-private partnerships with companies like yours. But we haven\u2019t heard anything yet.","Susan Story","Right. And it is one of the reasons that in December, we shared kind of the long [indiscernible] into deck. Today, we shared the long process it takes in terms of acquiring a municipality that even if there is interest and they expressed an interest, when you\u2019re a municipality, there\u2019s a lot of efforts all this are in play. You have to get a lot of people on board. You have to get a lot of people aligned. It\u2019s not quick. It would be much faster if the business was corporate acquisitions, which has its own set of issues. But in the municipality, we also understand that these are elected officials and they want to make sure not just that they\u2019re getting a good price for their system, but that the people who buy their systems and other assets are able to serve the citizens well over the coming years. And this is a big interest. A lot of these mayors and council folks say, yes price is one thing and yes we need to have more capital, but on the other hand, I have to make sure that this is going to last for the next several years and that we don\u2019t put our city in a situation where we have service use.","So you\u2019re exactly right, Angie. As we do more and more work with emerging contaminants, as we are looking not just at lead but other contaminants that are regulated, that we have growing concerns about and we\u2019re looking at ways to deal with them, we are sharing with municipalities all over the country our efforts, our value proposition and some of them are interested, some of them aren\u2019t, but it\u2019s not a fast process. And I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll ever be a fast process because of the politics involved.","And I know one thing that will help though and Walter can mention the Water Quality Accountability Act in New Jersey is one thing that it takes effect across the country because basically, private water companies like us are held to higher standards or where actually the regulations are enforced more strongly with us than they are with municipalities. And we believe that all people deserve clean water.","You may want to talk about what\u2019s going on in New Jersey, Walter.","Walter Lynch","Absolutely, Susan. If I could add to that as well. It does take a long time as we know. But our teams in the states are focused on executing and delivering value for the communities that they serve and will serve in the future. So the Water Quality Accountability Act right now was approved in the environmental communities in both the House and Senate in New Jersey. The next step is going from the budget committee, which should happen at the end of this month and then a floor vote in June. And then the governor\u2019s got 45 days to sign it. So it is moving forward. We expect it to move forward and get approved. But we think this is going to be good, not just for New Jersey but as other states look to New Jersey as a leader in this area that they\u2019ll look at something similar in those states. ","Susan Story","And if I could add to that, when we look at our long-term growth triangle, we continue to see 1% to 2% growth EPS compound annual growth rate from regulated acquisitions. And that translates into about 30,000 to 60,000 customer additions per year. And they ebb and flow, they can be lumpy as we go through, but we\u2019ve added 13,000 customers year-to-date.","Operator","And next question comes from David Katter with Baird. Please go ahead. ","David Katter","I was hoping you could discuss and give a little more color on the Senate bill in Virginia and how it adjusts, how you might evaluate opportunities in the state.","Walter Lynch","We\u2019re really proud of that. We did play a role in moving that forward in Virginia. So what we have is single tier pricing. 1 on the water and one of the wastewater side and we\u2019re going to use that like we do in other states. So if we acquire a system, we can spread those costs across a bigger customer base. And so we\u2019ll just continue to work with our municipal leaders in Virginia to promote the benefits of that. We\u2019ve seen it in all the other states and I think they recognize that because they passed it, the House and the Senate and the governor passed it for a reason because it\u2019s in the benefit customers within Virginia.","David Katter","And so would that make acquisitions in the state incrementally more attractive, do you think?","Walter Lynch","Yes, we believe so. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re big believers in the single tier pricing because again, it allows us to buy a system and most of the time, they need significant investment and we\u2019re able to spread that investment across a larger customer base. ","David Katter","Got it, thank you. And then one more question on California. After 2 years of drought, how should we think about a potential rise in demand or usage rates? How the consumer trends adjust after conservation from a drought, do you think?","Walter Lynch","Well, we expect the behaviors to continue in California. I think the customers there have worked very, very hard over the last 6, 7 years to bring their usage down to levels that they can sustain. So that\u2019s the way we look at it. The continued behavior around conservation is very important in California and our customers recognize that.","Susan Story","And also in California, we have revenue decoupling which aligns the conservation goals of the commission of our customers and our company.","Operator","The next question comes from the David Campbell [ph] of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. ","Unidentified Analyst","Given the recent cost of capital application filed in California, we\u2019re just curious, what is the revenue sensitivity for every 25 basis points change in return on equity?","Linda Sullivan","So we can give that to you off-line. I don\u2019t have it right in front of me. But what I can say is that our cast across the capitol filing was not extended, so we did do a filing on April 3. We requested a 10.8% ROE and that is up from our current authorized level of 9.99%. We also requested an increase in the equity ratio from 53% to about 55%. So we can run through that calculation and get it to you.","Ed Vallejo","It\u2019s Ed. We\u2019ll give you a ring after I get back to my office and look at the numbers, okay.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Thank you. And also, when do you expect the rate from the new Pennsylvania rate case go into effect?","Walter Lynch","Typically it takes 10 to 12 months to work through the process here in Pennsylvania.","Unidentified Analyst","And then finally, following up on Slide 19 as it relates the potential infrastructure spending bill. I guess we were wondering if increase in federal funds for water infrastructure spending could potentially, I guess, limit state incentives for fair market value legislation. So Washington, D.C. might not necessarily impact investments and American Water\u2019s current assets but may provide headwinds when it comes to future acquisitions.","Susan Story","That\u2019s a really good question. So from everything we\u2019re seeing, when you look at the amount of money spent by the private industry a year, which is between 2.5 billion and 3 billion and you look at the money that\u2019s out there for 84% of the water systems and 98% of the wastewater, they actually are spending less from public funds. So it would take such huge numbers of, I\u2019ll call free money, to have a big impact. However, there\u2019s always a issue one of the things that we\u2019re doing to watch out for our customers is our customers pay taxes just like the customers of municipality. ","So what we\u2019re asking for is a level playing field. For example, the state revolving fund that gets funding nationally, federally, we can participate in states that allow us to on the waterside but not on the wastewater side. So we\u2019re working on policy efforts to ensure that if there are pools of low-cost money that we have access to them equal to what the municipals have access to. And again, because all of our customers pay taxes also. So for us, there\u2019s also in some conversations that we\u2019ve been involved with in Washington, the trillion dollar infrastructure is not a trillion dollars in actual funding. It is finding ways that you have offset the need for that. So our ability to invest, job creation, those types of things could actually be used as a measure to count toward that and that\u2019s one thing that we\u2019re involved and making sure that we had recognized for that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jonathan Reeder with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Jonathan Reeder","Two quick questions. When you originally established the 2017 guidance, did it contemplate the $0.03 to $0.04 one-time charge for the New York State manufacturing deduction?","Linda Sullivan","Jonathan, this is Linda. It did not. And so as we began to look at our guidance and affirming our guidance, there were two really discrete tax items that we were looking at, that impacts from New York but also from the change in the new accounting standard for stock based compensation. And so those largely offset.","Jonathan Reeder","Okay. So you haven\u2019t contemplated the stock tax benefit either?","Linda Sullivan","Yes, we do about it. This is something that\u2019s really hard to predict because it\u2019s based upon the level of stock option exercises, the stock price, et cetera. And so we did not include it in the guidance. So that\u2019s why we wanted to make sure that we outlined these items for you for additional transparency, so that you could determine the overall quality of earnings.","Jonathan Reeder","Right. And I guess, that kind of goes to my next question, just given the onetime nature, why not just back it out? The $0.03 or $0.04 item, at least.","Linda Sullivan","Yes. And it\u2019s really a one-time cumulative noncash item. Let me try to be very careful. You get some companies that outlined everything so special and back out in all this and we just we tried to be pretty transparent and clean, so unless it\u2019s something -- that\u2019s why we say we adjust kind of some interesting weather that we should be able to adjust for a weather that\u2019s within a certain band and only if it\u2019s extraordinary so that\u2019s great point, Jonathan. But we just try to keep everything simple and clean as we can.","Susan Story","And I\u2019ll add to that. That is our preliminary estimate. The new legislation came out on April 11. These are very detailed calculations and we\u2019re working through that process now.","Jonathan Reeder","Okay. And then just building on Ryan\u2019s earlier question. I guess, for Walter probably, about the PA rate case. I know you indicated that you expect to be relatively straightforward, but I think it is the first time and I\u2019ll use the forward-looking test here. Do you expect any issues with that trends that it shouldn\u2019t during the process and potentially during the settlement negotiation?","Walter Lynch","No, we don\u2019t expect any issues there. We\u2019re just going to work through it like we do with our other investments in Pennsylvania.","Jonathan Reeder","Okay. And using the forward-looking texture that didn\u2019t allow you to I guess, grab and key sports since that one hasn\u2019t closed. Is that the way to kind to think about that?","Walter Lynch","Yes, that\u2019s correct.","Jonathan Reeder","But if it closes during the next few months or whatever, you wouldn\u2019t be able to adjust that case, would you?","Walter Lynch","No.","Jonathan Reeder","Okay, great. Thanks for the time guys. ","Operator","Yes. Our next question comes from Michael Gaugler from Janney Montgomery Scott. Please go ahead.","Michael Gaugler ","I would appreciate it if you could provide an update on the headquarters move and what your expectations are for tax savings at this point.","Linda Sullivan","Absolutely, Michael. This is Linda. And we are really excited because we have broken ground on the construction. And so you can now probably see it from the Philadelphia skyline. You can see, still going up, if you will. So we expect the cost of the building to be up to a $165 million. For 2017, we would expect to spend about $75 million this year on the construction, as long as we stay on schedule, which is expected. We would -- we are looking at completing the construction towards the latter half of 2018 and then taking occupancy there. ","Now in terms of that tax credit, the way that this works is that once we move into the building, we will become eligible to receive up to $165 million in tax credit over a 10-year period subject to meeting certain criteria. And our goal here is really to make this revenue neutral for our customers. And so that is what we\u2019re working towards. And we are going to be utilizing grant accounting for recognition of these tax benefits, which allow us to recognize those tax benefits over the life of the assets. And that\u2019s very consistent with our approach to make this revenue neutral for our customers.","Michael Gaugler","Okay. So what would you anticipate the life of the asset to be?","Linda Sullivan","Buildings are generally 39 years.","Michael Gaugler","39 years. Okay, that\u2019s all I had. Thank you.","Susan Story","And I\u2019d like to thank you all for participating on our call today. Please note that we value you as our investor owners and as the financial analyst who research our company for the benefit of your clients and their futures.

All statements in this call related to earnings and earnings per share refer to diluted earnings and earnings per share.","And with that I'll now turn the call over to American Water's, President and CEO, Susan Story.","Susan Story","Thanks Ed. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. After my opening comments today, our CFO, Linda Sullivan, will cover our fourth quarter and year-end 2017 results, tax reform impacts and our 2018 guidance and long-term outlook. Our COO, Walter Lynch, will then give key updates on our regulated operations. While their continuous volatility in the market, our fundamental story remains same. The vast majority of our business is regulated and our capital plan is critical to addressing ongoing infrastructure challenges. There\u2019re lots of national conversations about the urgent need to invest in water and wastewater in the U.S., a topic emphasized in the administrations recently released infrastructure plans. ","Every year, our country loses about 2 trillion gallons of treated water through more than 240,000 main breaks, with an economic cost in the billions of dollars and about 900 billion gallons of untreated sewage is discharged into our rivers and streams every year, further stressing our environment, water quality in communities. Addressing these infrastructure issues is compounded by fragmented industry with approximately 53,000 water and 17,000 wastewater systems, the majority of which are run by small to medium sized municipalities with multiple competing critical needs for their investment dollars. American Water will invest $8 billion to $8.6 billion over the next five years, with more than $7.2 billion spent to improve our existing systems.","Additionally, the lower federal tax rate which Linda will cover in more detail, means we can make these capital investments without increasing customers build as much. We will always make needed investment to ensure safe and reliable water services, which are critical to human life and healthy communities, but we are constantly mindful of what our customers must take for their services. ","Our portfolio of market-based businesses provides strong growth by leveraging our core competencies, using little to no capital and generating healthy cash flows. The successful execution of our strategies has enabled us to achieve a five-year total shareholder return of 275% with a 29% TSR in 2017. ","Today, we are affirming our 7% to 10% long-term EPS growth and our 2018 EPS guidance range of $3.22 to $3.32 per share, the same that we provided to you in December. Our conservative financial approach has resulted in our current A credit rating and strong balance sheet, providing us optionality going forward under tax reform. ","We continue to pursue efficiencies in O&M and capital deployment to further ensure that our decades of investment needs are affordable for our customers. From a capital project risk endpoint, we\u2019re different from most utilities who focus on just a few large projects per year for the majority of their capital spend.","Our annual capital is spent on around 500 discrete investment projects per year along with 2,500 smaller and more routine capital efforts. In 2018, this spend is rejected to be $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion. And these investment projects are planned for multiple years out so if it is right which could cause delays we simply move that project into a future year and full forward other projects which are already in the key. ","Given our size and scale as a nation's largest water utility we've benefit from our geographic diversity reducing both regulatory and weather risk to earnings. And this is further enhanced by our small but important portfolio of market-based businesses. All of our efforts are driven by our commitment to our customers communities and those who invest in us. ","For the fifth year in a row our board of directors approved a quarterly dividend increase that is at the top end of our 7% to 10% EPS CAGR. But none of our results matter if do not operate in the right way. For us the house is just as important as the watch [ph]. We know this matters to you too because companies do well but also doing goods. Our efforts in the environmental, social responsibility and governance arenas are recognized most recently Bob Barren which named us 36h out of their 100 most sustainable company. Off course none of our achievements would be possible without the 6,800 people who are American Water. ","When sustained subzero temperatures in late December and early January results in over a 1,000 name brakes in the Midwest and Northeast, our folks were working 24 hours a day to ensure that our customer have the precious resource of water into profits as well as critical fire protection and sanitation services. We've been in business for 132 years and we want to be in business for at least that many more years. We have succeeded through world wars, market ups and downs, company ownership changes, technology disruptions and the full continuum a political and regulatory policy experience matters, history matters and that's why we are confident in our business and growth for the future.","With that, I'll turn it over to Linda. ","Linda Sullivan","Thank you, Susan, and good morning, everyone. Today I will cover our fourth quarter and annual results followed by a discussion of the impacts of tax reform on 2017 and on our five-year plan and conclude with 2018 and five-year earnings guidance.","Let me start with our fourth quarter and full-year 2017 results on Slide 7. Excluding the impacts of tax reform, we had a very strong fourth quarter. We reported adjusted earnings of $0.69 per share an increase of $0.12 or 21% over the fourth quarter of 2016. ","Our regulated businesses were up $0.11, our market base businesses were up a $0.01 and parent was flat to prior year. GAAP earnings which were negative a $0.01 per share included a $0.70 charge from the green measurement of deferred taxes to the new 21% tax rate under the tax cuts and jobs act. I will discuss the key elements of this charge in more detail in a moment. ","For the full-year, our adjusted earnings were $3.03 per share which is at the midpoint of our narrowed earnings guidance range set forth in both December and January, and as you know we have some challenges to overcome in 2017 including tax related changes in several of our states and lower capital upgrades in our military services group. Despite those challenges our teams across the company delivered and just like they have consistently done. ","For the year GAAP earnings were $2.38 per share which includes adjustments for the positive insurance settlement related to the freedom industries chemicals bills, the early debt extinguishment charge with the parent and the impact of tax reform. ","Turning to Slide 8, let me walk through our adjusted quarterly earnings by business. Our regulated operations were up $0.11 per share in total, revenue was up $0.06 from infrastructure investments and regulated acquisitions, net of lower demand, or declining usage of about 1%. Weather negatively impacted the quarterly comparison by $0.01 per share as fourth quarter 2016 had drought conditions in the northern part of New Jersey resulting in higher bulk water sales. ","Also, in the fourth quarter, we had favorable O&M expense of $0.02 per share, mainly from higher O&M expenses in the fourth quarter of 2016 due to timing. ","Finally, higher depreciation and interest expense related to investment growth was more than offset by approval of a new depreciation study in Illinois, which reduced full-year 2017 depreciation by $16 million. ","Turning to our market-based businesses, we were up $0.01 compared to the same period last year. The majority of this increase was in Homeowner Services from customer growth and price increases, offset slightly by lower capital projects in the Military Services Group.","Turning to Slide 9, our full-year adjusted earnings were up $0.19 per share or a $6.7% increase over adjusted earnings in the same period last year. Our regulated operations were up $0.23 in total, driven primarily by infrastructure investment, regulated acquisitions and organic growth. ","Also, we had warmer and drier weather in 2016, which negatively impacted year-over-year earnings by $0.05 per share. Depreciation, interest and taxes were higher by $0.06 per share from investment growth, partially offset by the new depreciation rates authorized in Illinois. ","Our market-based businesses were up two pennies, with AWE coming in $0.01 favorable to the prior year as growth in Homeowner Services exceeded the impact from lower capital upgrades in our Military Services Group, and Keystone was favorable a $0.01 to prior year as market conditions continued to improve. ","Parents and other were down $0.06 mainly from the two discrete tax adjustments associated with legislative changes in New York and Illinois, impacting state tax apportionment, as well as higher interest expense to support growth.","Let me now turn to the impact from tax reform on Slide 10. As you all know, there are a lot of moving parts on tax reform both with the numerous judgments and interpretations from the changes in law and how our different regulatory jurisdictions will handle the implications. We will continue to monitor the impact of additional interpretations or guidance on these judgments. ","For American Water, the most important takeaway from tax reform is that over the next five years, our fundamental investment strategy does not change. We continue to see a 7% to 10% long-term compound annual growth rate in EPS and our EPS cadre with tax reform is accretive or even stronger than our plan before tax reform. ","We expect to continue to invest capital of $8 billion to $8.6 billion over the next five years with a majority focus on the much-needed infrastructure investments for our customers. We expect to continue to help make our regulated customers build affordable by focusing on O&M and capital efficiency. We expect to continue to grow our complementary capital rate and cash flow positive market-based businesses. We expect to maintain our guidance to grow our dividend at the high end of our long-term EPS compound annual growth rate of 7% to 10% and we do not plan to issue additional equity under the normal operating conditions expected with this plan. So, our fundamental stay the same. ","Now what changes. There are two primary items. First, we expect our customer bills to benefit from the impact of tax reform, which for us helps to make our much-needed capital investments more affordable. Second similar to other utilities as we return the benefit of the lower tax rate back to our customers, we expect lower cash flow. And with the loss of bonus depreciation we expect to become cash tax payers sooner than in our prior plan which is why Moody's put us along with 23 other utilities on negative outlook.","So, you may ask given the expectation of lower cash flow why do we think we can execute on our five-year plan without impacting capital, dividends or equity and the answer is, because we start from a position of strength. We have a very strong balance sheet, we are A rated by S&P and AAA by Moody's which gives us optionality. And we continue to believe we will have a strong balance sheet under the plan even though we expect our FFO to debt metrics to drip to lower as we return the tax rate benefits to our customers and pay cash taxes sooner. It's also important to note that we are working closely with our regulatory jurisdictions to determine the best approach for our customers which I'll talk more about in a moment. So, all that said the bottom line is that we are starting from a position of balance sheet strength and net-net we believe tax reform will be good for both our customers and our shareholders. ","Now let me dig into the details a bit. I'll start with how tax reform impacted our 2017 income statement and balance sheet on Slide 11. As I mentioned earlier on the income statement we had a $0.70 or $125 million charge in 2017 related to tax reform. This onetime non-cash charge was the result of re-measuring our deferred taxes from the 35% federal rate to the new 21% rate. The re-measurement was required to be recorded when the new tax law was enacted therefore it impacted 2017 earnings. The largest portion of this adjustment was from federal net operating losses recorded at the parent company as well as adjustments to deferred taxes for items currently not recoverable through regulated customer rates. ","For the balance sheet our regulated businesses are required to normalize the impact of the change in the federal tax rate or said another way they are required to return that benefits to customers over the average remaining life of our assets which is currently estimated at approximately 50 years, which is specific to the longer life of water and waste water assets in our industry. The re-measurement resulted in a 1.5 billion net reduction to deferred taxes on the balance sheet. ","Looking forward the impact of tax reform on our business is summarized on Slide 12. There are three major technical areas that impact us, and we have shown directionally how they are expected to affect earnings and cash flow and as you can see overall tax reform is expected to be positive to earnings overtime and negative to cash flow. ","Let me walk briefly through each area. First, the change in the tax rate from 35% to 21%. We expect the change in tax rates to be accretive to long-term earnings and negative to cash flow. For earnings, the lower tax rate will benefit our customers, so that impact is expected to be earnings neutral. However, we do expect rate base in our regulated businesses to increase overtime as a result of having lower deferred tax liabilities, which offset rate base.","There are three primary drivers of lower deferred tax liabilities. First, we will have a lower federal tax rate on new investments. Second, we will normalize or give back to customers the re-measured deferred taxes of the remaining life of the assets, and third we are no longer eligible for bonus depreciation going forward.","For our market-based businesses, the lower tax rate is expected to increase earnings, however, we do expect the majority of our military service contracts to true up over time. Partially offsetting these increases is the impact of a lower tax shield on parent company interest expense and higher debt levels due to lower cash flow from operations through 2022.","From a cash perspective, the lower tax rate will result in lower regulated revenue under cost of service rate making, although this lower revenue will be earnings neutral, it will negatively impact cash flow as we currently have a net operating loss for federal tax purposes. We will see a cash benefit from lower taxes of the market-based businesses, but this is offset by the lower tax shield on interest expense of the parent company.","Next, interest expense reduction and bonus depreciation. Utilities received a carve out that allowed us to preserve the ability to the best interest in exchange for foregoing bonus depreciation. At the parent, we expect the majority of the interest expense to be allocable to our regulated operations and fully deductible for tax purposes. ","And with our market-based businesses being capitalized, the allocated interest is expected to be well below the 30% limitations and that is why we showed the interest deduction as neutral to both earnings and cash flow. ","As I mentioned earlier, the loss of bonus depreciation will increase rate base and earnings over time, but will decrease cash flow and is expected to accelerate when we become a full cash tax payer from 2021 to 2020.","Now let me quantify some of the major impacts I directionally discuss. Let me start with the impact on earnings on the left side of Slide 13. For the regulated businesses, rate base is expected to increase a 4-percentage point over our prior plan to a compound annual growth rate in the range of 7.5% to 8.5% post tax reform. Because the earnings from our market base businesses are at about the same level as the interest expense of the parent company, the increase from the lower tax rate in our market-based businesses is expected to offset the loss in the tax shield on interest at the parent. ","However, lower cash flow will result in an additional debt and interest expense drag at the parent. In total, over time, the earnings benefit at the regulated and market-based businesses are expected to largely outpace the additional drag at the parent company.","On the cash flow side, we expect lower cash flow of about $500 million over the next five years compared to our pretax reform plan. You can see that the estimated impact is larger in the beginning years, especially in 2020 when we become a full cash tax payer, but that impact declines over time as we grow rate base. ","Now the actual impact will be largely dependent upon the outcome of our regulatory proceedings regarding tax reform. With this lower cash flow, we expect about $500 million of additional debt at the parent to support our growth over the next five years, which could increase our long-term debt to cap levels to a range of about 61.5% to 62.5% in 2022 after tax reform. ","Moving to Slide 14, the forecast we are providing you today are based on the expectations of a reasonable regulatory outcomes and customer impacts which will be determined by the various regulatory proceedings. And all of our state commissions have opened formal proceedings or dockets related to changes in the tax law or we have open rate cases. And we have begun to work with regulators to determine how best to provide the tax savings to our customers. We are currently considering several options with our various commissions that will moderate rate and cash flow impacts. ","Some of the discussions with regulators include consolidation of customer rate impacts with general rate case proceedings, offsetting of capital investment needs and regulatory assets to address the customer rate impact, deferral of rate receiving, rate reduction or a combination of these items. The outcome of these proceedings would likely take some time and we have to keep in mind that each state will look at the infrastructure needs and customer builds in a different way and we are glad our regulators are trying to find a win-win in conversations with us. And this is so important for our customers and the local communities we serve as we continue to invest in our infrastructure and create jobs in our local communities. ","Turning to Slide 15, and looking forward to 2018 we are today affirming our 2018 earnings guidance range of $3.22 to $3.32 per share. In terms of the tax reform impact on 2018 in our regulated businesses we do not expect significant near-term changes in earnings. As the decrease in the tax rate is expected to flow back to customers and its earnings neutral. ","However, in our market base businesses we do expect a positive impact from the lower tax rate that will be offset by the lower tax shield in interest expense for comparing. The major variables included in our guidance range are consistent with what we've shown you before with plus or minus $0.07 of weather or what we consider to be normal weather variability being the most significant events or variations outside of these ranges could cause our results to differ.","Turning to Slide 16 in our long-term financial plan as I mentioned earlier we do not expect our fundamental investments strategy to change. We are affirming our 7% to 10% long-term compound annual growth rate and EPS while investing capital in the range of 8 to 8.6 billion mainly for our customers. ","Our strong balance sheet provides flexibility to overcome challenges of tax reform and we do not see a need to issue additional equity under normal operating conditions. We've been a top leader in dividend growth for five consecutive years we've had dividend growth at or above 10% and we expect to grow our divined over the next five years at the top of our 7% to 10% EPS growth range subject to board approval. Also, we continue to target a dividend payout ratio of 50% to 60% of earnings.","With that I'll turn the call over to Walter to talk about the regulated businesses.","Walter Lynch","Thanks, Linda. Good morning everyone. Our regulated businesses had a strong year all around with historic capital investments and record levels at employee safety, strategic acquisitions and continued O&M efficiency gains that benefit our customers. Let's walk through some of the regulatory highlights starting with Pennsylvania. ","The Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission unanimously approved the rates settlement in December with new rates going into effect on January 1st. The settlement resulted in an increase of approximately $62 million in annual revenue driven by approximately 1.3 billion of investments made since our last rate case in 2013. ","Our calculated ROE for the [black box] settlement is 10%. This constructive settlement balances our customers\u2019 interest with much needed investments, including the replacement of nearly 450 miles of aging pipe, valve, service lines and hydrants. This substantial investment balanced by our commitment to cost management, mean the average family pays about $2 for a day's worth of cooking, feeding, cleaning and drinking water. In New Jersey, we filed a rate case last September, seeking recovery at $868 million in infrastructure upgrades, made in less than three years since our last rate adjustment in 2015.","This includes a replacement of more 200 miles of aging water mains, which is in compliance with the new replacement rate criteria of New Jersey's recently approved Water Quality Accountability Act. In fact, New Jersey American Waters had a better replacement rate than required by the new law for several years. ","In Missouri, we filed a rate case last June, requesting an increase of $84 million in annual revenue, driven by more than $490 million in investment in our systems. Settlement discussions have begun with evidentiary hearings to begin next week. A decision could come late April or early May. In California, we filed our cost of capital application last April, it was submitted for consideration in the fall with a proposed decision issued earlier this month. The proposed decision must be on record for 30 days before the commission considers it. At that time, they may support, reject or modify it.","We've reviewed the decision and intend to file comments next week. We're concerned that the proposed decisions recommendation on ROE does not reflect current market conditions like interest rates, inflation and tax reform. It also makes an assumption that ROE is guaranteed by the water revenue adjustment mechanism, which is not accurate. This will be reflected in our comments and will keep you updated as the process moves forward. ","Finally, as Linda mentioned, our states are currently assessing the impact of tax reform. We're working closely with our local commissions as each of our states have different circumstances and needs. We want to ensure we get to the right outcome for everyone.","Moving to growth, we had another great year. We added 15,000 customers through organic growth in our existing service areas, the highest organic growth in many years. Through pending and closed acquisitions, we've added or we'll add approximately 63,000 customers in our regulated businesses. You can see here that we have 16 pending acquisitions in multiple states. This growth across our footprint, really speaks to the local solutions we\u2019re able to offer neighboring communities. ","In 2017, we closed 19 acquisitions in 9 states, adding about 40,000 customers. This includes our newest wastewater customers in McKeesport Pennsylvania. We completed that acquisition last December and we're pleased to welcome 22,000 new customers as well as the new employees who joined our Pennsylvania American Water team. This acquisition has been highlighted in several venues as a model of public and private sectors working together to address wastewater challenges.","Turning to Slide 20, doing right by our customers is key to our ability to grow. This means smart investments balanced by efficient operations and capital deployment. We invested more total capital in 2017 than in any other year, with $1.4 billion going into our regulated operations. This is critical to reliable service, but it's also about affordable service. ","As you know, we measure our operating efficiency using the O&M efficiency ratio. With tax reform, we expect that metric to increase to 34.9% in 2018 due to reduced operating revenues. For comparison purposes, we've included pre-tax reform and post-tax reform numbers. As you can see we've made great progress since 2010 due to our continued commitments to our customers and our culture of continuous improvement which is why we expect to meet our 32% O&M efficiency target by 2022. Let me give you two examples of the many initiatives we have at American Water to improve operating efficiency. ","We have a highly trained asset reliability team that conducts assessments at critical facilities across our footprint. Using specialized instruments these teams predict and correct minor issues preventing major issues from occurring. Just last year further assessments they identified and corrected about 200 minor issues resulting in 400,000 hours of repair cost. ","In New Jersey our operations team is using the acoustic monitoring to find and fix leaks before they lead to main brakes. This water saving technology uses sound ways to locate leaks and as already provided savings up to 1.9 million in the first two year and an estimated 1.7 million of water per day. Remember every dollar we save in expenses we can invest $8 in capital with no impact to customer builds that would drive our commitment to our O&M target. ","Additionally, we reinforced our operational efficiency efforts by also focusing on capital efficiency leveraging technology and using our scale and size to achieve savings for a supply chain. We understand that driving capital efficiency allows us to do more with the same amount of money. ","In summary it was a great year of growth, smart investments and engaged employees driving efficiencies and quality results also benefited our customers. ","With that I'll now turn the call back over to Susan.","Susan Story","Thank you, Walter. Before I turn the call over for questions, I do want to speak just a couple of minutes about the administrations, infrastructure proposals which was recently released. We're encouraged that the administration in congress are working to address the pressing need to upgrade our nation's infrastructure including the systems that provide critical water and waste water services. ","Companies like American Water play an important role working together with the public sector as the needs are too good for anyone sector to tackle along. We are very pleased that the proposals seeks to level the playing field for private and public providers of these critical services. ","There are several positive proposals in the plan including the removal of caps on tax exempt private activity bonds as well as making clean water state revolving fund loans available to private waste water utilities. The plan encourages partnerships between private and public providers with incentives for smarter ways of investing in critical upgrades and while this infrastructure plan's just a proposal the fact is that the tax cuts and job reform act is actually in infrastructure package for us.","It doesn\u2019t change our strategy or operating plans but we will be able to invest more with less impact to our billed and that's the good news for our customers and our regulators. American Water looks forward to continuing to be part of the infrastructure conversations and working with the administration congress as they address the nation's infrastructure challenges.","With that we're happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The question today comes from Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Securities. ","Shahriar Pourreza","So just two questions. First, there has obviously have been a lot of analysis on tax reform and so much of the focus is centered on cash flow metrics like FFO to debt. In light of you guys not needing any equity and looking at debt to sort of offset the near-term cash drag from tax reform can we talk a little bit about what other metrics the agencies could be looking at especially as we think about the water industry. I have to imagine that looking at cash flow metrics in isolation sort of misses the bigger picture, especially in this industry?","Linda Sullivan","Yeah. Shah, this is Linda, and you're right there has been a real heavy focus on FFO to debt metric for utilities due to the lower cash flow from the loss of bonus depreciation, the passing back of the tax benefits to customers and especially for those that are in a federal net operating loss position like us, and you're right, FFO to debt is an important element of our rating. ","It represents 12.5% of our rating under Moody's methodology, but it is also important to note that the largest component of our ratings is based on our business risk profile, which generally represents about half of our rating. And the business risk profile is based on a more qualitative risk specific to the water industry and to the unique size and scale of American Water. ","So, for example, the types of things that are looked at there are items such as the absolute essential service of providing water, the smooth deployment of our small capital projects like Susan talked about earlier, and the regulatory environments across our diverse 14 jurisdictions that really support our ability to grow to invest and to generate cash flow going forward. So, this strong business risk profile is not changing with tax reform.","The other thing that's really important to note is that the business risk profile of the water industry and American Water is unique to us. So, our FFO to debt metrics generally will fall in a broader range than what you see with other utilities, so a strict comparison of the numbers of FFO to debt with other utilities is really not a good comparison. ","So, all that said as I mentioned in my comments, with tax reform, we do expect our FFO to debt metrics to drift lower and we very carefully evaluated the right mix of capital investment needed for our customers, dividends for our shareholders and then we believe will be able to carry the tax reform impact without issuing additional equity. ","So, the tradeoff is a lower FFO to debt ratio and our starting point as I mentioned is a very strong balance sheet that provided us with that optionality as we work through the appropriate mix.","Shahriar Pourreza","Got it. That\u2019s super, helpful. And then just I want to touch a little bit on your growth rate. You have no dilution obviously from incremental equity, you have very minimal regulatory or structural lag and what seems to be fairly perpetual growth opportunities and a very healthy step up in rate base. So how are you sort of thinking about where growth should fall kind of within these raises, especially as the benefit of tax reform sort of lands within your outlook. So mainly focused on your 5% to 7% regulated growth outlook.","Linda Sullivan","So, in our growth triangle, we continue to see that the bottom part of that triangle that\u2019s 5% to 7% for rate base growth. We also see 1% to 2% for regulated acquisitions and both of those together really kind of translate to what we showed on our rate base growth chart.","Susan Story","Shah, this is Susan, we can not to be a company that gets too far ahead of ourselves and speculate what we want to see is, let's give time for everything to settle in, and before we start looking at changing anything, we want to feel confident and comfortable that our plan which we have presented as 7% to 10% is still the best guess we have in terms of the best estimates and projections we have for the next five years.","So, what you won't see is us going back and forth based on the type of tweens or initial analysis, but the point you brought up are good, we will continue to evaluate all market trends we will continued away with our balance sheet and our growths opportunities to determine the best projections for our five years plan. ","Operator","The next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","So, wanted to follow-up little bit up on Shah's questions two-fold on the tax reform question. First, on the regulatory front what are you embedding in the context of your slide, you showed some CFO impacts. Can you touch on some of the regulatory operates in the key states say Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Missouri for instance just on what the game plan is there vis-\u00e0-vis returning the funds to customers or otherwise seeking accelerated investments depreciation?","Linda Sullivan","Yes, and we are working as we have 14 regulatory jurisdictions, we are working through with those regulators in terms of how to best pass the benefits back to customers and continue to invest in the much-needed infrastructure. And so, as you know we have currently three open rate cases proceeding in New Jersey, California and Missouri so we are having discussions in those proceeding. We're also working across our jurisdictions where everyone is really open sometime of a tax proceeding, and so we're working to determine what is the best approach and I went through some of those strategies on the call I don\u2019t know Walter if you want to add a little bit more to the specific state.","Walter Lynch","Again, as Linda said we are in rate proceedings obviously in New Jersey and California and Missouri and were incorporating these discussions in those rate case proceedings. It's a great discussion we're open with the committee were very happy that the commissions are open to discussing these issues as part of the rate filings and as Linda said in the other proceedings we're working through with the commissions to say we want to mitigate the impact on customers give back what we can but then as we invest we want to make sure that it's smoothing out, so with that I think we're having good discussions across our footprint. ","Linda Sullivan","And with those discussion Julian we put forward on slide 13 the cash flow impacts that are expected using reasonable judgments and so we looked at what do we think are the reasonable judgments from a regulatory perspective, what are some of the cash flow strategies that we can deploy across the company and we wanted to be very transparent to put it there by year.","Susan Story","Julian, interestingly each of our state are in a little bit different situation for example I mentioned we actually had about 1,400 main brakes in the frigid temperatures in late December and January so that goes into our investment planning where we've had flooding, where you have natural disasters were putting a lot of focus on our critical assets and resiliency plan when you look at Indiana for example, in Gary, Indiana there are a lot of lower income customer [on-lit] service lines. So, each state has some similarities but each state also has its own issues in terms of investment needs as well as the ability to be able to continue to have these affordable rates while we increase our investments. So, each state President as Walter says, we are very much a local company and each state President and each state staff is working very closely to determine what that specific state needs are and finding the way forward that works for everybody.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","And then just coming back to the FFO to debt question, I know there has been a lot of focus on it. Can you just give us a little bit more of a quantification of where you stand relative to where the agencies want to see you, just again -- just broad brush where you kind of end up through the plan?","Linda Sullivan","Yeah, Joe, so our cash flow from operations remains robust, Moody's just issued their report and published an effort FFO to debt metric of 17% covering 12-months ended in September and we believe the FFO to debt metric continue to remain strong throughout the remainder of 2017.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Through the remainder of 2017, you said?","Susan Story","Yeah. Yes.","Operator","The next question comes from Ben Kallo from Baird. Please go ahead.","Ben Kallo","Hi, thanks for taking my question. Could we just cut back to California the cost capital proposal? And then maybe John, what we saw with other types of utilities and their cost capital of California, what you think that means going forward to water utilities in California? And then do you think that there's a spillover or this is a precedent in other jurisdictions? And then I have a follow-up question, please.","Linda Sullivan","Yeah, absolutely. So, the decision was an administrative law judge proposed decisions are not a final decision. We have as Walter mentioned, we have 30 days before the commission considers it and we will -- and they can support, project or modify it, we will be filing comments it next week and we are concerned that the ROE does not reflect the current market conditions like interest rates, company\u2019s risk profile, et cetera. And we will include those items in our comments back to the commission. And I think reasonable jurisdictions across the country we're not seeing anywhere near those proposals, and I think there is an understanding of the need to have attract capital to invest in a much-needed water and wastewater infrastructure across the nation.","Ben Kallo","I guess on that point, is my second question. You guys mentioned infrastructure plan that comes up in conversations. But could you just talk about maybe the one or two things, I know it\u2019s early and it's changed a lot, but one or two things that actually have key for the water utility industry?","Susan Story","Yeah. So, this is Susan, Ben. So, we were actually little bit surprised just how much focus there actually was on water and wastewater. And a few things, so, PricewaterhouseCoopers actually came out with a report about six months ago, that said that $60 billion to $80 billion of additional private investment could be leased if a few things happened. Interestingly, they were five things they listed, two of those five, I mentioned in my comments which is one thing people may not understand, it\u2019s state revolving signs that tend to have the least expensive financing cost, we're able to take advantage of those in several of our states, but only for drinking water. ","The clean water -- the Clean Water Drinking Act state revolving fund, which is wastewater, it would not allow private. This particular proposal now would allow us to be able to access the state revolving funds, which have a lower financing cost. That\u2019s one. ","The WIFA the Water Infrastructure and Finance Act. It basically also allows for private firms to be able to pay and financing debt tied to the treasury yield without an up charge. So that would expand the ability to do that. Couple of things too that we're seeing that will be part of this is, half of the $200 billion debt the administration says is going to leverage the $1.5 trillion, over half of that is for projects and only 20% of the project cost can come from federal, so local areas, private companies or municipalities will have to find funding for the other 80% of that, we think that's very positive as well as the fact that the issue of workforce development and looking at things like permitting reform to allow projects to go forward more quickly we think those are all positive things that will benefit not just the entire industry but specifically American Water.","Operator","The next question comes from Ryan Connor with Boenning & Scattergood.","Ryan Connor","I wanted to -- it's understandable because the tax reform is such an important issue but it that definitely does seem there is less focus this quarter on the acquisition M&A municipal M&A pipeline. So, I just wanted to get more of an update there on the pipeline especially in the key states like Pennsylvania where you've had so much of success in the last couple of years and it would be and now with the act 12 in and just want to kind of get a little more detailed update on the deal environment and the cadence of the encore activity and that sort of thing?","Walter Lynch","The opportunities are robust throughout our pipeline. We spend a lot of time working on legislation to enable the acquisitions, our teams are focused on it. The municipal sector, many of them are having a lot of issues at monetizing the assets would really solve their situation. So, we're in discussion we have as I said before about 330,000 customer opportunities in our pipeline across our footprint and that's up from 145,000 this time last year so we have a robust pipeline, we are working through in each of our states and I can't comment at anyone deals that's not public yet but we are working very hard to meet the 1% to 2% growth of 30,000 to 60,000 customers and I feel confident we're going to get there.","Ryan Connor","Okay, and in terms of -- I know you can't comment on specific deals but in terms of the general themes that are coming up on those discussions I mean are there certain recurring themes that are preventing things from moving ahead in a number of cases or is it just kind of real case-by-case aspect and any common threads you can let us seen on in terms of how those discussions move ahead or don\u2019t move ahead?","Walter Lynch","No overall themes it's really the case-by-case basis and again we feel very good about our pipeline about their size of the deals and our focus again has been 3 to 30,000 customers and we feel like we're going to execute on that very favorably over the next five years.","Linda Sullivan","Ryan, this is an area where our geographical diversity also helps. I mean you mentioned about Pennsylvania but the fact is we've got numerous states where we have opportunities and that's part of this significant pipeline we have which is we're in 16 states we have 14 regulatory jurisdictions it's much easier to grow from a grass roots where were in the communities we live there, so what we're seeing is more states that would see activity and so we think that's a very big positive. ","Ryan Connor","And then just to revisit this, I don\u2019t want to beat the dead horse so to speak but on the tax impacts and there is a various PCs looking at how to address that issue and then opening discussions on that, just to be clear from a modeling standpoint obviously the earnings impact is neutral to positive but from a revenue standpoint I mean just to be clear logically we\u2019re talking about a potential revenue requirement reduction at least in some cases, I mean is that logically \u2013 that\u2019s the way to think about it, correct?","Linda Sullivan","Yes, it is. That's correct.","Operator","The next question comes from Angie Storozynski with Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Angie Storozynski","Thank you. I'm sorry to go back to the tax question, so when you show us the projections of the likely degradation of the operating cash flow, I mean how does it compare to what the credit agencies saw back in January when they put you in the negative credit watch, because, at least versus in our expectation, it seems like the reductions and FFO was a bit lower, I mean, do you think the reduction is lower than we have expected?","Susan Story","Yeah, when Moody\u2019s put us on the negative outlook as you know they put us on with 23 other companies. And so, we didn't really do a deep dive into our financials that was really more about us being in net operating loss position. And so, we are having meetings with our rating agencies, we're continuing to work through this, but today we\u2019re not kind of reviewing all of these details as part of that particular analysis. ","So, we'll continue to work with them and what we wanted to do here is really be transparent that from our prior plans to this plan with tax reform, this is our estimate of the potential tax impacts on cash flow over that five-year period, with the key being that you can see us kind of higher in the earlier years, and then as rate base continues to grow it lessens.","Angie Storozynski","Okay. And given that the earnings mix placed such a role in your credit ratings, is there -- I mean are you having any second thoughts about the growth in the market-based operations in light of this tax reform, just mostly just to attempt to manage some of the duration and the FFO to debt through maybe some change in the earnings mix?","Susan Story","Yeah. So, when we look at the earnings mix going forward, remember that under tax reform, the regulated business is growing and the market-based business is growing. That\u2019s being offset somewhat by the additional drag as the parent company, but the earnings mix is still roughly $90.10.","Linda Sullivan","Yeah. And Angie, we have no plans at this point to change strategically our outlook for regulatory \u2013 for regulated versus market based.","Angie Storozynski","Okay. Then my last question. So, the infrastructure plan. As you, Susan, pointed out yourself, it actually did cover a quite a bit of water related investments. And so, are the municipalities basically even more hopeful that they will some help from the federal government and as such, that could further delay any municipal M&A?","Susan Story","One thing that was missing from the infrastructure proposal, there are not large pots of federal money, free federal money. Basically it's $200 billion to leverage $1.5 trillion and except for about $50 billion that\u2019s set aside for rural infrastructure block grants, which also was expanded to include broadband, really the amount of money, half of that $200 billion, $100 billion is basically 20% of a project and the municipality has to find a way to finance 80%. Then you\u2019ve got some of the block grants that have to include broadband transportation and water for $50 billion. Then you\u2019ve got expanding the federal loan programs that we all have access to but then again, our municipality has to ensure it has bonding capacity that it's able to do and then beyond that you got about 10% -- 7% to 10% that was dedicated for what the administration refers to this transformative projects like Elon Musk Hyperloop on transportation so what you don\u2019t see here are huge amounts of free federal funding that people can access. ","Operator","The next question comes from Richard Verdi with Atwater Thornton.","Richard Verdi","I have a quick question regarding Keystone on the last call it sounded like American was guiding to rather flat earnings growth there in 2018, however on the last call I mentioned that it sits through the filings since American acquired Keystone the customer base is more than doubled. Rig count is up let's call it 10 rigs in the past 10 months and all of the energy companies that I used to follow are shifting's through their transcripts, listening to their calls are exciting that Marcellus is heating up. I mean just yesterday [Indiscernible] said that they are expecting a meaningful increase in shipments to the Marcellus which means there are much more frac sand there which means you are going to see a much higher water needs, you need to clean it and deliver it etcetera. So, I'm wondering if you can give us an update on Keystone for 2018 because in my eyes right now it looks like that's going to be much stronger than what American guided to as just a few months ago. ","Linda Sullivan","One of the things we did cover is that year-over-year Keystone was a penny up from 2016 so we were very encouraged to see that and it didn\u2019t show up in the fourth quarter because the markets are to picking up in the fourth quarter of '16. However, you are correct we currently have about 300 employees, we're looking to hire another 100 the margins or a little less than they were before the market went down but we're still continuing to grow our percent of the market, there is a lot of big projects underway this year and we feel very good about the business this year. We think it is going to be a strong business this year. ","Richard Verdi","Just one other question and it pertains to the military group and the idea that the contracts which were up on tax reform. I understand under the price re-determination I can understand how this might be the case. But with economic price adjustments, I mean the concept bears contractual and very simply put the idea is that if the water utility spent too much then they would have to eat it but at the same time wouldn\u2019t the water utilities get the benefit and a benefit of tax reform. I guess everything I'm hearing is pointing to American is going to keep that and you guys are some daily ones I don\u2019t know if it's conservative approach but I'm kind of having a hard time understanding how you guys see that improve.","Linda Sullivan","Sure. So, Rich when you understand price redetermination so on the positive side and this helps to make it regulated like there are three instances that the department of defense as they will true up your original bid and you are right, if you make a bad O&M bid, and it doesn\u2019t fall into these categories you live with the results and one of those is do you have a law change. For example, that there is a change that requires more environmental monitoring then we actually can get more money for that. ","We also look at inflation and the O&M contracts could adjust for inflation. And the third component is, if we put another capital project, for example, if we build another wastewater facility and operation costs go up or down, it gets trued up. So, understanding that\u2019s the definition of price redetermination. ","So, what you have now is that the DLA and the DOD has not come in and said where they see to tax reform falling into. So yes, we are very conservative, one way, you can review and you can interpret what that price redetermination definition is, is that tax reform was a law and thus we would basically give back that money over a period of time, just likely we would gain, if there was a law passed that increase our cost. So that's been our position. ","I know that not everyone shares that, we're not sure, what they have not basically given that the days of DOD has not given guidance. But, the way we're modeling it is in the most conservative nature. So, if they come back and say, gee, we are going to let you keep a portion or is this, then it would just be upside for us. But, we feel more comfortable modeling the way we have it, based on our interpretation of the caveats and the price redetermination.","Operator","The next question comes from Michael Lapidus with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Q \u2013 Michael Lapidus","Just curious how you're thinking about larger scale M&A in a world where tax reform maybe impacts you less than some of your peers, in a world where you're trading at a mid-20s PE multiple and at a time when you've got one of the best balance sheets in the business?","Susan Story","Well, thank you Michael. Well, I wish we have used some of your words in our call. But in terms of how we look at it when we look at our growth triangle, we don't consume any large acquisitions. So that 1% to 2% of acquisitions are the tuck-ins are the ones in our state. They're very ground up grassroots up that happened in the local communities. ","However, we also do have a corporate strategy group and we are always looking at the landscape, we're always looking at other water companies, we're always looking at municipalities, large municipalities, we have mentioned to our investors before as we look at whether we grow in our existing states or new state, if we look at going into new state, we look at three factors, we look at the business climate, the regulatory climate and we see a way to get to 50,000 customers in five years, because otherwise, our efficiency model doesn't work and we can't ensure that we have affordable value added rates for our customers that we can leverage our size, scope and scale.","So, the answer is we are always looking, however, we are also very disciplined in how we look and we don't believe that you get too in love with any type of deal or to chase a deal that could be to the detriment of the overall long-term performance of the company. So, we'll continue to look, monitor where we see opportunities, we\u2019ll pursue them.","Michael Lapidus","And do you see the opportunity set as being changed at all via tax reform?","Susan Story","That's a really interesting question. I think that the water space is so limited and that you look at that and I'm not sure, I don't think any of us understand now how all of this is going to shake out in the next one, two, three years. In terms of municipalities I don\u2019t think it makes a difference. I think the bigger difference sort of things like the age of water systems, waste water systems, the amount of investment needed, growing pension has been the pension liability the amount of roads that need paying, the amount of schools. ","So, for us really, I think it's more in the municipal market it is left to be seeing what happens with the entire water waste water infrastructure in this country and how we approach that because it is getting at a critical stage and in the next few years decisions are going to have to be made because these systems can't hold-up forever if they are not being invested in.","And even more importantly one thing we really like about the administration's plan in the past sometimes you had pools of money and it only went to a capital project but there was no requirement for nourishment of this systems ongoing. ","The interesting thing about this administration, the 50% of the 200 billion that funds the 20% not only are they looking at investing 20% of those funds into projects that have funding for the upfront capital investments but they are also requiring a revenue stream that is predictable that will help with operations maintenance and upkeep. We've not seeing that before. ","So, the recognition of life cycle cost for this infrastructure investment it's something that I think is a real positive that you have to step back and look at what are you going to do for the next 50 years as Linda mentioned in the water industry our assets we're looking at 50 years we're not looking at 20 or 30 years. There is 50 sometimes 70-year assets. So, we think that based on what happens with this proposal and the overall philosophy about overall infrastructure investments could have more opportunity than any type of impact from tax reform on individual product companies. ","Operator","The final questions today comes from Jonathan Reeder with Wells Fargo.","Jonathan Reeder","Hey, Susan [indiscernible], okay so.

Good morning everyone, and thanks for joining us. Before I discuss our first quarter earnings results, I'd like to talk about Linda Sullivan's retirement. While we made the announcement yesterday, she will remain as CFO until July the 1st and will stay with us until August 1st to ensure a smooth transition. This is especially bittersweet for me as Linda and I have been a team since she began her tenure as CFO in early May of 2014 when I moved from the CFO position to CEO.","But her family is growing in addition to her two beautiful grandsons you met in a presentation at our Investor Day last December. Her son and daughter-in-law in California are expecting her first grand daughter in June. We're happy for Linda and in a few minutes she will tell you more about her plans. Her accomplishments are too long to live, but I would highlight that from 2014 through 2018, our EPS has grown at an 8% CAGR, our annual dividends have increased at a 10.1% CAGR and our stock price has risen from $46.22 on May the 1st, 2014 to a $107.10 at yesterday's closing.","I reminded of an executive team meeting in 2014, when we ask each person for his or her top aspirational goals for American Water, literally Linda said \"for our stock to go over $100 per share.\" Linda, we did it. Linda also oversaw the raising of $4.4 billion of financing capital over the past 5 years. She rebuilt our tax and risk management functions with industry leading talent, and she has led significant improvements in our supply-chain processes. She also designed and developed the financial strategy and planning organization, and she has recently setup digital finance within her organization, one of the first in the utility industry.","She has also been very involved in our corporate wide growth, customer and people initiatives, and she helped us recruit her successor, Susan Hardwick, who she has known for several years. Many of you also know Susan, who served more than 6 years as CFO of Vectren. She has 35 years of deep finance and regulated utility experience. She most recently led the execution of the 8.5 billion Vectren sale to CenterPoint Energy. Susan is strongly committed to customers constructive regulatory relationship and building better communities.","She prioritizes employee development and the building of collaborative and successful teams. She has a strong record of living and leading the values we have at American Water and is a tremendous fit for our company. She would join our company on June 3rd as Executive Vice President of Finance until she takes the CFO rank from Linda on July the 1st. She is actually here in the room with us today.","Linda, would you like to say a few words?","Linda Sullivan","Yes, and thank you Susan for your very kind words and your inspirational leadership. I have learned more from you in the last 5 years in my entire career and I thank you immensely. You know, my husband and I took the road-less travel when we moved from California to New Jersey 5 years ago and being part of the American Water team turns out to be the best career decision of my life and I would not trade this experience for anything in the world.","And to our analysts and investors, I want you to know that one of my favorite things to do is to meet with you and discuss the American Water story and listen to your insights and views. You are truly the grand teachers and thought leaders of our industry. It has been an absolute pleasure learning from all of you. So now after 30 years in the utility industry, this decision to retire is the hardest career decision I have made and at the same time the easiest personal decision for me and my family.","It's hard because I love everything about American Water, the leadership team, my colleagues, my team, the board, and our collective ability to do what we say we're going to do. I believe American Water is the best run utility in the nation and with our announcement today bringing Susan Hardwick on board, I am confident it will continue to be just that. Personally, this is an easy decision for me. My coast-to-coast family is rapidly expanding with two grandsons and a granddaughter due in June and I am fortunate in this stage of life to be able to follow that strong pull of my heart.","And you know, it's really hard to explain the way grandchildren make you feel, but there is a song lyric and it's by Andy Grammar that sums it up pretty well, it says, I think I finally found my hallelujah. So, I also love the work I do on several boards and I am eager to spend more time pursuing that passion plus my bucket list is approaching the size of a novel and my husband Tom and I look forward to living those dreams.","I would like to thank the leadership team and board for being so understanding and gracious about my decision and working with me through a strong succession plan. I am thrilled to have Susan Hardwick join the team. She will bring tremendous value to American Water.","Susan Story","Thanks Linda. As always, Linda will cover our financial results in just a few minutes. Unfortunately, our COO, Walter Lynch is in Arkansas due to the passing of his father-in-law Alex Street. Many of you know that Walter is a West Point graduate and an Army veteran. Mr. Street also served our country in the Army. At 80 years old, he was still a practicing attorney after more than 50 years. We applaud his life commitment to his family and the values we hold here at American Water integrity, service, and unwavering commitment to his community and country.","So, now moving on to our first quarter results, the employees of American Water delivered solid performance and further strengthened our low risk and predictable growth story. Our first quarter 2019 adjusted earnings per share were up 3.4% compared to the first quarter of 2018. As a reminder, we had an extraordinary first quarter of 2018 with a 13.5% EPS increase from the previous year, primarily due to the impact of finalizing both the Pennsylvania and Missouri general rate cases in 2018, which Linda will discuss in more detail.","While American Water does not give quarterly guidance, our first quarter results were a penny ahead of plan for the quarter. Given our performance year-to-date we are affirming our 2019 adjusted EPS guidance of $3.54 to $3.64 per share as well as affirming guidance to the top half of our 7% to 10% EPS compound annual growth rate through 2023. Also consistent with our previous dividend guidance on April 17, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend payment from $0.455 to $0.50 per share, a 9.9% increase.","The Company has increased its dividend every year since our IPO in April 2008 with consistent annual increases of around 10% per year since 2013. The foundation for our earnings growth continues to be the capital investment we make in our regulated operations, so that we can provide clean, safe and reliable service. We invested $337 million total this quarter with a majority for infrastructure improvements in our regulated businesses.","We minimized the customer bill impacts of these investments through a continued focus on controlling O&M costs. These cost savings are driven by optimizing capital spend through value engineering and volume procurement, constructive regulatory mechanisms and deploying technology developed with inputs from both our employees and our customers. I'll talk more on the next slide about our continuing progress on regulated acquisitions and their contributions to our long-term growth story.","Earnings were up year-over-year in our market based businesses. This was due primarily to growth in customer contracts from homeowner services. Of note, we have a very successful new partnership with Philadelphia where we had added more than 100,000 contracts since we launched the partnership in October 2018, that type of growth would not be possible without our exceptional customer service and our combined homeowner services has an A+ rating from the Better Business Bureau.","Our military services group added the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base contract in 2018, and we began full operations at Fort Leonard Wood Army base yesterday, May 1st. We still expect to see decisions by the Department of Defense on up to three military base awards for which we are competing this year.","Turning to Slide 8. Let's talk more about growth across our regulated footprint. We have closed on five acquisitions in four different states so far in 2019. Three of these were water systems in Kentucky, Indiana and Missouri; and two were waste water acquisitions in Kentucky and Pennsylvania. These closed acquisitions resulted in 4,700 new customer connections and the join within 3,000 customer connections we added through organic growth in the first quarter.","We also look forward to adding another 61,500 customer connections through signed agreements in nine states, most of which we expect to close in 2019. This includes our most recent agreement to acquire East Pasadena Water Company in California, adding 2,900 new connections. Just as a reminder, typically a customer connection or meter represents on average 2.5 to 3 people based on the specific state.","At American Water, we believe that all people should have clean and safe water at affordable prices regardless of where they live or the socioeconomic status. These new agreements reflect our commitment to provide water and wastewater solutions to communities across the United States.","Moving to Slide 9. Customers remain at the center of every decision we make today and into the feature. This means smart investments balanced by efficient operations and capital deployment. As we make these critical investments to maintain reliable service, we must also ensure affordability for our customers. We do this by putting a laser focus on both O&M efficiency as well as capital investment efficiency. This is why our 31.5% O&M efficiency goal by 2023 is so important.","As a reminder, this ratio represents how many cents of O&M we spent for every dollar of revenue, meaning we want more dollars to go to investment so we can make our system safer, stronger and more reliable. Our employees live in the communities we serve and they're committed to serving their neighbors and families with the best quality water and water services at affordable prices. Let me give you just one example of we're driving further efficiency.","We are finding that due to a growing national shortage of trucking personal, the prices of materials and equipment are rising and scheduling has become more challenging. So, we developed a supply chain strategy to continue to diversify and optimize our suppliers and their willingness to locate closer distribution points, so their states operations are most cost effective. When we roll these savings into other cost efficiencies we get by leveraging our large size and purchasing power, we will save approximately 33 million a year just in purchase of meters, hydrants, valves and pipes.","Slide 10 summarizes many of the points I discovered, again we are affirming our 2019 EPS guidance range of $3.54 to $3.64 as well as the affirming guidance to the top half of our 7% to 10% EPS compound annual growth rate through 2023. We're off to a good start this year and we look forward to continuing to deliver stable and predictable results.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Linda for her comments.","Linda Sullivan","Thank you, Susan. I'll start on Slide 12. We had a solid first quarter of 2019 especially compared to a very strong first quarter 2018. GAAP earnings were $0.62 per share and increase of $0.03 compared to the first quarter last year. Included in GAAP earnings was a favorable adjustment of $4 million or a $0.01 per share to reflect a reduction in the settlement liability related to the Freedom Industries chemical spill. This reduction is based on our latest determination of the final claims cost.","In total, our share of the original 126 million Freedom Industries related settlement has been reduced to $19 million through insurance recoveries and lower claims. Excluding this benefit, first quarter earnings were up 3.4% which came in a $0.01 above our plan. On strong market based earnings offset partially by timing items in the regulated business in parent.","Other highlights included achieving a consolidated adjusted return on equity of 10% for the 12 months period ended first quarter 2019, executing on our capital investment strategy by investing $337 million during the quarter and adding $36 million in annualized new authorized revenue since the beginning of this year.","Turning to Slide 13. Let me provide more detail on our first quarter adjusted earnings results. I'll start from the left hand side of this page. As you can see, we had a very strong first quarter of 2018, up 13.5% over first quarter of 2017 on settlement above of the Pennsylvania and Missouri general rate cases last year. First quarter 2019 increased 3.4% on a quarter-over-quarter basis which reflects some timing impacts that I will discuss in more detail as I cover each business.","Let me start with our regulated businesses which were up a $0.01 per share. Revenue was at $0.08 in total and included increases from authorized rate cases, infrastructure mechanisms and acquisitions. These increases were partially offset by lower demand and a $0.02 benefit in the first quarter of last year as our Missouri general rate case did not begin to adjust customers rates for the lower federal income tax rate until May 28, 2018.","Lastly, I should note we did not see any material impact from weather during the first quarter of 2019. Next, we had higher O&M expense of a $0.01 per share from something we are very proud of. Through finalization of our union negotiated national benefits agreement last year, we now include our 17 national unions in our annual performance plan. This puts our 7,100 employees on the same annual performance plan where the annual payout is based on company performance tied to the goals you see in our proxy statement.","So from our CEO to the frontline, our goals are aligned. We believe this investment in our employees will further enable us to meet our O&M efficiency goals, allowing us to reduce the customer bill impact of our critically needed infrastructure investments. Depreciation and interest expense for each up $0.03 per share to support investment growth. Our market-based businesses had a strong quarter up $0.04 or 57% with homeowner services up $0.03 from the acquisition of pivotal and new customer additions.","Military services was up a penny from the addition of Wright-Patterson Air Force Base and an increase in capital work at Vandenberg. Lastly, the parent decreased $0.03 from three separate items each a $0.01 per share. First, we had higher interest expense to support growth. Next, we had a tax adjustment that was favorable in 2018 and we also had a penny of expense timing.","Turning to Slide 14. I will provide an update on the regulatory proceedings. We settled two rate cases in the first quarter of 2019 in West Virginia and Maryland and implemented our third year rate increase under our four-year plan in New York effective April 1. In West Virginia, we received approval of an annualized revenue increase of $19 million, an ROE of 9.75 and an increased equity ratio to 48.4%. The case was driven by $200 million of infrastructure investment since our last rate case in 2016.","Additionally, the distribution system improvement charge was reset to provide for additional investment. This surcharge will be offset by the amortization of deferred tax savings under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. In Maryland, we received approval of an annualized revenue increase of over $1 million an estimated ROE of 9.9% and equity ratio of 48.7%. The case was driven by $18 million of investment since 2015.","During that time, the Company constructed a new 90 million gallon reservoir and intake near Bel Air, Maryland this new reservoir is now in service and provides a long-term safe and reliable water supply and economic opportunity in that region. We also have three pending rate cases in Indiana, Virginia and Kentucky and filed our preliminary application for our California general rate case.","In Indiana, we reached an agreement with the major parties on our rate case. If approved, the new rates will reflect a revenue increase of 17.5 million over two steps, an ROE of 9.8% and an equity ratio of 53.4%. The settlement shows that at the end of the 2020 future test year, Indiana American Water will have invested over $500 million in infrastructure upgrades since its last rate case in 2015.","Regarding the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Indiana American already reduced its customer rates by 4.4% on August 1 2018 and the agreement includes credits for the period before August 1st to be spread to customers over 12 months starting in May 2020, a final orders expected by mid-2019. Moving to Virginia, we implemented interim water and waste water rates on May 1st. The general rate case requested an overall increase of 5 million driven by approximately 98 million in infrastructure upgrades since April of 2017. The final rate order could take several months.","In Kentucky, our general rate case requested nearly 20 million in additional annualized revenues and was driven by more than 100 million in capital investments since the last rate case in 2016. And yesterday, California American Water filed a preliminary application for its 2021 through 2023 general rate case that includes a first year revenue increase of 23.9 million followed by annual step increases that would support 200 million of infrastructure projects. California is also awaiting a decision on its step increase for 2019.","Turning to Slide 15. Today, we are affirming our 2019 adjusted earnings guidance range of $3.54 to $3.64 per share. This excludes the $0.01 favorable impact from the reduction of the liability associated with our Freedom Industries related settlements, which is included in our 2019 GAAP earnings guidance range.","Included in our annual guidance range are several variables with the most significant potential variable being the impact of weather, and as a reminder we consider plus or minus $0.06 of weather to be normal weather variability included in our earnings guidance range with the largest weather impact typically occurring in the summer months of third quarter of each year. On a long-term basis we are affirming our 2019 to 2023 long-term EPS guidance in the top half of our 7% to 10% compound annual growth range incurred of 2017 adjusted earnings.","Turning to Slide 16. Let me discuss our balance sheet. As we look at our cash flow impact from tax reform originally, we expected lower cash flow of about 500 million from 2018 through 2022. This has improved by a 120 million following the Pivotal acquisition. You can see that the estimated impact is largest in 2020 when we expect to become a cash tax payer, but then declines quickly as rate base grows and becomes positive by 2022.","Also as we continue to refine our estimates, we are now forecasting becoming a cash tax payer in the second quarter half of 2020 versus our prior estimate of a full-year in 2020. Now, the actual impact will be largely dependent upon the outcome of our regulatory proceedings regarding tax reform. Also I am pleased to report that our 2018 debt to capitalization ratio came in better than expected at 59% in 2018 further showing our balance sheet strength and cash flow management.","Incorporating the better 2018 results into our 5 years plan, we have lowered our expected long-term debt to cap levels by a full percentage point to a range of 61% to 62% by 2023. And I should note the debt to cap ratio includes both long-term and short-term debt. In terms of credit rating earlier this year, Moody's downgraded American Water from A3 to Baa1 with the stable outlook. Although, this appointing we expect the impact to be minimal. And as you know in the second quarter of 2018, S&P affirmed our A credit rating with a stable outlook. In summary, we continue to have a very strong balance sheet, and we do not see the need to issue new equity with our current 5 year plan under normal operating condition.","Turning to Slide 17, we are committed to continue to deliver customer and shareholder value with our announced increase in dividends of 9.9%, our 5 year compound annual growth rate and dividend is 10.1% and we now had consistent annual dividend increases since 2013. Looking forward, we expect to grow our dividend at the top end of our 7% to 10% EPS growth range, subject to board approval, and we continue our targeted dividend payout ratio of 50% to 60% of earnings.","Our total company adjusted return on equity is holding steady at 10% for the 12 month period ended March 31st. Our weighted average authorized return on equity across our regulated footprint remains at about 9.8%, and we have consistently delivered strong total shareholder return far outpacing the UTY index and S&P 500 over the one, three and 5 year period. Through this disciplined financial management customers and shareholders may be confident that American Water will continue to deliver value.","With that, I'll turn it back over to Susan.","Susan Story","Thanks Linda, we never forget at American Water that at the end of every water pipe there's a family depending on the safety of the water they give their children, that at every fire hydrant lives depend on the water being there at the right pressure, that at every wastewater plant we are a shield between our customers and disease. We're very proud to announce our most recent awards in the water research foundation to continue research on Legionella while Legionella is primarily an issue in customer owned plumbing and not even on our side of the meter.","We think it's critical that we further educate and protect our customers from contaminants that could impact their water quality. As a reminder, we've had an R&D group at America Water since 1981 and our newest research grant is one of over 100 we received on topics ranging from emerging contaminant to water recycling and reuse, to groundbreaking water technologies. We know that employees, customers and investors are seeking to align themselves with and invest in companies that are actively committed to the betterment of society, our planet, and our communities.","We believe that successful financial performance follows doing these things as part of our purpose driven value culture. I was fortunate to be asked to participate on the panel at the recent S&P Global ESG Evaluation launch. The key topics at the launch were ESG risk quantification, developing more standardized ESG measures, and improving timeliness of reporting. S&P as well as Moody's have indicated that ESG measures will be an important input into evaluation of risks to overall financial performance capability of companies and their subsequent credit ratings.","We're committed to bringing even more transparency in giving you the ESG information that you want, but the wide-ranging and non-standardized measurements today create inconsistency in reporting and comparison. Timeliness of data is a big issue as many of the rankings and ratings we've seen recently are based on data from as far back in 2016 and don't reflect progress that many companies have made over the past few years.","We've engaged a leading ESG consulting firm and they recently completed a materiality assessment for us. This effort included detailed interviews with and data research from investors, credit rating analysts, regulators, customers, elected officials, environmental and ESG activists and our own board members and employees. We will use that input to provide more complete and timely information that is most important to the stakeholders we serve and we look forward to you continuing feedback.","In closing, I mentioned earlier that professional accomplishments of Linda Sullivan over the past 5 years, but that will be remiss if I didn\u2019t end on something even more important for personal influence and impacts on the heart and soul of who we are as a company. Linda has the highest integrity. She is smart, quick and strategic and she is always asking how can we get better. She cares deeply about our employees, our customers, our communities and our shareholders.","She has been a CFO that I depend on everyday to do the fundamentals very best and to look beyond the horizon to what's next. She treats every single person with respect and dignity. I can honestly say that I have learned something from her every day. She is my colleague, my hero and my friend and I will miss her tremendously. For those of you who know her well, you understand this last slide. Linda loves three things very much her family, American Water and Corvettes.","So many of you will see Linda, Susan and me with Ed and Ralph over the next two months on investor visits. And while Linda is not retiring until August 1st, this will be her last earnings call. An in and out of things to come, I will share with you another first for American Water. We are one of only three S&P 500 companies with the female CEO and CFO team, and on July 1st, we will have the distinction as the only company for both women even have the same first name, just another way we're trying to make things easy for you.","So with that, we are happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Angie Storozynski with Macquarie Research. Please go ahead.","Angie Storozynski","Linda, congratulations, I'm very happy for you and we will live vicariously through your travels.","Linda Sullivan","Thank you so much Angie.","Angie Storozynski","Thank you. So, I wanted to ask about California, about the recent acquisitions, I mean, I was a little bit surprised. I always thought that most of the municipal M&A is going to come from the Northeast. Some of those are not newly M&A, but could you talk a little more about this?","Susan Story","Sure, Angie, and thank you for the question. So, this is what we call as you know we're tuck-in and in California, there is significant interest from the public utility commission to help the stress system throughout the state. We saw that at the cost of capital hearings in some of the discussions that resulted in the increase and our cost of capital.","Our plan that we guide to is basically assuming that all of our acquisitions are these smaller tuck-ins and you will have larger systems of course as you said, and if you look at our history of acquisitions more have been in the northeast and in the Midwest. This was an opportunistic acquisition.","We're pleased to have these folks on board. It's a roll-in to service areas where we already are, and again, we have in the past several months seeing for us anyway constructive outcomes at the California PC including the approval of the Monterey desalination facility as part of the water supply project as well as the last general rate case outcome.","Linda Sullivan","And, Angie, if I can add to that, in our cost of capital decision as Susan mentioned, we did have a lot of conversations about investments in California, and it's really important to note that although our ROE decreased to 9.2% in that proceeding, our equity ratio increased from 53% to 55.4%.","Angie Storozynski","And just one last question about New Jersey. Is there any progress on the implementation of this New Jersey Water Quality Accountability Act, meaning as far as it relates to municipal M&A?","Susan Story","That\u2019s a great question, Angie. So many of you know that the first step in implementation was that water providers in the state of New Jersey were going to have to certify to certain parts of those regulations. That is happening though as the regulations are currently still being developed by the DEP in New Jersey to be rolled out further. So, we were the first to certify, for us, it was more business as usual.","So, we are just now starting to see some of the certifications coming in. It's our understanding that there may be one or two, I think, a university that may be looking at consolidating those type of certifications and looking where different systems stand in the state. So, it's in the early stages. The regulations are still being promulgated, and we look forward to -- it continued into roll out over the next, probably 6 to 12 months.","Operator","Our next question comes from Richard Verdi with Coker & Palmer. Please go ahead.","Richard Verdi","Before I ask my question, I just wanted to say Linda, I wish you all the best in your retirement, congratulations and that I really appreciate all the time that you gave me from when I would pester you for you know to do conference calls with investors, with me or to go on the road to visit investors. So, I appreciated all that time and I wanted to say that make sure you knew that and I wish all the best in your retirement, congratulations on a well-deserved retirement still I'm sure.","Linda Sullivan","Rich, thank you so much, and it was my pleasure to have those discussions with you.","Richard Verdi","Thank you very much. So kind of I'm pretty clear on everything for the quarter. Just kind of a, I guess, more of a high level question. Last month, we saw the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection announced that it had planned to set standards for the PFOS contamination. And they're much, more strict than the EPA's guidelines, and it appears other states are going to implement similar standards as well. So, I was just kind of hoping maybe you could discuss a little bit about how that could impact the Company on the regulated side in terms of the acquisition front and then on in terms of what it could mean to cost to the Company since it's going to need to deal with the stricter standards as well? And then on top of that, how it could also impact the Company in terms of the military business because you know driver of this contamination is caused by the fire extinguisher foam used on these military bases every day when they're running the drills. And so, I would think that would be you know something with this PFOS contamination could be an impetus to see more of those military bases pursue O&M contracts with the likes of American Water. So just wondered, if you could give us some high level color on how is PFOS contamination could impact the Company?","Susan Story","Rich, thank you for this. This is probably one of the largest emerging issues that will need to be addressed across the country both from states that are doing their own limits on PFOS as well as EPA actually yesterday came out from -- what most people don't understand while the EPA has a recommended maximum contaminant level, there really isn't a regulation. It is not actually a regulated chemical, what it is that they're recommending not to have over certain limits, but they don't have the force of regulation behind it. EPA came out yesterday I read and basically said they are going to do it. They're looking at the level that they were using for maximum contaminant levels that weren't regulated of 70 parts per trillion.","New Jersey as you mentioned, has come in with a much lower I believe 13 parts per trillion. To your point about the Company, I mentioned, it's interesting that you've asked this question because I mentioned in my final remarks about the role of our R&D group. We've been doing research on these perfluorinated chemicals for decades. And in fact and I'll talk about military first and I'll come back to the regulated business. We have actually already been working on a couple of three of our military basis to actually treat PFOS. We have mobile units where we can actually do on-site decontamination.","And for example, at Picatinny Arsenal in New Jersey, we've done tremendous work already with the couple of wells there that we serve. We believe from a military installation standpoint, it's actually a competitive advantage for us. We have treated 2 levels that are at or below what the New Jersey requirements are, we now had to do that. So, this is a serious situation, and if you were to get a nice 4 or 5 page premier for those are there who want to know the National Institute of Environmental Health Services has a wonderful 3 or 4 page premier because some people use, PFOS, PFOAs, they are all part of group of PFCs called perfluorinated chemicals.","And they are all man-made materials and the issue comes in is that they are, as you said, firefighting foam, Teflon. It comes for the even Stainmaster things that repel grease and water and it's been used for decades. And so, what is happened is, as we get into the water source of the environment that it just stays and it's consumed by humans, it just doesn\u2019t get release from the body for years and years. And that's where the concern is coming.","So this is a very serious issue. We applaud all of the different states as well as the EPA for making this a priority already. We actually see this is a very good thing. We are very supportive of all of the actions being taken on the PFCs in our different states, and we really want to be part of being the solutions provider for those and see it as a strength given all the research and actual deployment we've done on how to decontaminate these, out of water supplies.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jonathan Reeder with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Jonathan Reeder","I wanted to echo everyone's remarks when they congrats on the retirement decision. I know you're going to have fun through the rest of your live as you have been while at American Water Works. And I think I understand how it's an easy personal decision for you to make. Then last point, I thought when Susan was saying for the first time American Water Works history and have just been talking about Corvette. I thought she was going to say there was a new Corvette waiting for you in the parking lot. Maybe they don't like you that much, I don\u2019t know.","Linda Sullivan","I was hoping that too Jonathan, but it didn't happen.","Jonathan Reeder","It is okay, yes. So anyway, Susan, just want to ask you, in light of the recent rate case outcome, how do you think about West Virginia in terms of the inner core state for you? I know in some pretty good rate cases there, they were challenging outcomes plus kind of the way -- the Freedom even was treated, seem less than kind of equitable to you guys. So just wondering how you do West Virginia today?","Susan Story","So, West Virginia, first of all for those of who ever been there, it's a beautiful state and we had been in West Virginia since 1880. And the last two rate case outcomes we've had, including a settlement, I mean this was a settlement reach without parties. We were very constructive because in West Virginia, there's a realization you know maybe as much as any other state about the importance of clean water and safe water. And it's not just an issue for American Water, the public providers of water there and wastewater services see the same thing.","So, we have some wonderful employees in West Virginia. We have some outstanding customers in West Virginia and we're very excited that there is a growing realization from all of the parties to stakeholders as well as the regulatory commission about the importance of investment for the future to ensure that that state can continue to grow economically and have a safe water, wastewater and fire protection system for its citizens.","Linda Sullivan","And Jonathan, I'll add to that as well, as you know, West Virginia now has a decent mechanism as well for continuing investment in the state. And as part of our settlement of the rate case, they authorized a 9.75% ROE, which is the same that we had in the last case. But they also increased the equity ratio from 45.84% to 48.4%, so really showing that the need for attracting capital to the state.","Jonathan Reeder","Good stuff. Glad things are improving there for sure. Linda, did you quantify what the weather impact, the headwind was in Q1 '19 then? I mean I know it's huge and not overly sensitive, but\u2026","Linda Sullivan","Yes, we did not have any, any really at all weather impact in the first quarter.","Jonathan Reeder","Okay, I thought, I heard you say that that was a bit of a headwind, sorry about that. And then, I also kind of missed what you said was driving the expected 1% improvement from your prior forecast and the 2023 debt to total cap ratio going to 61 to 52. What were the drivers there?","Linda Sullivan","So, it was really kind of refining -- our estimates are actual, came in much better than we thought for 2018, and we also have had a very, very strong, strong focus on cash flow management.","Jonathan Reeder","Okay, okay, alright, well thank you very much and enjoy the future, I know you will.","End of Q&A","Susan Story","Thanks Jonathan. And that's the last question and we thank you all for participating in our call today. Please note that we value you as our investor owners, and as a financial analyst, who research our company for the benefit of your clients and their futures. We also want to be open and transparent in all of our discussions and dealings with all of you, so that you can have confidence in your decisions around our company and investments in our stock.","If we have not been able to address your question or you have additional questions, please call Ed and Ralph, and they will be happy to help.

Mr. Panagos, you may begin.","Greg Panagos","Thank you, Frank and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for today's call.","We'll do our best to keep the call to about an hour. At the end of our prepared remarks, we'll open the call up for your questions.","As Gary said, my name is Greg Panagos, and I'm the new Vice President of Investor Relations for American Water. Before I read you our forward-looking statements, I would just like to say I'm happy to be here and excited about the opportunity with American Water. Before I read you our forward-looking statement I'd like to say I'm happy to be here and excited about the opportunity with American Water.","During the course of this conference call, both in our prepared remarks and in answer to your questions, we may make statements related to future performance. Our statements represent reasonable estimates and assumptions. However, these statements deal with future events. They are subject to numerous risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual performance of American Water to be materially different from the performance indicated or implied by such statements.

Also reconciliation tables for non-GAAP financial information discussed on this conference call can be found in the appendix of the slide deck for the call, which is located at the Investor Relations page of the Company website.","We'll be happy to answer any questions or provide further clarification if needed during our question-and-answer session. All statements in this call related to earnings and earnings per share refer to diluted earnings and earnings per share from continuing operations.","And now I would like to turn the call over to American Waters' President and CEO, Susan Story.","Susan Story","Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us. With me today are Linda Sullivan, our CFO, who will go over the third quarter financial results and Walter Lynch, our COO and President of Regulated Operations, who will give key updates on our regulated business.","Turning to Slide 5, we reported earnings of $0.96 per share for the third quarter, a 10.3% increase above the third quarter of 2014. Excluding the 2014 cost impact of the Freedom Industries' chemical spill, third quarter year-to-date adjusted earnings increased 9.4% compared to the same period in 2014.","Our employees continue to deliver strong operational and financial results reflected in our ongoing investment in our infrastructure, our improved operational efficiencies and the expansion of customers in our regulated and market based businesses.","These results continue our progress toward achieving our long-term growth goal of 7% to 10% EPS through 2019. Based on our performance today, we're narrowing our earnings guidance range to $2.60 to $2.65 per share.","Slide 6 highlights the progress we're making on our strategies across our businesses. We invested $970 million in capital year-to-date through September. The majority of this investment is in our regulated business, which is the core and foundation of our growth.","These investments are mainly for infrastructure to continue providing safe, clean and reliable water services for our customers. Walter will talk further about our ongoing O&M efficiency efforts, which allow us to mitigate build increases to our customers despite this critically needed capital investment.","In addition, we continue to invest in regulated acquisitions. Year-to-date, we closed seven acquisitions totaling or adding about 19,200 customers and we have 16 pending acquisitions, which when approved and closed will give us the opportunity to serve an additional 13,300 customers in several of our jurisdictions.","We closed the Keystone Clearwater Solutions acquisition in the third quarter. Keystone, while a separate subsidiary is being reported as part of market-based businesses. Last month we were very pleased to be awarded a contract to serve the military community at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.","We now serve 12 military installations across the country. We consider it an honor to provide our service men and women and their families with reliable high quality water and wastewater services for the next five decades and beyond.","Our Homeowner Services business continues to grow as well. Within the past couple of weeks, we received a Notice of Intent to award an exclusive contract with Georgetown County Water and Sewer District in South Carolina. Pending contract negotiations we should be able to offer programs to their 22,000 eligible homeowners.","Looking forward, we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our long-term earnings per share growth goal of 7% to 10% through 2019. At the end of our prepared remarks, I'll spend just a few minutes talking about our regulated business and how our investments and our positive financial performance demonstrate our customers and the communities we're privileged to serve.","And with that, Walter will now give an update on our regulated businesses.","Walter Lynch","Thanks Susan and good morning, everyone.","As Susan mentioned, our regulated business have delivered strong results year-to-date. We continue to improve our owned and efficiency ratio as shown on Slide 8. We reached 35.8% for the 12 months ending September 2015.","This is the result of a disciplined approach to cost management by our employees. We continue to make steady progress towards achieving our goal of 34% or less by 2020. Achieving sustainable O&M reductions is important to our strategy as it enables us to redeploy these cost savings in the capital investments in our water and wastewater infrastructure with minimal impact on our customer\u2019s bills.","A perfect example of our strategy and action as our recent New Jersey rate case order on Slide 9. During the third quarter, the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities approved the 3% or $22 million annualized increase in water and wastewater revenues that became effective on September 21.","Since the last rate case in 2012, the company invested more than $775 million to replace and upgrade our water and wastewater infrastructure including approximately 160 miles of water mains and connection pipes.","During the same time, New Jersey American lowered their operating expenses by more than $90 million. Those cost reductions supported more than $125 million of infrastructure investment with no impact on customer bills.","Also last week in Virginia we filed a rate request for $8.7 million. The request seeks recovery of about $53 million in system investments made since our last rate case in 2012. Our operating expenses in Virginia have declined 2% since our last rate case reflecting our continued success in driving operating efficiencies.","We use those cost savings to offset some of the revenue requirement requested for our capital improvement, which again minimizes rate impacts on our customers. We expect the decision in the next nine months.","When we talk about owned and efficiency improvement, this is exactly what we mean, inventing to ensure reliable service while limiting the impact of when our customers pay.","Moving to California, our team continues to display leadership in dealing with the draught and we\u2019re certainly proud of all of their work to help our customers during this period.","Overall five of our six districts are meeting the State Water Resources Control Board reduction targets. In venture accounting where customers are almost meeting their targets, we recently implemented Stage 3 conservation measures.","These measures along with other customer outreach is helping us encourage conservation during this draught and we want to thank our customers in California who really stepped up to the challenge.","I'll give a quick update on our Monterey Peninsula Water Supply Project as well. Last month the California Coastal Commission approved an amendment to our permits to operate a test line well. This minor amendment allowed us to restart the well and continue to prove up the operational feasibility of subsurface intakes for this water supply project.","The project is undergoing environmental and regulatory review by the California Public Utility Commission and we expect to start construction in the second quarter of 2017.","Lastly let me discuss the weather impacts during the quarter. As we mentioned in our second quarter call, we experienced heavy rainfall in our central states during July. We saw this pattern continue in that region through August.","Also in the quarter we experienced hot and dry conditions primarily in our northeast region. Due to our geographic diversity, these varying weather conditions largely offset each other in the third quarter, so there was no net material impact on our financials.","Now I'll turn the call over to Linda for more detail on our third quarter financial results.","Linda Solomon","Thank you, Walter and good morning, everyone.","In the third quarter, we continue to deliver strong financial results. As shown on Slide 11, revenues were up 6% quarter-over-quarter and up 4% year-to-date. Earnings per share for the third quarter were $0.96, up 10% over the same period last year.","Year-to-date earnings were $2.09 per share, which after adjusting for 2014 impact of the Freedom Industries chemical spill were up about 9% over the same period last year. In terms of business segment contribution, for the quarter the regulated businesses contributed earnings of $0.97 per share or an increase of about 10%.","Our market base businesses contributed $0.07 per share, an increase of about 17%. Parent interest and other, which is primarily interest expense on parent debt was a negative $0.08 per share for the quarter, relatively flat to the prior year.","As Susan mentioned because of the Keystone acquisition in the third quarter and the financial results of Keystone have been included in the market base business segment, the purchase price after purchase price adjustments was $133 million.","As we\u2019ve previously disclosed, we expect Keystone to be earnings neutral in 2015 and accretive to earnings in the first full year of operation.","Now I\u2019ll go over the different components of our third quarter earnings per share growth as shown on Slide 12. In the third quarter, we reported a $0.09 increase in earnings per share. Approximately, $0.05 of that increase was due to mild weather during the third quarter of 2014.","As Walter mentioned, during the third quarter of this year, the financial impact of the varying weather conditions largely offset each other. As we had higher revenue of around $10 million from hot and dry conditions in the Northeast, which was offset by lower revenue of around the same amount from the wet weather experienced in our Central State.","Next the regulated businesses benefited from higher revenues of $0.04 per share mainly from authorized rate increases, from infrastructure charges and rate cases in a number of our regulated states and additional revenue from acquisition growth, partially offset by lower demand in California.","For the market-based businesses, earnings per share were up a penny due to additional construction projects under our military contracts and the addition of two new military bases in the second half of 2014.","We also had contract growth in our Homeowner Services business. Partially offsetting these improvements were higher depreciation and other cost of about a $0.01 per share mainly due to growth associated with our infrastructure investment programs at the regulated businesses.","Now let me cover the regulatory highlights on Slide 13. We currently have three general rate cases in process, West Virginia, Missouri and Virgina for a combined annualized rate request of approximately $69.5 million.","For rates effective since October 1 of last year through today, we received a total of approximately $77.5 million in additional annualized revenue from general rate cases, step increases and infrastructure charges. We encourage you to review the footnotes in the appendix for more information.","Slide 14 is a summary dashboard of our financial performance, which showed improvement across the Board. During the third quarter of 2015, we made investments of approximately $455 million, primarily for regulated infrastructure investments and the acquisition of Keystone Clear Water Solutions.","Year-to-date we have invested a total of $970 million of which $793 million was for regulated infrastructure investments and $44 million was for regulated acquisitions. For the year, we expect to invest $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion with almost $1.2 billion to improve our regulated water and wastewater systems.","Regulated infrastructure investments are projected to be about $100 million higher than we originally planned as we continue to optimize capital deployment under our infrastructure mechanisms.","For the quarter our cash flow from operations increased approximately $48 million and year-to-date $15 million primarily from earnings growth and the timing of working capital item.","Our adjusted return on equity for the past 12 months was 9.12%, an increase of approximately 48 basis points compared to the same period last year. We also paid a $0.34 quarterly cash dividend to our shareholders in September, which represented about a 10% increase compared to last year.","And on October 30, the Board of Directors approved a $0.34 dividend per share to be paid on December 1 and as Susan explained, building on our strong financial performance year-to-date we're narrowing our 2015 earnings guidance from continuing operations to be in the upper end of our prior range or $2.60 to $2.65 per share.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Susan.","Susan Story","Thanks Linda.","Before taking your questions, I\u2019d like to spend a few minutes talking about how our investments and our strong performance benefit our customers and the communities we serve.","As Linda mentioned we planned to invest up to $1.4 billion in 2015 with almost $1.2 billion of that total to improve our regulated water and wastewater systems. So what is investing more than a $1 billion a year mean to our customers and communities?","It means we replace up to 350 miles of pipe every year. To give you an idea of the size of our water pipe network if you placed all the pipes we manage end to end, it would stretch over 48,000 miles nearly enough to go around the earth twice.","It also means a strong water quality record. We are 20 times better than the industry average for meeting all drinking water requirements and we've earned more awards from the EPA partnership for safe water than any other water utility in the Nation.","Why does this matter? Even though we serve about 15 million people across the country, we never forget that at the end of every pot line, there is a family depending on us to provide life's most essential ingredient.","Not only as investment in our water and wastewater system is critical to families, businesses, industry and fire protection, but that investment also provides jobs and economic benefit.","According to the Water Research Foundation, $1 billion invested in water infrastructure creates approximately 16,000 jobs. So American Water's regulated infrastructure investment through 2019 will result in more than 80,000 new jobs in the communities we serve. We know that we have to be sensitive to the impact of cost increases to our customers, even for something as necessary as infrastructure replacement.","We also know as Walter mentioned that for every dollar we save, we can invest $6 of capital with no impact on our customer build. By combining effective cost controls with regulatory mechanisms that smooth cost out, we can make a big infrastructure impact without a big bill impact.","In fact, we've invested almost $700 million nationally in our basic type programs in just 2013 and 2014 and all of that investment impacted customer build by just $1 almost on average. That's less than the cost of a loaf of bread, a cord of milk and far less than what it cost you to get your own money from a general ATM machine, which is about $3 to $4 a transaction.","Across our footprint, most of our customers still pay about a penny per gallon of water. Our average family pays a little over $2 a day for all of their water needs, which is literally a ton of water a day delivered directly to their sink, their showers and their washing machine.","At the end of the day, we know that what we do in our customer's long term best interest will also be in our investor's long term interest and we never lose that focus.","So with that, we're happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, ma'am. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Ryan Connors from Boenning & Scattergood. Please go ahead.","Susan Story","Good morning, Ryan.","Ryan Connors","Good morning, Susan. I had a question on the rate case in New Jersey. You've got $22 million in new rates there which is about -- I guess about a third of the $66 million you requested. Obviously, that's a very crude metric that I guess maybe gets too much attention sometimes.","But that does seem to continue a trend where the gap between asked and received rates has been kind of growing. Can you just talk about why that's happening and what the ramifications of that are for the business?","Walter Lynch","Yes Ryan, Walter here. Thanks for the question. Just to put a little clarification on it, the last time we filed a rate case in New Jersey, we didn't have a disc mechanism. So in this case, the disc mechanism is included but you have to look to the revenue that was generated from it.","If you do that and include the $22 million we came in, in excess of 50% of our filing. So that's the difference. We invested as Susan said, a significant amount of money in New Jersey and in our infrastructure and when you include that, with the outcome of the rate case, again we're in excess of 50%. So it's right in line where we've been historically.","Ryan Connors","I see. So the national trend then would be a function of the fact that D6 are becoming more and more prevalent.","Walter Lynch","Absolutely.","Ryan Connors","Okay. Interesting. My other question was there were some fairly notable development yesterday with one of your peers California basically saying that they're going to have to defer revenue recognition in the fourth quarter because WRAM balances are increasing.","I know you've had your own issues having to extend the collection period on your own WRAM balance, can you talk about the situation in California related to the WRAM and the outlook and also maybe give us your take not only on how that impacts your business, but where you see the regulatory evolution going, whether the draught creates any change in the regulatory situation in California?","Linda Solomon","Ryan, this is Linda. Let me start and talk first about the accounting issues around revenue recognition. So the accounting rules require that if revenue is extended -- collection of revenue is extended beyond two years that you need to defer the equity component or the equity return of that revenue. And so this is really an accounting timing issue versus a collection issue.","We did experience something similar in the third quarter when we requested and filed our application with the CPC to defer recovery in Monterey over a 20-year period and including a return. We have recorded that impact in our third quarter results and it was about a $5 million pretax impact.","Now in terms of the regulatory environment, I\u2019ll start and ask Susan if she would like to add to it, but really decoupling mechanisms were put into place in California to deal with situations like the severe draught the California is going through now so that you can align the customer conservation with the goals of the company and so these decoupling mechanisms really align these goals and allow us to help our customers and serve in the long term.","Susan Story","Right, and I think Linda is exactly right. The only thing I would add is this is an extraordinary situation in California and we all know that and we believe -- we know that the Utility Commission, the companies were all trying to work together to find a way forward that's in the best interest of our customers and the companies and everyone involved.","Ryan Connors","And then while we're on California, one last one if I might sneak it in is that on the terms of return on equity you're at 9.99 in California. Most of you appears are at 9.47 because you stood at the automatic downward adjustment duty or credit rating situation there, but the credit standing continues to improve.","So is there any chance that you could be re-trued up or trued down to that level and talk about how that mechanism works and the ROE outlook for California thanks.","Susan Story","Absolutely, we're at 9.99 in that mechanism in its current formal extent through the end of 2016 and then we would go through the next profit capital process in California to reset rates going forward.","Ryan Connors","Got it. Okay. Thanks for your time.","Operator","And our next question comes from Richard Verdi from Ladenburg Thalmann. Please go ahead sir.","Richard Verdi","Good morning, everyone and nice quarter and thanks for taking my call here.","Just a quick follow-up question to Ryan I enter my question. The Pence or the New Jersey rate case outcome in combination with the D6, Walter you had mentioned it's in excess of 50%. We have that around 54.6%, does that sound about right?","Walter Lynch","Yes that sounds about right Rich. Pretty precise.","Richard Verdi","Okay, perfect. Okay and then Susan a quick question for you surrounding the acquisition strategy. Somewhat recently you were quoted saying American is going to ramp up its focus on the wastewater acquisition front. So can you just maybe talk a little bit about how you see this benefiting American Water?","Susan Story","Sure. I'll start and then Walter may want to add something to it. So one of the things that's interesting and I know the national numbers are about 84% of Waters provided by public entities and about 98% of wastewater is and what we find Rich is that of a 3.3 million metered customers we have that only about 150,000 of those are wastewater customers.","So we know that we've got several communities around the country where we already serve water and someone else serves wastewater. So that\u2019s one piece and then you add to that the fact that there is growing number of EPA consent decrees, you got an issue where a lot of the wastewater infrastructure is aging and needs investment and you have some community who would prioritize other needed critical investments above their wastewater.","So far us the real value is in many of these places we already served water. So to serve wastewater we know the communities. They know us. There are efficiencies we can gain because we already have offices there even though you would have different people doing some of the work. So we think it's just a natural progression.","Then on top of that you add the fact that we just talked about California. When you look at water, it really is a single one-cycle for water and in the past, where we separated portable water with stormwater and wastewater, those days are -- they're starting to merge.","So we believe that as the leading water utility in the country, we want to a leadership role in looking at water as one water from start to finish and especially given our strength in our research and development efforts that we got on the whole water cycle.","Walter Lynch","Yes, Walter here. Just to emphasize the operational synergies. We already have offices. We have relationships. We have employees that are proving service to our customers. To us it makes too much sense not to engage on a wastewater side and that's what we've been doing and we're getting really positive feedback in those communities where we do provide both services.","Richard Verdi","Excellent. Okay. And next, thinking about the Water Infrastructure Protection Act recently implemented in New Jersey, clearly that's a great outcome for American and Americans performed well from that Act and now Chairman [indiscernible] in Pennsylvania implement something similar.","So if Pennsylvania does when considering that both New Jersey and Pennsylvania in this situation will have attractive legislation, do you think that it may eventually result in the American Water middle region representing more than 50% of its current, where that currently or do you think you would try to exploit that Pennsylvania move, but then grow in other state to maintain that diversified geographic footprint?","Susan Story","I'll start and Walter may want to add. So number one, we value very mach our geographical diversity and how we do look to grow in Pennsylvania and New Jersey, we're also looking to grow in the Midwest for example where we have a significant presence.","So we do think this legislation and Walter and his folks have been key at proving research and information for those policymakers who are looking at different options to improve the economy in their areas.","We think that it's important to have good legislation everywhere and we think it's good for the citizens and the people who are consumers of water and wastewater.","Walter Lynch","Yes, with those definitely are huge plus to accelerate acquisitions in New Jersey. If we get that in Pennsylvania, it will provide the same benefit, but we also have enabling legislation in many of our other states including many Midwestern states and some of this was tailored after the legislation we had in our Midwest states.","So it looks very, very favorable in the Northeast, but we have the same favorable regulation in the Midwest.","Richard Verdi","Okay. Great. Thank you for that color guys and last one for me, looking at the non-regulated side, in our view we see that Keystone acquisition is just a super move, that's a great move from our view. Is there anything else like that in the pipeline or maybe better put, can you give us -- just give us an update on the non-regulated position driven strategy there?","Susan Story","Sure. So first of all fundamentally there is two things I want to say is that when we go into the market based businesses, we ensure that it leverages the core competencies that we have as a company.","We're not going to be going at two and three steps beyond what our core competencies are, which is water, wastewater, stormwater, those type of efforts. So I just want to make sure people understand that clearly.","The second thing is as we said in our last earnings call, the market based businesses, which include all of the American Water enterprises lines of business and Keystone, we will not -- we don't see that growing beyond 15% to 20% of earnings and only towards the high end of that if it's regulated like in the military services. So I just want to say that's it's on.","So in terms of opportunities, again we're going to stick to our netting, stay close to our core competencies, where there are opportunities to number one leverage the expertise we have in water, wastewater, water treatment, infrastructure investment, those type of things we will look at, but we also look at the risk profile of anything we do because we are extremely cognizant and dedicated to let our core we're a regulated utility and we want to ensure that any growth we have is smart growth.","Richard Verdi","Okay. Great. Thank you Susan. I appreciate the guys and great quarter once again.","Susan Story","Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Next question comes from Michael Gaugler from Janney Montgomery Scott. Please go ahead.","Michael Gaugler","Good morning, everyone.","Susan Story","Good morning, Mike.","Michael Gaugler","Just a couple of things. I would appreciate an update on the potential headquarter move and the timing implications in terms of the tax breaks and then also your thought on Keystone Clear Water now that you've been in that business for a bit.","Linda Solomon","Mike, this is Linda. Let me start with the move to Camden. We're currently in the site selection process and we\u2019re continuing through that process. We\u2019re working to make sure that we have all of the tax issues handled appropriately with the City of Camden and we are very excited to be part of the revitalization of Camden.","On Keystone, so everyone of course on the call is aware that there are market conditions on oil and gas and of course from the negative side from the market is that, the activity in the capital spending has been reduced somewhat.","The number of rigs are down and again in the Marcellus and Utica interestingly while we have the cheapest cost for natural gas drillers that also require more water we know that there is an issue for the supply actually to take away capacity. So from the market issues that everyone is familiar with, we also are tracking this. We\u2019re tracking it with the business.","We also are very encouraged and we're following very closely the progression of the construction of the takeaway pipes because we believe that whenever the takeaway pipeline are completed, that that is where and I know that all of you know this, where we\u2019ll see a resurgence in that particular area of the country for natural gas.","And with that said, since we have bought Keystone and since we closed in July, there are some positives that are going on for us. Number one, it\u2019s interesting that as several of the ENP are looking at the current situation, they're also looking at water infrastructure that will be needed for the resurgence that is expected at the end of '16 and into '17.","So we\u2019re in conversations looking at future activity, because there is a time period that we need to develop water infrastructure, which is critical for most of these wells.","Another thing that we see is that there are some near term opportunities with the ENPs continuing to prioritize their capital for their core business, there is more of an interest of us taking a role into water infrastructure and water pipeline including owning it which would be a little longer term in some of the contracts that currently have.","Looking at construction ownership of storage and exchange facilities and not just pipeline and we\u2019re seeing that there is a renewed interest as the ENPs have a goal of 100% water reuse and recycling.","So we do the transports and we\u2019re seeing really a pre-robust business on the transport to the recycling facilities to ensure extremely high levels of reuse and recycling.","And then another positive that we\u2019ve seen in the almost six months we've owned Keystone is that, they are increasing their customer base significantly with the addition of several new large customers and we've calculated that our market share of the water services in the Utica, Marcellus has increased from about 20% to 25%.","So yes it\u2019s a difficult environment as we know, but being a water focused subsidiary of ours looking at solutions for that area we\u2019re seeing some bright spots for us and we continue to, we said earlier when we purchased Keystone, we expect it to be EPS neutral in 2015 and to be accretive next year as Linda mentioned.","Michael Gaugler","All right. Thanks","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Follow up question from Richard Verdi from Ladenburg Thalmann. Please go ahead.","Richard Verdi","Hi guys, thanks for letting me back in. Just a question on -- just a follow-up to Michael\u2019s inquiry surrounding Keystone, this might be a tough question right, I am just curious to see what the take is, when you look at the frac sand guys or the oilfield services players, it\u2019s up in the air when that energy space is going to recover.","Some say it's going to be -- we might see a bottom in Q1 and then improvement back into '15. Some others say it won't even be until '17, whether its improvement. But it sound like what you just said you expect it to be accretive in '15.","So I am kind of wondering, one, what maybe your outlook is there for, what may be Keystone's outlook is for energy space and maybe what you guys are doing differently to ensure that that's one of the expense in 2016.","Susan Story","Rich, thank you for this and so on December the 15 at our Analyst Day the CEO of Keystone Ned Wehler who has been in the business for years, he is actually going to be part of our Investor day presentation and he is going to offer his insights that will give an additional month to see where everything is playing out.","Again I think we can say some things now, but I think it would be better to wait till Investor Day and really talk to the expert. We're looking at a lot of different options. We're trying to be very practical and realistic, which is why in answer to Mike's question, I wanted to give both the positives but also the things we're very cautionary about.","And so it will be interesting. We do have some thoughts at this time, but on December 15, we fully expect that question to be asked and from there to give his thoughts about that.","Richard Verdi","Okay. All right. Fair enough. Thank you, Susan.","Operator","And our next question comes from Ryan Connors from Boenning & Scattergood. Please go ahead.","Ryan Connors","Great. Thanks also for letting me in and again to figure out coming with one more I have since there is time, so rising interest rate environment that we're likely to enter into here that's starting to raise rates, obviously there are various commission look at benchmark rates as a proxy for risk free and there is interest in theory, that's a positive tailwind for ROEs.","How does that impact what you do when you're asking -- when you're filing rate cases and what you're asking for an ROE? Do you start to reflect that into higher requests for ROE as the Fed is getting ready to raise rates or talk to us about that dynamic?","Linda Solomon","Yes Ryan, this is Linda and generally what we have seen with regard to past trends is that as interest rate rise then over time that is correlated with increases in the return on equity and so I would expect that moving forward to the extent that interest rates improve that we would see similar trends.","Ryan Connors","Okay. But you used to say that goal to actually -- where do you start building that into what you're asking for? Is that coming later or is that something you've started to do right here as we're sort of getting ready to enter into rising rate environment?","Linda Solomon","Right Ryan and really what we will do, typically most of our states have the cost of capital as part of the general rate case profit and so we would be looking across our states and determining the optimal time to go in for general rate case.","We also have some states that have a separate cost of capital mechanism like California which has a set schedule, which we would be -- which is set through 2016 and then we would be setting new rates for 2017.","So it will depend on the jurisdiction and it will also depend on a multitude of factors that we look at in terms of the timing of our general rate case filings.","Ryan Connors","Interesting, well thanks for that.","Linda Solomon","Absolutely.","Susan Story","Thanks Ryan.","Greg Panagos","Operator, do we have any more questions? Operator, are you there?","Linda Solomon","Maybe he is experiencing some technical.","Susan Story","Yeah, we can't hear anything. If you can hear us, we can't hear you.","Operator","Pardon me, the next person to ask a question is David Paz of Wolfe Research.","Susan Story","Okay. Great, hi David.","David Paz","Good morning.","Susan Story","David, that's quite a dramatic kind of intro to your question.","David Paz","Yeah, you can take credit for that one, but you may have actually just one of my questions on California, but just can you remind me when the cost of capital proceeding and where ended?","Susan Story","The cost of capital proceeding will be filed in the beginning of 2016, so about March of 2016.","David Paz","Okay. And if you -- it was extended once before correct?","Susan Story","That's correct and it's extended through the end of 2016. We actually begin the filing in the first quarter of 2016 for cost of capital affected in 2017.","David Paz","Right and just remind me, were there any changes to the mechanism when you extended it this last time versus the original I guess agreement?","Susan Story","No, it was extended in its current forms.","David Paz","Okay. And is there any chance for you guys to extend that another year, given that not much has changed on the rate side?","Susan Story","We're always looking at opportunities so that -- and working with the Commission on these types of things as well as the other investor owned utilities in California.","David Paz","Okay. Separately this year have you announced any new large regulated projects like water treatment plants or the like that, that were incremental to the plan you gave last year?","Walter Lynch","This is Walter, no, no, it\u2019s has been in line with what we've said last year. We just continue to upgrade our plants as part of our normal capital investment but no new plants in line.","David Paz","Okay. And you'll give a 2016, 2020 capital plan in December.","Walter Lynch","That\u2019s correct.","David Paz","Great. Thank you so much.","Susan Story","Thanks David.","Operator","And this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks.","Susan Story","Thank you, Frank. We would like to thank everyone for participating in our call today. And as always if you have any questions, please call Greg or Durgesh and they\u2019ll be happy to help.","Before I let you go, I've mentioned it during the Q&A, I would like to remind you all that we\u2019re hosting our Investor Day at the Western Times Square in New York on December the 15 from 9 AM until noon. We will have a light breakfast beforehand and lunch available for afterword. So it is not the program that attracts you, hopefully the food will.","We will be discussing our plan for 2016 to 2020. We'll have added color around 2016. You'll hear updates and projections for our regulated business from Walter as he has already said. An update from Sharon Carmen on our plans for the American Water Enterprise's lines of business, homeowner services, military services and contract services.","And as I mentioned before, you'll hear from the CEO of Keystone, Ned Wehler who is going to offer his insight into that business and the market, and of course Linda will provide updates on our financial plans.","We hope all of you can attend.

[Operator Instructions]","I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Ed Vallejo, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Vallejo, you may begin.","Edward Vallejo","Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to American Water's 2012 First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At the end of our prepared remarks, we will have time for questions. Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that during the course of this conference call, both in our prepared remarks and in answers to your questions, we may make statements related to future performance. Our statements represent our most reasonable estimate. However, since these statements deal with future events, they are subject to numerous risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual performance of American Water to be materially different from the performance indicated or implied by such statements. Such risk factors are set forth in the company's SEC filings. ","Now I'd like to turn the call over to American Water's President and CEO, Jeff Sterba.","Jeffry E. Sterba","Thanks, Ed. Good morning, everyone, and I appreciate you joining us today. Ellen Wolf, our Chief Financial Officer, will join me in our comments this morning. Also with us here are Walter Lynch, who heads our Regulated Operations; and Kellye Walker, our Chief Administrative Officer and General Counsel.","It's a pleasure to report on another quarter of success in both our financial performance and the execution of our strategic plans. On Slide 5, you can see we delivered strong first quarter results with a quarter-over-quarter increase in earnings from continuing operations of more than 20% to approximately $49 million or $0.28 per share. This was fueled by an almost 4% growth in revenue while total operations and maintenance expenses were held flat to the same quarter last year. ","In our regulated segment, increased revenue driven by implementation of rate case decisions in a number of our states and reduced O&M costs improved our O&M efficiency ratio by about 280 basis points quarter over quarter. Now you will also notice that it shows consolidated cash flow from operations decline of about 8%. This is attributable to timing changes in working capital. ","These financial results are due to our focus on investing resources in capital in areas where we can drive value for customers and the company as well as our focus on continuous process improvement that's ongoing throughout the business.","Financial results are obviously important, that's what we all are here to talk about. But their sustainability, I think, has a lot to do with how we serve customers and whether they think they are getting good value for the price. Like most companies, we survey our customers to understand their overall satisfaction with us and they're perception of service of quality and I thought you may be interested in how we're faring on this front. In the most recent survey, which was done in the last 30 to 45 days, 94% of our customers responded in the satisfied categories concerning their overall satisfaction with American Water during the past 12 months. And among customers who had specific service contact with us, almost 90% were either extremely or very satisfied. We take these measures and the confidence our customers place in us seriously, particularly as investment in facilities critical to providing service to our customers could cause us upward pressure on rates. ","Our capital investments directly benefit our customers to improve reliability. And we've increased our efforts to help customers understand these investments and the associated benefits that come from having reliable water service such as fire protection, quality water and wastewater treatment in the economic vitality of the towns that they live in.","We're also levering technology to help us serve our customers better. For example, we recently upgraded our call management system, which has significantly improved call handling performance. And while substantive improvement to our customer outreach and online service capabilities is tied to the implementation of our new CIS system next year, we have improved our web self-service application and it's seeing a more than 65% increase in a number of customer-initiated web-based transactions over the last year. This enables us to meet customer needs more effectively and also at lower costs. ","Turning to Slide 7. Let me highlight just a few other key accomplishments of this quarter. As you know, we have now closed the previous announced portfolio optimization transactions, which have added about 55,000 customers in Missouri and New York and generated more than $510 million of cash, which can more effectively to be deployed in the 16 states in which we now have regulated operations. So far in 2012, 2 rate cases have been filed and cases in 5 states has been resolved, providing an annualized revenue increase of over $62 million. The most recent decision came a couple of days ago in New Jersey, where the New Jersey BPU approved the stipulated agreement in that rate case, as well as approved the distribution system improvement charges for the state.","We also received 2 proposed decisions in California that are of significance. One is on the revenue requirement for our general rate case for 2012 through '14, and the second one is the cost recovery of the San Clemente Dam removal proposal. Both of these recommendations still require final commission action, which we hope will be forthcoming soon after comments have been filed by all the parties have to be out for comment for 30 days before the commission can take final action. We view these recommended decisions as generally constructive but there are some points that need clarification with the commission.","Lastly, I know there's been talk about dry weather in the media lately. We've assessed our reservoirs and other sources of supply and at this time, are comfortable where we are with virtually full reservoirs and our supply sources. But as always, we'll assess our supply on a continuing basis as we go forward.","With that said, let me turn the call over to Ellen to delve into our financial performance in more detail.","Ellen C. Wolf","Thank you very much, Jeff, and good morning to those of you who are listening to our first quarter 2012 earnings conference call. Jeff has just reviewed with you some of the key highlights for the quarter, all built around our commitment to ensure reliable service to our customers and results to our shareholders. I am now going to take a few minutes to describe in more detail the drivers of our results for the first quarter. As always, additional details can be found on our 10-Q, which we filed late yesterday afternoon with the SEC.","Now turning to Slide 9. As Jeff indicated, we produced solid financial results for the first quarter of 2012 with increases in revenue, net income and earnings per share, as well as continued improvement in our O&M efficiency ratio. These results were driven by our team's commitment to strategies that focused around the value of our customers, investing needed capital and controlling costs. ","For the first quarter ended March 31, we reported operating revenues of approximately $619 million, a $22 million or 3.7% increase over the approximately $597 million reported for the first quarter of 2011. Income from continuing operations for the first quarter was around $49 million or $0.28 per common share compared with around $41 million or $0.23 per common share in 2011, with both up over 20% year-over-year. Included in income and earnings per share for continuing operations, is an after-tax charge of about $1.4 million or $0.01, respectively, related to severance costs associated with our organizational realignment.","Net cash, as Jeff mentioned, provided by operating activities for the 3 months ended March 31, 2012, was $148 million compared to $161 million for the first quarter in '11. This again, is mainly due to the changes in the timing of working capital need. ","Now I'd like to turn the discussion to the various components of our income from continuing operations starting with revenue.","Revenues from our regulated business increased by a net of $13.6 million or 2.6% from March 31, '11 to '12, driven by new rates awarded and various surcharges granted by the regulators related to our continued investment in infrastructure. As of March 31, the 2012 impact of these rates increases, most of which were granted in 2011, was approximately $20 million. These increases were partially offset by decreased revenues of around $6 million, attributable to a decrease in overall demand of 1.5% in the first quarter of 2012 compared with the first quarter of '11. ","During the same period, our market-based operations revenues increased by $5.2 million or approximately 7%, primarily as a result of incremental capital project activity related to our military services contracts.","Now turning to Slide 11. As you all know, our ability to invest in our infrastructure is driven by our ability to earn appropriate rate of return on our investments. This slide shows rate cases that have been filed and are awaiting final order. As of May 2, we are awaiting final orders in 4 states, requesting additional annualized revenues of $101.5 million. There is, of course, no assurance that all or any portion thereof of any of the increases will be granted. ","During the first quarter of '12, we filed a general rate case in Virginia requesting additional annualized revenue of approximately $5.7 million. As a reminder, we anticipate filing a total of 4 rate cases in 2012.","Slide 12 shows rate cases and infrastructure charges that have been granted since the beginning of 2011. As of May 2, 2012, we've been granted additional annualized revenues from general rate cases totaling around $190 million and another $11 million in additional annualized revenues from infrastructure charges. The most recent rate case decision was just this week in New Jersey, where the commission approved a revenue increase of $30 million to be effective immediately. The outcome of this case balanced the requirement for our customers and shareholders by taking into account for the first part -- for the first time as part of our original filing, the decline in customer usage as well as our own efforts to control costs since that original filing back in July of 2010.","Turning our attention to water sales volumes. Total company sales volumes decreased quarter-over-quarter by 1.5%. During the first quarter, usage is generally not impacted by weather. The quarter-over-quarter decline we are seeing is in line with the 5-year demand usage trend. While we can never be completely sure of the reason for the declining usage, again at this time, it appears that for at least the residential decline of 1.7% that is related to concentration in more efficient water-related appliances.","I'd now like to take a few minutes to discuss our operating expenses. Total operating expenses, including depreciation, for the 2012 first quarter increased by $5.4 million or 1.2% from the 2011 first quarter. This increase includes a $7 million decrease in the regulated business operations and maintenance expense, offset partially by a $3.2 million increase in the market-based business expenses, mainly related to the increased revenues from our military contracts.","The regulated O&M decreased of approximately $7 million, the mild winter we experienced this year affected expenses by lowering our chemical usage due to lower water turbidity and by increasing our capitalized labor as more time was spent on replacing old pipes rather than fixing main breaks. Also employee-related expenses decreased due to employee vacancies and lower Orissa-based pension expense. And finally, included in the O&M expense for the first quarter was, as I mentioned earlier, a $2.4 million pretax severance charge again associated with organizational realignment. ","Overall, our O&M -- our regulated O&M efficiency ratio improved from 48% for the quarter ended March 31, 2011 to 45.3% for the quarter ended March 31, 2012. We continue to see improvement in this ratio quarter-over-quarter as we remain committed to cost containment and long-term margin improvements.","The results of the first quarter, as well as our rate case decision, allow us to reaffirm for you our 2012 ongoing earnings per share range of $1.90 to $2.","And with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Jeff for closing comments before opening it up for your questions.","Jeffry E. Sterba","Thanks, Ellen. Before taking questions, let me just close our discussion with the slide, remember that we presented this in January for the first -- this year on some of the things that we are striving to achieve in 2012, so you can track our progress. Now of course, that is all in addition to our target of earning $1.90 to $2 per share from continuing operations.","While it's still fairly early in 2012, good progress is being made on all of these fronts. And I won't go back over them because we've discussed most of them already today. We're making solid progress in getting declining use and other regulatory-like items recognized by regulators. Our continuous process improvement efforts are really starting to take hold, and we're seeing increased opportunities in both our regulated- and market-based segment for customer growth, all of which lead us to continue to believe in our long-term growth prospects of 7% to 10% per year. ","With the approximate 3% dividend yield, I believe we have committed to investors to providing a double-digit investment return under an investment thesis that's centered on investing in our country's structure. ","Lastly, just a reminder that we'll be holding our annual meeting here in Voorhees and also online through our virtual stockholder meeting on Friday, May 11, next Friday. So we welcome your participation.","And now, we'd be happy to take any questions you might have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Kevin Cole with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Kevin Cole - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Jeff, I guess, on your last comment, I guess, how should we think about the natural regulatory leg now with both Pennsylvania and New Jersey offering disc-like structures? As I know, traditionally, I've always though of it as -- so we have like a target ROE of, say, 105 and then we minus 100 to 125 basis points of holdco debt and then 100 to 150 basis points for regulatory lag. Where do you see that migrating towards?","Jeffry E. Sterba","Yes. I think the 150 basis points of regulatory lag is declining as we get discs in place and as we get declining usage built into place. Now obviously, the best approach is when you have an automatic adjustment mechanism. But in other states, like we've done in New Jersey, we have a future test year and then have forecasted 1 year forward in terms of consumption and then that's what's being put in. So by the time rates go into effect, they're recovering costs. You go 2 years and you start to still have more lag. So I think that 150 basis points is what we're trying to shrink. Do we ever get it to 0? Well, probably not. But if we can squeeze it down to 50 basis points, that's 100 basis points pickup. Plus in some of our jurisdictions, I'll use New York as an example, we have a dead band where we're allowed to earn above our allowed return for a little bit and then we start sharing excess, if there are any additional returns. So our goal is to drive it to 0. And we're not going to be satisfied til we get there. But you'll always have a little bit of friction. And on the parental debt, obviously, that percentage -- when I first came, it was about 125 basis points. It's already shrunk down to about 100 just because it's static and our total business is growing. And so that will continue to happen. But obviously, until something is done with that debt, it won't go to 0. It'll slowly migrate down to 75 basis points and lower.","Kevin Cole - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. You don't mind if I ask one more question. I noticed in some recent presentations, you've put in a new area charge, that kind depicts your 7% to 10% EPS growth, like the sources of that. And I guess, can you kind of talk about where you think we are in -- when I look at the X axis because over the short term, it depicts, say, half of EPS growth comes from ROE improvement. I think we have achieved a good chunk of that, right?","Jeffry E. Sterba","Yes.","Kevin Cole - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","In that way, you start going towards the right, it leans more into new services and then acquisitions?","Jeffry E. Sterba","Yes. We started using this, frankly, at the Analyst Day 1 year ago, a little over 1 year ago, February of 2011. And its purpose is to conceptually present and there's no specific timeline because, frankly, we're in different parts of that curve or different parts of each of these curves today. So for example, on the ROE improvement, frankly, we're making more progress than -- we're making faster progress. Here's the way I think about it long term. We are investing $800 million to $1 billion of CapEx a year. Call it a mid-point of $900 million. That $900 million is offset by depreciation of about $300 million. So that's a net rate-based addition of about $600 million. As you add that into our existing rate base, we're driving 6% to 7% growth in earnings just off that fundamental driver. And that does not include, for example, acquisitions, new services, the value of efficiencies that we build in because we think about the efficiency as really creating headroom of add this capital. So that's where we're comfortable with the 7% to 10% growth rate is it's basically given -- the baseline of that comes from the investment strategy. Now the key is, obviously, could we recover that? And that's why the focus on efficiency because it gives us that headroom. Remember though, one of the kind of rules of thumb that we talk about is $1 of O&M has the same impact on rates as $6 of capital. But that $6 of capital generates $0.30 of earnings for you. So that's the way we think and work on how do we drive operational efficiency to create headroom for capital growth.","Kevin Cole - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And one follow-up question for that. So with regards to the drift in equity needs, how big has the drift got and would you agree that through use of a drift into the NOL, it looks like you could be equity free from a long time?","Ellen C. Wolf","Let me first address the drift and employee stock purchases. Last year, they provided about $5 million worth of cash for the company. So they are not huge providers of cash. And year to date, we've seen about $700,000 that's come in for the first quarter. So again, we're not seeing them as large inputs. As we have said, there won't be equity offering. We don't foresee one in 2012 because we had around $450 million come in as it relates to Arizona and New Mexico and another $60 million that came in as a result of our acquisition of New York and divestiture of Ohio to on May 1. So we have sufficient cash to get through this year. And we have not yet talked about the future years. But again, we're continuing to see our equity ratio improved and I should note that for the first quarter, actually, we moved up to 43% equity. We were at 42% as of yearend.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions here. First is, Jeff, if you could talk about the way you're thinking about a potential dividend raise and your dividend payout as you think about the cash that's coming in from some of these asset sales.","Jeffry E. Sterba","Okay. Obviously, we think about dividend as efficient use of capital decision in terms of what can we invest to continue to build the business and what's an appropriate cash return. As you know, our payout ratio has now drifted below 50% because of our strong earnings growth. And what we're seeing, obviously, is our dividend growth has been about 5% but our earnings growth has been substantively higher than that. That's something we're taking a hard look at as to what that appropriate mix on a go-forward basis. I think when the first company first came public, I think we used the payout ratio of 50% to 70% as a guideline. Frankly, that's fairly broad. We're obviously, now even a little bit below that. So we're taking a look at what's appropriate going forward. I think you'll see from us a little more specific conversation relative to the dividend and what our policy is going forward as we move forward through a little more time this year.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And the second question relates to volumes here. At some point, you've got to think they're diminishing marginal returns of efficiency and changes in customer behavior, where all the easy gains have been won and the volume decreases associated with it will start to fade a little bit. How are you thinking about that? Or do you think that 1.5% that we saw in the first quarter is sustainable for a long period of time?","Ellen C. Wolf","What we're seeing is it's been sustainable for a long period of time. We would expect it to continue as a lot of the areas that we serve are older areas. And so over time, their homes continue to take out the older appliances and put in the newer appliances. We have seen it start to flatten only in a very, very few places. And again, as you talk about more water-efficient devices, we've now seen that move to the outdoors, so more watering devices have become more efficient as well. So I would expect that to continue for a while.","Jeffry E. Sterba","Yes, I'd agree, Neil. The big thing that Ellen hit on and this is one of the things that, I think, you'll see is on the irrigation side. More people have not just gone to drip irrigation but now, they're starting to use sensors. And so I think we'll continue to see -- I think to begin house stuff, yes, you hit a  point of diminishing returns. I think out of house that we probably see more potential for that. And that's why we're focused on making sure that we get appropriate mechanisms in place. At some point, does it level out? Yes, I would agree with you. But I don't think it's in the next -- we personally aren't expecting it in the next 3 to 5 years, let's say.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then the last question is on a quick update on the New Jersey rate case. When I looked at the final outcome here, a little bit of lower hit rate than we historically see versus your ask. Can you help us understand some of the components of the delta between the request and the final outcome?","Jeffry E. Sterba","Yes. I'm going to let Walter take that.","Walter J. Lynch","Yes. thanks, John. Yes, there are 2 real reasons. The final revenue requirement and the rate case showed a decrease in expenses from the original filing. And it was in our press release that we issued a couple days ago, that there's about $10 million less expenses in the filed revenue requirements than when the original filing occurred. And also, we've taken a more aggressive approach in our declining usage mechanism. The original filing, we filed for a 2-year look ahead to get the revenue recognition for that and in the settlement, in the $30 million, we got about 1 year of that. So that really explains some of the gap.","Jeffry E. Sterba","When you take a hard look through it, there's no capital that was disallowed. Costs were allowed. All of our operating costs, we got a 1-year forward look on declining usage. So in a sense, I think, making -- because some people will look just at the $98 million and the $30 million sale, you only got 1\/3. Well, that's not really the appropriate comparison because of the O&M change, which is really a savings and you bet we're going to pass it on to customers, as well as the way that we approached the declining usage caused the size of the increase to look much larger than, for example, it has in prior years.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Connors with Janney Montgomery Scott.","Timothy Feron - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","This is actually Tim Feron filling in for Ryan who's on the road. I just have another question on the New Jersey case. We obviously have the numbers, but I was just curious if the whole process was more or less contentious than in the past? And do you think the fact that the disk was attached to the case could have some effect on the ultimate award?","Jeffry E. Sterba","I don't think the disk really had much effect on it. I think this is one of the reasons why we are being much more active in communicating with our customers on issues around value of water. New Jersey has had a series of rate increases and it's because we hadn't done what needed to be done there for a while. And so I think that attracted a bit more attention, particularly in -- there's a couple of individuals who took the mantle up about just no rate increases. We understand that. I think the notion that this was a settled case with all of the major parties continues to speak well for a stable regulatory environment in the state of New Jersey. And it's -- obviously, it's a settlement we believe we not only live with but think it's fair and reasonable. I think the media coverage, because of some of the stir up, if you will, from a couple of folks in the political world, created more attention, if you will. Well, that's fine, we understand the concerns and we're going to continue to work with those folks to help them better understand why you have to invest and what that means to rate long term.","Ellen C. Wolf","Tim, I'd also add that this was actually a separate filing from the rate case. And it just so happened they were on the same agenda. But up until now, the comments we have had are very favorable around the disk. So I want to separate, we don't believe the disk was in any way driving reaction to the rate case.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of David Paz of Bank of America.","David A. Paz - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just on New Jersey on the disk specifically. Can you just walk me through how that will be implemented if we look close to next year? And then just any expected earnings impact but more specifically, maybe capital deployment impact?","Walter J. Lynch","Yes, Dave, this is Walter. I'll take that question. The board of public utilities has approved the disk program on May 1. But it's not effective until it's published in New Jersey register. We expect that to occur in early June. And then American Water in New Jersey, American Water will file the foundational filing shortly thereafter. You either have 90 days or a few that filing and when it is reviewed, and we'll start investing and we'll invest for a 6-month period and then we'll make our first filing. The board of public utilities will then have 60 days to review that filing and approve it and then the rates will go into effect at that point. We expect the impact to be sometime in the third quarter of 2013.","David A. Paz - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And in terms of just how you allocate capital, what should we expect? Higher percentage going in New Jersey versus other states versus historically?","Walter J. Lynch","Yes. I mean, with this mechanism, it's an incentive to invest in New Jersey. And we're going to increase our investment there.","Jeffry E. Sterba","You've seen, Dave, I think, a flow of capital into Pennsylvania, into Missouri and now into New Jersey because that's what these mechanisms incent.","David A. Paz - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","All right, okay. And then on declining usage. Can you say which states that you believe you have the mechanisms in place that address declining usage?","Ellen C. Wolf","I'm sorry, which states we have mechanisms in place that address the declining usage?","David A. Paz - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Yes.","Ellen C. Wolf","Clearly, California, which has a balancing account for declining usage.","Jeffry E. Sterba","New York.","Ellen C. Wolf","New York also has a similar account that takes into effect defining usage as well as costs. And then in New Jersey, we now have a 1-year forward look on it. Illinois has always been a future -- has been a future test year for us, so that has a 1-year look in it. Missouri has recognized some of it as well and Pennsylvania definitely this time through has recognized a 1-year future on declining usage. And I'm sure I missed one. Iowa and Kentucky.","Jeffry E. Sterba","Well, Kentucky also. Kentucky is also a future test year. So that has built in. Now a future test year in and of itself, it does not fully meet what we believe is necessary. But if you do a future test year plus a roll forward, we're getting pretty close. And that's what happened in New Jersey.","David A. Paz - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. Okay. And then just last, to clarify, Jeff, I think, you said that you filed 2 cases here today, and, Ellen, you said one. Just to clarify, how many cases have been filed here today?","Jeffry E. Sterba","We have filed 2, 1 of which has already been resolved. And so it's kind of odd but it's a very small operation and we filed a notice and it has already been accepted and approved. So that's why we have only one outstanding.","Ellen C. Wolf","We have this internal debate whether Michigan really filing or not since we have the ability to put in rates after we have submitted our letter notifying them.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Heike Doerr with Robert W. Baird.","Heike M. Doerr - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Not to belabor this New Jersey rate case, but I wondered if we could talk a little bit about the ROE, I believe, you [indiscernible]. ","Walter, you mentioned that there was $10 million that was related to O&M if we look at that 95.5 as our starting days. Maybe it makes more sense to think about it as maybe 85.5. I know the ROE is a little bit below what the going rate has been in New Jersey. Is there anything you can comment on that?","Ellen C. Wolf","We believe, Heike, our ROE is in line with what Aqua and United and others have perceived as well.","Heike M. Doerr - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. I thought that those companies had during their last rate proceedings, the most recent being completed in February, had been at a 10.3.","Ellen C. Wolf","No. I think they're at 10.15, I think, is what Aqua just got.","Heike M. Doerr - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And as we look ahead, Ellen, I believe you mentioned we were expecting 4 rate cases in 2012. Does that include the Michigan and the Virginia case that's already been filed or is that 4 more from here on out?","Ellen C. Wolf","It does include the Virginia case that has been filed.","Heike M. Doerr - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. Can you share with us what states those are?","Ellen C. Wolf","No. Heike, it is our philosophy and belief that really the first person we share that with is the regulator and their staff.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we do have a follow-up question from the line of Kevin Cole with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Kevin Cole - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Can I just ask a quick follow-up question on the dividend? I believe you have been doing some, I guess, a grass-roots-like conversation with your investors to see what they want from a yield and a payout perspective. I guess, how did that shape up and were you able to get an indication from your investors that they want to keep -- they want to stay, I guess, in the sub 3.5% water, I guess, normal payout ratio or be elevated to more in electric, in the mid-4% range?","Jeffry E. Sterba","What you find in those conversations, which I have found very helpful and interesting, is people are obviously have little different perspectives on the basis of what kind of a run they run, et cetera. But the fundamentals were predictable, stable and growing. And those are the 3 components that, I think, were common in all of the folks that we've talked to. And so that -- the effect to that is that is what we'll be guiding us going forward. Remember, when I say stable, that doesn't mean that you don't change at all, but it means that it's -- there's not a risk of it having to be cut, obviously. And the predictable really goes to the -- more of the notion that the dividend policy as opposed to what the specific dividend is. We had good conversations with different approaches that have been used by different firms. And I think you'll see from us an approach going forward that will be predictable, stable and growing.","Kevin Cole - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So I guess from recent years, the dividend increases have not tracked the EPS growth? Should we think of there's going to be like a one-time true up in the payout?","Jeffry E. Sterba","Yes. Kevin, as you know, the dividend decision is a subject matter for the board and their action. I think what you'll see is something that fits those criteria of predictable, stable and growing. I'll tell you that I have a personal bias against things where you do 1x, whether it's big jumps or X dividends. Those are rare times when I think those kind of approaches are appropriate.","Kevin Cole - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, that's fair. And then did you say earlier when the board was deciding the dividend?","Jeffry E. Sterba","Well, we meet often on all throughout the year. So no, we have not said when a specific decision. Our next declaration, I can't remember when the date is.","Kevin Cole - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. But your investor meeting is next week? Is that right?","Jeffry E. Sterba","Our annual meeting is next week.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Spencer Joyce with Hilliard Lyons.","Spencer E. Joyce - Hilliard Lyons, Research Division","I had to hop on here kind of late, so I apologize in advance of you may have already covered this but just a couple of quick questions. The $1.90 to $2 guidance range, that is continuing operations, correct?","Jeffry E. Sterba","Correct.","Spencer E. Joyce - Hilliard Lyons, Research Division","Okay. And just the other one regards to the expense side. It looks like we had a real nice quarter. bringing down some employee related cost, I'm just wondering if you all can provide a little color on maybe how close you all are to sort of a terminal destination there or should we expect some significant improvement in some future quarters?","Jeffry E. Sterba","Well, we've given -- we've made public a goal of having an operating efficiency ratio of at least no greater than 40% by 2015. We're certainly on target, I think, to hit that kind of a goal maybe even be able to be a little bit. It's not just what our absolute level of operating costs are because we have rerun 2 very different businesses. Our regulated business is capital intensive. Our market-based business is operating cost intensive. So we really look at the 2 as separate pieces. Also keep in mind that one of the major things we've got going on now is our Business Transformation project, which is bringing to the table new platform IP systems that we have not had. Over time, we expect that to be able to help reduce operating costs because we will not have to do as much as we're doing today manually. That doesn't happen on day 1 that the systems get implemented and those systems start being implemented in August of this year through about the same time frame next year in 3 different phases. But it takes a bit of time to get people comfortable to these systems and then we can use attrition and the like to help continue to reduce the employee side expenses of running the basic business. Ellen, anything you'd add?","Ellen C. Wolf","I think that's it. And again, when you look at our operating expenses, the total transformation going through with our systems will impact all lines of our expenses, including things like today, we can't do an electronic bill. So we will be able to do that in the future, so we will expect to see less printing costs, less mailing costs. So again, we're looking at all lines that will be impacted as we put new and much more customer-friendly systems in.","Spencer E. Joyce - Hilliard Lyons, Research Division","Okay. Yes, so it looks like we do have some ongoing things there.","Jeffry E. Sterba","Yes.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back to management for any closing remarks.","Jeffry E. Sterba","Well, I guess, thank you for your continued interest and support with what we're doing at American Water and again, invite you to participate in our annual meeting and we look forward to seeing you down the road.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call.

At the end of our prepared remarks, we will have time for questions.","Before we begin, I\u2019d like to remind everyone that during the course of this conference call both in our prepared remarks and answers to your questions, we may make statements related to future performance.  Our statements represent our most reasonable estimates; however, since these statements deal with future events, they are subject to numerous risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual performance of American Water to be materially different from the performance indicated or implied by such statements.  Such risk factors are set forth in the Company\u2019s SEC filings.","Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to American Water\u2019s President and CEO, Jeff Sterba.","Jeffry Sterba","Thanks, Ed.  Good morning to all and thanks for joining us today.  Ellen Wolf, our CFO, is here with me and will join in the presentation.  We also have Walter Lynch, our Head of Regulated Operations, and Kellye Walker, our General Counsel and Chief Administrative Officer with us.","We\u2019re pleased to announce continued strong performance for 2011 on virtually all fronts.  My comments will be brief since we\u2019d previously covered our general performance during the earnings guidance call that we just held a few weeks ago.  Additionally, we\u2019ll be discussing results for the full year of 2011.  Details around the year and the fourth quarter in specific will be able to be found in the 10-K, which should be filed tomorrow.","Turning to Slide 5, you can see that we delivered solid results for the year all around.  Total revenues increased $111 million year-over-year to approximately $2.7 billion.  Adjusted net income and earnings per share increased to approximately $320 million and $1.81 per share respectively.  These adjusted earnings are presented in the same manner that we have throughout the year, and Ellen will go through those adjustments in more detail.","In 2011, our regulated O&M expense was flat to 2010 which, when coupled with a 3.6% increase in regulated revenues, drove 170 basis point improvement in our O&M efficiency ratio from 45.5% to 43.8% over the last 12 months.  We also generated a 4.3 year-over-year increase in consolidated cash flow, and when you take into account a one-time tax refund that was received in 2010 and an additional pension contribution that we made at the end of 2011, cash flow from operations really increased about 16%.  All of these items resulted in slightly more than 100 basis point increase in our earned ROE to just over 7.5%.  ","While we\u2019re not yet where we want to be, significant progress has obviously been made.  In recognition of this financial performance, as we previously announced, a quarterly cash dividend payment of $0.23 per share was declared in December; and additionally, on February 24 of this year, our Board declared a quarterly cash dividend payment of $0.23 per share, payable on June 1, 2012 to shareholders of record as of April 20, 2012.  We also reaffirmed the 2012 earnings guidance range we provided a few weeks ago of between $1.90 to $2 per share for ongoing operations.","Before turning the call over to Ellen to go into more detail on this year\u2019s financial results, let me just note that Slide 6 shows that we successfully accomplished all of the items we laid out for 2011 at our analyst day a little over a year ago.  We\u2019re very pleased with this progress and look forward to continuing that trend into and through this year.","With that said, Ellen, let me turn it over to you.","Ellen Wolf","Good morning and thank you, Jeff, and good morning to those of you who are listening to our 2011 year-end earnings conference call.  As Jeff mentioned, our 2011 10-K will be filed within the next day as we continue to work with our auditors to make sure all the I\u2019s are dotted and the T\u2019s are crossed.","Jeff has just reviewed with you some of the highlights for 2011.  I\u2019ll also briefly add some additional detail around the results for the year.  ","Turning to Slide 8, our overall 2011 was another year of strong financial performance with increases in revenue, net income and cash flow as well as continued improvement in our regulated O&M efficiency ratio.  For 2011, we reported operating revenues of approximately $2.7 billion, a $111 million or 4.4% increase over the 2.6 billion reported for 2010.  GAAP earnings per share increased approximately 14%.  Included in the GAAP number and related only to our discontinued operations is a per-share benefit of $0.09 related to the cessation of depreciation as well as a non-cash charge of $0.14 related to the write-down of parent company goodwill associated with these discontinued operations.  This write-down should have been recorded in the first and second quarter of this year; therefore, when reviewing our 2011 financial statements, you will note in Footnote 22 we have recast the 2011 quarterly results.  This recast had no impact on ongoing net income, EPS or cash flow, and our year-end financial statements are correct.  ","As some of you may remember, when American Water was purchased by RWE in 2003, the premium RWE paid for American Water was booked at the parent company level.  Even though American Water was sold in 2008 through a public offering, that goodwill remains on our books.  When we sell subsidiaries, the goodwill associated with those subsidiaries also needs to exit our books.  Since I\u2019m sure that someone will ask this question, let me say that the annual goodwill impairment test which we performed at the end of 2011 showed that there was no impairment to the $1.2 billion of goodwill that is on our books.","For the full year 2011, net income and diluted earnings per share adjusted for the cessation of depreciation and the write-down was approximately $319 million compared with the approximately $268 million for 2010, or $1.81 per diluted share compared with $1.53 per diluted share in 2010.  The adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share represent American Water\u2019s ongoing operations, which as we have mentioned on previous calls we feel is a more appropriate way to view our business results.","Now I\u2019d like to turn the discussion to the various components of our net income, starting of course with revenue.  Overall operating revenues increased $111 million year-over-year.  Operating revenues from all regulated business increased approximately $83 million or 3.6% driven by $134 million in rate increases obtained through rate authorizations for a number of our operating companies, which is related to our continued prudent investment in infrastructure to ensure reliable service.  Revenue increases related to rates granted were offset by decreased revenues of approximately $57 million attributable to decreased water sales volume in all customer classes in 2011 compared to 2010; and I\u2019ll be addressing water sales shortly.","As of today, we have eight rate cases filed and awaiting final orders totaling approximately $258 million.  There is of course no assurance that the filed amount of the rate cases will be what is finally awarded.  A list of rate cases resolved and outstanding can be found in the appendix to this presentation.","Finally, our market-based operations revenues increased by $33 million during 2011 compared with the prior year.  The increase was primarily attributable to the increase in contract operations group revenues of about $22 million.  This increase is mainly the result of incremental revenues associated with military construction and O&M projects of $43 million, partially offset by lower revenues associated with other expired or terminated contracts.","Now let me spend a few minutes talking about our water sales, the trends we are experiencing, and the actions we are taking.  The bar chart in this slide shows total water sales volumes from 2007 to 2011 in millions of gallons, and the tables show you the breakdown of the different customer classes.  Except for 2010, which as you remember was characterized by a hot and dry summer in the northeast, the overall trend has been one of declining water usage across all of our customer classes throughout all of the states in which we operate regulated subsidiaries.  The rate of decline over the past five years in our various states has ranged between 1.3% to 3.4%.","Some of the variations are attributable to weather conditions and the overall economy, but increased water conservation, including the use of more efficient household fixtures and appliances as well as declining household sizes are affecting our water sales.  This decline in usage contributes to regulatory lag and is an issue that we addressed in the rate cases that we filed in 2011 and will continue to address in all future rate cases.","Now on Slide 11, you can see total operating expenses for 2011 increased by approximately $36 million or 2% from 2010.  Regulated operating expenses increased $21 million or 1.3% for 2011 compared with 2010, but really that is primarily due to higher depreciation expense of just about $21 million resulting from additional utility plants placed in service and increased general taxes of 5 million primarily attributable to higher gross receipt tax in our New Jersey regulated subsidiary.  Now offsetting these increases is lower O&M expense mainly due to decreasing usage as we noted mainly in our New Jersey subsidiary due to record rainfall in August.  Our market-based operating expenses increased by about $22 million mainly driven by expenses associated with our contract operations group\u2019s increased activity and our military construction projects.","Our continued focus on operating expenses can be seen in the continued improvement in our O&M efficiency ratio.  As Jeff mentioned, for the year our regulated entities\u2019 O&M efficiency ratio decreased to 43.8% compared with 45.5% in 2010, and 47.7% in 2009.  Our long-term O&M efficiency ratio goal of less than 40% is an important goal for this company as it allows us to continue to invest needed dollars in our infrastructure, including IT systems, while lessening the impact of rate increases to our customer.","Let me talk a little bit about capital expenditures both for 2011 and \u201912.  In \u201911, American Water invested $925 million in company-funded capital improvements compared to 766 million in 2010.  The Company\u2019s continued investment in pipes and plants to ensure reliable service included the start of two large capital projects \u2013 a $100 million project in Pittsburgh to upgrade two water treatment plants and associated pumping capacity that will benefit over half a million people, and a $75 million project to replace a 1920\u2019s-era water treatment facility in New Jersey.","In \u201911, we also moved forward with our business transformation project to upgrade technology systems which will ultimately provide more cost-effective and value-based services to customers and result in enhanced value for our shareholders.  We expect the ERP application to go live in August of \u201912 and the new customer information system and enterprise asset management system to be implemented throughout 2013.  Total expenditures spent for our business transformation project through the end of \u201911 was approximately 140 million, of which about 100 million of that had been spent in 2011.  As we mentioned in our guidance call for \u201912, we intend to invest about $900 million to upgrade and maintain our water systems.  ","And lastly on Slide 14, we have provided a bridge to take you from our 2011 GAAP earnings per share of $1.75 to the ongoing adjusted earnings per share of $1.78, so you can have an apples-to-apples basis to compare against our 2012 ongoing operations guidance of $1.90 to $2 a share.  Of course, these forecasts are subject to numerous risks including those described under forward-looking statements in our earnings press release and in our 10-K.","As a result of American Water\u2019s 2011 portfolio optimization efforts, the Company does not anticipate the need for an equity offering in 2012.  ","And with that, I\u2019d like to turn the call back to Jeff for closing comments before opening it up for your questions.","Jeffry Sterba","Thanks, Ellen.  So in addition to growing ongoing earnings to $1.90 to $2 per share, what else should you expect from us in 2012?  If you look at Slide 15, we have laid out once again the expectations that you can judge us by as we go through the year for this next year.  First and foremost, we\u2019ll remain dedicated to providing safe and reliable water services to our customers and the communities that we serve.  We\u2019ll also continue our portfolio optimization effort with closure of the Ohio-New York transactions and continued evaluation of other opportunities that may present themselves.","We\u2019ll also continue to be active on the regulatory front, both in filing appropriate rate cases needed to earn an appropriate return on our investments to actively addressing regulatory issues like regulatory lag and usage trends that Ellen talked about, and continuing to champion the increased use of infrastructure surcharge mechanisms to help minimize rate impact as well as provide the cash flow necessary to maintain the level of investment that we do.","And lastly on our market-based operations, we will continue to expand the businesses that show promising growth, like our homeowner services and military contract operations, while seeking to optimize the contribution from our muni contract ops group.  These efforts will anchor our long-term earnings per share growth rate of 7 to 10%.  With approximately a 3% dividend yield, we seek to provide investors with a double-digit investment return with a thesis centered around investing in our country\u2019s critical water infrastructure.  Again, we\u2019re very pleased with the 2011 performance and believe that we will keep the momentum moving through 2012.","With that, we\u2019d be happy to take any questions that you may have.","Question and Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you.  At this time if you would like to ask a question, please press star, one on your touchtone phone.  If you would like to withdraw your question, please press star, two.  ","Our first question comes from the line of Dan Eggers from Credit Suisse.  Please go ahead.","Dan Eggers \u2013 Credit Suisse","Hey, good morning, guys.  Jeff, I wondered if you could maybe talk or help walk us through the O&M efficiency target ratios you guys were using, and kind of the goal of getting it down below 40% by \u201915.  What levers are you seeing to pull right now and give you confidence you\u2019re going continue to be able to grind that number down over the next few years?","Jeffry Sterba","Yeah, Dan, they\u2019re really a series that focus on our operating excellence mantra, so trying to drive operating costs, for example.  We have initiated two rounds of new efforts regarding our supply chain where we have over $2 billion that flows through it, but quite frankly we\u2019ve found that we\u2019re not really leveraging it across the system as much as we could.  We do a good job, just not great; and so we\u2019re finding opportunities, for example through our recent pipe acquisition, we saved somewhere in the 3 to $5 million range.  We\u2019ve got one in process on our fleet and meters, and we\u2019re seeing really good, solid results as we move from really\u2014move more into what I\u2019ll call strategic sourcing initiatives.","We also, with the bringing forward of the elements of the SAP system through what we call business transformation, the first of three phases of which will go into service in August.  We won\u2019t really see savings this year, but as we go forward, particularly starting in \u201914 and out, we will be able to drive savings in both our\u2014largely labor, which we can hopefully manage mostly through attrition because these systems are going to enable a much higher degree of automation, a much higher degree of data that we can mine.  And then last, I would just put it as really driving a culture of continuous improvement where we\u2019re already starting to see the impact of projects that may save half a million here, a quarter of a million there; but frankly, that starts to add up. ","So there is not one big thing.  There are a series of things at which we\u2019re tackling the processes we use to get our work done, to procure the materials for it, and how we deploy our skilled labor to meet the needs of our customers.","Ellen Wolf","And Dan, if I can add, these strategic sourcing savings that Jeff is talking about is really around our capital and capital spend, and the money that we would save there we can then reinvest in other capital projects within the system which, over the long run as we replace those pipes faster, can help us on our O&M number.","Dan Eggers \u2013 Credit Suisse","So the idea is that basically the O&M savings is the efficiency of reinvestment, not so much the money being saved by getting the supply chain cheaper?","Ellen Wolf","On the strategic sourcing side, yes.","Jeffry Sterba","Yeah, just on the strategic sourcing.  All the other items\u2014because some of the sourcing, a lot of the sourcing that we\u2019re doing does affect our O&M costs.  Obviously, the labor side and being able to hold our labor costs constant through increased efficiency, as well as\u2014to give you an example on the supply chain where it directly hits the O&M, our chemicals and power acquisition.  So for example, what we\u2019ve done with this entity called EMBALA, to be able to sell power back into the grid not just in a regular demand management way but really selling ancillary services, which have high value in markets like PJM.  That drives down operating costs right away.  So Ellen was referring just really to some of the strategic sourcing, which is more geared around our capital side, but we\u2019re exercising the same kind of approaches relative to the operating costs we procure through the supply chain.","Dan Eggers \u2013 Credit Suisse","Not to belabor this issue, but when you think about the savings you get, there\u2019s also a regular cycle of rate cases being filed with the utilities.  How much of this O&M benefit do you guys expect to retain at the bottom line rather than being a reduction in customer rates or need for increases in customer rates?","Jeffry Sterba","Over time, Dan, we won\u2019t retain it.  We don\u2019t anticipate retaining it.  What it really does is help mitigate rate increases over time that allows us to invest more capital on which we earn; so the way we look at it with our employees is, look, for every dollar of O&M expense we\u2019re able to take out of rates, we can in turn invest $6 of capital with the same rate impact and earn $0.30 a share per year.  So it\u2019s really a matter of helping structure what rates are made of to create more value for customers by infrastructure investment, which in return creates value for our owners because of the returns on that investment.","The challenge, and what we want to make sure we avoid, is kind of what happened to the electric industry back in the early 90\u2019s when we pushed too far on rates and all of a sudden, with O&M costs going up and capital being invested, regulators said, wait a minute \u2013 this is just too much pressure on customers, and so we ended up getting capital disallowed and all the things that I really don\u2019t ever want to go through again.  So we expect over time we\u2019ll get back all the O&M savings.  We\u2019ll keep it for windows of time until the next rate case, et cetera; but it really is given back and it creates headroom, if you will, for capital expansion.","Dan Eggers \u2013 Credit Suisse","Thank you for explaining that.  And I guess, Ellen, just to make sure I understand this \u2013 the no equity for 2012, does that include a DRIP program equity raise, or is that really zero equity coming in the door this year?","Ellen Wolf","We\u2019ll still have slight, very small amounts of equity that will be raised through the dividend reinvestment plan as well as through any employee stock purchases; but that, as you see historically, is minimal.  ","Dan Eggers \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you.  Our next question comes from the line of Michael Roomburg with Ladenburg Thalmann.  Please go ahead.","Michael Roomburg \u2013 Ladenburg Thalmann","Hi, good morning.  I\u2019m looking at the broader trend \u2013 you guys under-spent your 800 million to a billion soft target for capital expenditures in \u201909 and \u201910, and it looks like you\u2019re now back on track in \u201911 and into \u201912 to meet or exceed those goals.  And I guess what I\u2019m trying to get at was in \u201909 and \u201910, I would imagine that construction costs came down a bit, and since then they\u2019ve now rebounded.  I\u2019m just wondering whether or not you could quantify the impact of that so as to determine whether or not the same volume of projects was completed as expected in \u201909 and \u201910, and therefore there wouldn\u2019t be a backlog that exists into \u201912, \u201913, \u201914; or, if that\u2019s not necessarily what drove the less CAPEX in 2009, 2010.","Jeffry Sterba","You know, Michael, I understand your point.  It\u2019s very hard to filter through.  I mean, there are obviously certain costs like copper and some components of steel that have increased in \u201911 versus, say for example, \u201908; but really, I think that\u2019s a pretty small impact on the overall cap spend.  It\u2019s more driven by in \u201911, we had a couple of significant projects, one in Pennsylvania\u2014well, it\u2019s really a series, but all of it associated with our Pittsburgh system, and then another major one in New Jersey.  So are there some changes that have happened in individual components?  Yes.  Some have come up and there\u2019s a few that have gone down, so I think that\u2019s a relatively small impact, and part of that is also when and how we procure those materials.  I think the strategic outsourcing or strategic supply sourcing that we talked about is really geared around trying to create greater efficiency in our capital spend so we can get more done with the same dollars, but I think the thing that really drove 2011 is the completion of the projects, or the movement through the projects in Pennsylvania and New Jersey.","Ellen?","Ellen Wolf","Yeah, the only thing\u2014prices came down a little bit in \u201909 and \u201910, but not all that much, if you\u2019ll remember, because there was a lot of federal dollars going towards construction, so there wasn\u2019t that same amount of drive down to get business.  And as Jeff said, a lot of this is around major projects \u2013 the Pennsylvania, New Jersey projects \u2013 continuing into \u201912.  We have, as we\u2019ve talked about before, major projects starting in California related to the supply issues out in California.  So the capital continues to increase based on the need.","Jeffry Sterba","And a lot of the items where you\u2019ve seen more rapid escalation \u2013 for example, copper \u2013 frankly, we\u2019ve reduced our use of copper and are reducing it further by going to other materials, so it has had less impact on us than it probably would have had five years ago.","Michael Roomburg \u2013 Ladenburg Thalmann","Got you, okay.  That\u2019s very helpful, thank you.  And just moving on to rate cases, it looks like based on your slide deck here that you\u2019ve settled the Missouri case.  I\u2019m just wondering if you have the terms available of that settlement.","Walter Lynch","Yeah, this is Walter.  No terms available yet, but we did reach a non-unanimous settlement and it\u2019s going to be going in front of the commission at some point.","Ellen Wolf","And we\u2019ll disclose those to you as soon as we have them.  As soon as we know that they can become public, we will make them public.","Michael Roomburg \u2013 Ladenburg Thalmann","Okay, okay.  And then just a couple other quick rate questions as well\u2014sorry?","Jeffry Sterba","Michael, just a clarification \u2013 when we say it\u2019s an non-unanimous settlement, all parties have agreed not to contest it, even though they may not have signed onto the stipulation.  So it\u2019s not going to be a contested stipulation.","Michael Roomburg \u2013 Ladenburg Thalmann","Okay, understood.  In New Jersey, you guys had settled previously a lot of your prior cases in pretty short order, and we\u2019d noticed that the rate council had in this case filed a formal recommendation.  I\u2019m just wondering in terms of your thinking whether or not you\u2019re surprised by that, your inability to settle it, and how you look at this case now in the larger light of what appears to be steadily improving regulatory environments in New Jersey?","Walter Lynch","Well, the New Jersey rate case is going through its normal process, and right now we\u2019re in discussions with all parties to try to reach settlement.  And so it\u2019s going through it\u2019s normal process with the normal timing.","Jeffry Sterba","You know, I think their coming out and releasing with their case, et cetera, is really kind of \u2013 as Walter said \u2013 part of the process.  I think there\u2019s certainly more focus on increasing rates, but I think we\u2019re reasonably\u2014we\u2019re hopeful that we\u2019ll able to get to a good place for customers and for us, and have reason to believe that will occur.","Ellen Wolf","And I\u2019d like to remind, normally in New Jersey it\u2019s a nine to 12-month process, and we\u2019re still well within that time frame.","Michael Roomburg \u2013 Ladenburg Thalmann","Sure, okay.  And then lastly, the New York-Ohio swap, any update on the timing of that?","Jeffry Sterba","It should close one tick after midnight on April 1.","Michael Roomburg \u2013 Ladenburg Thalmann","Okay.  Congrats on a nice 2011.  Thank you.","Jeffry Sterba","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you.  If there are any additional questions, please press the star followed by the one on your touchtone phone.  If you would like to withdraw your question, please press star, two.","And our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs.  Please go ahead.","Neil Mehta \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Good morning.  So you completed since our guidance call here the sale of your southwest operations.  Just wanted to confirm that the cash inflow associated with the transaction, that\u2019s $470 million and you expect to book it in Q1?","Ellen Wolf","The actual cash flow which came in was $461 million.  The difference is debt that was assumed; and yes, we are booking it.  The cash has come in.  We have used it to pay down our short-term debt, and we were very happy to have it.  And any other items related to the transaction will be booked in the first quarter, but as we noted, because there was the technical loss on the sale due to the goodwill of the parent company, all of that was now booked in 2011.","Neil Mehta \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Got it.  And the second question, any regulatory events we should be keeping our eyes on, whether it\u2019s a set date that\u2019s in the public domain for staff or a final decision in any of your major rate cases?","Ellen Wolf","The only one that is truly mandated and live by it that we see it is the Illinois rate case; and as we\u2019ve said, that\u2019s 11 months so that won\u2019t be until much later in the year.  But again, something you might want to look at, and as Walter said earlier, there\u2019s settlement in New York and Missouri so we would watch for timing on those as well.","Walter Lynch","The only other one I\u2019d mention would be California, where we do have a partial settlement.  It covers most of the rate case, and we did have hearings on the cost of capital which seemed to go very well.  They were, quite frankly, fairly short and so we remain optimistic that the cost of capital element will get put in place and the rate case will get resolved.  We do have the assurance from the commission that the rates will be retro to January 1 of 2012, so while we\u2019d like to get them in place, we\u2019re not losing anything.","Neil Mehta \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay.  And then year-end estimated company-wide rate base, do you have that number?","Ellen Wolf","No.  We\u2019ll get it worked up for you and supply it.  We don\u2019t have it at the moment.  And again, I just need to caution you, it\u2019s an approximate number because each state has a very different nuance to it, so we do a very high-level rate base number.","Neil Mehta \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay, thank you, Ellen.","Ellen Wolf","Sure.","Operator","Thank you.  Our next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.  Please go ahead.","Steve Fleishman \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah hi, good morning.  A couple things \u2013 first, is there any update on the New Jersey DISC process, just either timing or update there?","Jeffry Sterba","Everything seems to be going according to plan as we believe that the commission will be holding\u2014you know, they\u2019ve gotten comments, they\u2019ve received comments from parties.  I\u2019d say that the comments that were received on the proposal were generally positive and supportive of what\u2019s been in place, so we would expect that the commission would act on those comments and put forward the order within the next 30, 45 days, something like that.  I don\u2019t think it should go much longer than that, so it\u2019s really now that it finally got through after the election.  I think it\u2019s moving according to the schedule.  And again, remember that that probably won\u2019t have an impact on our earnings until we move into the second half of \u201913.","Steve Fleishman \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay.  And then when you talk about seeking other types of infrastructure charges and other mechanisms to reduce regulatory lag, are there other certain key cases we should watch where those are pending right now, or to be pending, so we can kind of track how that\u2019s going?","Jeffry Sterba","I\u2019ll let Walter address any that are pending.  There\u2019s a few states where we had a proposal and we ended up modifying its timing; so for example, extending in Missouri beyond the St. Louis district.  Others that you would mention, Walter?","Walter Lynch","No, I think that\u2019s it.  Getting the New Jersey DISC in place is obviously one of our keys, but we continue to look at the declining usage mechanisms in each of the states and working through settlement to recognize that the decline, as we\u2019ve said in this discussion here, is a little more steep than what\u2019s been going on in the past, and we want to get recovery of those revenues.  So that\u2019s really a huge focus for us.","Steve Fleishman \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay.  And one other question, and pardon if I didn\u2019t recall this, but in your guidance for 2012, did you give an assumption for sales?","Ellen Wolf","No, we did not.  We did say that we do continue to look at the decline as we put together our revenue figures.","Steve Fleishman \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, great.  Thank you.","Operator","This concludes the question and answer portion of the call.  I will now turn the call back over to Jeff Sterba for closing remarks.  Please go ahead.","Jeffry Sterba","Well again, thanks very much for joining us today, and we look forward to\u2014if we don\u2019t talk to you before the next quarterly call, we\u2019ll talk to you then.

Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us.","Today, our COO and CEO-elect, Walter Lynch will give key updates on our operations and our CFO, Susan Hardwick will cover the fourth quarter and full year financial results. ","As you know, this is my last earnings call and I\u2019m excited to say something I\u2019ve had the privilege of repeating on every earnings call since May of 2014 - yet again, American Water employees delivered strong results as we continue to grow our business and execute on our strategies. I\u2019ve said many times that very few people get the opportunity and privilege of working with their heroes every day, and I do. The amazing people of American Water consistently deliver outstanding service and results, and they do with incredibly inspiring commitment and dedication to our customers and to our communities.","Now let me highlight just a few of our 2019 accomplishments.","We continued our strong financial performance. Adjusted earnings were up 9.4% year over year with strong growth in both our regulated and market-based businesses. We added 67,000 customer connections in our regulated business in 2019 through both closed acquisitions and organic growth, and just over the past seven weeks in 2020 we have closed an addition 5,100 customer connections. Walter will cover this in detail, but we closed on a total of 21 acquisitions in eight different states in 2019. We are proud to truly be providing solutions across the United States.","We want communities to be better because we\u2019re there, and we\u2019re excited to welcome our new customers and our new employees to the American Water family. In addition to these closed acquisitions, we will welcome more than 44,000 new customer connections already under agreement over the next several months.","Our growth wouldn\u2019t be possible without being customer obsessed and being the best at the fundamentals of delivering safe, reliable and affordable water and wastewater services to our customers. We invested about $1.9 billion in 2019 with $1.7 billion going into our existing regulated infrastructure and $235 million for regulated acquisitions. We work to be as efficient as possible in both our O&M costs and in our capital projects work, and by leveraging our buying power and strategic sourcing to keep customer bills affordable.","We continue to implement practical technology tools for our frontline employees to enhance their ability to serve our customers more effectively, and we\u2019re also working on customer interfaces that deliver a highly personalized and satisfying customer experience.","Moving to our market-based businesses, homeowner services continued its strong performance, most recently launching a partnership with the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission. This represents about 100,000 potential new customers for that business, and as you know, we were extremely honored in 2019 to be awarded the Department of Defense contracts for water and wastewater systems at both Joint Base San Antonio in Texas and the United States Military Academy at West Point in New York. We now provide water and wastewater services on 16 military bases across the U.S., and it is a true honor to serve the men and women who serve our country.","We also announced in November an agreement to sell our New York American Water subsidiary to Liberty Utilities Company, and in December we completed the sale of our Keystone operations. ","Moving to Slide 6, with our continued strong performance and our commitment to the disciplined execution of our strategies, we are affirming our 2020 EPS guidance initiated this past December of $3.79 to $3.89 per share and our long-term five-year growth of 7% to 10%, and for the sixth year in a row our board of directors approved a dividend increase that is at the high end of our long term growth. ","We remain a regulated water utility at our core with a low risk and predictable growth story further enhanced with a strong ESG performance record. We plan to invest $20 billion to $22 billion in capital over the next 10 years. This includes replacing pipe, pumps and plants, and it also includes investing in critical resiliency and asset hardening projects related to climate variability. Again, this will be balanced by our continuing O&M and capital cost efficiency efforts, constructive regulatory and legislative policy, and technology deployment. ","The successful execution of our strategies has enabled us to achieve a five-year total shareholder return of 156% compared to the S&P 500\u2019s five-year TSR of 74%. Strong financial performance is a direct outcome of our steadfast focus on and execution of the fundamentals of our business.","Moving to Slide 7, let me talk just a moment about how we deliver results. It is our firm belief that companies do well by doing good. Just last month, we were named to the Global 100 Index as one of the World\u2019s 100 Most Sustainable Companies. American Water ranked 16th, fourth among only 17 total U.S. companies of any sector making the list, and the only U.S.-based utility. We were also just named for the third year in a row to Barron\u2019s 100 Most Sustainable Companies as the highest ranked utility. We are extremely proud of these recognitions as they validate from external sources our deep commitment to being an ESG leader. This slide lists several of our most recent 2019 and 2020 ESG recognitions.","We know that investors are actively searching for companies who deliver strong financial results while they also fully engage and develop employees, continually improve customer experiences, protect the planet, and make communities stronger because they\u2019re there. When these things are in the fabric of your culture and you also excel at the fundamentals of your business, long-term financial sustainability follows, and this is why we are confident in our business and our growth for the future.","With that, I will turn the call over to Walter to give a more detailed update on our regulated business.","Walter Lynch","Thanks Susan, and good morning everyone. Our regulated businesses had a strong fourth quarter with significant capital investment, strategic acquisitions, and continued O&M efficiency. ","Turning to Slide 9, there was a substantial amount of progress on the regulatory front throughout 2019 and continuing into 2020. In 2019, we concluded four rate cases in Indiana, Kentucky, West Virginia, and Maryland. In total, these four casers included more than $860 million of capital investment to provide reliable service for our customers. They also reflect a concerted effort in cost management, which I\u2019ll speak to shortly.","We have three pending rate cases in New Jersey, Virginia and California. In December 2019, New Jersey American Water filed a general rate case requesting an overall revenue increase of approximately $88 million excluding the revenue from the distribution system improvement charge, or DSIC. Since our last rate case in 2018, we have or will invest more than $1 billion in system upgrades, including 95 miles of water mains which is critical to water quality, reliability and fire protection. That level of investment also addresses New Jersey American Water\u2019s compliance with the state\u2019s Water Quality Accountability Act.","In November 2018, Virginia American Water filed a general rate case requesting an overall revenue increase of $5.6 million driven by approximately $98 million in infrastructure upgrades since April 2017. Interim rates became effective on May 1, 2019 and we expect a decision later this year.","Moving west, California American Water filed for new rates in July 2019. The case covers 2021 through 2023 and requests an increase in authorized revenue of $46.6 million over three years, beginning with a $26 million increase proposed for January 1, 2021. The request seeks $197 million for infrastructure improvements planned for 2021 and 2022. We expect a decision on this case late this year with new rates to take effect on January 1, 2021.","California American Water also joined a multi-company request on January 22, 2020 that requested a one-year delay in filing a new cost of capital application and an extension of the currently authorized cost of capital.","Turning to Slide 10, we continue to balance making critical investments to provide reliable service while limiting the impact to our customers\u2019 bills. For 2019, we\u2019ve invested a total of $1.9 billion in our regulated operations. At the same time, we continue making progress towards our long-term O&M efficiency goal of 31.3% by 2024. ","To put this effort in perspective, our adjusted O&M expenses are just slightly higher today than they were in 2010. Since then, we\u2019ve added approximately 270,000 customer connections while expenses only increased at a compound annual growth rate of 0.6%. We\u2019re extremely proud of our employees\u2019 focus and commitment to controlling costs on behalf of our customers.","Turning to Slide 11, as Susan said, we continue to grow the size of our footprint with 21 acquisitions occurring in eight states, adding about 53,100 new customer connections. In 2020 year to date, we\u2019ve added approximately 5,100 new customer connections through two closed acquisitions, with the majority coming from the Fruitridge Vista water system in California. ","In 2019, we were successful in continuing to expand our wastewater footprint in areas where we serve water customers. It just makes great sense to use our existing resources in areas where we already provide water services. This was the case last year in Alton, Illinois where we welcomed 23,000 wastewater customer connections, and in Exeter, Pennsylvania where we welcomed 9,000 wastewater customer connections. ","We also added 14,000 new customer connections from organic growth in 2019 and will welcome another 44,200 customer connections through 28 signed agreements in nine states. Seven were signed since we last spoke at investor day in early December. These agreements will add about 15,000 water customer connections and about 29,000 wastewater customer connections. ","Moving to Slide 12, we continue to achieve our 1% to 2% growth of customer connections through acquisitions, which equates to about 30,000 to 60,000 new customer connections per year. As you can see, since 2015 we\u2019ve completed 83 acquisitions, adding about 173,000 new customer connections in 10 states. Of those 83 acquisitions, 50 were acquisitions of water systems adding 43,000 customers, and 33 were acquisitions of wastewater systems adding 130,000 customers. Our customer base is now 93% water and 7% wastewater, which provides us tremendous opportunities to grow our wastewater business in areas where we already provide water service.","We\u2019re very disciplined in our approach to acquisitions, leveraging our tremendous expertise to find solutions for communities. We now have about 695,000 customer opportunities in our pipeline, up from about 650,000 customer opportunities in our last update at investor day. This consistent growth in our pipeline is bolstered by key regulatory mechanisms and legislative enablers. We work constructively with regulators and legislators in the states where we operate to receive these key mechanisms and enablers. We now have fair market value in eight of our states, consolidated tariffs in 12 of our states, and water quality accountability legislation in two of our states, with other states within our footprint considering similar legislation. ","We\u2019re a purpose driven company and every one of our employees plays a role in supporting our disciplined growth strategy. For us, it\u2019s about providing meaningful water and wastewater solutions to communities and welcoming these new employees into our company culture of purpose and safety. ","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Susan Hardwick for more detail on our financial performance.","Susan Hardwick","Thank you Walter, and good morning everyone. Let me start on Slide 14 with a summary of our results.","Fourth quarter 2019 consolidated GAAP earnings were $0.54 per share compared to $0.62 per share in 2018. In the fourth quarter of 2019, GAAP earnings were adjusted for the December sale of our Keystone operations and 2018 GAAP earnings were adjusted for the re-measurement of deferred taxes resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Excluding these adjustments, adjusted earnings per share were up $0.04 per share, driven primarily by growth in the regulated business.","The regulated business segment results were up $0.13 per share or an increase of 18.3% compared to 2018 earnings. The market-based businesses results were up $0.03 per share and the parent company decreased $0.12 per share compared to 2018, primarily reflecting higher interest expense to support growth in the business. For the year, our 2019 adjusted earnings were $3.61 per share or a 9.4% increase over the same period last year. Our regulated businesses increased $0.28 per share, our market-based businesses increased $0.12 per share primarily from homeowner servicers, and finally the parent results decreased by $0.09 per share year-over-year, driven by higher interest expense which was partially offset by the sale of the legacy investment that occurred in the second quarter of 2019.","Moving onto Slide 15, let me walk through a bit more detail of the 2019 results by business. As I mentioned, regulated operations were up $0.28 per share in total. We had a $0.49 per share increase from additional authorized revenue and surcharges to support infrastructure investments, acquisitions and organic growth. Offsetting the revenue increase, the second quarter of 2019, which was the wettest on record, had a $0.04 per share unfavorable impact from weather. Also, O&M expense increased $0.03 per share and depreciation and interest increased $0.14 per share, both to support regulated acquisitions and other growth.","The market-based businesses reported strong results in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily driven by organic growth of the homeowner services group and from the addition of the two contracts in our military services group in 2018. Finally, the parent was down $0.09 per share, primarily reflecting higher interest expense to support growth in the business and a $1.5 million or about a penny per share donation to the American Water Charitable Foundation. ","Moving to Slide 16, we have been very active on the regulatory front. The regulated businesses received $98 million in annualized new revenues in 2019, and this includes $45 million from rate cases and $53 million from infrastructure surcharges. We have also filed requests and are awaiting final orders on three rate cases and one infrastructure surcharge proceeding, for a total annualized revenue request of $126 million. The continued successful execution of our regulatory strategy is a key element of our ability to consistently deliver results.","Moving to Slide 17, as Susan said, we are affirming our 2020 EPS guidance range of $3.79 to $3.89 per share that we initiated in December. We are also affirming our long-term earnings compounded annual growth rate expectation on an earnings per share basis of 7% to 10% while investing capital in the range of $8.8 billion to $9.4 billion over the next five years. ","Moving to Slide 18, let me summarize. We\u2019ve invested capital of $1.9 billion in 2019, including $1.7 billion of regulated system improvements to better serve our customers and $235 million in closed regulated acquisitions that added over 53,000 new customer connections. These investments increased our estimated rate base at the end of 2019 to $13.7 billion, a 10.1% increase from the prior year. Our cash flow from operations held steady on a year-over-year basis from strong net income growth and the cash flow from our market-based businesses. ","We continue to deliver strong consolidated results. Our total company consolidated actual return on equity was 10.6% for 2019. Regulatory execution along with strong results from our market-based businesses allows us to consistently deliver on our earnings commitment. We believe that delivering on results combined with our strong earnings growth and superior dividend expectations continues to provide excellent value for our investors, and we continue to be a top leader in dividend growth. We have grown our dividend at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 10% or more over the last five years, and we expect to continue this growth at the high end of the 7% to 10% range. Also, we continue to target a dividend payout ratio of 50% to 60% of earnings.","With that, let me turn it back to Walter for a few additional comments.","Walter Lynch","Thanks Susan. As you all know, this is Susan Story\u2019s last earnings call with American Water, and I wanted to take this opportunity to reflect on her tenure with us. ","For me, it\u2019s been an absolute honor to work with Susan over the past six years as CEO and the year before that as CFO. She cares deeply about our people, our customers and our communities. Her commitment to do well by doing good has led to so many of our successes. ","There are too many accomplishments to name, but I will note that her commitment to the health and safety of our employees has been extraordinary. Susan always lives up to the company\u2019s strong values, especially safety. Nothing has mattered more. She cares about every single employee in our company and constantly reminds us that every employee should go home to their families in the same or better shape in which they came to work. ","We\u2019ve had a 63% reduction in overall OSHA recordable injury rates and a 72% reduction in the serious injury rate since she became CEO. Our goal is have to zero injuries, and we\u2019re working to make that a reality.","During Susan\u2019s tenure, American Water became the first and continues to be the only water utility in the S&P 500, the Dow Jones Utility Average, and the Philadelphia Utilities Index. Additionally, our six-year total shareholder return is 230.8%, market capitalization increased from $8.6 billion in May of 2014 to over $25 billion currently, and our dividend growth compound annual growth rate over the past six years is 10.2%.","Susan has been instrumental in guiding us on our current journey as a people power culture and a customer-obsessed organization with a strong commitment to environmental leadership, water quality, operational excellence and growth. Our entire leadership team is deeply committed to the execution of our strategies and our company values.","Susan, on behalf of all employees at American Water, thank you so much.","Susan Story","Thank you Walter. I want to thank all of you on this call, investors, analysts and other stakeholders who have been part of this remarkable journey I\u2019ve had with this amazing company. I\u2019ve enjoyed all the moments we\u2019ve spent together, whether on non-deal road shows, our individual visits, earnings calls, investor days - you name it. I appreciate the rigor and discipline that you require of us to ensure the best finance future for your clients. I hope you know that now and tomorrow, this company and its leaders take very seriously our responsibility to stewardship of the trust you put into us so that you can, as one of our investors described to me, make us your, quote, swan stock or your sleep well at night stock.","I know that you realize that this company and our continuing results are a product of almost 7,000 incredible employees led by the best executive team in the country. All that we have done is reflective of thousands of hours of honest discussion, vigorous debate, long and short-term strategizing, and action planning from all of us. ","Walter has been a critical key leader for this company for almost two decades, and his experience and steady hand will successfully guide this company into the coming years. I\u2019m also thankful I\u2019ve had the opportunity to work with two of the best CFOs in the entire utility industry, first Linda Sullivan and now Susan Hardwick, and to top it off you have Institutional Investor Magazine Sales Side Analyst Choice for the Best IR VP in Utilities, Ed Vallejo and his entire team providing continuing expertise to ensure that you and your clients get the information you need to make your best decisions, which we think is us, of course.","So thanks to all of you for everything, and with that, we\u2019re happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions]","Our first question will come from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Hey, good morning team. Let me just pile on here - congratulations, truly. It\u2019s been a pleasure and more importantly I wish you all the best in the adventures to come.","Susan Story","Thank you Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Absolutely. Perhaps just to turn it back to our regularly tuned program here, if I can, I appreciate the commentary. If we can talk about PFAS in brief, and I want to break this into a couple different pieces, first with respect to military sites, I know you guys have been obviously very involved for a while. Does PFAS start to change the opportunity set for your existing sites, and secondly, does it change the opportunity set for incremental sites and\/or accelerate those opportunities in terms of bases that may or may not be looking at opportunities, including yourselves? ","Then separately, coming back to PFAS more holistically, I know EPA is looking at setting perhaps updated targets, and to what extent could either state or, more importantly, federal level efforts, and I know a lot of the specific states you guys operate in already have been looking at or have already instituted more specific and stringent targets, does that change the name of the game? I know we talked about this a few months ago at your analyst day, but again even in that short brief time, it seems like the conversation has evolved.","Susan Story","Julien, that\u2019s a great question, and I will start and then Walter can pick up after this. Let me take the first one about the military bases, because as we know that a majority of the source of PFAS are firefighting foam and many military installations through the years, of course, doing exercises and those type things tend to have a concentration. The Department of Defense is actively working at its bases to determine if and whether they have issues.","We have, as you noted, already done work on two of our military bases. We have been working on PFAS for well over a decade. We\u2019re able to treat it successfully - we\u2019ve done so at Picatinny Arsenal in New Jersey, for example, so we\u2019re working with the bases that we serve in order to help look at what do they have, and then we feel certain that we\u2019re able to treat those.","Remember that with military bases, we can with the newer bases actually every year, instead of every two years, go in, look at the assets, look at something above and beyond what we bid on to begin with, and we have the ability to change those O&M contracts to recover those costs. From that standpoint, we\u2019ll be working on that over the next several months to work with those bases to do that.","The second thing about the EPA and the updated target, keep in mind that the EPA has two classifications. One is called maximum contaminant level, and there\u2019s close to 100 contaminants that they basically say, this is the regulation, you must meet these. Then, they have something called a health advisory that actually doesn\u2019t have the weight of required adherence to that. Believe it or not, PFAS is actually not an MCL, or maximum contaminant level, it\u2019s a health advisory, and right now they\u2019re looking at 70 parts per trillion - that\u2019s what they have. What they\u2019re looking at doing is codifying that and making it an MCL so that they do have the weight of required compliance behind it.","There is a lot of questions, as you said, about levels, and we\u2019re seeing the different states, New Jersey for example has a 13 or 14 parts per trillion based on the type of PFA it is. We\u2019re seeing New York look at it, California is looking at it, several states are. We at American Water are working closely with the EPA, very closely. We think it\u2019s better to have one for the entire country. We can treat to whatever level is needed. It is an expense issues as we go through there, plus some capital investment in how we treat that, so it is a growing field, it is a field in which we believe we have tremendous expertise. We\u2019re an advisor to the EPA on this issue, and we will be--as we go down this road and we look at what the finalization of these targets are, we can look at what impact that would have to our investment levels as well as what would it have to O&M.","Walter Lynch","Just to add a little bit to that, Susan, we treat in each of our states to the health advisory level of 70 parts per trillion unless the state has a more stringent requirement and then we treat to that, such as California and New Jersey and New York. That\u2019s how we address it, but as Susan said, we are working with the EPA to make sure that we put our views in there about what we think the MCL should be, and it\u2019s going to take, I think, some time for the EPA to go through the testing protocols to determine the MCL. But we\u2019re going to continue, again, to treat it to 70 parts per trillion or less if the state has a more stringent requirement.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Got it. Just a quick follow-up - does that change the municipal acquisition opportunity as best you see it with that triggering--? Sorry to follow up, I know it\u2019s a lot of questions.","Walter Lynch","Yes, I think that\u2019s going to be just part of the pie as far as opportunities for us to provide solutions for communities. If they have issues with PFAS and they\u2019re looking at the cost to treat that or other options, maybe shutting down their facility and tying into ours, I think it does provide opportunities for us, yes.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","I\u2019ll leave it there. Thank you again, and again best of luck.","Susan Story","Thank you Julien.","Operator","Our next question will come from Durgesh Chopra of Evercore. Please go ahead.","Durgesh Chopra","Hey, good morning team. ","Susan Story","Hi Durgesh.","Durgesh Chopra","Susan, I will miss you a lot. It\u2019s been an absolute pleasure. Congrats again.","Susan Story","Thank you.","Durgesh Chopra","Just going back, can I follow up on Julien\u2019s questions on the PFAS [indiscernible]? Can you just remind us what level of capex do we have in the current, I guess your five-year outlook or 10-year outlook, as it relates to PFAS [indiscernible]?","Susan Story","It\u2019s considered to be part of the normal capex we do. When you look at the chart, for example, and you look at water quality, it falls into the piece of the pie for water quality. As we go forward and we look at the magnitude of what the requirements could be, it could either take a bigger piece of the pie or we could move to make the pie bigger. It just depends on the magnitude.","Durgesh Chopra","Okay, thanks. Then can I go back to the quarter really quickly, maybe this is for Susan Hardwick. The parent other number, the $0.13 to $0.12 increase quarter over quarter, this seems very large. Is that all interest expense driven, or are there other items in there?","Susan Hardwick","It\u2019s primarily interest, and just recall again that we issued about a billion dollars worth of--sorry, I didn\u2019t have my mic on. It is primarily interest, and just recall that during the year, we issued about a billion dollars worth of long-term debt. That\u2019s the primary driver.","Susan Story","And when you see the employee-related expense, actually this is something that we are very positive about. If you remember, we reached an agreement with our unions last year and we include all of our union represented employees, which is about 47%, 48% of our employees, into our annual performance plan with bonuses based on the performance of the company. 2019 was the first year, the first full year that we actually had that accrual for all of the union-represented employees, so the majority of those employee-related costs are based on that. That\u2019s why year-over-year it looks higher, because that\u2019s an additional cost.","Durgesh Chopra","Okay, perfect. Then just a real quick one, New York American sale, that\u2019s still scheduled to close second half of this year?","Walter Lynch","Hey Durgesh, it\u2019s Walter. Yes, we\u2019re progressing as expected on that, and we said we\u2019ll probably close at the end of this year or the beginning of 2021. But it is progressing as expected.","Durgesh Chopra","Okay, thanks again.","Operator","Our next question will come from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Michael Lapides","Hey guys. Once again Susan, I don\u2019t mean to sound like or repeat myself from comments made at the analyst day, but congratulations. You\u2019ve done an excellent job in running this company over the years.","Susan Story","Thank you Michael.","Michael Lapides","I do have one question. Where do you think across your system you have the greatest challenges to earn authorized ROEs, and what are the steps over the next two to three years, Walter, you plan to do either from a regulatory construct or a cost management effort, or something else, to improve the earned returns in those jurisdictions? ","Walter Lynch","Hey Michael, it\u2019s Walter. We\u2019re happy in each of the states where we\u2019re operating, and as far as being treated fairly, I think we\u2019re being treated fairly in the states where we operate, so I\u2019m not going to really comment on the authorized ROEs or the earned ROEs in any of the states. We\u2019re very happy where we\u2019re operating.","I think going forward, it\u2019s part of our culture to look at every dollar in our business, and that\u2019s, I think, what sets us apart. If you look at the O&M efficiency improvements that we\u2019ve had, every dollar that we spend, our teams are out challenging, do we need to spend that dollar, is there a benefit to our customers, so it\u2019s that culture that I think is driving our O&M efficiency in the right way. ","I think we\u2019re going to continue to leverage technology. Technology has been a key enabler for us and will continue to be a key enabler going forward, making our employees more efficient, providing better service for our customers, so we\u2019re going to continue to leverage that as we move forward as well. ","Susan Story","You know, one thing that was interesting, I was reading our supply chain report from year end 2019, and they track something called total cost of ownership, that looks at from negotiations, from us being able to use volume procurement, they call it a total cost of ownership. We actually last year almost saved $80 million just in supply chain from that area called total cost of ownership, and I think that is a good representative of what Walter\u2019s talking about, in addition to our folks and the technology, just leveraging our size, scope and scale and being smart on supply chain.","Michael Lapides","Got it. Thank you guys. Much appreciated.","Operator","Our next question will come from Jonathan Reeder of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Jonathan Reeder","Hey, good morning Susan and team. Just want to echo everyone else\u2019s remarks - congrats. Definitely going to miss you, and hopefully the Tigers treat you well in your retirement.","Susan Story","Well, I\u2019ll send you my personal email, so we have to do college football season between Notre Dame and Auburn.","Jonathan Reeder","Definitely. You might come out on top on most of that. ","Two questions from me. First off, Walter, maybe this one is for you. The California cost of capital update, has the public advocate\u2019s office weighed in officially with the CPUC in regards to your request, or have you had any [indiscernible] application here in the next few months.","Walter Lynch","Actually, I\u2019m having a hard time hearing you. I think it was around the cost of capital. We\u2019re going to be filing--the proposed plan is to file in May of 2021 for 2022, so we\u2019re going to be at the current cost of capital this year and next year.","Was there another part of that question? Did I miss it?","Jonathan Reeder","Are you saying--did you get the one-year extension, then? Was it accepted?","Walter Lynch","No, we just filed for it, but the expectation would be that the cost of capital would be in place for this year and next year if we get it approved.","Jonathan Reeder","Right. No, I was wondering if the public advocate\u2019s office, have they weighed in on your request or have you been having active settlement discussions with them to try to get them on board with the request, and how should we think about the timing of the CPUC decision in that request?","Walter Lynch","Yes, there has not been any official decision on it, so it\u2019s just our filing in the hopes that we can delay it for a year.","Jonathan Reeder","Okay, but the consumer advocate, have they weighed in at all, or are you actively trying to get them on board with that request? What\u2019s going on behind the scenes?","Walter Lynch","Yes, that\u2019s part of the filing, is working with them and putting our views out there, but they have not officially made a decision on it.","Jonathan Reeder","Okay. Then the other question, I know you had the $0.03 legacy investment sale, but just to be clear, 2019\u2019s $3.61, that reflects a $0.04 headwind from below normal weather for the full year, that\u2019s correct, right?","Susan Hardwick","Yes Jonathan, it\u2019s correct.","Jonathan Reeder","Okay, great. Thanks so much, and again Susan, enjoy the off time, and definitely look forward to staying in touch.","Susan Story","Thank you Jonathan.","Operator","This concludes our question and answer session.

As a reminder, this call is being recorded and is also being webcast with accompanying slide presentation through the company's website, www.amwater.com.","Following the earnings conference call, an audio archive of the call will be available through November 14, 2014, by dialing 1 (412) 317-0088 for U.S. and international callers. The access code for replay is 10053559. The online archive of the webcast will be available through December 6, 2014, by accessing the Investor Relations page of the company's website located at www.amwater.com. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Ed Vallejo, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Vallejo, you may begin.","Edward D. Vallejo","Thank you, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for today's call. As usual, we'll keep our call to about an hour; and at the end of our prepared remarks, we will have time for questions.","But before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that during the course of this conference call, both in our prepared remarks and in answers to your questions, we may make statements related to future performance. Our statements represent our most reasonable estimates. However, since these estimates deal with future events, they are subject to numerous risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual performance of American Water to be materially different from the performance indicated or implied by such statements, and such risk factors are set forth in the company's SEC filings.","All statements in this call relating to earnings per share refer to diluted earnings per share.","And now I'd like to turn the call over to American Water's President and CEO, Susan Story.","Susan N. Story","Thanks, Ed. Good morning to everyone, and thanks for joining us on the call. I'm joined today by Linda Sullivan, our CFO, who will go over the third quarter results; and Walter Lynch, COO and President of Regulated Operations, who will discuss key matters in our Regulated Business.","I'm pleased to report that through the hard work of over 6,600 employees at American Water we delivered a quarter of solid performance, although most of our states experienced significantly cooler temperatures this summer.","During this quarter, we achieved increases in revenues and earnings per share, made significant progress growing our Regulated and Market-Based Businesses, and we reached a settlement with our unions on national benefits after a 4-year impasse, all, while delivering water services to our customers, safely and reliably.","In addition to the 2,200 customers in regulated acquisitions that we closed on this quarter, we had some exciting news on Tuesday. The residents of Haddonfield, New Jersey; Arnold, Missouri; and Rushville, Indiana; all voted to sell their communities' water and wastewater systems to American Water. We're honored that they put their votes of confidence in our company to bring safe, clean, affordable and reliable services to them, and we look forward to welcoming our newest 19,000 customers in the near future following regulatory approval. These communities are adjacent to our current water and wastewater systems, so we can bring economies of scale and existing resources to run these systems effectively and efficiently.","As you can see on Slide 5, our revenues increased nearly 3% for the quarter. Income from continuing operations rose 4.5% to $0.87 per diluted share, which is not adjusted for that weather impact of $0.04 to $0.06 per share. Walter will discuss the weather in more detail in just a few minutes. Excluding the midpoint of this impact, the weather normalized income from continuing operations was an EPS of $0.92 for the third quarter. The increase in earnings per share is mainly due to the success of our regulated business in obtaining rate authorizations and surcharges that support our rate-based growth through infrastructure investments. We also continued strong cost management across our businesses.","While we saw a slight decrease in cash flow from operations for the quarter, primarily due to the weather, of $0.04 to $0.06, we continue to improve our earned return on equity. Our adjusted ROE for the last 12 months ended September 30, 2014, increased by 80 basis points to 8.85% compared with the same period last year.","Turning now to Slide 6. We continued to invest in the pumps, plants and pipes that deliver water and water services to our customers. This quarter we invested $314 million in needed improvements. Year-to-date, we have made capital investments of over $700 million, and we expect to spend about $1 billion by year's end. We completed 4 acquisitions this quarter, adding 2,200 customers. Year-to-date, we've added about 3,700 customers on closed acquisitions. At this time, we have about 25,000 additional customers in pending acquisitions, which includes the 19,000 in Haddonfield, Arnold and Rushville, which I've talked about earlier.","We grew our Market-Based Business through the expansion of our Homeowner Services territory as well as through our military group. This past week we received notification from the Orlando Utilities Commission of its intent to award American Water Resources a home warranty protection agreement to market to its 260,000 customers pending contract negotiation.","During the quarter, we also announced our second military award this year, Picatinny Arsenal in New Jersey. We now serve 11 military installations across the country. The Department of Defense had not awarded any new contracts the size we target since 2009 until the 2 this year. We won both of those through competitive bids. We are always honored to have the privilege to serve the men and women who protect our freedom and liberties every day.","During the quarter, we made progress on our ongoing goal to actively address regulatory lags and promote constructive regulatory frameworks. Notably, as Walter will discuss, the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities approved modifications to consolidated tax adjustments. And in California, a general rate case settlement was reached with the Office of Ratepayer Advocates and other intervenors. We also filed for additional infrastructure investment revenue in Missouri and Tennessee, which Linda will discuss further.","We recognized the important balance between making needed investments in our systems and helping our customers have affordable bills. To do that, we continue to improve our O&M efficiency ratio, which, adjusted for West Virginia and weather, improved 330 basis points from this 12-month ended period compared to last year. We also reached an agreement on October 31 to sell Terratec Environmental Ltd., the market-based residuals management subsidiary of our Canadian residuals division, and we expect to close in the coming weeks. Our main driver for this portfolio optimization was to exit the class B biosolids business and concentrate on class A biosolids, which is a more specialized market and is more aligned with our market-based business model.","Lastly, I'm pleased to report that American Water and the Utility Workers Union of America, representing the company's union, reached a settlement regarding our national benefits agreement. Walter will also provide more detail on that momentarily.","Moving to Slide 7. In our ongoing commitment to our shareholders, American Water's Board of Directors on September 19 declared a quarterly cash dividend payment of $0.31 per share, payable on December 1, 2014, to all shareholders of record as of November 10. This continues our annual dividend payout target of 50% to 60% of net income while growing dividends at a rate aligned with earnings per share growth. Based on our performance this year, we are narrowing our earnings guidance for adjusted continuing operations for the year from $2.35 to $2.45 to a range of $2.38 to $2.44. This range is not adjusted for the $0.04 to $0.06 per share effect of adverse weather, but it does exclude the impacts of the Freedom Industries chemical spill in West Virginia.","We remain confident in our ability to deliver on our long-term EPS growth of 7% to 10% through execution of our investment and growth strategies as well as continuing operational efficiency gains. Also, we plan on providing 2015 guidance on a conference call at 11:00 a.m. on Monday, December 15. So stay tuned for additional details, and please mark your calendars.","Walter will now give an update on our Regulated Business.","Walter J. Lynch","Thanks, Susan. And good morning, everyone. Let's start with an update on the weather. This was a very cool and mild summer as evidenced by the NOAA climate data on this slide. We've seen the same theme from electric and gas utilities throughout these regions during this third quarter earnings season. In some of our service areas in Missouri, Illinois and Indiana, we experienced record cool temperatures. At the same time, we saw above-normal precipitation levels in Indiana, Illinois and parts of Pennsylvania. This did impact demand and revenues, and we estimate the weather impact to be about $0.04 to $0.06 for the quarter. As always, we did take appropriate management actions to address this revenue shortfall associated with this unfavorable weather.","In contrast, California continues to experience a record drought and the hottest year on record. In response, California American Water has conducted extensive conservation outreach, mailings, bill messages, emails, social media campaigns and community events. We developed a special section of our website dedicated to keeping customers updated on this drought, its impacts and the resources we have available to help. California American Water is calling for voluntary conservation from its customers in all districts, with the exception of one district, Larkfield District, which is in Sonoma County, which instituted mandatory conservation on October 23.","Statewide water system delivery is down about 10% since the previous year, and in the third quarter, each California district saw decreases in water use. Because of mechanisms in place, the company's revenues will not be impacted by declines in sales due to conservation efforts. As Susan related earlier, in our California general rate case for rates effective 2015 through 2017, we and the Office of Ratepayer Advocate, along with others, filed a settlement. If approved, the settlement would provide $13.6 million in additional annualized revenues in 2015 and subsequent increases presently estimated at $5 million for 2016 and $6.3 million for 2017. We're awaiting a California PUC decision on this settlement in the general rate case at this time.","Our California team also continues to make progress on the Monterey Peninsula Water Supply Project. The test well permit will be considered before a state agency next week, and construction work and drilling on the test well could begin this month. And finally, for California, our San Clemente Dam Removal Project is making great progress. Sediment has been relocated and a new path for the river has been cut. When the next rain occurs there, it will be the first time that water will actually flow through these new channels. This project is on time and on budget with substantial completion expected in late 2015 or early 2016.","Moving on to New Jersey on the regulatory front. As Susan said, the Board of Public Utilities approved changes to consolidated tax adjustments. The BPU is recognizing the more standard practice that other states have to encourage investment. These approved changes include limiting the look back to 5 years and additionally allocating 75% of the savings to the company and 25% to utilities customers.","I also want to reiterate what Susan said about Tuesday's vote in Haddonfield, New Jersey. We're so pleased that the Haddonfield residents voted to sell their water and wastewater systems to New Jersey American Water. We'll now seek the approval by the Board of Public Utilities, which we expect to take place sometime in mid-2015. Because we already provide those services to surrounding communities, we're able to leverage existing resources to more efficiently and effectively operate these systems. Immediately after closing, we're going to begin to make the much-needed upgrades to the systems. In fact, just to give you some transparency on it, in the first year after closing, we've committed to spending $6.5 million on several critical projects to significantly improve the wastewater system. An additional $9.5 million will be invested in the following 4 years to modernize these systems.","Haddonfield, along with Arnold, Missouri, and Rushville, Indiana, are great examples of the type of solutions that we can offer communities challenged by competing budget priorities and deteriorating water and wastewater systems. They're also great examples of our local business model. Our employees live and work in the communities, and in these referendum efforts help to inform voters about the ways American Water can work with them to address their challenges.","In all 3 of these communities, local government leaders, along with their local employees, ensure that the citizens had the data they needed to make important decisions on election day. That's what it means to be a local company, and that's how we like to operate in the states where we're privileged to serve. We're committed to continuing the partnerships we developed with Haddonfield, Arnold and Rushville, and I want to thank all of our employees who volunteered to help in our growth efforts.","Additionally, last week, American Water and the Utility Workers Union of America, representing the company's unions, jointly announced the ratification of a settlement related to the complaint filed by the Utility Workers Union of America regarding our national benefits agreement.","Part of this settlement included a new health care and benefits package for our workforce through 2018. This benefits package remains competitive compared to other plans offered in the utility industry. We're pleased to reach a settlement that we believe is fair for both our employees and our customers. We look forward to working together with our unions in a collaborative way on issues such as safety, employee training and development and growth opportunities.","And finally, I want to provide a brief update on the Freedom Industries chemical spill in West Virginia. From an operational perspective, we continue to monitor well water for MCHM and PPH, and we're pleased to report that there were no traces of these substances in any samples taken. We'll continue to do this monitoring until the Freedom Industries site is certified as decontaminated by the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection as this site right now is being completely torn down. We anticipate that this will occur in the next few months. Otherwise, we are back to business as usual in West Virginia.","And now I'll turn the call over to Linda for a more detailed review of our financial performance.","Linda G. Sullivan","Thank you, Walter. And good morning, everyone. It is a pleasure to be here with you today to review our third quarter financial results in more detail.","Turning to Slide 13. Third quarter 2014 had solid financial results. Despite the cool summer temperatures, our revenues, operating income, operating margins and earnings improved over the third quarter of last year. In addition, we continued to make progress on improving operating efficiency. More specifically, for the quarter, we reported operating revenues of approximately $846 million, $24 million or about 3% higher than the third quarter of last year. Both periods were impacted by weather, which I will cover in more detail in a moment.","Operating income rose to $337 million or about $14 million higher than the same period last year, resulting in just over 0.5% increase in operating income margin. Third quarter income from continuing operations was approximately $157 million or $0.87 per share. This compares to $150 million or $0.84 per share for the third quarter of 2013.","As Susan mentioned previously, we reached an agreement to sell Terratec Environmental Ltd., which was part of our Market-Based Business segment. As a result, both the loss on the sale and the operating results have been classified as discontinued operations. This resulted in a combined loss from discontinued operations of $0.02 per diluted share for the quarter and $0.03 per diluted share on a year-to-date basis. Although we reported a loss on the sale of this transaction, the transaction is structured to monetize about $4 million in tax benefit.","As mentioned earlier, both periods presented were impacted by the weather. In the third quarter of 2014, weather impacted our results in the range of $0.04 to $0.06 per share. Last year, the weather impact was $0.02 to $0.04. Excluding the midpoint of these impacts, adjusted weather normalized earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.92, which is a $0.05 or approximate 6% increase compared to the weather normalized third quarter of last year. We also paid a dividend of $0.31 per share during the quarter, which represents an approximate 11% increase over the $0.28 per share payment in the third quarter of 2013. We reported cash flow from operating activities of about $390 million for the quarter, relatively flat compared to the same period last year despite the larger weather impact experienced this summer.","Now let's discuss the different components of our adjusted EPS growth from continuing operations on Slide 14. On the left side of this page, our starting point is third quarter 2013 recorded earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.84. Last year was cooler and wetter than normal, so we have adjusted up for the midpoint of the weather impact or $0.03, which gets us to what we consider a weather normalized earning starting point for the third quarter of 2013 of $0.87 per share. And now I will walk through each of the EPS drivers, which gets us to our third quarter 2014 adjusted weather normalized EPS of $0.92 per share from continuing operations.","First, we had lower revenue in the third quarter of 2014 due to cooler weather in many of our states. This impact was in a range of $0.04 to $0.06 per share for the quarter and shown on the EPS bridge is the midpoint of that range or $0.05. The next item shows the impact from both income and general taxes, which were higher by $0.03 per share over the same quarter last year, due to 2 items: higher income tax true-ups of about $0.02 and higher property taxes of about $0.01, primarily from tax assessments in Pennsylvania and Kentucky.","Next, in the third quarter 2014, we reported higher consolidated depreciation and amortization expense of about $0.02, principally from growth associated with our capital investment program, including our SAP project that was placed into service during 2013.","Next, EPS for our Market-Based Business was a $0.01 lower than the same quarter last year. However, there are 2 onetime items in the third quarter of 2013 that lowered the quarter-over-quarter comparison by $0.02 per share, including $0.01 from price redeterminations in the military services business and $0.01 from the release of contract reserve due to resolving uncertainties on certain O&M contracts.","Adjusting for these 2013 items, the Market-Based business segment would have actually increased $0.01 per share on a quarter-over-quarter basis, driven by additional capital projects associated with our military contracts and contract growth in Homeowner Services, mainly with our New York City contracts as well as expansion into other geographic areas.","In the next bar, the incremental revenue from regulated acquisitions increased $0.01 per share due mainly to our acquisition of Dale Services Corporation in Virginia in the fourth quarter of 2013.","We also had a $0.05 increase from higher regulated revenue. This increase over the prior quarter was made up of 3 key items. First, authorized rate increases for a number of our operating companies increased $0.08 per share. Second, increased surcharge and amortization of balancing accounts increased $0.01 per share; and third, these increases were partially offset by decreased demand of about $0.04 per share as we continued to experience declining usage, primarily for our residential customers in the 1% to 2% range.","Next, regulated O&M decreased $0.05 per share for the quarter compared to last year due to 3 main drivers. First, employee-related costs, which were the single biggest contributor, decreased by $0.03 per share or 6.5% for the quarter, primarily from reduction in pension and postretirement benefit costs due to the change in the discount rate. Second, operating supplies and services decreased $0.01 per share, primarily driven by lower contract services as last year, we had additional contractors assisting us with our SAP system stabilization, and we experienced higher regulatory expenses. Lastly, production cost decreased $0.01 or 3.2%, primarily due to lower chemical costs in our Illinois subsidiary.","In the appendix of the slide deck, we have included our traditional revenue and expense bridge slides to provide more detail to the earnings variances I just discussed. I will not cover these in detail today as most items are a duplicate of what I discussed on the earnings bridge. Also, I encourage you to read our 10-Q on file with the SEC for a more detailed analysis of both revenues and expenses. We'll be happy to answer any questions or provide further clarification if needed during our question-and-answer session.","On Slide 15, we show our O&M efficiency ratio. We continue to see progress in this metric. For the 12 months ended September 30, 2014, we achieved a 36.8% ratio, which is a considerable improvement over the 40.1% ratio we had in the same period last year. This ratio adjusts for weather and excludes the expenses related to the Freedom Industries chemical spill. As we have shared with many of you previously, our long-term stretch goal is to achieve a 35% O&M efficiency ratio by 2018. There is a full calculation of this ratio in the appendix section of the earnings call slide deck.","Now let's look at recent regulatory highlights on Slide 16, which shows formal rate cases awaiting final order as well as step increases and infrastructure filings which impacted the quarter or are still pending. But before I cover this slide in detail, I want to point out what is really key about this slide, and that is that you can see a shift in the way that we recover capital from formal rate cases to infrastructure surcharges.","As you may remember, in past years we would have 8 -- maybe 10 rate cases outstanding and few or no infrastructure filing. Now we have 8 surcharge filings approved this year, and as you know, we recover our capital faster with these mechanisms, which improves our return on equity, provides more flexibility around the timing of formal rate cases as well as providing better customer service and moderating bill impact for our customers.","Back to the slide itself, in terms of pending rate cases, as of today we have a waiting -- we are awaiting orders for general rate cases in 2 states, California and Indiana. In California, we now have a settlement with the Office of Ratepayer Advocate and other intervenors, as Walter mentioned. Our Missouri and Tennessee subsidiaries filed for additional annualized revenues from infrastructure investment charges for a combined total of $11.1 million.","Shifting to rates that became effective. In 2014, we had $2.4 million is step increases from prior rate cases in New York and California. A total of $25.6 million in additional annualized infrastructure investment charges have been awarded this year, with the latest one being the July 1 approval of our annualized distribution system improvement charge of $7.4 million in New Jersey. As I mentioned earlier, these infrastructure charges represent the ability to more timely recover capital, which we invest to improve both infrastructure and customer service.","Additionally, we implemented new rates effective January 1 of this year in Pennsylvania and effective April 18 in Iowa for a combined annualized total of $29.8 million. These are the highlights of these cases, and we advise you to review the footnotes for a fuller understanding of particular cases. And while we cannot project the outcome of these cases, we hope that this will help you understand our current rate environment. And in the appendix, you will also find an updated version of our largest 10 states with our authorized rate base and allowed return on equity.","Lastly, as Susan mentioned, we are now narrowing our adjusted earnings per share guidance for continuing operations for the year to a range of $2.38 to $2.44 per diluted share, which is not adjusted for the adverse weather impact of approximately $0.04 to $0.06. This guidance does exclude the impact of the Freedom Industries chemical spill in West Virginia. And remember that our year-end guidance is a range to account for a variety of factors during the year, with the largest being weather. Unless there are extreme weather impacts, this range should absorb those impacts. Our quarterly earnings are point, not ranges, so we like to disclose the weather effects to give you more insight into our actual performance.","Now given that the guidance is not adjusted for weather, you should use the $0.87 reported in this quarter on your way to building our annual 2014 performance versus our $2.38 to $2.44 guidance range.","With that, I will turn it over to Susan.","Susan N. Story","Thanks, Linda. As we discussed last quarter, we will conclude each of our earnings call by highlighting initiatives or recent news that may be outside of what we would typically cover in an earnings call. This quarter, we're going to highlight American Water's addition to the Dow Jones Utility Average. We are very proud to be added to this index. The utility average is a 15-member index that represents the stock performance of large, well-known U.S. companies within the utilities sector.","During its 78-year existence, there have only been 3 major reorganizations in the index, and only 40 companies have been part of that average since it was introduced in 1929. Additionally, we are the only water utility to ever be part of the index; and interestingly, we've been a member twice. When it was started in 1929, the original members of the Dow Jones Utilities Average included our predecessor company, American Water Works & Electric Company. In 1947, under the newly implemented Public Utility Holding Company Act, 6 holding companies, including our predecessor, were dissolved and removed from the utility average. Now 67 years later, we're back; and of course, we're better than ever. Being included in the utility average is a tremendous honor for American Water and the entire water and wastewater industry for several reasons. First, having the index recognize the critical role the water industry played in the utilities space and the economy is important. The legacy of our country's prosperity is rooted in infrastructure investments, and water and wastewater represent vital infrastructure necessary not just for the economy growth, but for quality of life.","Second, water is critically needed for electricity and energy production and for the growing of food. The EPA's November 2013 report on the importance of water to the U.S. economy notes that 94% of our economy is linked to this water-energy-food nexus. And finally, being included in the utility average is a testament to our ability at American Water to deliver on our investment and operating strategies and provide dependable value to our customers and our shareholders. This achievement is a direct reflection of the dedication and expertise of our employees who are committed to the customers and communities that we serve every single day. In my 6 months as CEO, I've had the pleasure of visiting the majority of our work locations. And I've met with the incredible people of American Water, who every day deliver safe, affordable and reliable water services to our customers. These are the same people who dedicated more than 4,700 charitable service hours to the communities that we serve just during September in our dedicated month of service. Our employees are very inspiring to me for these reasons and more, and I appreciate the privilege of being part of their team.","So now we're happy to take any questions you might have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ryan Connors from Janney Montgomery Scott.","Ryan M. Connors - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","A couple of questions. First off, I wanted to just talk about this New Jersey CTA issue a little bit, and you gave a real nice discussion of it, Walter. But can you kind of talk to us a little more about the financial impact of that on the P&L and the timing of that in terms of how we quantify that and go about -- translating that into an actual earnings contribution?","Linda G. Sullivan","Ryan, this is Linda, and this is a step in the right direction we believe for New Jersey. When -- this decision will impact us when we file our next rate case in New Jersey, that is when it would become effective for us. And as you know, we filed our last rate case in New Jersey in 2011, and that rate case was a black box settlement, so we cannot disclose the financial impact of this. But when we look at the timing of our rate case and the flexibility that we have in terms of timing around our infrastructure mechanisms in New Jersey, we take all of those things into consideration to help determine when we will file that next rate case and be able to implement this new change.","Richard A. Verdi - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. But really no estimate or guidance on kind of the magnitude of the impact?","Linda G. Sullivan","Because it was a black box settlement the last rate case, we really can't disclose that.","Ryan M. Connors - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Got it. Okay. Fair enough. And then just -- the other question I have was just more kind of tactical, but -- and I guess, we'll get more detail on this on December 15, but just talking about the weather from a big picture perspective. So we had the cool temperatures in the Midwest. But as you mentioned on the call, last year's third quarter was also negatively impacted by weather. So as we look into 2015, is it safe to say we've got a very easy comparison, so to speak, as we sort of think about growth next year and demand?","Linda G. Sullivan","So what we do from an earnings guidance perspective is we'll give you weather normalized earnings guidance for 2015, which, as we indicated earlier, will occur on December 15.","Susan N. Story","And Ryan, as Linda mentioned, just as the electrics do also, we put a range for guidance because while we look at budgets and everything weather normalized, we understand that there are going to be variabilities. We disclosed at Investor Day last year a set of those variabilities, and for us, just like the electrics, the largest potential variable is weather. In a typical year, we account for some of that variability in our range unless there is extreme weather. And for example, back in 2012, the positive uplift was between $0.13 and $0.16 for American Water. That's a little beyond what you would have as normal variability. So when we look at weather, you don't want to start having a lot of guidance ranges that are weather-affected and this type of things. So we just try to keep it as clean as we can.","Richard A. Verdi - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then one last one before I hop out is just on your payout ratio, can you talk to us about where you're running right now and how you feel about where you're at and whether you would up that payout ratio a bit going forward depending on your equity capital needs and so forth?","Linda G. Sullivan","Our payout ratio is currently at 2.5%, and the way that we look at -- I'm sorry. Let me correct that. Our payout ratio is just over 50%. We have a target range for our payout ratio of 50% to 60%, and we plan to -- our goal is to grow our dividend commensurate with our EPS growth.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Gaugler from Brean Capital.","Michael E. Gaugler - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division","I've actually got a follow-up on the CTA to Ryan's question. Just wondering, given the changes and how you think holistically about where you're going to deploy future investment, is that enough to put New Jersey at the top of your list?","Linda G. Sullivan","When we look at the prioritization of our capital, ROE is one of the key items that we look at in the prioritization of capital, in addition to what are the needs for the investment in the state. And so that is a factor that we will look at as we move forward and file a rate case in New Jersey. So all of those factors come into play when we look at the capital prioritization. This is something that is moving in the right direction. So although externally we have seen lower ROEs being authorized in New Jersey, we see that this will offset those lower ROEs moving forward.","Walter J. Lynch","And Mike, this is Walter. Given the DSIC program that was approved a few years ago, as you know, we've invested a lot more in New Jersey than we have in prior years. So it does -- it is one of our top states, and we'll continue to do so because of the DSIC mechanism and the needed investment that we have to make in New Jersey.","Susan N. Story","And Mike, as you know, and you've heard us say over and over, in our capital program we will invest what we need in every state to meet our customer needs. We will make sure that our water is safe and clean and reliable. So you also know that we do have some discretion. After we have committed those funds, we have discretion with other funds. And as Linda and Walter both said, we look at a variety of factors, including ROE, and as Walter said, too, where you have mechanisms where you can get the return in a more productive and reduced regulatory lag. So all those factors come into play, but we look at our capital very carefully. We make sure that every single state has what they need to deliver services to customers. Then that which is discretionary, we'll look at these other factors.","Michael E. Gaugler - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division","Great. Then I have just one other question. Probably for Walter, just kind of wondering how you're feeling about water supply in California. It seems like some of your peers are getting just a tad bit nervous looking out into '15.","Walter J. Lynch","Well, right now, Michael, we're still okay with water supply; but again, we've asked for voluntary conversation of all of our districts. We've put mandatory conservation in one of the districts. We're obviously participating as a partner in the state to reduce water usage, and we'll continue to monitor.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Richard Verdi from Ladenburg.","Richard A. Verdi - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division","I just have one quick question which pertains to the efficiency ratio. At the Analyst Day last year, the company had highlighted the goal of achieving a 35% efficiency ratio by 2018, and obviously that's been the objective since as shown in Slide 15 today. Let's hypothetically fast forward to 2018 and say the target's been reached. Would a new target be set? And if so, what would it be? How long could it maybe take to achieve? And what would the driving force behind the reduction be? Because I would think there's probably going to be more room to go.","Linda G. Sullivan","So let me start with just an overview of the progress that we've made. So we've made significant progress on the metrics, and we continue to make progress. Now as we move through time, the progress will tighten a little bit. As we work through and we file additional rate cases, our revenue will be trued up as we've returned these savings that we have recognized back to our customers. And so the improvement will begin to tighten as we get closer to the 35% target for 2018. And we will continue to look at are there other ways that we can continue to improve the metric? Are there technologies that we can deploy or other operational efficiencies that we can drive in the business? Because really, this is about how do we operate the business from an overall perspective. We know we have more infrastructure investment to make. As we continue to make that affordable for our customers, we need to make sure that we're managing every dollar on the operating efficiency side.","Richard A. Verdi - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. I just -- I'm thinking, is there any chance that smart metering could be used? Any chatter about potentially creating some sort of Smart Grid like the electricity side did for the water side?","Susan N. Story","Rich, I am so glad you asked that question. So the answer is yes, and I will tell you that we actually have some information on our website, and we'll be happy to send it to you. We're actually pioneering a lot of work on the smart water grid. We have our own R&D group, and we have an innovation development process. So what we're looking at on the Smart Grid, we're 85% AMR and AMI right now on the American Water system. We also are doing a lot of research on water sensors near meters that can monitor flow and pressures, and we're working with an Israeli company to look at how to look at dynamic flow monitoring, so that we can reduce pressure at night at times of low demand, which will also reduce leaks. So we're actually looking at the whole system from the customer meters to the pipes, smart sensors on the pipe, looking at flows and valves and finding ways that we can do more predictability, more predictive maintenance that reduces cost as well as provide more information to our customers. And the water industry, as you know, is behind the electricity industry on this mainly because of the cost. Water bills aren't as expensive as electricity, and so -- and you also have a very fragmented industry. So you don't have a lot of entities like American Water with the size, scope and scale to actually embark, partner on a lot of these research opportunities. We're very excited about it, and I would tell you that the efficiency we're looking for going forward are much more heavily weighted, as you mentioned, to technology and automation and better ways to do the business.","Operator","And the next question is from Jonathan Reeder of Wells Fargo.","Jonathan Reeder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just have a couple of questions here, if you don't mind. The $0.03 discontinued loss on the sale of Terratec, how much of that was due to the sales price versus operations? Well, perhaps, maybe a better way of asking is how much of a loss from Terratec operations was assumed in your previous guidance range?","Linda G. Sullivan","So there's a couple of questions there, let me -- for the second quarter, what we have included, the loss on sale is $3.8 million, and the remainder of that is associated with the loss from operations, both the second quarter as well as the year-to-date. Included in that loss is a book write-off of taxes of $1.5 million, which, as I mentioned earlier, we were due to the structure of this transaction to monetize about $4 million in tax benefits that we otherwise wouldn't be able to monetize. In terms of the guidance and going forward, in our earnings guidance for 2014, we had a very small loss included in our guidance for Terratec. So it doesn't have a real material impact either this year or going forward.","Susan N. Story","When you look at AWE, Jonathan, it's about 10% of our revenues and even less of operating income. Terratec is even really, really, a really small part of AWE.","Jonathan Reeder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, okay. So I mean, just the way to view it is had we had normal weather your revised range would have been, I guess, what, the -- $2.43 to $2.49?","Linda G. Sullivan","So in our earnings guidance for 2014, we had a very small loss from the operations of Terratec included in that guidance. We did not project the loss on the sale in that guidance, and so it really rounded out from -- in the beginning of the year when we set forth our guidance.","Jonathan Reeder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Right. Right. I'm just saying had you had normal weather in Q3 the revised guidance range, essentially, we could just bump it up $0.05 if we wanted to compare it to -- apples-to-apples to your original range?","Susan N. Story","No, Jonathan, because remember, we built in some variability to our range. So we -- and this is interesting from weather normal, it's always an art, not a science, right? So what happens is when we do our range, part of having a range for us is including some weather variability. So -- and we showed last year at the Investor Day that weather could be plus or minus $0.07, so we build in variability to the weather. So the range that we're guiding to now is what we would have, again, nonweather normalized, just assuming that you have some variability built in, and most companies do that.","Jonathan Reeder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. I got you there. And then going back to New Jersey, could you remind us what the revenue increase cap is on their infrastructure mechanism? And I guess how much have you increased rates under that mechanism thus far?","Walter J. Lynch","Yes, the revenue cap is 7.5%, and we continue to investment within that cap, and we'll be able to do so.","Jonathan Reeder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","How close are you to 7.5% at this juncture?","Linda G. Sullivan","We're making progress.","Walter J. Lynch","We still have some room on that, Jonathan.","Linda G. Sullivan","Making progress on the 7.5%. And remember, Jonathan, we had 2 infrastructure increases this year, a 10.1% in January and then the recent one at 7.4%.","Jonathan Reeder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then you've done a good job lately on the M&A front. I knew you gave us the customer count. Is there any way you can describe it in terms of either -- to the purchase price or kind of the rate base those deals represent?","Walter J. Lynch","Yes, and back -- and to the customers, as Susan said, and we talked about, we're going to be adding 19,000 customers. But the rate base varies obviously and tied back to our acquisition the price there, but anywhere from $20 million to $25 million per.","Susan N. Story","And also to clarify, because some people report it differently, when we say 19,0000 customers, that's actually customer connections. Those are meters, not the number of people, so -- and also interestingly, of those 19,000, 13,500 are wastewater. Very consistent with our target of going after wastewater. And in Arnold, Missouri, we already serve water to those residents.","Walter J. Lynch","And back to Haddonfield, what I meant by that was $28 million was our purchase price for Haddonfield for those 9,000 customers: 4,500 water, 4,500 wastewater.","Linda G. Sullivan","And remember, these were approved through the referendum, but we have not yet closed on those transactions.","Walter J. Lynch","That's right. We've got to get Board of Public Utility approval on that. And again, as I said, that'll take about 6 to 8 months. Typically -- that's typical, and you're looking at mid-2015 before we get that approval.","Jonathan Reeder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Right. Do you have the Arnold and Rushville purchase price handy? Were those disclosed?","Susan N. Story","We don't, but we can get -- whatever is disclosed, we will get to you.","Jonathan Reeder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then last question and I'll hop off. Any idea when the government might act on another military privatization? I mean, you've go the last 2, including one recently? Do you expect more in the near future?","Susan N. Story","Well, predicting the Department of Defense and the Federal Government is an art that we have not perfected yet. We do have outstanding RFP that we -- that actually go back all the way to 2010. And understanding who is going to award when is something we continually monitor, and it depends on the service and it depends on the base quite honestly. A lot of times it depends on the situation they've got with infrastructure. We do have outstanding RFP. We are hearing that the Air Force may also have additional ones that they bid out. So again, it's hard to predict. But let me go back to something else. There's 3 ways that we make money in military. Awarding new awards is something that because it's so difficult to predict, that we work hard on the other 2, which is our O&M contracts. But also, once we have a base, they engage us to look at what the infrastructure needs are on that base. And each year within their budget, we bring down potential projects; and they choose from those projects, which also increases the amount of work we do on bases. So we don't just wait for a big award and say, \"Great, it was success.\" For us, success are all 3 components.","Walter J. Lynch","And Jonathan, one thing, one correction. On the DSIC in New Jersey, the cap is 5% of revenues, not 7.5%. I want to correct that for the record here.","Operator","The next question is from Spencer Joyce of Hilliard Lyons.","Spencer E. Joyce - Hilliard Lyons, Research Division","Just wanted to touch very briefly on the ballot initiatives that were approved. I think from our standpoint it was very positive see a New Jersey, Missouri and Indiana kind of across the footprint approvals there. And my question is, did you all go 3 for 3 on these initiatives? Or were there a handful that maybe weren't approved?","Walter J. Lynch","No, I'd like to -- we're batting a 1,000, 3 for 3. Really, I think the recipe for success here was make sure that our employees and the community leaders were hand in hand, talking about the value that American Water can provide to the communities. That's really what I think was driver of success in all 3 of those.","Susan N. Story","And Spencer, what was even more exciting, we didn't just win the ballot initiatives; we were 2 to 1 or greater on all of them in favor of, and that's what we were very proud of.","Spencer E. Joyce - Hilliard Lyons, Research Division","And I thought you all may have insinuated this a little bit, but these weren't areas where perhaps the American Water brand was already somewhat of a household name. Is that correct?","Walter J. Lynch","Well, I'll tell you in Haddonfield, New Jersey, we surround the system, so we have a big presence in this area. So the brand is very -- is out there and -- that's right. And also, in Arnold, we bought the wastewater system, but we have the water customers. So our brand has been out there, and I think that's helped us. But the key to this has been our passionate employees going door-to-door and talking about, again, the value that American Water can bring to the community.","Operator","And our next question comes from Shivangi Tipnis from Guggenheim (sic) [Global Hunter Securities].","Shivangi Tipnis - Global Hunter Securities, LLC, Research Division","I just wanted to ask you about your CapEx of Q4. Your guide -- your earlier guidance in Q2 said it was about $1.1 billion, and year-to-date, it's about $700 million, and you expected it to be now $1 billion for the full year. So I was wondering if the Q3 CapEx was less than what your earlier anticipated? Or are you expecting a little lower CapEx, about $100 million lower, in Q4?","Linda G. Sullivan","Yes, this is Linda, let me answer that. The CapEx for the third quarter was what we expected. That was related to the regulated investments. What we are seeing this year is lower than planned investment on the acquisition side. And so that has enabled us to deploy more capital in certain areas on the regulated side, and that's really a timing issue associated when we deploy the capital.","So yes, we're still on plan for $1 billion, and we -- as a result of the timing issues associated with the acquisition, we have been able to deploy more capital on the regulated side.","Susan N. Story","And that's why, Shivangi, we started looking at a 5-year capital plan. Prior to 2014, we reported capital year-to-year. We know that by separately disclosing last year's strategic and regulated acquisition capital apart from regulated investment capital that there would be some years that because of delays in being able to close on a deal, for example, if you have to have a referendum, et cetera. So what we saw is, just as Linda said, that you're going to have some timing issues. So that's we disclosed now our 5-year capital plan.","Shivangi Tipnis - Global Hunter Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Sounds good. My next question, actually on the gallon usage on your Slide 23 based on the customer class. The weather impact are primarily related, I guess, to your residential usage of water and -- especially on the outdoor activities. However, your commercial and public gallon usage appears to have declined about 4% and 3%. How do you understand these declines? And can you just provide some color on this?","Linda G. Sullivan","Absolutely, there's actually quite a bit of noise that's included in these numbers because we implemented our customer information system last year in 2 waves. And so the third quarter of 2013 includes a time period in the first wave of the implementation to where we were looking at our bill in more detail to make sure that they were appropriate before we sent them out. And so in the industrial class mainly, we have lower bill water sales volume because we were holding those bills, and so there are some timing issues there as well. If we were to kind of normalize that, we would expect our industrial usage to be more in line with what we have seen historically.","Walter J. Lynch","Yes, and one more point on the Arnold acquisition. The total purchase price is $13 million, and that's got to be trued up as we work through the approval process. We're buying the collection system, not the treatment plant, and that's why is a little bit on the low end as far as the total purchase price for the number of customers. I just want to provide that clarification to everyone.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Susan Story for any closing remarks.","Susan N. Story","Thank you so much. I appreciate all of you on the call. I know that we typically are at the tail end of a very long quarterly earnings call season, and that you all are very tired, and we appreciate the time and effort. I just want to close with just a couple of sentences. And I just have to tell you, and Walter mentioned it and so did Linda, we had a really good financial quarter. We are poised for long-term growth and healthy -- and a healthy company, and it's is because of the employees we've got. I cannot tell you enough, going around looking at expertise; but as Walter said, the passion that our employees have for our customers and for growth and finding ways not just to grow the numbers for financials but to bring new customers in on our system so that they can enjoy the benefit that our current customers do. So it's a great time to be in the water business. We look forward to a great year end, and we hope that everything goes well for you all. And if Jonathan Reeder is still on this call, I just want to tell you War Eagle. See you all next quarter.","Operator","The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

And as usual, we'll keep our call to about an hour; and at the end of our prepared remarks, we will have time for questions.","But before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that during the course of this conference call, both in our prepared remarks and in answers to your questions, we may make statements related to future performance. Our statements represent our most reasonable estimates. However, since these statements deal with future events, they are subject to numerous risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual performance of American Water to be materially different from the performance indicated or implied by such statements.

We will be happy to answer any questions or provide further classifications if needed during our Q&A session. All statements in this call relating to earnings per share refer to diluted earnings per share.","And now I'd like to turn the call over to American Water's President and CEO, Susan Story.","Susan Story","Thanks, Ed. Good morning everyone, and thanks for joining us. With me today are Linda Sullivan, our CFO, who will go over the fourth quarter and year-end financial results; and Walter Lynch, our COO and President of Regulated Operations, who will give key updates on our Regulated Business. Also joining us today is the newest member of our executive leadership team, Mike Sgro, who was announced last week as our Senior Vice President and General Counsel.","Mike is a 22-year employee of the company who has a deep understanding of our business, our customers and our employees. We are excited to have him join our leadership team. So onto business, the employees of American Water delivered strong results in 2014 for both the fourth quarter and the full year. With customers at the centre of all we do we made smart and timely investments in our infrastructure to ensure the continued reliable delivery of clean and safe water and water services, and we leveraged our increasing operating efficiency gains and technology deployment to ensure continued affordability for our customers.","As you can see on Slide 5, our year-over-year revenues increased 4.6% to just over $3 billion. Adjusted net income from continuing operations was at 10% to $2.43 per share. The increase in EPS is due to the successful execution of our strategy, which Walter and Linda will discuss in just a few minutes.","Turning now to Slide 6, you see we delivered on our strategies in both the regulated and the market-based businesses in 2014. We made about $1 billion in infrastructure investment, which is $100 million more we originally planned. This increased investment is due to the hard work of our employees and our continuous improvement in both O&M and capital efficiency. It also demonstrates our flexibility to deliver on our growth goals, while keeping customer bills affordable. These needed investments help improve service reliability and water quality for our customers, but the full value of these investments go beyond infrastructure renewal.","Our investments also pay dividends by creating jobs and helping the economies of our community. According to data from the Water Research Foundation every $1 million of infrastructure investment creates five direct jobs and 11 indirect jobs. This means our total investment of $1 billion in 2014 helped fuel about 16,000 jobs in the communities and the states we serve.","Using this framework, over the past five years we have created about 75,000 jobs, and looking to the next five years our $5.2 billion in regulated infrastructure investment out of our total $6 billion capital budget equals over 83,000 new jobs. In addition to regulated capital investment in 2014, we also grew our company through regulated acquisitions. We formally closed on 13 acquisitions adding about 4500 customers to our regulated footprint and we have 11 announced pending acquisitions for an additional 21,500 customers.","Additionally, in a joint press conference on February 3, the City of Mt. Vernon and Illinois American announced an agreement in principle for us to purchase their water and wastewater system, which serve about 6500 water customers and 6200 wastewater customers. The parties are working to finalize details of the transaction and a city council vote is expected in the near future. Constructive regulatory mechanism and legislation in many of our states help us to make needed investments for the benefit of our customers, while minimizing their bill impact.","Some of the newer and more progressive actions that provide these opportunities include New Jersey\u2019s new Water Infrastructure Protection Act signed into law just this year, Pennsylvania\u2019s wastewater DSIC mechanism, which became effective January 1 and Tennessee\u2019s year-old investment in economic development riders and environmental pass through clause.","Our market based business also had an excellent year. Our military services group won two competitively bid contracts within the US Department of Defense, and our Homeowner Services group expanded into eight new states and received notice of intent to be awarded an exclusive utility services protection agreement with the Orlando\u2019s Utility Commission.","In 2015, we will be launching this exclusive partnership, which will include our water line, sewer line and in-home plumbing and interior electric protection program. Additionally, our exclusive partnerships with the City of New York and Nashville\u2019s Metro Water Services continue to grow as does our contract with Burlington Iowa, which was recently renewed.","American Water values our public-private partnership, also known as PPP, and we enjoy partnering with these strong and successful public entities in mutually beneficial initiatives. And always critically important, we show on Slide 7 our ongoing commitment to our shareholders. The American Water board of directors again declared quarterly cash dividend payments in 2014 and raised the dividend to $0.31 per share this past May.","We are proud to note that we have increased our dividend every year since our IPO in 2008, and we\u2019re one of the fastest dividend growing utilities in the nation. In fact, in the last one, three and five-year periods we have achieved top quartile dividend paid growth compared to the companies in the Dow Jones Utility Average and our water peers.","We are reaffirming our 2015 earnings guidance from continuing operations to be in the range of $2.55 to $2.65 per share. This is despite the headwind of increased pension expenses due to mortality table changes of around $0.03 per share and our previously disclosed estimate of West Virginia legal cost of about $0.02 per share. As noted, this $0.05 is included in our affirmed guidance range. Linda will discuss this issue in more detail in just a few minutes. We remain confident in our ability to deliver on our long-term EPS growth goals of 7% to 10% through 2019, anchored from our 2013 earnings.","With that Walter will now give an update on our regulated business.","Walter Lynch","Thanks Susan and good morning everyone. As Susan mentioned we are very pleased with our accomplishments in 2014. Our regulated operations achieved significant growth, continued our commitment to investing in infrastructure and through increased efficiency and effective cost management, we were able to mitigate the rate impacts to our customers.","A good example of this is our recent New Jersey rate filing. Last month New Jersey American Water filed with the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities for a rate increase of slightly less than 10%. The company\u2019s last filing was 3.5 years ago and since then the company invested more than $775 million to replace, rehabilitate and upgrade its treatment, pumping and distribution facilities statewide. By our continued focus on efficiencies, the company actually reduced its operating and maintenance expenses by more than $19 million.","We estimate that every $1 in O&M expense reduction allows a capital investment of about $6 with no impact on customer bills. So that $19 million in cost reduction supported approximately $125 million in investment with no impact on customer bills. If approved, this file the typical residential customer\u2019s average monthly water bill will increase approximately $5 to $8 per month and the majority of our waste water customers will see no increase and some will actually see a small decrease.","In this filing the company filed a consolidated tax adjustment methodology as per the new BPU policy. Additionally through our DSIC filings we renewed over 160 miles of mains, valves, hydrants and other eligible assets. So you can clearly see that through cost reduction, efficiency improvement and regulatory mechanisms like DSIC we\u2019re making the needed infrastructure improvements to ensure reliability and quality for our customers, while keeping the cost of that service affordable.","Moving onto California, our subsidiary, California American Water, along with three other Class A water companies have reached an agreement with the California Public Utility Commission to defer the next cost of capital application to March 31, 2016. So this extends our authorized return on equity of 9.99% through 2016.","Lastly we reached a settlement in our Indiana rate case filing. The agreement includes a forward-looking rate base with an increase in ROE to 9.75%. The $5.1 million or 2.6% increase in operating revenues is based on more than $220 million of investment in our water and wastewater systems across the state balanced by reducing our operating and maintenance expenses.","Similar to New Jersey, our $5.5 million in cost reductions in Indiana supported approximately $33 million of investment with no impact on customer bills. For most of the companies\u2019 residential customers this increase in water rates is approximately 2% of the current bill or just under $0.03 per day. ","I also want to give you a brief update on the train derailment that occurred in West Virginia last week. As many have heard in media reports, on February 16 West Virginia American Water\u2019s Montgomery treatment plant was shut down as a precaution after a train carrying crude oil derailed beside a tributary of the Kanawha River and that was a few miles upstream of our plant. For clarification, this was a different plant than the one that was impacted by the Freedom Industries\u2019 chemical spill.","Our customers in the Montgomery area, who had water until the system\u2019s storage was depleted, were notified of the shutdown and our team in West Virginia sourced local bottle water supplies as well as larger supplies of water for our customers. The West Virginia National Guard 35th Civil Support Team and technicians at our laboratory performed three rounds of water quality testing confirming that water quality samples taken at different locations at the river and at the plant showed non-detectable levels of the components of crude oil.","Following our discussions with the West Virginia Bureau for Public Health we restarted the plant at 1 PM on February 17, starting the restoration of service for fire protection and sanitation, and we subsequently issued a precautionary boil water advisory for customers.","Water service was restored to all customers on the morning of February 18, and the precautionary boil water advisory was lifted just before 1 PM on February 19 after the results of water quality testing confirmed that water quality met all the drinking water standards. And once again our team in West Virginia has done an outstanding job in this event.","Turning to Slide 11, you can see how our significant progress in driving operating efficiencies in our business over the last few years has really made a positive impact. Our O&M efficiency ratio has gone from 44.2% in 2010 to 36.7% in 2014. As many of you know, our initial target was to be at or below 40% by 2015. So we actually met our goal a couple of years early.","Thanks to the remarkable achievement of our employees in driving costs out of the business and as a result of our sharp focus on continuous improvement we established a new long-term target of 34% or less by 2020. I talked about the impact of this in our New Jersey rate case specifically, but this achievement can be seen in all of our rate filings. A few years ago nearly half of our revenue requirement in rate filings was based on recovery of operating expenses.","In a very short period of time, we have successfully turned that around until recovery of invested capital. By 2013, 95% of our revenue requirements in our filings was due to recovery of capital and in 2014, we reached the 100% mark for filings that went into effect that year.","Actually this story is even better than this because as I noted earlier our O&M cost reductions have allowed us to make significant investments without corresponding revenue requirement increases. As I have said all these efforts to operate as efficiently as possible enable us to minimize rate impacts on our customers. Our five year plan calls for an average price increase in customer bills of about 2%, which is in line with the current rate of inflation. We are thrilled with this progress and once again it goes back to putting the customers at the centre of everything we do. ","I will now turn the call over to Linda for a more detailed review of our financial performance.","Linda Sullivan","Thank you, Walter and good morning everyone. ","I will start on Slide 13. This is a new format intended to expand the transparency of our disclosure based on feedback from you and other investors by showing the contribution to earnings per share by each business segment for 2014. On the left side of the page we show our typical annual and fourth-quarter results. Adjusted EPS from continuing operation was $2.43 per share, up 10% over last year and for the quarter was $0.52 per share, up 8% over the same period last year.","On the right side of the page is where we add a disclosure to show the contribution to 2014 adjusted EPS from each business segment. The regulated segment continues to be the largest contributor towards earnings at $2.45 per share. Our market based businesses contributed $0.22 per share and our parent company drag, which is primarily interest expense on the parent debt generated from the RWE acquisition of American Water was $0.24 per share. On a year-over-year basis, the adjusted EPS of each of our regulated and market based segments grew at about 10%. I trust you find this new format helpful. ","Now let me discuss the different components of our fourth-quarter adjusted EPS growth from continuing operations on Slide 14. Our starting point is fourth-quarter 2013 adjusted EPS from continuing operations of $0.48 per share, which excludes last year\u2019s cost of the tender offer of $0.14. ","The fourth quarter of 2014 came in $0.04 above 2013 adjusted EPS at $0.52 per share. The major drivers of this $0.04 increase were first, $0.02 from higher regulated revenue, which is the net impact of authorized rate increases and incremental revenue due to acquisition, partially offset by decreased demand as we continue to experience declining usage in the 1% to 2% annually.","Next earnings per share of our market based businesses was up $0.03 per share driven by additional projects associated with our military contracts and growth in homeowner services, mainly with our New York City contracts as well as expansion into other geographic areas. ","Lastly we had higher depreciation expense of about $0.01 per share principally from growth associated with our capital investment programs at the regulated business. In the appendix of this slide deck we have included our revenue and expense bridge slide to provide more detail to the variances I just discussed.","One Slide 15, we show our annual EPS bridge. Similar to the fourth quarter we had increases in regulated revenues and market based businesses, offset by higher depreciation and taxes. I will not cover this in detail today as most items are duplicative to what I discussed on the previous slide and in previous earnings calls.","Now let me cover the regulatory highlights on Slide 16, which shows rate cases and infrastructure filings awaiting final order and new rates that become effective in 2014 through today. In terms of pending rate cases, we are awaiting orders for the general rate cases in three states for a combined total rate request of $57.1 million, which includes our New Jersey rate case filed in January, which Walter discussed earlier. Also we continue to await a proposed decision in our California rate case settlement with ORA and other intervenors, and our Tennessee subsidiary filed for additional annualized revenues from infrastructure investment charges of $2.4 million.","For rates that became effective in 2014 and through today we received $88.4 million in additional annualized revenues from general rate cases, step increases and infrastructure surcharges. This includes the Indiana rate case settlement which became effective in January. These are the highlights of these cases and we advise you to review the footnotes in the appendix for a fuller understanding of particular cases.","Also in the appendix, you will find an updated slide of our largest 10 states and their authorized rate base and allowed return on equity. Slide 17 is a summary dashboard of our performance in 2014. Through successful execution of our strategy, we achieved increases in all metrics, earnings per share, cash flow from operations, and return on equity, while increasing our investments in infrastructure to $1 billion for the year.","On slide 18, we are reaffirming our 2015 earnings guidance from continuing operations to be in the range of $2.55 to $2.65 per share. Please note that within this guidance range, we have a revision from our December guidance call. We have adopted the new mortality tables issued by the Society of Actuaries which increases pension and other postretirement benefits expense by $0.03 per share. By driving additional cost savings and efficiencies we are now absorbing this $0.03 impact within the guidance range.","Also as a reminder, the 2015 guidance already includes as part of that range, a $0.02 impact due to West Virginia legal costs from the Freedom Industry\u2019s chemical spell.","Now, let\u2019s talk about variables to the guidance range. Weather of course is the biggest variable. Our guidance range is expected to cover normal weather variability, weather extremes beyond this band are not included in the guidance range, as this has been our practice, we will continue to quantify and disclose weather impacts for greater transparency.","We also expect a certain amount of volatility in the regulated business, mainly from the timing and amount of rate case decisions and O&M expense variability. In the market-based businesses, we experienced volatility around the timing of awarding new contracts, military price determinations and the opportunity for additional contracts and partnerships. And lastly Shell activity could vary\u00b1 a penny.","On the right side of the page is a look at the expected growth for 2015 by category consistent with our earnings guidance.","With that I\u2019ll turn it back over to Susan.","Susan Story","Thanks, Linda. Last year we began concluding each of our earnings call by highlighting initiatives or recent news that maybe outside of what we would typically covered during this call.","This quarter we are going to highlight American Water\u2019s Activity in the Shell Energy Market which is based on our ability to provide water services in a sustainable, environmentally responsible manner to our customers into the communities we are privileged to serve.","On the regulated side of our business, our Pennsylvania American Water subsidiary currently have 45 active connections to the Shell Energy Well. We sold 604 million gallons of water to gas producers in 2014. While most energy companies have reduced their 2015 CapEx spending projections, many of these companies have delivery commitments to midstream pipelines and so they should continue to drill in 2015 to make those commitments. The E&T companies we partnered continue to rely on us as a primary source of water for Shell Gas development activities in Western Pennsylvania.","The overall oil and gas activity in the state increased only about 10% in 2014 over 2013 but our water sales have increased at a much greater rate. The increase in 2014 revenues was due to a number of infrastructure improvement projects that became operational during the latter part of the year.","The same factors are expected to support similar performance in water sales for Pennsylvania American in 2015. Consistently, the Marcellus and Utica are considered by the E&P companies as their lower cost gas place to develop and they should remain so. Further, a large number of our regulated water services followed in the Marcellus wet gas region, which historically has been more profitable than the dry gas area.","In our market-based business, focused on Shell, we're exploring longer-term water supply plans with key producers. With reduced CapEx in place for many of these companies, we could possibly see opportunities for water supply contracts as the E&P\u2019s focus there for prioritize capital for well developments rather than ancillary services. It is uncertain how this will play out but American Water is evaluating various scenarios. As a reminder, market-based Shell represents 0% to 1% of our EPS growth triangle for 2015 and 0% to 2% of our long term earnings growth plan.","While we are pursuing opportunities in this area, we are disciplined in our approach and we don't have to rely on Shell to hit our long-term EPS guidance.","With the opportunity Shell presents for our nation\u2019s present and future energy security and for our company 's potential role in that future, we announced the last week that Karl Kurz was elected as an independent member of the American Water Board of Directors. Karl is the former chief operating officer at Anadarko Petroleum Corporation, one of the largest independent oil and gas exploration and production companies in the world. Most recently, Karl served as the Managing Director of CCMP Capital Advisors, a global private equity firm. WE are excited to have somebody with Karl\u2019s experience to become part of American Water.","And with that we are happy to take any questions you might have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from James Ward of Macquarie Capital. Please go ahead.","James Ward","Could you give us a bit more color on acquisitions of wastewater systems and roughly how many anticipate for the next year or two?","Walter Lynch","This is Walter, I\u2019ll take that question. It\u2019s one of our strategic focus areas as growing on the wastewater side and we've been in discussions with a number of municipalities and just that acquiring the wastewater systems and you can see from some of the acquisitions we have done over the last year, that has really hold. We are going to continue to have those discussions primarily at the state level, the state teams are focused on having those discussions and convincing the municipality that there's a benefit to becoming part of American Water and we've been pretty successful there, but it is a key focus area for us and we are going to continue to have those discussions and hope so of acquiring the systems.","James Ward","So just to get a sense number-wise, do you see it probably coming along the same pace, do you see an acceleration, just trying to -- from a modeling perspective trying to get a sense of how many you would see going forward.","Walter Lynch","So far, I mean we are adding about two-thirds wastewater and one-third water. It shows I think the opportunity that we have within the marketplace that wastewater is a prime opportunity for us to continue to grow. So we think it would be continuing on that way, maybe it\u2019s half to two-thirds on the wastewater side but it's hard to give numbers at this point. ","James Ward","Sure, okay. Thank you very much. And my second question can be a bigger picture, on 7% to 10% EPS range how do you see over the next few years, particularly may be on \u201915 where do you see things shaping up, a little bit closer to the higher or lower end.","Susan Story","As always, we give our guidance range to be the 255 to 265.","James Ward","Fair enough. Okay. Congratulations again guys thanks a lot.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Brian Chan of Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Brian Chan","Just a general quick questions, some of the other utilities out there that report this quarter have made a few comments on bonus depreciation, I don\u2019t think I heard any comments from you guys on that regard but just any color you can give on how we should think about that for you guys going forward.","Linda Sullivan","Remember, we are in a net operating loss position. So we are currently evaluating the bonus depreciation deduction for 2014 and its impact on each state as well as the overall NOL utilization of the company and we have until September 2015 to make the final decision there.","Brian Chan","Okay great. I will take a look at that point and what you have decided to do. Thank I appreciate it.","Linda Sullivan","Operator, are there any other questions, if not I can go to closing? ","Operator","At this time, I see no further questions.","Linda Sullivan","Well, just in closing I just want to recognize and pay tribute to our outgoing investor relations VP Edward Vallejo. Ed has headed up our IR functions since our IPO back in 2008 and I think he is the very best in the entire utility industry. So same leadership skill, financial acumen, customer focus and knowledge and experience let us to promote him to his new position of VP of Financial Strategy planning and decision support. In his new role, Ed will have all of the state and division finance directors reporting to him as well as overall responsibility for financial strategy and planning and he will lead our newly formed revenue analytics group.","Despite this big new job, he has continued in the IR VP role to help us through the transition. Just to remind you of what is taking place in Ed tenure, check out the total shareholder return in the market Cap chart from the slide which you see. As you can see we are very proud of what Ed has done only to be a cliff but what he is going to do for us in his new role, thanks Ed we are happy you are part of our team. And he did not know I was going to do this! But you should see his face right now. So with that thanks everybody for participating. We appreciate it and we will talk to you again in the couple or three months.","Operator","The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation.

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. With me today are Linda Sullivan, our CFO, who will go over the third quarter financial results; and Walter Lynch, our COO, who will give key updates on our operations.","But before we give you the summary of our third quarter results, I'd like to comment on the announcement we made on Monday. We have a binding global settlement in principle approved by the federal court for all consolidated claims in both federal and state courts in West Virginia arising from the Freedom Industry's chemical spiel on January 9, 2014.","This settlement is not an admission of any liability or fault on the part of our company or our employees. As a matter of record, Freedom Industries, as a company as well as six of their employees including three officers, has quite guilty to criminal violation of the Clean Water Act, as a result of the Chemical Spill.","In comparison, West Virginia American Water has not been found to have violated any law or regulations in connection with the Chemical Spill. We firmly believe the suites brought against us are without merit and resulted at least in part due to the bankruptcy of Freedom Industries and their limited ability to pay claims. As noted in the recent report that the Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board, the Freedom Industries Chemical Spill was preventable, had Freedom followed proper procedures.","Additionally, the Federal Court dismissed all claims against American Water parent company, and our service company in pre-trial decisions nor is either a party to the Class Action Litigation in State Court. So, why did we decide the settle these cases. First, we believe it is in the best interest of our customers, our company and especially our West Virginia employees. They are the people who work hard to deliver the highest standard of customer service possible, regardless of the challenges they face.","Second, this resolution allows us to serve our customers without the distractions and potentially significant expenses of Federal and State Litigation over the next several years, which Linda will quantify in a few minutes.","And third these distractions and expenses are further compounded by a couple of facts. West Virginia is our only regulated state in American Water with severely limited protections against claims of damages arising from outages or interruptions of services. Even electric and gas utilities in the state are more protected as our municipalities. Additionally, these trials would have occurred in the state that historically has been highly favorable to the point as far. While West Virginia passed meaningful tort reform measures in 2015, the law suits filed by plaintiffs in these cases were filed before the new measures took effect.","Now let me turn the call over to Linda to comment on the financial element of the proposed global settlements.","Linda Sullivan","Thanks, Susan. Let me start with the earnings impact. The aggregate amount of the binding global agreement in principal is $126 million pre-tax. Our portion is $65 million with the remaining $61 coming from some of our insurers. In the third quarter, we recorded our $65 million portion of the settlement, net of committed insurance receivables as an after tax charge of $39 million or $0.22 per share which was recorded on the books of West Virginia American Water.","I would like to point out that two of our insurers that we asked to participate in the settlement have presently not agreed to participate in the settlement. Their insurance coverage level is up to $50 million in the aggregate. We intend to actively pursue recovery from these two insurers and in fact last Friday West Virginia American Water filed suit against one of these insurers in West Virginia and we will pursue arbitration against the other. We firmly believe that these insurers had a responsibility to participate appropriately. In terms of the structure of the settlement \u2013 the structure of the settlement","Page six lays off the components of the structure for both our settlement of $126 million as well as another $25 million funded under a separate settlement agreement between the plaintiffs and the Eastman Chemical Company. The structure establishes a two-tier payments of claims made up of the guaranteed fund and claims-based payments.","Let me discuss the guaranteed fund first. In our settlement, the guaranteed fund will be $76 million of which our portion would be $51 million and in the insurance will contribute $25 million. The two reserves that I mentioned earlier who did not participate in the settlement were after commit coverage to the guaranteed fund.","Their insurance coverage level is at the $50 million in the aggregate. We have not recorded in accounts receivable from these two insurers but we are actively pursuing recovery as I mentioned earlier.","As the chart shows, Eastman's $25 million is in the guaranteed fund. The total $101 million in the guaranteed fund must be exhausted before any claims-based payments are made.","Now, let me cover the claims-based payments. In our settlement, the claims-based payments would be up to $50 million, of which our portion would be up to $14 million and a number of our insurance carriers committed to contribute up to $36 million.","I trust that this chart helps to explain the structure of the settlement. Let me now discuss a few other points, as part of the settlement, West Virginia American Water agreed it will not seek rate recovery from the West Virginia Public Service Commission for the amounts included under this settlement, and for approximately $4 million in direct response costs expensed in 2014, relating to the chemical fill. In terms of cash flow, we intend to fund West Virginia settlement payments through existing sources of liquidity. Funding is not expected to begin until the settlement is final, estimated to occur in the first half of next year.","Let me also discuss legal fee. We estimate that future defense cost could easily have been $25 million or more over the next several years, have we gone through all trials in the case for federal and state. And these are only the estimated legal expenses and do not account for other expected impact that results from significant litigations, such as management's time and attention, and then, ongoing distraction to our employees in West Virginia, who are focused on delivering water service to our customers in that state.","I'll now turn it back to Susan.","Susan Story","Thanks, Linda. We believe strongly that these uncertainties, distractions and anticipated expenses wanted a global settlement at this time. Again, despite the fact that we believe this suits broad against West Virginia American Water or without merit. In terms of next step, the terms of the settlement must be finalized and approved by the court, notice of the terms of the settlement must be provided to the settlement quest members, and then, a final fairness hearing will be held before the final approval of the settlement.","We anticipate this final hearing should occur in the first half of 2017. The Freedom Industries' chemical spill was a challenging time for the West Virginia community, our customers and our employees. We are looking forward, and as we have for our 130 years as a company, our focus is on serving our customers clean, safe, reliable and affordable water.","So, with that, let's discuss our third quarter performance because outside of this week's news of the pending resolution of ligation, our employees continue to consistently deliver great results across our business with their outstanding dedication and commitment to our customers. Excelling at fundamentals is critically important in any business, we get that, and this is why we continue to invest in our water and wastewater system, while at the same time increasing our operating efficiency to reduce cost impacts on our customers.","We also continue to grow our regulated businesses based on our demonstrated core competencies in customer care. Our people are providing solutions and value to customers and communities across our footprint and this is what drives our consistent results.","Slide 7 highlights how we have executed our strategy. It starts with providing reliable service through capital investment in our regulated operations. During the first nine months of the year, we invested $905 million in capital with a majority dedicated toward our regulated operation to improve water and wastewater systems. It also included $24 million for regulated acquisition. We plan to invest between $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion this year with about $1.2 billion of that amount in regulated infrastructure investments.","This level of investment is balanced by our continued focus on first, controlling O&M cost, then spending every capital dollar efficiently and finally, utilizing constructive regulatory mechanisms. We're extremely proud of our employees\u2019 efforts to improve efficiency and their commitment comes from a deeply ingrained culture at American Water to provide the best quality service to our customers at an affordable price. Walter will give you a little more background on some of these efforts in just a few minutes.","Having the reputation of doing what is right for our customers also contributes to our growth. This year, we've already welcomed 10,700 new customers just from acquisitions and the total of 10,000 more customers from organic growth. We also have signed agreement representing another 67,800 customers pending regulatory approvals.","As we've discussed in the first two quarterly calls this year, we faced headwinds in our market-based businesses in 2016. We continue to see reductions in capital upgrade projects in our Military Services Group compared to previous years. This is due to decreases in base infrastructure budgets as well as the completion earlier this year of a very large multi-year capital upgrade projects we had in one of our military bases.","We see improving conditions in natural gas drilling plants in Appalachian basin and our Keystone Clearwater subsidiary continues to increase its market share from about 20% when we bought the company in July of 2015 to about 35% today. However, due to the timing of ramp ups and work completion schedules, at this time we still view Keystone as being EPS neutral for this year.","Our Homeowner Services business continues to grow especially through municipal partnerships and expansion of services we offer. To-date, we have about 1.7 million customer contracts, which serve 833,000 customers in 43 states and Washington DC. This business is seeing a very active national market with several municipal RFPs in process.","We believe that our market base businesses remain strong long-term place and they leverage our core competencies in water and waste water treatment and management. We strategically limit their impact to our overall risk profile. These businesses are also very capital light with a vast majority of our investments made in our regulated business.","Moving onto slide 8. Adjusted earnings were $1.05 per share for the third quarter, excluding the Freedom Industries settlement, a 9.4% increase above third quarter 2015. For the first nine months in 2016, EPS increased 8.6%. Our continued strong results enable us to revise our adjusted earnings guidance to the upper end of our prior range, plus a $0.01, so from $2.75 per share to $2.85 per share to $2.81 per share to $2.86 per share, again excluding the Freedom Industries settlement. We also continue our progress toward achieving our long-term goal of 7% to 10% EPS growth through 2020.","And with that, Walter will now give you his update on our operations.","Walter Lynch","Thanks, Susan. Good morning, everyone. During the third quarter and year-to-date, our employees continue to demonstrate their expertise and scale in delivering reliable and safe water services to our customers.","Once again we've made smart investments, achieved growth through the solutions we offered to communities and we continue to maximize efficiencies to help keep costs down. Our commitment to invest in our infrastructure while focusing on efficiency of operations, to balance customer costs is front and center in the regulatory request we made this year.","In Kentucky, our rate case Settlement was approved and we've received an order for $6.5 million of additional annualized revenues. As part of the rate order, the PSC eliminated the former 45% equity ratio cap, this allows for some flexibility in how we finance our investments in that state.","In California, we filed a general rate case in July 1, seeking $51 million in annualized revenues over the three years. We also received approval to begin construction of our new pipeline associated with Monterey, Peninsula Water Supply project, which is due to start of this project, which is due to start this month.","This marks another significant milestone in a multi-year approach to solving a water supply issues for residences and businesses in that area. And in Pennsylvania, the Public Utility Commission last month approved our proposed acquisitions of the wastewater assets of the Scranton Sewer Authority, which I'll discuss in a moment.","Turning to slide 11, in the third quarter, record warmth and lower rainfall swept through many of our largest service areas, especially in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. Well, some areas we serve are wetter than usual mainly in Missouri and Illinois, the overall effect was higher weather impact at water sales. We estimate the impact to our net revenues to be approximately $6 million.","Also of note, on October 21, the New Jersey DEP issued a drought warning in four of the six designated drought regions. While we do have production facilities in these designated drought areas. We have the ability and capacity to transfer water to the impacted regions as authorized by the DEP. Currently we're in discussions with the DEP and we stand ready to help.","On slide 12, you can see success we've had in executing our growth strategy by providing solutions to water and wastewater challenges across our footprint. As Susan said, our pending and closed agreements represent about 78,500 customers. In New Jersey, we've filed with the Board of Public Utilities on October 28 for approval of the Shorelands acquisition, which is 11,000 water customers. We anticipate approval in the first half of 2017.","In Pennsylvania, we have our two largest pending acquisitions this year. The wastewater assets of the Scranton Sewer Authority as well as the Municipal Authority of the city of McKeesport. Together, these systems represent more than 50,000 customers. Regarding Scranton the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission in October approved our application authorizing the acquisition. The commission's approval is an important positive step forward in the regulatory review process and it reflects the hard work by our Pennsylvania team and partnership with the Sewer Authority to secure the necessary approvals.","We remain confident that we'll receive all the necessary remaining approvals, close the acquisition and begin providing quality waste water service to Scranton and Dunmore before the end of 2016.","Finally this week, we close on our acquisition of the Borough of New Cumberland Wastewater System adding 3,100 customers to our Pennsylvania footprint.","Moving to slide 13. Once again we continue to improve our O&M efficiency ratio, achieving 34.9% for the last 12 months. We remain on track to meet our O&M efficiency target of 34% by 2020. This tremendous effort by our employees is centered on bringing value to our customers. Once again, let me provide you with a couple of examples of what we're doing to drive these results.","In Indiana, we completed a local project to digitize customer requests to locate underground assets, so that customers can excavate on their own property. Known internally as he locate this project which uses our GIS data has improved our response time, reduced labor and improved accuracy and customer satisfaction on these customer requests. E-locate has been replicated now across six states and has provided over $1 million in annualized cost savings and efficiencies. Another example is our investment in enterprise software and meter data management, which is beginning to pay off efficiency gains, which continue to improve our performance, closing in on near 100% in actual meter reach for billing. We've seen cost savings of over $1 million as we reduced the time spent hamming exceptions. And again, every dollar we save in O&M costs we can invest $7 in capital with no impact on our customers' bills.","And now, I'll turn the call over to Linda for a more detail on our third quarter financial results.","Linda Sullivan","Thank you, Walter. In the third quarter of 2016, American Water reported earnings of","$0.83 per share including the $0.22 charge for the Freedom Industry settlement. Excluding this charge, adjusted earnings per share were a $1.05; 9.4% higher than the third quarter of last year. As shown on slide 15, our regulated segment was up $0.10 per share, our Market-Based businesses were down $0.03 and the parent was favorable $0.02.","For the nine months ended September 30, our adjusted earnings per share were $2.27, up $0.18 or 8.6% compared to the prior year. As with the quarter, these results were driven by our regulated segment which was up $0.22. And both our Market-Based businesses and parent were each down $0.02 per share.","Turning to slide 16, let me discuss the quarterly results by business segment. For the third quarter, adjusted earnings for our regulated businesses increased $0.10 per share. The largest driver of growth with regulated revenue which was up $0.15 per share. Of that $0.15, approximately $0.14 was from additional revenue authorized to rate cases and infrastructure mechanisms to support investment growth, as well as some fluctuations in balancing accounts; and $0.01 was from acquisitions and organic growth.","As Walter mentioned, we experienced hot dry weather throughout much of our service area this quarter, especially in New Jersey, which increased revenue by more than $12 million. This was partially offset by wet conditions in Missouri and Illinois, which decreased revenue by about $6 million. Net-net, we had a pickup in revenue of about $6 million this quarter compared to normal weather conditions. Although the year-over-year third quarter weather impact was zero.","Next, adjusted O&M expense increased $0.03 per share this quarter. There are \u2013 were lots of pluses and minuses here, but among the drivers were higher production and employee-related costs, partially offset by lower insurance cost. We're also experiencing some O&M timing this year, as more than $10 million of regulated O&M is now expected to be complete in the last quarter of the year. This includes dampening expenses, certain maintenance and repairs, as well as some project delays.","Next, depreciation expense increased $0.02 per share from regulated investment growth. In the market based businesses, our third quarter results were $0.03 lower than last year's, due mainly to lower capital upgrades at our military bases. The year-over-year reduction in capital upgrades is driven by two factors.","The first is a reduction in military base infrastructure budget and the second is the completion of an $85 million capital upgrade project at Fort Polk that contributed revenue in 2015, and which was substantially completed in the second quarter of this year.","Also, I'd like to clarify that we calculate military capital upgrades represent working capital only. These military projects are not capitalized on our balance sheet, rather we've recovered these investments through scheduled or milestone payments as we complete that.","Finally, while we are seeing a year-over-year decrease in military capital upgrade projects, the pipeline of new base is looking to privatize remain strong. In the final section of the waterfall chart, you'll note that parent is positive $0.02 per share for the quarter, primarily due to certain expenses recorded in the third quarter of last year, partially offset by higher interest on parent's debt. And finally we show that $0.22 impact of the settlement bringing our GAAP earnings to $0.83 per share for the quarter.","Turning to slide 17, we have five rate cases and two outstanding infrastructure surcharge requests awaiting final orders for a total revenue request of $109.7 million. We also have a total of $90.5 million in annualized rates effective since October 1, 2015, including the resolution of our Kentucky rate case for $6.5 million in late August, and $9 million in the annualized infrastructure surcharges in our Pennsylvania subsidiary.","Slide 18 highlights our ongoing, strong financial performance and some key cash flow and investing metrics for our business. Our capital investments year-to-date were $905 million. This is $65 million lower than the same period last year, which included the third quarter purchase of Keystone Clearwater for a $133 million. We expect to spend between $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion this year, including capital for this Scranton acquisition, which we're working to close in the fourth quarter.","Our cash flow from operations grew 8.1% to $925 million for the first nine months of the year. The majority of this growth was driven by increased net income and depreciation, both of which are the results of infrastructure investments for our customers. Our adjusted return on equity improved to 9.57%, this is testament to the ongoing efforts of our employees to work efficiently and to limit regulatory lag through timely filings and innovative regulatory mechanism. We also continue to provide top quartile dividend growth, compared to the Dow Jones utility average and our water peers. On October 28, we declared a dividend of $0.375 per share payable on December 1, 2016 to shareholders of record as of November 9, 2016.","Finally, I would like to discuss our earnings guidance. Throughout the year, we have shared with you the headwinds we've faced in our market base businesses. For example, we have discussed the impact of lower capital upgrades in our Military Services division, as well as our Keystone team's efforts to manage their business to be earnings neutral despite a very challenging natural gas market.","Despite these headwinds, the employees in our businesses have delivered extraordinary results, even with the additional fourth O&M expense, we are revising our adjusted earnings guidance to the upper end of our prior range plus a $0.01 or to $0.281 to $0.286 per share which excludes the Freedom Industries' settlement.","And with that, I'll turn it back over to Susan.","Susan Story","Thanks, Walter and Linda. You heard us describing some details, the excellent results of our business through the third quarter of the year. And with the announcement of our preliminary settlement of the Freedom Industries' chemical spill related lawsuit. We will remove future risks and uncertainties related to legal cost and other expenses and distractions inherent in multiple ongoing multi-year litigation.","Our year-to-date financial performance reflects the successful execution of our strategy investing in our systems, operating efficiently, growing our business and remaining steadfast in our commitment to the highest standards of customer service. We have 6,700 amazing people that we all get the privilege of working with every day. They are great in what they do. They make life better for about 15 million people across the United States everyday with the services they provide. They are the first ones to volunteer when communities are in need or natural disasters hit. I am proud of not just what they do, but as the people that they are. And as investors, you can be proud of their record of service as well.","Before we go to questions, as a reminder, we will have our 2016 investor conference at the New York Stock Exchange beginning with lunch on Thursday, December 15. At that time, we will share with you our projections for our lines of businesses in 2017, as well as share our capital plans for 2017 and beyond. As the slide indicates, we will need you to RSVP to make sure that you can get into the Exchange. We hope, you will be there.","With that, we're happy to take any questions that you might have at this time.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Steve Fleishman of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Steve Fleishman","Hey, Susan. How are you?","Susan Story","Hey, Steve. Good. How are you doing today?","Steve Fleishman","Doing great. So just one question, this just maybe a technicality, but I didn't see your kind of 7% to 10% growth slide that you normally have in the slide deck, so just wanted to clarify is the 7% to 10% growth still the growth rate through 2020?","Susan Story","Well, we \u2013 yes, 7% to 10% in 2020, and our long-term growth at 7% to 10%, and on December 15, we'll rollout what we're looking at over the next five years.","Steve Fleishman","Okay. Great. And then, I'm just curious, the upcoming election kind of from the water sector standpoint, is there any real difference in your view in terms of policy on who wins in the election and anything that we should be kind of watching?","Susan Story","You know. Steve, really not both candidates have expressed support for infrastructure investment. I think, both candidates have expressed support for public-private partnership. So, specifically in the water industry where there are a number of governmental entities. I co-chaired with Doug Peterson, the CEO of S&P Global earlier in the year, for the Bipartisan Policy Center, a template. And we had a \u2013 an advisory council of political figures, former mayors and political figures, Democrats and Republicans who are all advocating for public-private partnerships because there were simply won't be enough federal monies to do the infrastructure investment we need in this country for water and waste water or transportation.","The Clinton campaign has come out and talked about a water innovation center. The Trump campaign has talked about infrastructure investment. So, we believe that whoever wins the election, the focus will remain on infrastructure and the role of private industry to be part of that renaissance of infrastructure investment for the country.","Steve Fleishman","And then, just finally, in all your kind of key states, is there any kind of election or kind of issues, proposals or things like that, that we should be watching?","Susan Story","No, actually the opposite. In our states, we have states with a lots of representation from Democrats, Republicans and we have \u2013 they're all great states. So, what we are \u2013 when we look actually and Walter can comment on this, what we're actually seeing are positive legislative efforts, given the attention that's given to infrastructure investment, we're actually seeing the office. We really seen support from both sides of the aisle on solutions that can help us solve some of the water and wastewater infrastructures issues. Walter, do you want to comment?","Walter Lynch","Yes, Susan, all across our footprint, we're seeing positive legislation from Indiana and Illinois to New Jersey and Pennsylvania. But really all the states encouraging us to invest in our infrastructure and making sure that we have enablers to acquire systems as well. So we're seeing very positive movement in each of our states.","Steve Fleishman","Okay, great. Thank you.","Susan Story","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","Our next question comes from Angie Storozynski of Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Angie Storozynski","Thank you. So, I wanted to ask about the municipal acquisitions that you have announced. Is there any rule of thumb about the earnings in fact per se the thousand accounts acquired and also how does it track versus your prior expectations on an annual basis, how many accounts you're adding because it feels to us like you've more than doubled the prior goals in additions of customer accounts.","Linda Sullivan","So, Angie, let me start \u2013 this is Linda. Let me start, the way that this works is that once we acquire a system, it goes through regulatory approvals by the PSE in that state. Once that approval is obtained, then we would include the acquisition in our next rate case. And so there is a bit of regulatory lag from the time that we get the approval to the time that it's included in a rate case proceeding that rate case proceeding then will determine the amount of rate base that we are authorized to earn a return on. And so that's really the process that it goes through.","Walter Lynch","And Angie, it's Walter. Speaking to the acquisition pipeline and some of the deals we've announced, what we're doing is providing solutions for communities, and with communities have issues and they're looking for somebody to come in and buy their systems, we are the natural acquirer. I think the legislation in each of the states are key enablers for us to do this, and we're seeing that play out across our footprint, but particularly in Pennsylvania as I noted, with two large acquisitions Scranton Sewer Authority and then the Authority of McKeesport. We're providing solutions for these communities, and they're turning to us because we have the expertise and the financial wherewithal to be able to buy the systems and operate them properly and make sure they're protected for years going forward.","Angie Storozynski","But do you feel like it's the beginning of a real consolidation of the water sector that we've been waiting for many number of decades now?","Susan Story","Well, I think you've seen a pretty big increase in the numbers the deals that we've announced, and we're, I mean, we're in discussions with the number of communities as we said and we're here to provide solutions and we're confident that we can do that.","Angie Storozynski","But is this [indiscernible] okay, I'm sorry. Go ahead.","Susan Story","Angie, this is Susan. I think your question, so to your point, we've been talking about \u2013 the people have been talking about this for years and that's one reason and that we can get questions about, is this the 1% to 2% still grow it on the triangle those type of things. We want to watch and see, we've had an extraordinary year, we think the pipeline looks very healthy, and we want to look and see what happens, that we monitor it very carefully in all of our states. We are seeing more interest than we've seen. But whether that translates into X percent more growth, that's what we're looking at and really putting our pencil to the paper to see what we'll see. I think when we see what happens in 2017 that will inform us more, is this suddenly the floodgate starting to have a little more flow, hopefully it is, the indications are positive, but we'll just have to see.","Angie Storozynski","And is it just, I mean, it sounds like most of the acquisitions are happening in the Pennsylvania and then this one in New Jersey, is this trend for now limited to these two states?","Susan Story","No, not limited to New Jersey and Pennsylvania, we are in discussions with others in other states, but these are just the ones that we've been able to announce here recently, but our teams are working in each of the states, looking for solutions to provide for these municipalities. And again...","Angie Storozynski","But you are saying \u2013 but you're only seeking municipal acquisitions in the states, where you already operate right, so there is no venturing into other states?","Susan Story","Well, what we have always said, Angie, is that, we're very interested in our state's growing, we are constantly looking \u2013 we are constantly looking at the landscape, and we have three hurdles when we look at whether we would enter a new state. The first one is, what is the regulatory climate, the second one is what is the business climate and are they open to private water, and the third is, do we see a line of sight to get to at least 50,00 customers within five years, so those are our gates and we're constantly looking across the country, we write every state based on those three. So we would not disclose if we had any activity until there was signed agreements, but we are always looking beyond our states. But right now, our focus \u2013 we're seeing a lot of opportunity. To your point about, it only seems, it seems mostly in Pennsylvania and New Jersey.","Pennsylvania is where we have the most mature laws that are favorable for this. Act 11, which was passed the 2012, maybe 2013 and then the course Act 12, which we are seeing more on the fair value legislation across the country. But I think you're seeing a state that has been more mature in some of the enabling legislative efforts that have been translated into regulatory policies, and so we are looking towards seeing more activity in other states as their legislation, enabling legislation becomes more mature.","Angie Storozynski","Perfect. Thank you.","Susan Story","Thanks, Angie.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Chin of Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Brian Chin","Hi, good morning.","Susan Story","Hi, Brian.","Brian Chin","Just a question on the acquisitions again. On slide 12 you broke out agreements reached, approvals granted and acquisitions closed, given that Scranton was reached \u2013 an agreement was reached last year, could you just define a little bit more clearly, when we say a 30,000 customers to 60,000 customers, is that agreements reached, is that approvals granted, is that acquisitions \u2013 because the three categories can startle over a year, so can you just be a little bit more specific in terms of why you're including in that 30,000 customers to 60,000 customers?","Susan Story","Right, that 30,000 customers to 60,000 customers translates into the approximate customer amount to reach our 1% to 2% earnings per share growth in that at regulated acquisition portion of our growth triangle. So, what that means is as I mentioned earlier there is a process that we go through with the acquisition, which starts with the regulatory approval, and other types of environmental approvals if necessary. We then go through the regulatory rate case process to include this in our earnings, and it's really when it gets to the 1% to 2% of earnings that it would count. So, Brian...","Brian Chin","So...","Susan Story","... I think how are we classifying these. So, a city or a municipality does an RFP, okay we're the successful bidder, we don't put into that pending at that point, only after we've negotiated done our due diligence, negotiated an agreement from the time we get a signed agreement is when we put it into that pending, then once we sign the agreement, you get regulatory approval, and then typically you close sometimes like Scranton, there is another step because they were under consent degree from the EPA, additionally we're having to get a couple of environmental permit.","So the quick answer is, when we put at something in the pending is because we have a signed agreement. We've gone through the RSP, we've done due diligence, we've signed to the terms. They all are waiting on typically from that point on is regulatory approval, which can typically take six months. Does that help?","Brian Chin","Okay. So if I think about it properly, what you're basically saying is, don't focus necessarily on which transaction gets included in which year by customer count. It's just that the lose 30,000 to 60,000 customers should translate to roughly 1% to 2% customer growth, even if the definition of agreements reached or approvals granted or acquisitions closed might be a little bit in flux from year-to-year, is that the right way to think about that?","Susan Story","Exactly right. And again, that's why we do five years with a triangle, so 1% to 2%, it \u2013 you need to average it, but again, we want it, we're trying to be more clear, which is why we put this slide in here, so you could see what exactly does this mean, what is really closed, what you're waiting on, what is it mean when you put in that bucket, how \u2013 we don't want to include as pending until we have pretty strong assurance that's going to go through, which is why we don't include anything until we have a signed agreement on the terms with the municipality.","Brian Chin","Great. And then one last question. I know you touched on this a little bit earlier, but in terms of just your confidence with regards to the acquisition and overall regulated growth outlook, I know we're going to get more detail at the conference coming up, but do you feel more confident in terms of the possibilities that are out there versus say a year ago when you did the last Analyst Conference?","Walter Lynch","Yes. I mean, it all ties back as we are talking here, the 1% to 2%. We're confident that we're going to be able to deliver 1% to 2% customer growth through acquisitions.","Brian Chin","Thank you very much.","Susan Story","Thanks, Brian.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Michael Lapides","Hey, guys. Thank you for taking my question. Real quickly on the market based segments, this has been a tough year in terms of growth, can you talk about whether that business you think still is able to fit the growth target overall or do you see the utility business is growing at faster than 7% to 10% but the market based business maybe grows a little bit slower than 7% to 10%?","Susan Story","Michael you always ask such a good question. The answer is we're as I said talking earlier, we're very committed to the market based businesses that we're in. Specifically for American Water enterprises, predominantly you have Homeowner Services and you have the military. The capital upgrades business that Linda talked about is a big part of that. But the big difference is that in military, while some of those infrastructure budgets may continue to be under some pressure, the pipeline for new basis that are issuing RFP or who have RFPs out there, they're significant. We have seen army pretty much, pretty active in the past several years. The air force over the past couple of three years has gotten even more active. So there is a robust pipeline in the military for new bases to win, so that's why we remain bullish on the military services.","Homeowner Services is doing well. There are more municipalities who are interested in partnership opportunities for these home warranties that we offer, so we feel really good about it. And then on the Keystone Clearwater, everybody and gosh Goldman you guys are really doing a great job of monitoring the natural gas and oil markets. So you know that things are picking up. We're very proud that through the worst of it that our organization, our business was able to stay EPS neutral, that is a huge deal and it shows a lot about how they kept going in some of the services they were able to provide during the downturn. So, yes, the market-based businesses we're in, we are committed to. Now we have always said that at our core, we are a regulated utility period, we will stay that way. Currently, anywhere from 9% to 10% of our revenue, net income comes from market-based little less this year. So, we will not see that grow beyond 15% to 20%, and probably closer to the up to 15% unless there is something extremely regulated like, if we win every new military base for example, and that helps us and it's more regulated like. But right now we are committed, but the market-based businesses have a limited role in the overall growth of our company and the majority of our growth will always come from our capital investment in our regulated business as well as regulated acquisition that then turns into more capital investment into our business.","Michael Lapides","Susan, that was super helpful. I want to make sure I can summarize that back.","Susan Story","Okay. Go.","Michael Lapides","It was a lot. I'm just trying to digest. I'm going back to the transcript if it were out already. Market-based business grows faster than the overall total EPS growth rate for the company, albeit, maybe not as fast as what you've seen prior to this year?","Susan Story","I think that's a nice summary, wow. I could have saved a lot of time, I have just said that, right.","Michael Lapides","One follow up. How are you thinking, companies gotten bigger, your regulated rate base, your regulated earnings power has improved significantly with rate increases, cost management et cetera. How are you thinking about dividend and dividend policy, especially if you remain in that kind of $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion a year in capital deployed, it imply that with higher earnings you'd have kind of a little better cash flow both with similar CapEx levels. Are you thinking there's potential for dividend growth maybe do exceed earnings growth or for an upgrade or uptick in the dividend payout ratio policy?","Susan Story","So I'll start and then let Linda contribute. So, on the positive side, we are already really high in the top quartile of dividend growers in utility space. We have said that, we have a 50% to 60% payout ratio target and we remain at the lower end of that. So we have room within our current payout ratio target to grow, the answer to your last question that you asked.","We look at every dollar and the best way to use that dollar, reinvesting in our capital programs for the benefit of our customers will always be first and dividends of course are right up there. So we also look at other investments, are there other ways to grow, do we look at things like, I mean the very bottom of our list by the way is buybacks. We think that, we should have plenty of opportunities to invest in our business, we look at dividends, we look at refinancing debt. All of those things we think have far more value to our shareholders than the latter. So, we right now, see ourselves continuing to have our dividend growth commensurate with our EPS growth. However, we also are very happy that over the past four years, we've had double-digit dividend increase and still remain at the bottom of our payout range.","Linda Sullivan","And Michael...","Michael Lapides","Got it.","Linda Sullivan","I would add to that, that we continue to look at our cash flow from operations, which is strong and which in our five year plan is expected to exceed our capital expenditures in 2018.","Michael Lapides","Got it. Thank you. Much appreciate it, guys.","Susan Story","Thanks, Michael.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dave [indiscernible] of Baird. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Participant","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you could provide a little commentary on what you're seeing in terms of fair value legislation? Do you think catching are more broadly across your service area, and, yeah, what are your expectations there?","Walter Lynch","Yeah. This is Walter. And we have that fair market legislation, fair value legislation in six of our states now, and we do see a catching on, because it's just another enabler for us to go and acquire systems and pay the fair market value, which gives the mares, the communities options if they're looking to monetize assets. So, we do think it's got momentum and you can see just in the last couple of years, how it's expanded across United States. And so many of our acquisitions are tied to that fair market legislation. So, it is working as well.","Susan Story","Yeah. And one thing to, this is Susan, David. This is really a differentiator for the water utility sector, compared to other utilities, because these fair market legislation initiatives really only cover water and wastewater, and they tend to be also for distressed water systems, which is back to the whole infrastructure issue nationally that we have with municipalities.","Unidentified Participant","Excellent. Thank you all very much.","Susan Story","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jonathan Reeder of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Jonathan Reeder","Hey, good morning. Hey, good morning, everyone. Congrats, Susan, I was surprised in a little bit this year. So, I'm sure you happy there.","Susan Story","Jonathan, I won't talk about not dime.","Jonathan Reeder","Yeah. Please don't. At least the lot of fans are cubs fans to so they have a little follows there. But I want to follow just a bit on Andy's area, response to Andy's question. So, for the Scranton and the McKeesport deal from a modeling perspective, we shouldn't really, we expecting any earnings impact until the next Pennsylvania rate case, is that the way to kind of think about that?","Susan Story","So, what happens, once we received regulatory approval and we close on the deals, then we begin collecting the existing rates under the system. And so we look at that for the interim period and generally what we do in the interim period before a rate case is we will finance that acquisition with shorter term debt. Then we will go through the regulatory process and that will determine the amount that gets on rate, gets into rate base upon which we would earn our return or have the opportunity to earn our return.","Jonathan Reeder","Okay. So maybe you're not earning the same ROE as the rest of the business, but you are earning a return and you kind of help enhance that a little bit by doing the short term financing in the meantime, is that accurate?","Susan Story","Yeah. And John, that's right. And part of what we go through, is we look at specific metrics that each of these acquisitions need to meet those financial hurdles and generally accretion is one of those metrics.","Jonathan Reeder","Okay. And then can you remind us what would be the timing of the next Pennsylvania rate case?","Susan Story","So we do not make that public.","Jonathan Reeder","When was your last, I guess, rate case filed, and how about that for Pennsylvania, I don't think it's been in the last 12 months?","Susan Story","Yeah. It's been two years.","Jonathan Reeder","It's been two years. So, kind of coming up and I mean, is it fair to say getting those two large systems into rate base might be a catalyst as well?","Susan Story","So we look at a multitude of factors to determine the timing of our rate cases, and we take all of that into consideration when we look at timing Jonathan. But you are an excellent questioner, Jonathan.","Jonathan Reeder","All right. Thanks for that. And then the other question I had just the $10 million of O&M expense for Q4 is, did you say that's been pulled forward from 2017?","Linda Sullivan","No, that's actually timing differences between primarily the third quarter, but also first quarter and second quarter and has moved into the fourth quarter.","Jonathan Reeder","Okay. All right. Thanks for the clarity. I appreciate it.","Linda Sullivan","Absolutely.","Susan Story","Thanks Jonathan.","Operator","Our next question comes from Shahriar Pourreza of Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.","Shahriar Pourreza","Good morning, everyone.","Susan Story","Hi, Shahriar.","Shahriar Pourreza","So just one question. Can you remind us of the regulated acquisition, the trajectory of 1% to 2% includes any storm water and if not, is that sort of an opportunity that can move the needle and where is that opportunity set?","Susan Story","Shahriar, no it doesn't, first of all, the storm water is an interesting area nationally that's been looked at and really for us the first place we're looking at that is on military bases. We've had a couple of our bases where we serve water and wastewater, who have indicated an interest. So we're working through the Department of Defense as to whether that can fall under the preview that they got to their privatization language and legislation which, we believe it does the senate and the senators and the congress men I believe it does, but I think they're going through the lawyers and the Department of Defense to get comfortable with it.","So, I think what you would find is storm water is part of the water cycle, we are looking at how that would look, so for us we're continuing to look at storm water, but our foray into that would and that's probably come through our military bases and it's our ability to take that part over along with water and wastewater.","Shahriar Pourreza","Okay, got it. So a little bit ways off?","Susan Story","Yes.","Shahriar Pourreza","Excellent, thanks. That was it.","Susan Story","Well. Thank you, Shahriar.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tim Winter of Gabelli & Company. Please go ahead.","Tim Winter","Good morning, and congratulations on the quarter and the year-to-date results.","Susan Story","Thanks, Tim.","Tim Winter","I wanted to follow-up on the fair value legislation and the process, at what point does the fair value assessment take place in \u2013 is that made public?","Susan Story","Every state is a little bit different, Tim, but typically after an asset purchase agreement is signed and then there are appraisers that are hired by the city and by us and then there is an typically an averaging of those appraisals, and it is public at some point, yes, but that's typically the process, the average of a couple of appraisals.","Tim Winter","So, in the instance of McKeesport, when will that take place or has is it?","Susan Story","We're actually hiring our appraisers now. So we're doing and then the city is doing it as well, that's where we are in the process.","Tim Winter","Okay. And as we considered the accretion process for this acquisitions, I mean, how would you characterize the levels of synergies that you can achieve as you go into the next Pennsylvania rate case?","Susan Story","Lot of factors involved and it's all based on local operations and the synergies that we can get from those, but they're obviously are synergies particularly when we're buying wastewater systems in areas where we serve water systems, and that's really key to our strategy is to be able to take advantages of synergies to benefit our customers.","Walter Lynch","And Tim, I'd add to that as we look at the way that we're structured overall from the American Water perspective, we really leverage the size and scale of our company to be able to provide synergies across the business in terms of back office support, finance, HR, legal, as well as our supply chain.","Susan Story","We see that as a big differentiator of supply chain and the purchasing power that we have and I like to highlight the examples on these calls and in individuals meetings, but it's a huge advantage that we have I think in this business.","Tim Winter","Okay.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Susan Story for any closing remarks.","Susan Story","Thank you. First of all, thank you, all for participating today and your excellent questions. This was a great discussion. If you have any further questions, please call Ed or Melissa, and they'd be happy to help you. We really hope to see all of you on December 15 at our Investor Conference. We will \u2013 as you all know, we have a new head of Keystone, Dan Dalton, who has been the President & COO for several years. We also have a new head of our Market-Based Business, Deb Degillio. You'll get to meet them. So, I think and of course, what's old is new again, which is Ed Vallejo back in his role as VP of Investor Relations as well as Financial Planning and Analysis.

We will keep the call to about an hour and at the end of our prepared remarks we will open the call up to questions.","During the course of this conference call, both in our prepared remarks and in answers to your questions, we may make forward-looking statements that represent our expectations regarding our future performance or other future events.

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Today, our CFO, Linda Sullivan, will cover our second quarter financial results and COO, Walter Lynch, will give key updates on our operations.","I'll start with what I'm sure are your two main questions today, why our earnings were down $0.04 for the quarter and why we're affirming our 2017 earnings guidance of $2.98 to $3.08. A key fact is that our Regulated Businesses continues to execute and deliver solid results.","Second quarter 2017 results were impacted by several items some of which we've noted in earlier call. The primary negatives for the quarter were two key 2017 items and two favorable items in the second quarter of 2016 which did not recur this year. $0.02 of our earnings were down quarter-over-quarter from lower capital upgrades in our Military Services Group.","We've covered this on past calls and it's related to reduce military budgets combined with the completion of the large wastewater project at Fort Polk in the first half of 2016. Additionally, we had a onetime $0.02 tax adjustment from a state income tax change in New York that Linda mentioned on our last quarter call. She'll discuss this in more detail as well as another state income tax change in Illinois. The quarter was also impacted by last year's favorable weather of $0.02 per share compared to a more normal second quarter this year and a 2016 onetime $0.01 benefit from an AWE contract settlement.","However, even including these items in our range, we continue to affirm our $2.98 to $3.08 EPS guidance for 2017. Our regulated core business continues solid growth, delivering a 3.7% increase in net income for the quarter. During the first half of 2017, we added approximately 15,000 customers through closed acquisitions and 7,000 from organic growth. Walter will speak a little bit more about the pending acquisition agreements we have in place as of July 31 that will add about 34,000 additional customers.","We continue to invest in our Regulated Businesses. This year we will invest $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion total capital with the vast majority dedicated to water and wastewater system improvement and upgrade. We balance those investments by operating efficiently and effectively, which is reflected in our O&M efficiency ratio.","On the market-based side, although we are experiencing lower capital upgrades in military services, we continue to perform our 50 year O&M contract quite effectively. We are completing the capital upgrades we do have and we're working with basis to identify potential infrastructure projects for the 2018 fiscal year.","Additionally, we have eight RSPs outstanding with a possibility of one or two awards being made this year by the Department of Defense. We continue to expand Homeowner Services including a new partnership with Yonkers New York. At Keystone Clearwater we are seeing increases in rig count and well completions in the Appalachian region and have an increase backlog of work scheduled in the second half of the year.","So while there are a number of items impacting this quarter's results, we remain confident in our ability to deliver earnings for 2017 in our guidance range of 298 to 308.","Beyond 2017 and for the longer term our business fundamentals and outlook continue to be strong and compelling. Our growth triangles still hold as does our long term 7% to 10% EPS guidance.","Now, let me turn the call over to Walter to give you his update on our Regulated Business.","Walter Lynch","Thanks and good morning, everyone. As Susan mentioned, our Regulated Business is delivered year-over-year second quarter growth by continuing capital investments and driving operating efficiencies the benefit our customers.","Let's walk through some highlights of this quarter. On July 21, after a strong show of support in the New Jersey Legislature, Governor Christie signed a Water Quality Accountability Act. In fact, in New Jersey State Assembly in a Bipartisan show of support passed the legislation 76 to 0 which was followed by the State Senate vote of 39 to 0.","This legislation calls for such things like regular testing of valves and hydrants a 150 year pipe replacement rate, the implementation of the cyber security program, and action plans for notices of violation. We see this is a good thing because first and foremost it ensures that all citizens in New Jersey have safe secure and clean water, it's also a great model for future legislation across the nation. American Water stands ready to be a solution provider as other systems looks to make needed investments.","This quarter two states received the orders to adjust rates. The New York Public Service Commission issued an order that will add $3.6 million in annualized revenue to recover about $150 million in water system improvements. These investments made over the past five years include replacing over 33 miles of water mains and bringing one new iron removal treatment plant online while making improvements with three other treatment plants. We also reduced operating expenses by $2.7 million in the same time period.","In Virginia, the State Corporation Commission issued an order that adds $5.2 million in annualized revenue to recover $53 million in infrastructure improvements made since 2102. Here too, we reduced operating expenses by 2% since our last rate case. This is a great job by our New York and Virginia teams as every dollar we save, we can invest $7 in our systems with no customer go impact.","During the quarter, we filed two rate requests, one in Pennsylvania, which we discussed last quarter and one in Missouri. On June 30, we filed a rate case in Missouri requesting an increase of $84 million in annual revenue. This request covers investment of $490 million in water and wastewater infrastructure. Included in this investment as a replacement of a large treatment plan at Parkville and the installation of AMI meters in St. Louis County, which will give customers more timely billing information, it also helps us monitor usage better which is important identifying leaks.","Finally, in West Virginia, we file for an updated infrastructure surcharge to incorporate new projects to be started in 2018, over and above the 2017 projects now underway. The 2018 projects include $29.9 million that will invest in various system wide upgrades including replacement or upgrade of more than 39 miles of water mains and upsizing two water storage tanks. These investments will drive system reliability and equate to only a $1 increase per customer per month.","Turning to Slide 10, we added about 15,000 new customers from closed acquisitions through June. As discussed last quarter, we closed on our Shorelands, New Jersey acquisition adding 11,000 customers.","In California, we closed the Meadowbrook Water Company serving approximately 1,700 customers. We also entered into a contract to purchase the Fruitridge Vista Water Company which serves approximately 4,800 customers. Among the acquisitions pending approval the largest is McKeesport, Pennsylvania, which will add 22,000 customers. We expect that acquisition will close later this year or in early 2018. This in other pending acquisitions will add approximately 34,000 customers. The remaining 7,000 new customers added during the first half of the year came from organic growth.","Moving the Slide 11, we continue to increase operating efficiencies across our company so that we can make smart investments without significantly impacting customer bills. Our adjusted O&M efficiency ratio improved to 34.5% for the last 12 months ending June 30, 2017. We continue to work towards our goal of 32.5% by 2021.","Let me highlight two examples of the steps were taken to drive efficiencies. After modifying our process for a new service installation, a field worker now has the ability to tap the main run the service line and install the meter on one visit as opposed to multiple visits in the past. As a result the project team generated nearly a quarter of $1 million in savings in eight states over the past 12 months. We plan to roll this new process so nationally.","In addition, we continue to drive efficiencies, reduced waste and improve safety across the entire company by routinely conducting Waste Walks. One Waste Walk in Tennessee resulted in the modification of existing meter lids, which improved meter reading accuracy and resulted in annual savings of about $150,000. We're looking to expand this modification across all of our systems.","On Slide 12, one final highlight is in the time of Bel Air, Maryland where we've identified a much needed backup water supply. We recently broke ground for a 90 million gallon water impoundment reservoir and a new intake. The fall goes as planned the $15 million impoundment will provide service in 2019. This is a great example of many parties coming together to ensure a long term water supply solution. We think state and local officials, community members from Bel Air and Harford County for helping make this solution a reality.","In fact, the Town Administrator Jesse Bane said that the solution save the town from what could have been its eventual demise if it didn't have a reliable source for water.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Linda for more detail on our financial performance.","Linda Sullivan","Thank you, Walter, and good morning, everyone. Today I will cover our second quarter results. Two legislative tax changes impacting us this year and our earnings guidance range.","Turning to Slide 14, second quarter 2017 earnings were $0.73 per share down $0.04 from the second quarter last year. Susan outlined the primary drivers of the lower quarter-over-quarter results. So let me walk through the results by business segments.","I'll start with our Regulated segment, for the quarter our Regulated Businesses were up $0.02 per share. Revenue was up $0.12 per share, included in that 12% increase was about $0.09 from authorized rate cases and infrastructure mechanisms to support capital growth and $0.04 from acquisitions and organic growth, partially offsetting this with $0.01 of lower demand.","Next as Susan mentioned, we had favorable weather in the second quarter of last year, which negatively impacted the quarterly comparison by $0.02 per share. O&M expense was higher $0.04 per share from increased production cost mainly in California increased waste disposal costs driven by acquisition growth and higher customer uncollectable expense.","Finally, we had higher depreciation and interest expense of $0.04 per share driven by our investment growth. I would like to point out that although the growth rate for the regulated businesses was lower this quarter their results are on plan for the year.","Turning to the Market-based Businesses, we were down $0.02 per share compared to the same period last year. As anticipated, we continue to experience lower capital upgrades in the Military Services Group, which includes the quarter-over-quarter impact from completion of the major project at Fort Polk in mid-2016. In addition, as Susan mentioned in the second quarter of 2016 we had a $0.01 benefit from an AWE contract settlement.","Homeowner Services came in relatively flat for the quarter as revenue growth of $4 million was offset by higher claims expense and several true ups related to our system implementation last year.","Keystone results were also relatively flat for the quarter although we are seeing increased activity and backlog expected to favorably impact the second half of the year.","Lastly, the Parent was down $0.04 per share in the quarter, $0.02 was due to the onetime cumulative tax adjustment from the legislative change adopted in New York during the second quarter, which I'll cover in more detail in a moment. We also have higher interest expense and other of $0.02 to support growth.","On Slide 15, let me discuss in more detail two legislative tax changes that occurred this year. As I discussed last quarter, we had a legislative change in New York that no longer allowed water utilities to qualify for the manufacturing exemption. This will increase our effective state tax rate in New York beginning in January of 2018, also effective July 1, of this year Illinois increased the state's corporate income tax rate from 7.75% to 9.5%.","Both of these changes require us to re-measure our deferred tax balances at the new rate in the period of the tax law change, so in the second quarter for New York and the third quarter for Illinois. This onetime non-cash cumulative adjustment of the deferred tax balances will total $17 million. The portion of this adjustment calculated on a standalone basis for each regulated state subsidiary is expected to be recovered through future customer rates and that will be recorded as a regulatory asset of $10 million in total.","The remaining portion will be allocated to the Parent through our state tax apportionment factors and will reduce 2017 earnings by $7 million or $0.04 per share in total. This earnings decrease is included in our annual earnings guidance range affirmed today.","Turning to Slide 16, let me provide an update on our regulatory filings. We have $65.4 million in annualized new revenues affected since January 1 of this year. This includes $43 million authorized to general rate cases and $22.4 million from infrastructure mechanisms. We have also filed requests and are awaiting final orders on three rate cases and two infrastructure charges for a total annualized revenue request of $234.9 million.","Turning to Slide 17, today we are affirming our 2017 earnings guidance range of $2.98 to $3.08 per share. I would like to call out a few items that are included in the earnings guidance range. First, weather variability of plus or minus $0.07 is included in that range. The third quarter is generally when we experienced the majority of our weather impact and through July, we have experienced warmer weather in several states approximately a penny benefit versus normal weather in July. However, as you know we're only one month into the third quarter.","Second, as we mentioned at our December Investor Conference and previous earnings call, we expect the lower capital upgrades in the Military Services Group to continue through 2017 to the completion of the large project at Fort Polk in mid-2016 and reduce military budget. And then finally included in the guidance range are the portion of the onetime cumulative tax adjustments expected to reduce 2017 earnings by $0.04 per share as I discussed earlier. Again these items are included in our affirmed earnings guidance range of $2.98 to $3.08 per share.","With that, I'll turn it back over to Susan.","Susan Story","Thanks, Walter and Linda. Before taking your questions, I'd like to talk a few minutes about customer on lead service lines and American Waters efforts to address its growing national issues. With the problems of lead pipe highlighted in plant last year, we know that having confidence in the quality of their water is most critical to our customers. American Water has increased our communications and educational efforts to our customers about lead and we're taking through aggressive step up to help them with their own lead lines.","Our scientists along with the EPA have determined that when we're replacing our water mains it's in the customer's best interest to replace their own lead service lines at the same time. So we're working with our states to develop plans to do just that, which includes a priority focus on low income customers.","Pennsylvania American Water has filed a PUC request to replace customer on lead service lines when we're repairing or replacing company online. Customers there who believe they have a lead line may also contact the company and once verified we would replace them over a period of time.","In New Jersey, we conducted a lead service line replacement pilot project in a financially distressed community and replaced the customer lead lines when we found them. We're working with our regulators at the BPU on recovery of these investments. We will continue to replace customer owned lead lines if they are encountered during our main renewal and replacement program.","In Missouri, we have filed a plant and have already replaced around 60 customer lines in a pilot project. We expect to replace lead service lines of about 100 to 150 customer homes this year in Missouri. In fact, you can see a picture on the bottom left of an impressive hardworking crew with one light weight on the far right side in [indiscernible]. While in St Louis County last week I had the opportunity to watch our crews do a water main replacement and a didn't decide those homes with customer lead service lines for replacement. They said everyone was very positive and one customer even gave our guy a bear hug.","In Indiana, enabling legislation passed for replacement of customer owned lead service lines. We're working with the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission for approval for our plan under the new law including projects in financially distressed communities with higher lead line concentration.","And finally, the Virginia Department of Health is funding a grant program for lead service line replacement and we're pleased the Virginia American with the proof for some of the funding. Our efforts are beyond anything that is required and are driven first and foremost about our commitment to the safety of our customers and our communities it is simply the right thing to do.","So with that, operator we're happy to take the questions of any of our participants.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Michael Lapides","Hey guys just curious on two things. One on your Regulated Businesses, you've got some pretty big rate cases outstanding. Right, I mean Pennsylvania for example, I think Missouri the other both in the $8500 million range. Just curious what's embedded in the multi-year growth rate for outcomes in those and how much of those rate increases are tied to costs that you're not incurring today that you could pull back on if you get outcomes in those cases that turn to be out to be a good bit less than what you're seeking?","Susan Story","So Michael, as you know we've put together our five year financial plan. We look at what do we believe are going to be successful outcomes for us to continue to invest in our systems and make those rates affordable for our customers. So embedded in our 7% to 10% EPS growth range are those judgments that we use on an ongoing basis.","Michael Lapides","Got it. One other question. Can you talk a little bit about what you think there returns on invested capital are for your market based businesses these days? Are you earning utility like returns or something that are dramatically above or below that level?","Susan Story","Yeah, Michael, we look at that from the standpoint of risk adjusted returns and so when we look at each of the businesses in our Market-based Businesses, we can think a little bit differently based on the risk return profile of each of those businesses. So we've consistently said when we look at our military business it's kind of regulated like in risk profile, so you'd expect the returns to be somewhat commensurate with that. And then we look at Homeowner services and Keystone based on their risk adjusted returns.","And also remember Michael, these are very much a margin business, I mean we invest very, very little capital, actual capital to the same point and it's not taking capital way from the Regulated Businesses because we do very little capital investment, and in fact when we talk about the capital projects or the fixed capital upgrades on our military bases that's working capital only because the way the Department of Defense operates is typically they like to own the asset that we basically get recovery plus a margin on that working capital. So another way to look at it is it's more of a margin business.","Michael Lapides","Got it. One follow-up on that just curious how is given results for the first half of the year. The earnings growth expectations for the market based businesses relative to what you laid out at the Analyst Day six or seven months ago?","Susan Story","Okay. Thank you, Michael for that question. This quarter is down we've talked about this year when we do our financial plan we look at a five year time period. We also talked today earlier about the fact that our growth triangle is intact. So we do planning on a five year cycle, if we ever sell a point at which we did not think that the market based business over the longer term would be able to deliver what we've outlined we would change it that is not the case right now.","Michael Lapides","Got it. Thank you guys, much appreciate it.","Susan Story","Thanks, Michael.","Operator","Our next question comes from Spencer Joyce with Hilliard & Lyons. Please go ahead.","Spencer Joyce","Hi, good morning, thanks for taking the call. One quick one from me perhaps, Linda, I know we have two kind of discrete tax items to discuss this morning both in New York and Illinois. And my question is, if you are seeing any other measures in another state you operate and that could lead to some more of this type of item or if it really is just kind of a random event that we have a couple of these two to discuss this morning?","Linda Sullivan","So we have seen these two from a legislative tax change position. We have also seen in Missouri several of our counties are looking at changing the way that they calculate some of the property taxes in those areas. So we are seeing that across three of our states this year. We continue to believe that the items on the Regulated Business will be recovered through our customer rates and so we're monitoring this very carefully so that we can to continue to drive down our customer rates as best we can.","Spencer Joyce","Okay. And thank you for the clarity there on particularly giving that in rates. That's all I had. Thanks.","Linda Sullivan","Thank you, Spencer.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jonathan Reeder with Wells Fargo.","Jonathan Reeder","Hey, good morning, Susan, Linda and Walter how are you all.","Susan Story","Good Jonathan, how are you.","Jonathan Reeder","I'm doing pretty good all things considered. Just wondering, Walter what the remaining prospects for the McKeesport approval I know you said you thought it could close later this year or early 2018?","Walter Lynch","Jonathan there are hearings actually today and tomorrow on McKeesport and they have a six months requirements, so we're looking at sometime in December to be able to get an order and then we've got to work through just some issues with the DEP before we take ownership. So that's really the process, six months were a good deal through that and hopefully we're going to take ownership at the end of this year or beginning of 2018.","Jonathan Reeder","Okay. Have that like third party evaluation systems have those come in already?","Walter Lynch","Yes, they've come in and the commission is actually working through those as part of the evaluation.","Jonathan Reeder","Okay. But from your end I mean no issues there?","Walter Lynch","Well, we just continue to work through the commission and any questions they have and it's just part of the process, Jonathan.","Jonathan Reeder","Okay. Just wondering, Susan any other state considering bill somewhat of the New Jersey Water Quality Accountability Act is that kind of model legislation that you're going to be pursuing another state or do you think it kind of opens up the door further for M&A opportunity?","Susan Story","I will start and then Walter can jump in. So we absolutely believe that it should be model legislation for all the states across the country. First and foremost because of the fact that the ability to ensure the safety and quality of water is something that every citizen should be able to expect, and it shouldn't matter who is running their water system as in terms of the quality of that water. So we think it is good model legislation, the fact as Walter mentioned that it was unanimously passed in the assembly the Senate is just really extraordinary in this they made. So we're very encouraged by that. We do believe it's model and Walter can talk about any efforts that we've got going across the rest of our state.","Walter Lynch","Yeah, just to emphasize it is model legislation, and I think Senator Sweeney and Governor Christie did a great job. Just promoting the benefits for the residents in New Jersey, we know that other states are looking at similar legislation primarily in the Midwest, and so we'll be working with them as we can in each of our states to make sure that we give our views of the benefits of about legislation and how again the purpose is to make the water safe in the communities that are in the States.","Jonathan Reeder","Right. And then last I know if you guys have any thoughts of California in the biggest subsidiary for you guys, but the cost of capital proceeding there, ORA came out their recommendation what's kind of your reaction to that do you think a settlement reasonable terms will be achievable from your end?","Susan Story","Yeah, Jonathan I think the ORA testimony was not unexpected, and as you know they put in there a lower ROA compared to our 10.8%, ROA request. They did come in also with a lower cost of equity just north of 54% where we requested 55%. So not unexpected on all of this, we will be filing rebuttal testimony later this month and then we would expect a final decision in the normal course by year end.","Jonathan Reeder","Okay. Great. Thanks for the color.","Susan Story","Thanks, Jonathan.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Angie Storozynski with Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Angie Storozynski","Thank you. So I wanted to ask about your shale water business, I mean it's broke even last year and seems like we had some increase the drilling activity and the Appalachian region and yet - we haven't yet seen the have a pickup of earnings why - I mean no is there a basically a lag between when those activities pickup and when you record additional revenues?","Susan Story","Thanks, Angie. This is Susan. So you are absolutely right on all accounts, so what we are seeing in Appalachian is that we're seeing more active rigs, there's a timing issue there and one of the comments I made is that we schedule projects, we plan projects and schedule projects and we have a backlog scheduled for the second half of the year. What we found in Appalachian is that it did pick up, but it's not picked up as quickly. And the interesting thing that's happening in the Appalachian now, because things have been quite busy in the Permian that a lot of the E&Ps have actually had trouble keeping groups, keeping the crews on the rigs side, so now they're trying to get more people appears to it's been a little slower than they thought.","So that's one of the things that we're hearing from our Keystone Clearwater. They are now trying to make sure that we're able to recruit enough people, I mean we have hired 75 people just this year and are trying to hire even more to staff our crew, so it's pretty competitive to get crews. Now with what's happening in the oil markets now, don't know if that's going to slow down in the Permian and release more for work in Appalachian we certainly hope so. But we do have active projects planned and interesting just from a statistic standpoint as of July 28, there were 192 active rigs in the U.S. and 75 in Appalachian Basin and just last year that was 86.","So we do see an increase in a number of rigs, number completions and hopefully some of the labor shortage issues will be taken care of so we can see more of a buildup in Appalachian work more quickly.","Angie Storozynski","Great. Thank you.","Susan Story","Thanks, Angie.","Operator","At this time, there are no more questions in the queue. I would now like to turn it back over to Susan Story for any closing remarks.","Susan Story","Thank you so much. First of all, we want to thank everyone for participating in our call today. We value you as our investor owners and as the financial analysts who research our company for the benefit of your clients. We will always be open and transparent in all of our discussions and dealings with you, so you can have complete confidence in your decisions around our company and investments in our stock.","If we have not been able to address any of your questions or if you have additional questions please call and Ed and Ralph and they'll be happy to help you. Thanks again for listening and we hope you have a great week.","Operator","The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending.

At the end of our prepared remarks, we will of course open the call to your questions.","And now, I'll now turn the call over to American Water's President and CEO, Susan Story.","Susan Story","Thanks, Ed. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us. Today our CFO, Susan Hardwick, will cover our third quarter financial results; and our COO, Walter Lynch will give key updates on our operations. American Water employees continue to deliver strong results. Let me highlight just a few of our third quarter accomplishments.","We continue to have strong financial performance. Adjusted earnings were up 10.8% compared to last year's third quarter, and we saw growth in both our regulated and market based businesses. In our regulated business, we've added more than 57,000 customer connections year-to-date. This includes 46,900 customers through closed acquisitions and 10,400 through organic growth in our existing service areas.","We most recently closed on the water assets of Steelton Borough, Pennsylvania, and Lake Station, Indiana, as well as the wastewater assets of Exeter Township in Pennsylvania. We're excited to welcome our new customers and our new employees. Additionally, in the coming months, we will welcome an additional 26,400 customer connections through agreements that are signed and pending.","Moving to our market based businesses; we're extremely honored to be awarded Department of Defense contracts for the water and wastewater systems at Joint Base San Antonio in Texas, and the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. Joint Base San Antonio includes Randolph Air Force Base, Fort Sam Houston, Camp Bullis and Lackland Air Force Base. These installations support over 187,000 jobs across the state of Texas.","The United States Military Academy at West Point is the oldest continually operated army post in the United States. The campus is home to 4,400 cadets, and was once home to our own CEO Walter Lynch, a West Point alumnus and Army veteran. The opportunity to expand our military footprint to 16 bases across the country is a testament to American Water's industry leading water research, development and operational excellence.","It's a privilege to ensure the delivery of safe, clean and reliable water and wastewater services for our country's military members and their families. With this continued strong performance and our disciplined approach to our business, we are narrowing our 2019 adjusted EPS guidance to $3.56 to $3.64 per share from $3.54 to $3.64.","Moving to Slide 6, the foundation for our earnings growth continues to be the capital investment we make in our regulated operations. Through September 30, we invested around $1.3 billion, with about 1.2 billion into our existing regulated infrastructure, and around 85 million in regulated acquisition closings.","We expect to invest approximately $1.9 billion total for the full year, with projections of more than 260 million for regulated acquisition closings and around 1.7 billion to address the continued and growing need for infrastructure investment across our footprint. Results for our market based businesses are also strong, contributing to both net income growth and cash flow generation given the capital light nature of these businesses.","So in summary, we will continue to invest in our infrastructure, and we have line of sight to a 31.5% O&M efficiency ratio by 2023, which is key to ensuring affordability for our customers as we make these much needed investments. And finally, we remain on track to meet our 7% to 10% long-term earnings growth target.","Now, Walter will give a more detailed update on our regulated business.","Walter Lynch","Thanks, Susan and good morning everyone. Our regulated businesses had a strong third quarter and making capital investments to ensure clean, safe and reliable water services. We also continue to improve our operating efficiencies to benefit our customers and grow our business through acquisitions.","On Slide 8, let me touch briefly on the weather. As you recall, we had an unusually wet weather in the second quarter of 2019, which led to a total quarter-over-quarter unfavorable impact of $0.05. This quarter has been more typical. And once again, you can see how a geographic diversity helps mitigate weather variability. For example, this quarter, New Jersey American Water experienced at or below average precipitation which offset Missouri slightly above average precipitation. As a result, weather had no material impact on our revenues for the third quarter.","Turning the Slide 9, let's walk through some of the regulatory highlights starting with our two pending rate cases in Virginia and California. In November 2018, Virginia American Water filed a general rate case requesting an overall increase of $5.6 million, driven by approximately $98 million in infrastructure upgrades since April 2017. Interim rates race became effective I May 1, 2019 and we expect a decision in the first quarter of 2020.","California American Water filed for new rates this past July, the case covers 2021 through 2023 and requests an increase in authorized revenue of $46.6 million over three years, beginning with a $26 million increase proposed for January 1, 2021. The request seeks $197 million for infrastructure improvement for the 2021 to 2022 capital test years. We expect the decision on this case in late 2020, with new rates to take effect by January 1, 2021.","And other activities, several bills were recently signed into law in Indiana by Governor Holcomb. First, House Bill 1406, known as the Water Infrastructure Funding Act, establishes the first state appropriation of $20 million per year for water infrastructure investment. Paired with another bill, Senate Bill 4, this combined legislation supports Regional Water planning and the reduction of water loss caused by poor or ageing infrastructure. The goal is to promote a consistent approach to providing clean and safe water across all water systems in Indiana.","A third bill, Senate Bill 472, enhances Indiana's version of fair market value legislation by now including qualified non-municipal systems. Previously, the legislation only covered distressed municipal systems. And in Pennsylvania on October 3, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved our proposal to replace customer owned lead service lines in accordance with Act 120. This act authorizes the cost associated with the replacement of the customer owned portion of lead service lines to be included in a regulated utilities rate base.","Turning the Slide 10, we continue to grow the size of our footprint with 19 acquisitions occurring in eight states, totaling 46,900 new customer connections. Earlier this month, Pennsylvania American Water completed the acquisition of both the Steelton Water and Exeter Wastewater Systems. The Steelton water system added approximately 2,400 new water connections. The sale of the water system will allow the Borough to eliminate its existing water debt and invest in capital projects.","In Exeter, Pennsylvania, where we've been providing water service for more than 17 years, we welcomed approximately 9,000 wastewater customer connections. According to township manager John Granger, quote, the sale of the wastewater treatment plant and collection system in the Pennsylvania American Water is a great benefit to current and future residents of Exeter.","The plant and system were becoming an increasing burden on the township as federal and state regulations were becoming too difficult for the township to manage and quote, this is a great example of how communities are better simply because we're there. This marks Pennsylvania American Water's fifth acquisition in the state in 2019.","Indiana American Water also closed on the Lake Station Water System earlier this month, adding about 3,300 water connections to the existing Indiana customer base. We also welcome 10,400 new customer connections from organic growth today, and we'll welcome another 26,400 customer connections through 24 signed agreements in 10 states. As we've shared with you before, with a consistent pipeline of opportunities we see in the water and wastewater industry. We're confident in our discipline, growth strategy and our ability to provide solutions across the nation.","Turning the Slide 11, we continue to bounce making critical investments to ensure reliable service while limiting the impact to our customers' bills. In the first nine months, we've invested approximately $1.2 billion in our existing regulated infrastructure. At the same time, we're making progress towards our long-term O&M efficiency goal of 31.5% by 2023.","To put this effort into perspective, our adjusted O&M expenses are just slightly higher today than they were in 2010. However, over the last nine years, we welcomed approximately 338,000 customer connections, while expenses only increased at a compound annual growth rate of 0.6%. We're extremely proud of our employees focus and commitment to controlling costs on behalf of our customers.","Moving to Slide 12, we're pleased that our new customer service site myWater is now live for all American Water customers nationwide. Customers are now able to access their accounts with this mobile friendly site. MyWater allows customers to easily make payments, view their water usage history and receive alert notifications from any location 24 hours a day, seven days a week.","We launched this new platform by listening to our customers, who told us they wanted to more easily manage their accounts online. Since the launch, we received very positive customer feedback, especially an ease of use. This is just another great example of how our customers are at the center of everything we do.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Susan for more detail on our financial performance.","Susan Hardwick","Thank you, Walter and good morning everyone. Let me start on Slide 14 with the summary of results. Their quarter 2019 consolidated GAAP earnings were $1.33 per share, compared to $1.04 per share in 2018. 2018 results included a $0.06 gain from the sale of the majority of the contracts in our contract services group and a $0.22 charge from the Keystone impairment.","Excluding these two adjustments in 2018, adjusted earnings per share were up 10.8%, primarily driven by growth in the regulated business. The regulated business segment results were up $0.12 per share or an increase of 10.2% compared to 2018. The market based business results were about flat and apparent results improved $0.01 per share compared to 2018.","Our 2019 adjusted earnings through September 30 were $2.88 per share or a 10.3% increase over the same period last year. Our regulated businesses increased $0.15 per share, our market based businesses increased $0.09 per share and finally the parent results improved by $0.03 per share year-over-year.","Moving to Slide 15 let me walk through the details of the quarterly results by business. Regulated operations were up $0.12 per share in total. We had $0.11 per share increase from additional authorized revenue and surcharges to support infrastructure investments, acquisitions and organic growth. Also O&M expense decreased $0.02 per share for the quarter as a result of the continued focus on cost management and higher costs in the third quarter of 2018, related primarily to the New York American Water settlement.","Depreciation and interest increased $0.01 per share primarily to support regulated acquisition and investment growth. The market based business results for the quarter were similar to last year on continued strong performance. Finally, earnings at the parent were $0.01 per share reflective of the impacts of a lower consolidated effective tax rate offset somewhat by increased interest expense.","Moving to Slide 16, nine months ended September 30, 2019, adjusted EPS increased 10.3% year-over-year even with the weather negatively impacting the second quarter of 2019. Many of the drivers of the variances in the quarter noted previously for the regulated business also explained the year-over-year results. For market based businesses the year-to-date improved results reflect, among other things, the addition of customers under new partnerships at homeowner services and growth from the 2018 additions of two bases in the military services group.","Moving on to Slide 17, it's been a very active year so far on the regulatory front. We have $93 million in annualized new revenue this year. This includes 45 million from rate cases and 48 million from infrastructure surcharges. As Walter noted, we have also filed requests and are waiting final orders on to rate cases in two infrastructure surcharge proceedings for a total annualized revenue request of $41 million. The continued successful execution of our regulatory strategy is a key element of our ability to consistently deliver results.","Moving to Slide 18, because of our strong performance and continued focus on execution, as Susan mentioned, we are narrowing our 2019 adjusted EPS guidance to $3.56 to $3.64 per share. Our previous guidance was $3.54 to $3 .64 per share. We are also affirming our long-term earnings compounded annual growth expectation on an earnings per share basis to be in the top half of that 7% to 10% range.","Now moving on to Slide 19, as we noted in the release, on October 29, 2019, the company's board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share of common stock payable on December 4, 2019. This reflects the continuation of the 9.9% increase in the annual dividend declared by the board on April 17, 2019. We continue to be a top leader in dividend growth.","We have grown our dividend at a compound annual growth rate of 10.1% over the last five years and we expect to continue the growth at the high end of that 7% to 10% range. We continue to deliver very strong consolidated results. For the 12 months ended September 2019. Our total company consolidated return on equity is 10.4%. Our weighted average authorized regulated ROE stands at 9.8%.","Regulatory execution, along with strong results from our market based businesses allows us to consistently deliver on our earnings commitment. We believe that delivering on results, combined with our strong earnings growth and superior dividend growth expectations continues to provide excellent value for our investors.","And with that, let me turn the call back over to Susan.","Susan Story","Thanks, Susan. Many factors go into producing our consistent financial results. At the top of that list is a commitment to be the best at the fundamentals of the business. One of the most basic things we have to do as a water utility is the quality of the over 1 billion gallons of water, we provide every day throughout the United States. And whether you call it our purpose or mission or just part of the SG, we know that if we don't deliver water that is safe and reliable and nothing else, we do matters.","You see on this slide just a few of the headlines we're all reading about threats to the safety of drinking water, including lead, Legionella, P5 cyanotoxins [ph]. These are real threats that require expert and knowledgeable people in organizations who have the breadth, depth and experience to ensure the safety of the critical human need of water. And at American Water we never forget that at the end of every water pipe, there's a family that's depending on us to provide this critical need, and that every fire hydrant lives could depend on the right pressures and volumes, and that every wastewater plant serves as a shield against potential disease.","And every community should be stronger because we're there. And at the end of the day, we also know that what we do in our customers and community's best long-term interest will also be in our investors' best long-term interest. And that's what we believe it means to be a truly sustainable company. I want to close our prepared remarks by saying how much our hearts go out to the millions of people who are affected by the horrific fires in California, and how much we are in all of the amazing work being done around the clock by the incredibly brave and talented firefighters. Our California American Water employees have also been working 24x7 to keep water service to our customers there when the power is out.","We're using backup mobile and permanent generators. We're also using remote monitoring for our facilities when they're under mandatory evacuations, so we can minimize the hardship our customers may be facing during these difficult times. We were able to maintain service the entire time during the Kincaid fire and power outages, which affected two of our smaller operations in Geyserville with approximately 300 customer connections and Larkfield with approximately 2,100 connections our infrastructure assets have not been damaged. I just want to publicly thank our hardworking employees who have truly kept the water flowing to our customers under these difficult conditions.","And with that we're happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from Shar Pourreza of Guggenheim securities. Please go ahead.","Shar Pourreza","Hey, good morning, guys.","Susan Story","Good morning Shar.","Shar Pourreza","Susan can you just touch a little bit on sort of some of the publicly available data in the media that we're seeing around JEA and sort of your interest there, maybe just high level structure of your bid, because it does have an electric business. So curious if you are bidding for the entire system or just the water portion of it and just how you're sort of thinking about that process because it's actually turning out to be a little bit more competitive than we originally thought.","Susan Story","So sure, one thing that I will remind everybody is that JEA has publicly announced who would be in the next round of participation. And we're very respectful of JEA and their process. And so we can't really comment any further on anything additional about JEA. And all I will say is that we've not made any changes to our previously communicated business model strategy.","Shar Pourreza","Got it and just maybe, it's somewhat of a large transaction. Is there any disclosures assuming that you're the winning bidder how you would finance that transaction?","Susan Story","We really can't comment about anything on the process at this point.","Shar Pourreza","Okay, got it. That's helpful. And then just around the military services, congrats Walter and West Point, and obviously, the Joint Base has done a ton of deals. Is there anything else for the balance of year that we should sort of be thinking about and maybe just quickly on how we're thinking about the opportunity set?","Susan Story","At one point we had said we expected award of up to three bases. We don't like to predict what the Department of Defense will do. The two that were awarded this year that we won, those came in September. We're not sure if there will be any others that are awarded. We do currently have five outstanding RFPs that we expect over the next one, two, three, four or five years. We do think there may be some that are awarded in 2020.","Shar Pourreza","Got it and just lastly on California, is there any remaining approvals around the desalination project that's been, I guess, a little bit of pushback at the local level, but is there anything you guys need from a permit or approvals to sort of move forward?","Walter Lynch","Hi, Shar, Walter here, we need the approvals from the California Coastal Commission. Their next meeting is scheduled on November 14 and they're going to take it up at that meeting. So that's the next approval that we need.","Shar Pourreza","Terrific, thanks, guys. Congrats on the results today.","Susan Story","Thanks Shar.","Operator","The next question today comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Hey, good morning to you.","Susan Story","Good morning, Julian.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Hey, so a quick question. Can you elaborate a little bit more on Indiana and the perspective impacts of any legislation in that states just to get going here?","Walter Lynch","We're really encouraged by the legislation. That's why I wanted to highlight it on the call. We think it'll open up more opportunities. And I think there's recognition that American Water can play a role there in providing water services for communities that are having trouble doing it on their own. So it's consistent with legislation. It's been in Indiana and across the country, about how we can play a role to help the communities.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Yeah. But just in terms of it translating back to more tangible opportunities is still a little bit on the way to see it.","Walter Lynch","Yes, I mean it \u2013 well, we think that there'll be more discussions, but it's going to take time to work this through and have the communities realize that they do have these options, but it's just part of the overall favorable legislation that we're seeing across the country. Because, again, I think legislators are realizing that we can play a significant role in helping these communities.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Got it, excellent and then can you talk a little bit more we've seen some headlines on Millburn, New Jersey, can you clarify a little bit of what's going on there? I mean, again, I don't want to put too many words out there. But just put some context around the process?","Susan Story","Specifically about what Julien?","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","There were some media articles out there about water quality, so I wanted \u2013 checking on that, yeah.","Susan Story","Right, so I think what you're referring to is there is a group called the Environmental Working Group that rather than looking at EPA guidelines and regulations or state regulations or even some of the unregulated contaminants that the EPA is looking at. I think they have come up with some of their own standards. And they've run stories that GE \u2013 even though we have all these water quality results, they're not living up to whatever standard this group has decided is appropriate. So I mean our response to that is that we take water quality and safety very seriously. The EPA establishes drinking water standards to protect the public health. We treat and deliver water that is \u2013 meets or surpasses every one of those.","And in fact, the EPA has a special program that's called the Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule, which looks at another 40 contaminants that really aren't regulated. But we voluntarily have adopted those, so that they can look and see what the impacts of those are. We meet or surpass all of our states. At the end of the day, there are a lot of groups out there who may decide that they're going to set their own goals and their own policies, but we really can't follow what every individual group does along those lines. So but we are meeting all of the EPA, we are voluntarily adopting 40 that aren't even regulated, but that we're continuing to monitor and we're acting as if they're regulated and meeting all state requirements.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Excellent. Thank you so much for the clarity.","Operator","The next question today comes from Durgesh Chopra of Evercore. Please go ahead.","Durgesh Chopra","Hey, good morning team.","Susan Story","Good morning Durgesh.","Durgesh Chopra","Good morning, Susan. Just to follow up on a Shar's question on the military bases, congratulations on the win there. What's the \u2013 can you just help us think about the size of those bases relative to the existing fleet of bases that you have currently? And actually think about margins and revenues coming in is it more sort of a 12 to 16 month lag from here on?","Susan Story","Yeah, so Durgesh Joint Base San Antonio because it is comprised two army and two Air Force bases, I believe is the largest that we have in our 16 bases in terms of the 50 year, over 700 million revenue. It's the largest that we've had. And West Point is nice size military installation. Also, we do know that, just like across the US where there are infrastructure needs, we're finding at the military bases that a lot of their infrastructure is from right after World War II when most of the military bases were built. So if you remember, we make money three ways with the military bases. There's a 50 year O&M contract, then when we take over, there's typically upgrades we need to make. And then any future projects that are capital or working capital on these bases, we then can add that as part of the O&M. And we get paid to do those plus the fee.","So what we're finding is the military bases also need infrastructure upgrades and investment just like the rest of the country does. So we're looking at these in terms of all three of those areas. So we're very pleased. In Texas, we have Fort Hood, which is also, I believe, one of the top two or three largest bases we have. So it's very exciting to us to be able to grow in that respect. And then we look and the Air Force and the army continue to be quite active. There's a lot of opportunity in Navy, we believe they have really not done much privatization. So we're stepping back looking at the basis and facilities across the country. Again, we have five outstanding RFPs that we're already in the middle of the process and we're looking to any new ones that may come up in the next year.","Durgesh Chopra","Thanks, Susan and what about the margins, I guess, I was really asking what the margins from the two bases that were just awarded this past quarter, when should we model those hitting the bottom line? Is it 12 to 16 months out from here or longer than that?","Susan Story","So first of all we don't talk about margins. However, it's a great point while to technically, we assume these contracts on September 30, there's pretty much a standard eight month transition for each of these bases. And by June the 30th of next year, we will be fully operational on those bases with the full amount of revenue that we get from those bases at that point.","Durgesh Chopra","Awesome, that's great. And then just one final \u2013","Susan Story","I'm sorry, June 1 not June 30.","Durgesh Chopra","Okay, perfect. And then just one quick clarification, did we lower the CapEx guidance for this year? I'm not sure if I'm reading this correctly.","Susan Story","No, so it may be a little confusing. What we did on the chart is we broke out regulated acquisitions, capital from the infrastructure. So we're still looking at around 1.9 billion, which is what we had guided to, so its 1.9 billion total. And what we expect that breakdown to be is around 1.7 billion into our existing regulated infrastructure and probably 250, 260 million on regulated acquisitions.","Durgesh Chopra","Awesome, thank you so much, that's super helpful.","Susan Story","Thanks Durgesh.","Operator","The last question today comes from Richard Verdi of Coker & Palmer. Please go ahead.","Richard Verdi","Hi, good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking my call and nice quarter as well. Thank you.","Susan Story","Thank you, Rich.","Richard Verdi","Thanks. So I'm quite clear on things and some of my other questions have been answered. But I do want to actually revert back to a question I would periodically ask in the past for an update due to some of the events that transpired during the quarter and to avoid being granular, I'm going to ask this on a very high level. So when we think about the company's portfolio, obviously it has a nice portfolio of states given the quarter report, given quarter reports going back for many quarters, but that doesn't mean that there's not opportunity in states outside the portfolio. On the other hand, to states where the company had the footprint are very compelling from a need to bring infrastructure perspective and also on the regulatory front. So moving forward in the near to intermediate term is the strategy maybe more to work within the states in which the company operates and try to expand within those states? Or can we maybe expect the company to more and more announces if it's trying to enter other states?","Walter Lynch","Hi, Rich, Walter here.","Richard Verdi","Hi, Walter.","Walter Lynch","No, it's really both. We continue to invest in our infrastructure in the states where we operate; we continue to look for opportunities in those states. But we also look outside our footprint. And for us to enter a new state, we really need a good business environment, a good regulatory environment and then the opportunity to grow to a certain size because we just don't want to buy a small system and just have that system. So we want to be able to expand in the state. So we're looking at that and we actively look at that, but we do both. And as far as growth goes inside, our growth, we're investing, as we said 1.7 billion this year. And we're going to be spending over 250 million to acquire systems in our footprint, which is I think tremendous, and just shows the dedication and the value that we're providing to these communities.","Susan Story","And Walter is exactly right. And into remind many of you, and I think we have said this in the past. When we look at \u2013 and we do have a corporate business development group and we're always looking at every state across the country, we actually have them kind of looking at the regulatory environment, the business environment. But the thing that typically will slow us down from going into new state is we believe it's important that within five years, we have 50,000 customer connections because part of our brand is affordability and the fact that we're looking at O&M inefficiency. And if you just have a couple of 3,000 in a state, it's very hard to get those efficiencies. So when we're looking at whether we would go into new state, those are kind of the three gates that we have that we would go through.","Richard Verdi","Okay, that's great. I appreciate the color guys. Thank you and great quarter again. Thank you very much.","Susan Story","Thanks, Rich.","Operator","The next question today comes from David Paz [ph] of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Yeah. Hey, good morning.","Susan Story","Good morning.","Unidentified Analyst","Just back to the DSL projects in California. I know you guys mentioned you still need the permits to get approved there. But just given that the staff recommended and denial, can you maybe just provide a little bit more color? And I guess if you were to not get the permits, how does that kind of impact the project and again, the capital plan going forward?","Walter Lynch","Yeah, I'll take that question. This is Walter. The primary reason that the staff voted no, was they see the expansion of the Pure Water Monterey recycling project is capable of providing sufficient water to meet the future demands. We don't agree with that. And it's actually not in line with what the PUC discovered as well as far as the future demand. So that's the real area of contention. And so the November 14 hearing and meeting we're going to be putting our views forward on that. But I mean that's where the disagreement comes in. And we actually had an environmental impact report that stated the demand was much higher as well.","Unidentified Analyst","Great, and just to the extent that, I guess it were to not go for the capital plan, I guess, the expectation there is that you would just kind of backfill any kind of CapEx were lost.","Walter Lynch","Yes, that's right.","Unidentified Analyst","Great, thanks.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Susan Story for any closing remarks.","Susan Story","Thank you, Alyssa. Thank you all for participating in our call today.

At the end of our prepared remarks, we will open the call up for questions. ","And now, I'll now turn the call over to American Water's President and CEO, Susan Story.","Susan Story ","Thanks, Ed. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us. Today our CFO, Susan Hardwick, will cover our second quarter financial results; and our COO, Walter Lynch will give key updates on our operations. ","American Water employees delivered strong results in the second quarter despite the significant impact of unusually wet weather throughout our service area. I'll highlight just a few of the accomplishments this quarter. First, we continue to deliver strong consistent growth and financial performance. Adjusted earnings were up 13.3% compared to last year, despite the wet weather I just mentioned. ","As a reminder, weather impacts typically occur in the third quarter, but the historical rains and flood in the second quarter resulted in a $0.05 quarter-over-quarter difference. We saw growth in our regulated and market-based businesses during this quarter. We added more than 37,000 customer connections year-to-date through both closed acquisitions and organic growth. This includes welcoming over 23,000 wastewater customers in Alton, Illinois, where we have been privileged to provide water for our company's entire 133-year history. Alton is also home to one of our regulated business customer care centers, and the Homeowner Services customer center. ","We finalized general rate cases in Kentucky and Indiana, where we have invested more than $600 million combined since our last cases to ensure clean, safe and reliable water for our customers. Walter will give more details on our regulatory activities in just a minute. All three market based businesses growth with especially strong growth from Homeowner Services. We were proud to join Philadelphia officials in May to announce that our water and Sewer Line Protection partnership is already having a significant positive impact to customers in the Philadelphia community. ","Also in the quarter, we successfully completed a $1.1 billion debt offering and S&P affirmed our A corporate credit rating with a stable outlook. We're pleased with S&P\u2019s decision. Having access to capital at lower debt costs enhances our ability to make needed investments while minimizing the cost impact on the customers we serve. ","Slide 6 shows our year-to-date performance. The foundation for our earnings growth continues to be the capital investment we make in our regulated operations. We invested almost $800 million during the first half of the year with virtually all dedicated to our regulated business. We expect to invest $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion for the year, reflecting both the strong acquisition closings this year, along with continued and growing need for infrastructure investment in our regulated states. And as I mentioned, results for our market based businesses continues to be strong. ","Moving to Slide 7, with this continued strong performance and our commitment to the execution of our strategies, we are affirming our 2019 adjusted EPS guidance of $3.54 to $3.64 per share. American Water will invest $8 billion to $8.6 billion from 2019 through 2023 as we continue to invest in our infrastructure. We have a line of sight to a 31.5% O&M efficiency ratio by 2023 which is a key element of our commitment to ensure affordability for our customers. And under our 2019 to 2023 plan, we do not see the need to issue equity. ","In summary, we remain on track to meet our long-term earnings growth target in the top half of the 7% to 10% range. ","Now, Walter will give a more detailed update on our regulated business.","Walter Lynch","Thanks, Susan. Good morning, everyone. As Susan said our Regulated Businesses had a solid first half of the year in spite of the very wet weather in the second quarter. We continue on a steady path making capital investments to ensure clean, safe and reliable water service, while we continue to improve our operating efficiencies to benefit our customers. We also continued to grow through acquisitions, closing on 12 transactions through the end of July. ","Let me start on Slide 9 with the weather impact for the quarter. As a reminder, we had a $0.01 positive benefit from weather -- warmer weather in the second quarter of 2018. In the second quarter of 2019, we experienced significant precipitation in the Midwest and the Northeast. In fact, The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported that the past 12 months in United States have been the wettest on record. And that 2019 had the most rain since records began 124 years ago. ","As a result of these extreme conditions, we had a total quarter-over-quarter unfavourable impact of $0.05. By the way, this little meteorologist is the grandson of our Vice President of Regulatory Services. ","Turning to Slide 10, we continue to have a very busy regulatory calendar focused on needed investment with a keen eye toward reducing customer bill impacts. I'll cover a few highlights. In Kentucky, we received approval from the Kentucky Public Service Commission for new water rates effective June 28, with an authorized return on equity of 9.7% and an equity ratio 48.9%. The case was driven by more than $100 million in investment since filing our last rate case in January 2016. ","The Kentucky Public Service Commission also approved the implementation of a qualified infrastructure program charge that will allow the company's replaced aging pipes as well as other assets while reducing regulatory lag. This is now our ninth state with infrastructure surcharge mechanism in place. ","Moving to Indiana, the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission approved the settlement agreement reached with other parties in June with an authorized return on equity of 9.8% and an equity ratio of 53.41%. The primary driver of the case was the company's investment of $542 million since our last case in 2014. ","California American Water put into effect its 2018 rate case decision on May 11, 2019 resulting in a $4 million annualized increase in authorized revenue. Decision also approved $103 million in infrastructure improvements. Rates were consolidated for several service areas in Northern California to ensure reliable water service at an affordable price. ","We also have two pending rate cases in Virginia and California. In Virginia, we filed a general rate case in November 2018, requesting an overall increase of $5.6 million, driven by approximately $98 million in infrastructure upgrades since April 2017. California American Water file for new rates covering 2021 through 2023 requesting an increase in authorized revenue of $46.6 million over three years beginning with a $26 million increase proposed for January 1, 2021. The request includes $197 million for infrastructure improvements throughout this date. We expect the decision on the case in late 2020, with new rates taking effect on January 1, 2021. ","Moving on to Slide 11, we continue to grow the size of our footprint, with 12 water and wastewater acquisitions occurring in seven states. These closed acquisitions added 30,700 customer connections, including 23,000 new wastewater customer connections from the Alton, Illinois acquisition, Alton Mayor Brant Walker stated that the sale of the wastewater systems to Illinois American Water is \u201cIn the city's best interest and provides significant net proceeds to help fund other city needs and priorities.\u201d This is another example of how we're growing wastewater in areas where we serve water customers, leveraging our tremendous expertise and our commitment to the communities we serve. ","We also welcome 6,500 new customer connections through organic growth. And we welcome another 38,200 customer connections through 29 signed agreements in eight states. These agreements reflect our commitment to provide water and wastewater solutions to communities across the country. ","Moving to Slide 12, customers remain at the center of every decision we make. This means smart investments balanced by efficient operations and capital deployment. We invested $792 million in our regulated operations in the first half of this year, with $712 million dedicated to infrastructure improvements and $18 million in funding acquisitions for our regulated business. We minimized the customer bill impacts through these investments through our continued focus on controlling O&M costs. These cost savings are driven by optimizing capital spend through value engineering, utilizing constructive regulatory mechanisms, and deploying technology developed with input from our employees and our customers. ","As you can see, we continue to make progress toward our long-term goal of 31.5% by 2023. For example, we've developed and started to deploy a web-based work management software for our field service representatives. This software will put the control of daily planning in the hands of local operations, allowing our field service representatives to manage and optimizing our work, quickly reroute to emergency orders, and balance employees\u2019 work to ensure we\u2019re meeting the needs of our customers. ","Moving to Slide 13. I want to highlight the importance of the investments that we make to improve the resiliency of our assets. What you're looking at is a photo of a recent flood in Davenport, Iowa, when the Mississippi River crested at a record 22.7 feet. The picture was taken from the vantage point of our water treatment plant and is a proof that our focus on the resiliency of our systems benefits our communities. This particular plan is secured and protected by a 2,200 foot long floodwall that was completed in 2013. The $11.8 million project was a successful partnership between Iowa American Water and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, safeguarding the drinking water supply for over 130,000 residents in the Iowa Quad Cities. This is only one example of how we continue to make necessary investments to ensure that our customers receive reliable high quality water service.","Finally, I want to recognize our Illinois American Water President Bruce Hauk, who was awarded the 2019 Inclusion & Diversity Award by the National Black Chamber of Commerce during its annual conference last week. This award is presented annually to an individual who champions inclusion and diversity within their company. American Water sees inclusion and diversity as vital elements in creating an environment in which our differences are celebrated and contribute to our success. It's also critical to us that our employees reflect the communities that we're privileged to serve. So congratulations, Bruce for living our values.","So it was a good quarter with continued growth, smart investments and engaged employees, driving efficiencies and quality results also benefit our customers. ","With that, I'll turn the call over to Susan for more detail on our financial performance.","Susan Hardwick","Thank you, Walter. And good morning, everyone. I'll start on Slide 15 with a summary of results. Second quarter 2019 consolidated GAAP earnings were $0.94 per share, compared to $0.91 per share in 2018. 2018 results included an $0.08 per share after tax benefit from the Freedom Industries insurance settlement. Excluding the 2018 benefit adjusted earnings per share were up 13.3% driven primarily by growth in Regulated Businesses, but also strong growth in the market based businesses and some earnings from the parent. ","The regulated business segment was at $0.01 per share compared to adjusted in 2018 earnings increasing 1.2%. Susan and Walter already discussed the unusually wet weather conditions in the second quarter. And without that unfavourable impact, the regulated business segment results would have increased by 7%, which is well in line with our rate base and EPS growth objectives. Both the market based businesses and the parent company were each up $0.05 per share. ","Our 2019 adjusted earnings through June 30 were $1.55 per share or a 9.2% increase over the same period last year. Our Regulated Businesses increased $0.02 per share. Without the unfavourable weather impact, the regulated business segment results would have increased by about 5% year-to-date compared to last year. Our market based businesses increased $0.09 per share primarily from Homeowner Services. And finally, the parent results improved by $0.02 per share year-over-year. ","Moving on to Slide 16, let me walk through the adjusted quarterly results by business. Regulated operations were up $0.01 per share in total as I mentioned, we had a $0.10 per share increase from additional authorized revenue and surcharges to support infrastructure investment, acquisition and organic growth. You'll also see on this slide the $0.05 per share quarter-over-quarter unfavourable impact of weather. ","Next, O&M expense increased slightly and depreciation and interest increased $0.03 per share mainly to support regulated acquisition and investment growth. ","Turning to the market based businesses, the $0.05 per share increase was mainly from our Homeowner Services Group due to growth in partnerships and the full year impact from the acquisition of Pivotal Home Solutions in 2018. The Military Services Group and Keystone combined for $0.01 per share increase and another $0.01 from the final wrap up of the exit of operations in Canada. ","Finally, the parent recognized earnings of $0.03 per share due to the sale of the legacy investment. The timing of expenses and other items added $0.04 per share in the quarter which you'll know is largely gone on a year-to-date basis. And as expected interest expense was a $0.02 per share drag in the quarter. ","Moving on to Slide 17, six month adjusted EPS increased 9.2% year-over-year even with the weather impact. Many of the drivers of the variances in the quarter noted previously also explain the year-over-year results. ","Moving to Slide 18 as Walter detailed it has been a very active year so far on the regulatory front. We have $84 million in annualized new revenues this year, and this includes $45 million from rate cases and $39 million from infrastructure surcharges. We have also filed request and are awaiting final orders on two rate cases and three infrastructure surcharge proceedings for a total annualized revenue request of $39 million. Our weighted average authorized ROE stands at 9.8%. The continued successful execution of our regulatory strategy is a key element of our ability to consistently deliver results. ","Moving to Slide 19. Because of our strong performance and continued focus on execution, we are affirming our 2019 adjusted earnings guidance range of $3.54 to $3.64 per share. We are also affirming our long-term earnings compounded annual growth expectation on an earnings per share basis to be in the top half of the 7% to 10% range.","Moving to Slide 20, as we noted in the release on July 26, 2019, the company's Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share payable on September 4. This reflects the continuation of the 9.9% increase in the annual dividend declared by the Board on April 17th of 2019. We continue to be a top leader in dividend growth.","We have grown our dividend at a compound annual growth rate of 10.1% over the last five years, and we expect to continue that growth consistent with our EPS growth expectation at the high end of the 7% to 10% range. ","We continue to deliver results as expected. For the 12 months ended June 2019 our total company consolidated return on equity was 10.2%. We believe that delivering on results, combined with our strong earnings growth and superior dividend growth expectations continue to provide excellent value for our investors. ","And with that, let me turn the call back over to Susan. ","Susan Story ","Thanks, Susan. Last week, we were very pleased to add three new independent directors to our American Water Board. Kimberly Harris, Patricia Kampling and Lloyd Yates are highly seasoned utility executives who bring combined strengths and expertise in regulatory, operations, business continuity, technology, people leadership and a deep commitment to customers and communities. They will make our already outstanding Board even better. This matters to those who invest in American Water. ","When deciding the value of an investment, we know that the profiles of our traditional investors are evolving and expanding. We've described some of those profiles on this page. We know that our traditional utility investors need us to keep our conservative, predictable, low risk and dividend growth priorities. We also know that the growing power of ESG investors is very consistent and complementary to our environmental leadership commitment, our leading governance structure and our focus on our employees, customers and communities. ","Research shows some pretty interesting facts and here some of these investors are which we share on this slide. Likewise, the uniqueness of the different sectors we touch provide a choice for both domestic and international investors looking for infrastructure, environment, growth, water and other specific personal interest areas. Even with somewhat varying priorities, we know that all of our investors expect predictable financial performance, successful execution of our strategies, transparency, integrity, strong governance, and a deep commitment to our customers and communities. That's the American Water story, and it's one that we're proud to tell. ","With that, we're happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","It\u2019s actually [Ryan Reynold] on for Julien. Can you talk about your strategy in states you don't currently operate in as more and more states adopt fair market value legislation? What states are most appealing for you and how big can potential opportunities be?","Susan Story","Sure. So currently our growth model is to continue to do tuck-ins and acquisitions in the states where we're present. We do have a model, however, where we have a corporate business development group, and we look across the country. And we actually rate each day pretty much on a couple of factors. One is the regulatory environment. The second is the business environment, how open are they to private water. And the third one is, is there a way within five years we could have at least 50,000 customer connections, because if not, we don't think that it is a benefit, because it could hurt our brand as being efficient, and making sure that we're providing the best economic value for all of our customers. So we don't disclose our ranking of those states. But we are very much aware of what's going on in all the states across the country. And we do those evaluations on a frequent basis.","Unidentified Analyst","And then it looks like the quarter got some help from the asset sales to help offset the unfavourable weather, how much margin you guys have built into the forecast for wet weather in the second half '19?","Susan Hardwick","Well, we don't have anything built into forecast for the last half of the year. We would expect normal weather. We talk about sort of a range of weather dollars that we would anticipate before we would have a significant impact on guidance. We obviously saw a little bit warmer weather in July, but we've got a lot of the third quarter left. So we'll see how the rest of the year plays out. ","Susan Story","And keep in mind Ryan, we always talk about the fact that we build in a plus or minus $0.06 in our guidance range. So that's what we'll be looking at in the third quarter. So you can always expect and that doesn't mean that outside of that we would make any changes, but it means that built into our range we're already expecting that type of variability.","Unidentified Analyst","That's helpful. Thank you. And then just lastly, the $100 million increase in CapEx. Is that purely from acquisitions?","Susan Hardwick","Yes, that really is the driver Ryan.","Operator","Next question comes from Jonathan Reeder of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Jonathan Reeder ","So if you could -- could you expand a little bit on the parental, the legacy investment, what it pertain to and why you elected to include it and the ongoing $0.94 number?","Susan Hardwick","The legacy investment we referred $0.02 to $0.03 impact there really relates to a holding that dates back to probably 20 years ago to a previous investment. And we just look at opportunities from time-to-time when they present themselves to monetize investments like that, and the opportunity presented itself in this particular quarter. ","Susan Story ","And also the reason that we included it is, we rarely consider anything to be non-GAAP. We try very hard not to. There's a lot of puts and takes we do if it's a one-time change in the tax in a states, that can be $0.04 or $0.05, we don't pull that out. We have as we did if it's a sale of a business, like CSG, we pull that out. But typically unless it's a significant -- and I mean a significant insurance type thing we went to reframe industries or the one-time taxes, we just don't want to get into having these big laundry list of non-GAAP items. So each quarter, we have puts and takes on both sides that are one-time, but they tend to balance out over time.","Jonathan Reeder ","Okay. Were sales contemplated in the guidance range when you originally set it?","Susan Story ","Again, we don't look at everything on the balance sheet. And we don't look at that. So it wasn't really contemplated. As we look at puts and takes, it was just one of the things that we had out there. We also have had some negative, I know that there have been a couple of times that we increased reserves for different types of things related to insurance or any type of legal ongoing, and we don't pull those out either.","Jonathan Reeder ","Okay. And then I guess maybe ask a little bit of different way. How do your Q2 results compare to your internal plan? Because I know you indicated Q1 was a $0.01 better.","Susan Story ","So we are so good at doing our budget, Jonathan, that now we don't give quarterly guidance. So one of the things we have not given quarterly guidance since we IPO\u2019d back out in 2008 and \u201809. And there's a reason because while I know that all utilities have variability during the year, in our business, for example, as Walter mentioned, with the wettest on record, we tend to look at a range and we look at a best case, worst case, expected case, and there's so many puts and takes in there. But there's a reason we don't give quarterly guidance. And there's also a reason we give annual guidance. And of course, you all like to model and look at that. And we understand that and we do have budgeting inside. But we -- this is why we don't give quarterly guidance.","Jonathan Reeder ","Fine. The only reason I asked is because on the Q1 call you indicated you were a $0.01 better than your internal plan so.","Susan Story ","Yes, yes, ","Jonathan Reeder ","So just wanted to continue that comment.","Susan Story ","So it was a good quarter. ","Jonathan Reeder ","Okay. And then the Phil partnership, if you\u2019ll recall you said that was just like 100,000 contracts. Just wondering how that growth has progressed in the last three months? What are you up to now?","Susan Story ","Yes, I don't have that number. And I'm not sure that we have that, we can get that to you. One of the things we've seen in Philadelphia is a -- the several of the elected officials see this as such a benefit to their citizens, that they're being very vocal about the benefits of this program. And what we did see is that it has already shown itself to be very helpful to many of the constituents who have taken up this warranty service. And that's our point about, it's doing really well, it's continuing to do well, and we're seeing a lot of community support.","Jonathan Reeder ","Great. And then the last one, are you still thinking that there could be three military bases awarded this year, and get that notification we assume as you bid on all three of those?","Susan Story ","So we are expecting up to three. It's always hard, as you know, Jonathan to predict exactly what the Department of Defense and the services will do. But there could be up to three based on their schedules. And we are very hopeful. It is a very competitive business. We know that we can operate not just efficiently and effectively, but we have leading R&D in terms of dealing with emerging contaminants such as PFAS and all of the type of perchlor and alkals that fall into that. And so, we're very hopeful that from a value added standpoint that we will be the successful winner on all of them, but we will see. ","Jonathan Reeder ","Okay, so you are involved in all three of those that you're saying. ","Susan Story ","The three that will be awarded that we talk about are those that we are involved with. Yes.","Operator","The next question comes from Richard Verdi of Coker & Palmer. Please go ahead. ","Richard Verdi","I just want to say that's a really nice job with earnings this quarter and managing the weather situation. That's kind of a way to manage the business that can be unfavourable, that\u2019s a nice quarter. So when I look at -- I have a kind of something pertaining to P&L. So when I look at my model, I think $0.94 for the quarter, you guys delivered $0.94, on the top you guys delivered at $0.82. So I mean it was pretty tight across up and down the model. However, I mean inside of there, there was -- I mean well it was all tight, there was a little bit of noise. And when you add up that noise, there's somewhat of an issue where really some of that was net with the below the line, other net of 15 million. Can you just discuss maybe a little bit maybe as going off with Jonathan, old Susan or new Susan, please, the 15 million and what we should think about that going forward for modelling purposes?","Susan Hardwick","Well, I guess -- this is new Susan, I would probably say that maybe we need to take this a bit offline for a detailed conversation around that. I think, Susan summarized just a few minutes ago that we view this as a very strong quarter. And it is a matter of transactions that occur and we do a nice job I think of sort of mitigating some of the impacts from weather and other things. But we can certainly have a more detailed conversation with you about some of your model inputs, if that'd be helpful. ","Richard Verdi","And then I just have a follow up question to a question I had on the last quarter call pertaining to the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection setting the standards for the PFAS contamination earlier this year. I mean that's something that should act as a as an impetus for privatization in a state and in a state -- I mean obviously New Jersey it\u2019s imperative to the American story. And so now that we're few months moved from that announcement out of the New Jersey DEP camp, I was wondering if maybe you could give us a sense of whether or not the company is potentially seeing an uptick in privatization chatter with municipalities as a result of those PFAS standards out of the New Jersey DEP?","Walter Lynch","Yes, Rich, Walter here. And the answer is I would say, yes. And this is coupled with Water Quality Accountability Act with the PFAS standards. A lot of the missile leaders are looking for options. And we're in discussions with them about sharing our expertise and buying their systems and integrating what they do every day into what we do every day. So, I think it has contributed to more discussions with municipalities as they face these challenges. And we're ready to help them and ready to help the communities meet these challenging standards. So yes, I would say yes to your answer -- your question. ","Operator","And I see that there is one more question. That question comes from Michael Gaugler of Janney Montgomery Scott. Please go ahead.","Michael Gaugler","Just wondering if you have any concerns on project work in your Military Group? It appears we're going to shift about 3.6 billion from military base construction to border security. Kind of how you're thinking about that? ","Susan Story ","It\u2019s a great question, Mike. We actually have worked with our MSG folks and they have been talking with the commanding officers at the bases, the 14 bases we serve. Right now, we don't see an impact from those. These projects, especially the ones beyond the O&M that are special capital projects on base are typically decided a few months out. And as you know, September 30th is the end of the fiscal year. So at this point, we're seeing actually an uptick from where were in the last year or so in terms of interest in getting projects done. And right now, we're not seeing an impact. We'll continue to monitor that and we are having conversations. ","Michael Gaugler","And then just as a follow up. Wondering if you think that could slow down any new rate -- any new base contract awards? ","Susan Story ","That's interesting. We don't see that. In fact what we are seeing is there are several out there that are in process. And we've not seen those slow down. In fact as I mentioned earlier the three we expect to be awarded are active. They have a big process and you basically participate with them unlike where you put a bid and you don't hear for a long time. We actually have to contact with them. And we've not seen those schedules slow down this year at least for those three that are expected to be awarded. ","Operator","Seeing no further questions, I'd like to turn the call back over to Susan Story for closing remarks. ","Susan Story ","Thank you, Andrew. Thanks to you all for participating in our call today. Please note we value you as our investor owners and as the financial analysts who research our company to the benefit of your clients and your futures. We always want to be very transparent in all of our discussions and dealings with you so you can have complete confidence in your decisions around our company and the investments in our stock. If we have not been able to address your question or you have additional questions, please call Ed or Ralph and they'll be happy to walk through anything that you\u2019d like to talk about.

All statements made during this call related to earnings and earnings per share refer to diluted earnings and earnings per share.","And with that, I will now turn the call over to American Water's President and CEO, Susan Story.","Susan Story","Thanks, Ed. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Today, our CFO, Linda Sullivan, will cover our second quarter financial results; and COO, Walter Lynch, will give key updates on our operations. The employees of American Water delivered strong results in the second quarter of 2018. We had a number of positive events this quarter, and I will highlight just a few of them. First, we continue to deliver strong consistent growth and financial performance. I will discuss more details in just a moment. Our Regulated Business continued to make critically needed investment in infrastructure for safety, reliability and resiliency. We continue to provide water and wastewater solutions within our service areas through disciplined acquisitions. We also made progress in optimizing our portfolio of Market-Based Businesses. We completed the acquisition of Pivotal Home Solutions, which significantly grew and enhanced our Home Warranty Business. As we've noted before, Pivotal is a leading provider of home warranty protection products and services and is highly complementary to our legacy Homeowner Services Group.","On July 5, we announced the sale of the majority of our Contract Services business to Veolia North America for a purchase price of $27 million. Veolia and we have already closed on 17 of the 23 contracts sold with the remainder to close by the end of the year. We will keep 4 separate contracts in Camden, North Brunswick and South Orange, all in New Jersey, as well as Godfrey, Illinois due to their proximity to our existing service areas.","Six other contracts, not part of the Veolia transaction, are being sold to others or will terminate within the next 12 months. Another highlight of the quarter is the selection of American Water to the inaugural NAACP Equity, Inclusion and Empowerment Index. This index was created in partnership with Impact Shares and Morningstar and tracks and monitors indicators that assess racial equity and inclusion policies among U.S. corporations with a $2 billion or higher market capitalization. We are a values-driven company, and our employees represent the communities we are privileged to serve. This is a real honor for us, as our people take pride in delivering the critical services of water, sanitation and fire protection to about 14 million Americans in diverse communities throughout the nation.","Lastly, the global settlement related to the Freedom Industries chemical spill in West Virginia has obtained final court approval and the appeals period has ended. We also settled the one outstanding claim with our last insurance carrier related to this matter. Linda will give you greater detail on the related financials in just a few minutes.","For the sake of our employees and the communities and customers we're privileged to serve in West Virginia, we're pleased this matter has reached its conclusion. As always, we remain focused on giving all of our customers the best quality product and services possible. In fact, our West Virginia Kanawha Valley Water Plant won first place this year in the statewide tapwater taste test competition. This is the plant that was affected by the Freedom Industries chemical spill in 2014.","Moving to our financial performance. Our adjusted earnings per share were up 13.7% compared to second quarter 2017. The foundation for our earnings growth continues to be the capital investment we make in our regulated operations. We invested $1.1 billion during the first half of the year, with $713 million for our regulated infrastructure and $363 million for the purchase of Pivotal. We minimized the customer bill impacts of our infrastructure investment through a continued focus on controlling O&M costs, optimizing capital spend through value engineering and volume procurement and through constructive regulatory mechanisms. Walter will discuss examples of these in just a few minutes.","We continued to grow our Regulated Business. Today, we have welcomed 10,300 new customer connections through closed acquisitions and organic growth. Just as a reminder, we said customer connections because it's more accurate to measure additions by customer meters rather than try to estimate the number of people who live in every house. Typically, and it varies location by location, but on average, there are about 3 or more customers per residential meter. When we at American Water refer to customer additions, we're talking in terms of meter connections. We have an additional 57,000 customer connections under agreement for acquisition. This includes 2 recently announced additions, one in New Jersey, where we will welcome 3,900 new water customers; and one in Pennsylvania, where we will add another 9,000 new wastewater customers. We've had two quarters of strong performance in 2018 and are affirming today our 2018 adjusted guidance of $3.22 to $3.32 per share, which excludes the $0.08 insurance settlement benefit related to Freedom Industries.","As most of you are aware, it has been our practice for the past several years to narrow or change our annual EPS earnings range following our third quarter results and we will do so again this year. American Water will invest $8.4 billion to $9 billion over the next five years, with more than $7.2 billion spent to improve our existing infrastructure. We see line of sight to our 32% target O&M efficiency ratio by 2022.","Our regulated operations will continue to be our core business. Under this plan and normal operating conditions, no new equity will be needed. With this strong performance and our continued execution of strategies, we affirm our long-term EPS CAGR to be in the top half of our 7% to 10% range through 2022. Walter will now give you his update on our Regulated Business.","Walter Lynch","Thanks, Susan. Good morning, everyone. As Susan mentioned, our Regulated Businesses had a strong first half of the year, making capital investments to ensure clean, safe and reliable water service, while continuing to improve our operating efficiencies to benefit our customers. We also had tremendous growth driven by acquisitions. ","Let me start on Slide 9 with an update on our New Jersey rate case. We filed this case last September, seeking recovery of more than $868 million in infrastructure upgrade statewide since our last rate adjustment in 2015. We concluded evidentiary hearings on June 25 and are now in the briefing phase of the proceeding. We expect a final decision in the first quarter of 2019. Also, effective April 1 of this year, New Jersey American Water customers received a rate decrease of almost 6% as a result of the lower federal tax rates under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.","Moving to California. We now expect both a proposed and final decision later this year on our general rate case for 2018 to 2020. If approved, this case will support approximately $230 million of capital investments on our systems.","We also expect the California Public Utilities Commission to approve in September the Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity for a water supply project in Monterey. This action, as we discussed in the first quarter, will give us the authority to move forward with this critical water supply project.","In June, Maryland American Water filed a petition with the Maryland Public Service Commission seeking recovery of approximately $18 million in capital investments since our last rate adjustment in 2015. The driver of this case is a new reservoir and intake that will secure the water supply for our customers in Bel Air and parts of Hartford County. The reservoir, which costs approximately $15.4 million is $6.3 million less than originally planned due to our value engineering approach and the tremendous team working on this water supply solution.","On the legislative front, 2 bills were recently signed in Missouri that benefit communities and water and wastewater customers. The first bill allows the state's Public Service Commission to approve a Revenue Stabilization Mechanism, or RSM, for water utilities, and RSM aligns to conservation goals of the state, customers and water providers while helping to ensure that water utilities achieve their authorized revenue requirement as established by the Public Service Commission.","The second bill changes the public vote requirement for the sale of a municipal water or wastewater system to a simple majority for towns with populations of less than 3,000. Historically, in Missouri, smaller communities need a 2\/3 majority. This new legislation increases the options for small towns and we stand ready to assist.","Also during the quarter in Iowa, legislation passed that allows private water utilities to use a future test year approach in rate cases. This will decrease potential regulatory lag and help spread out the time between rate cases.","We've also made constructive progress in our other regulated jurisdictions on the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. We've had 4 states revise their state income tax rates. Linda will talk about these in more detail in a few minutes.","Recently, in New York, we're working through a self-reported issue concerning a property tax error, which resulted in an overpayment to local taxing authorities and ultimately affected about 4,500 customer bills. We're working with the Public Service Commission leaders and staff as well as other stakeholders to ensure that the issue is resolved constructively to the benefit of everyone involved.","Turning to Slide 10. We added 5,600 new customer connections to date and have another 57,000 customer connections through signed agreements in addition to the 4,700 we added through organic growth. Most recently in July, New Jersey American Water announced an agreement to acquire the Roxbury Water Company that provides water service to nearly 3,900 customer connections in Morris County, New Jersey. Following regulatory approval, we expect to close this acquisition in early 2019. ","In June, Pennsylvania American Water signed an agreement to acquire the wastewater asset of Exeter Township in Berks County, which serves approximately 9,000 wastewater customer connections. We provide water service to about 70% of the township's residents and we're excited to be the future provider of wastewater service for the entire town. We expect to close this transaction by the end of the first quarter of 2019 pending regulatory approvals.","These agreements represent our continued focus on a regional approach to water and wastewater service, which expands our customer base, increases operational efficiency and economies of scale, while keeping rates affordable for our customers.","Moving on to Slide 11. Doing right by our customers is key to our ability to grow. This means smart investments, balanced by efficient operations and capital deployment. In the first 6 months, we invested $713 million on our regulated operations. This investment is critical to ensure reliable service, but for us it's also about affordable service. We continue to make progress towards our long-term O&M efficiency goal of 32% by 2022. And to put this into perspective, our adjusted O&M expenses are less today than they were in 2012. And during that same period, we invested more than $7.2 billion on our infrastructure and added more than 150,000 customer connections.","Let me give you 2 examples of how our employees are driving these results. Starting in 2017, we expanded the use of drones to perform visual inspections of our aboveground water tanks. This is a safer and faster way to visually inspect tanks while providing more detailed information. We can now perform about 150 visual inspections of aboveground water tanks in 6 months when it once took us 4 years to complete this work. We've also developed software that uses artificial intelligence to analyze thousands of images and millions of data points per day to detect deteriorating tank coating. This allows us to manage our tank maintenance program more proactively and efficiently, and again, it's a much safer way to conduct this work.","Our technology and innovation group is also developing a series of physical and digital solutions to detect and respond to water quality events in surface water supplies. The advanced systems include an artificial intelligence smart sensor network that could detect a range of contaminants. We'll complete this program in phases and eventually these sensors will tie into our operations and initiate treatment protocol. We're very excited about this project and what it can mean for our entire industry.","Lastly, the Chemicals PFOS and PFOA that made a lot of headlines of late when it comes to water quality. New Jersey has set the nation's toughest PFOA limit to date. I'm pleased to say that we've proactively addressed this contaminant and are in compliance. I also want to commend New Jersey's leaders for their commitment to addressing this water quality concern.","As a final point, we're pleased to announce that we reached the National Benefits Agreement, with our 3,200 employees who are part of 17 national unions and represent 69 contracts. Every five years, we negotiate national benefits with their represented employees. These negotiations were marked by collaboration, professionalism and respect. Some of the highlights include making all of our employees eligible for annual performance plan and providing our employees more options to decide what benefit plans make best sense for them and their families. We look forward to our continued partnership in doing what's best for our employees.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Linda for more detail on our financial performance.","Linda Sullivan","Thank you, Walter, and good morning, everyone. Before I jump into the numbers, I would like to provide a few key updates that occurred during the second quarter on Slide 14.","First, I am pleased to announce that S&P affirmed our A credit rating with a stable outlook, which is a reflection of our strong commitment to maintaining a predominantly regulated risk profile. Second, we closed the Pivotal acquisition for $363 million on June 4, and we fully settled our equity forward agreements issuing 2.32 million shares for $183 million or approximately 50% of the purchase price. And lastly, as Susan mentioned, we received final approval by the U.S. District Court of the Freedom Industries related settlement. We also settled this quarter with the final outstanding insurer for a $20 million pretax benefit that was reflected as a non-GAAP adjustment consistent with all other elements of the settlement.","In total, West Virginia American Water's final share of the $126 million Freedom Industry related settlement, net of insurance recoveries was $23 million pretax.","As reflected on Slide 15, we had a strong second quarter of 2018. GAAP earnings were $0.91 per share, an increase of $0.18 compared to the same period last year. Excluding the insurance settlement, adjusted earnings were $0.83 per share, an increase of $0.10 or 13.7% over the same period in 2017. The Regulated segment was up $0.08 per share and the Market-Based Businesses were up $0.02.","Now let me walk through the adjusted quarterly results by each business. Regulated operations were up $0.08 per share in total. Net revenue was down $0.01 with 3 primary drivers. First, we had a $0.14 increase from additional authorized revenue and surcharges to support infrastructure investments, acquisitions and organic growth. Second, we had warmer weather resulting in a benefit of $0.01 per share, and these positives were more than offset by the $0.16 impact of the lower federal tax rate expected to benefit customers.","Next, O&M expense increased $0.05 and depreciation increased $0.02, mainly to support regulated acquisition and investment growth. Also, our income tax expense was favorable $0.16, mainly from the lower federal tax rate.","Turning to the Market-Based Businesses. The $0.02 increase was mainly from our Homeowner Services Group due to operational efficiencies from improved cost management, customer growth and the favorable impact of the lower federal tax rate. This -- the partial month of Pivotal's earnings were offset by expected integration costs. So a strong quarter for our Homeowner Services Group.","Turning to Slide 16. Our first half adjusted earnings through June 30, 2018, were $1.42 per share or a 12.7% increase over the same period last year. Our regulated operations increased $0.13 per share from investment and acquisition growth. Our Market-Based Businesses increased $0.05, primarily from Homeowner Services. Our Military Services Group was flat as operational improvements offset the impact from lower capital upgrades awarded by the Department of Defense in the first half of this year. And Keystone's first half results were accretive, aided by strong revenues from an active market, especially in water transfer. And then finally, the parent decreased $0.02, mainly from the lower tax yield on interest expense.","Turning to Slide 17, let me provide an update on tax related matters. We are making steady progress in our 14 regulatory jurisdictions on the best approach to return tax reform benefits back to our customers. The top part of this slide updates the status by state for both the tax rate change and amortization of the remeasured accumulated deferred income taxes.","Turning the state tax changes on the bottom half of this page. We had 3 states pass legislation during the second quarter that reduced future state income tax rates. For each state, we expect the impact of the lower state income tax rate to benefit our regulated customers as calculated on a stand-alone basis. Any difference between the amount determined on a stand-alone basis in each state and the actual tax expense based on state tax apportionment factors are recorded at the parent company. And during the second quarter, we recorded a $3 million cumulative noncash charge to earnings at the parent for state tax apportionment.","In addition, New Jersey passed legislation increasing the corporate business tax rates in the third quarter, and we are in the process of determining the impact of this change on both our New Jersey subsidiary and the parent company and expect to have an update in the third quarter.","Turning to Slide 18. Let me provide an update on our regulatory filings. We have $110 million in annualized new revenues effective since January 1 of this year. This includes $95 million from the Pennsylvania and Missouri rate case settlements and $15 million from infrastructure mechanisms. We have also filed request and are awaiting final orders on 4 rate cases and 1 infrastructure surcharge for a total annualized revenue request of $169 million.","Turning to Slide 19. Today, we are affirming our 2018 earnings guidance to an adjusted range of $3.22 to $3.32 per share. This excludes the $0.08 insurance benefit for the Freedom Industries related settlement. We had a strong first half this year. And looking forward, we have several items outstanding that we expect to firm up during the third quarter. First, as I mentioned, we are in the process of quantifying the impact from the increase in the corporate business tax rate in New Jersey. We also performed a preliminary assessment of our purchase price allocation for Pivotal and are working through the appropriate amortization of intangible assets, which we now expect to be a bit more front-end loaded in 2018 than originally anticipated. And while we have 1 year to complete the purchase price accounting, we expect to be substantially complete in the third quarter.","Also, we expect the lease termination costs of up to $5 million as we move into our new headquarters building in Camden later this year from 4 separate office locations. And lastly, as you know, the third quarter is typically our largest net income quarter and is the quarter with the largest potential earnings variability from weather. And as a reminder, we consider plus or minus $0.07 of weather to be normal annual weather variability that is included in our guidance range. So a lot of puts and takes expected in the last half of the year, and we are confident in our adjusted guidance range, and we'll update as appropriate in the third quarter as we typically do.","With that, I'll turn it back over to Susan.","Susan Story","Thanks, Linda. American Water's stated purpose is to keep life flowing and that means for our customers, our communities and our planet. We also have 5 values that we measure ourselves by, and those are safety, trust, environmental leadership, teamwork and high performance. Living by these values actually constitutes a full 50% of our employee performance plans and individual employee ratings. These values match up nicely with the goals of our investors interested in ESG principles and measures. We agree that the hows are just as important as the whats. While we have always focused on ESG principles as the way we should run our business, we have not done a good job communicating our efforts as well as we should have. You told us you wanted to hear more, so you will.","Following the third quarter, we will share quarterly updates on ESG metrics that are important to our company and our investors. We look forward to your feedback on these. We know that being a good corporate citizen and environmental leader and a role model for sustainability is more than metrics or communication campaign. It's ensuring that we leave our children and grandchildren a healthy planet and the natural resources that we enjoy today. It means developing solutions to issues before they become problems. It means keeping our employees and our customers safe from harm. It's providing a workplace where every employee is respected and developed to his or her fullest potential. It means building strong communities where we serve and meeting and exceeding the expectations of our customers. So we close with a snapshot of just some of the things that others outside of our company are saying about our efforts. With that, we're happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","So couple of quick follow-ups, if you can. Just to start off on New Jersey. I'm curious on the stated income tax for -- on the corporate side. Why would it not flow back to regulated customers, just given, especially the commentary in the other jurisdictions that you have in the slide here?","Linda Sullivan","So we are working through that right now, in terms of how that will affect our New Jersey subsidiary and the parent company allocation. And so as you are aware, we are currently in a general rate case in New Jersey, and so we're working through how that increase in the corporate business tax rate would impact our customers.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Right. Completely understood. But broadly speaking, you should think about this principally as a parent level impact.","Linda Sullivan","Right. And we also have a corporate headquarters that is located in New Jersey, which will impact that calculation as well. And so we're going through all of the detailed calculations from a state tax apportionment perspective. We're also working through some clarifications, either through administratively or through legislation, to make sure that we understand the complexity of how this will apply to water utilities.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Understood. Excellent. Turning back to the Market-Based side of the business, if you can. Just curious how is the sort of Keystone water side of the business going year-to-date, just given some of the trends there? And then separately, can you just talk to a little bit more of the sales side of the equation, the Veolia deal, in the context of, sort of, pruning the business? Is the thought process here, this is more opportunistic? Or should we expect more as you think about the aggregate size of the Market-Based Business and kind of bumping up against that 15% pro forma?","Susan Story","Julien, that's a great question. So I will take Keystone first and then talk about the sale of CSG and then more broadly our views and philosophy around the Market-Based Businesses. So in the Keystone and Appalachian Basin, we are continuing to see of a firm market, strong year for revenues. As Linda said, through the first half of the year, it is accretive. For example, our 2 biggest businesses in Keystone water transfer, we have steady work continuing. We're continuing to try to hire more employees. Rig count has slightly decreased for the past few months, and so we're looking at that, but we're still seeing robust activity there. And in the oil and gas construction for pipelines, we're seeing consistent bid opportunities, increased infrastructure planning for 2018 and 2019. So in terms of the business there, as you know, there are a lot of takeaway pipeline capacities that are still under construction that will be very helpful for the Appalachian Basin compared to Henry hub, as you're very aware of.","So Keystone continues to be in a good market, and we continue to monitor the market there and look at our main businesses and how we optimize those businesses. In terms of how the CSG sale, we've mentioned in the past that our Contract Services Group, and to remind everyone, this is where we run systems for other people where municipalities or industrials actually maintain the assets, we run the business. It's a much more competitive business. There are a lot more players in the market like Veolia, SUEZ, different people. And as we looked at our Market-Based segment and started looking at buying Pivotal, the growth of Homeowner Services, how well Homeowner's doing and your earlier point about ensuring that Market-Based is predominantly 15% or less of our portfolio through 2022, we've mentioned before that it could get up to 20%, but we were very clear that would have to be very regulated like, and currently about the only business in Market-Based that we see that would fit that profile is the Military Services Group.","So as we look at the business and the focus on that business and the time and effort to run it, we thought that Veolia could actually run that business better than we could, and we reached an agreement with them to buy the majority of the contracts. We -- there were 10 that they did not buy. 4 of them, we're keeping because they're in proximity to our service areas, and there is very strong community relationships there. The others, 4 of the others, there are other buyers who had first rights in many cases and 2 of them will terminate in the next 12 months. So this is an effort to, as you say, prune the Market-Based Businesses. And I've kind of alluded to then the general philosophy, which is, at our core, we are a regulated utility. When we tell you and tell the Street that we want to keep that part of the business at 15% or less and we grow parts of the business, we, of course, will always look and say, so what are the parts that we think further leverage the core competencies that we have as a water and wastewater company.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Got it. Excellent. And then lastly, can I turn quickly to Missouri. You obviously alluded to the legislation there in your prepared remarks. How does that change the strategy? I mean, obviously, you've had some success of late in the settlement there. Does that require any kind of enabling subsequent rate case here? Or how do we see that actualize the latest legislation?","Walter Lynch","Yes. As far as the RSM goes, that would be applicable in the next rate case. And as far as the growth, the legislation that deals with the vote of half simple majority instead of 2\/3, it's really just allowing us to have more discussions with municipalities throughout Missouri, and particularly some of the smaller municipalities that had a really high threshold as far as the vote count. So we just think it's more in keeping with the rest of Missouri and the rest of the country, and it enables us to have many more discussions with some of the smaller municipalities.","Operator","Our next question comes from Richard Verdi with Atwater Thornton.","Richard Verdi","Great quarter too, great on the report and on the other news delivered. I just have two quick questions regarding the acquisition front. Obviously, American is the most operationally diverse water utility and it helps blend against unfavorable weather conditions or regulatory impact. But despite that operational diversity, I was wondering if there are any states outside of that current American Water footprint that the company may be consider entering through the acquisitions?","Susan Story","So Rich, that's a great question. As a company, of course, our growth projections we give, the five year, based on growth within our service area, we do have a corporate business development group. We are always looking across the country at other states, opportunities, but as I think we have mentioned before, we have three kind of gates before we would look at going into a new state. The first one is looking at the regulatory environment, the second one is the business environment or business climate and the third one tends to be the one that is the most difficult, which is do we see a line of sight to get to at least 50,000 customers within five years. Why that's important to us? You hear Walter and Linda talk all the time about the O&M efficiency. We're very proud of the chart we put up that showed that our O&M cost, the adjusted that's used in the calculation for O&M efficiency and we have a reconciliation table in the appendix, but that calculation, our O&M costs are less today than they were in 2012. Our reputation being able to do investment that's desperately needed in systems is dependent on being able to also help offset a portion of those impacts to customer bills by reducing O&M costs. What we find is, if we don't have enough customers to get a critical mass, then we're not able to make the investments, we're not able to get some of the economies of scale. So we find that, that third element of ensuring that we can grow to about 50,000 customers in five years tends to be the one that is our biggest hurdle. So with that said, we are always looking at every state in the nation, we are always looking at opportunities, and we are always looking at a chance to grow and to provide our expertise to as many people across the country as we can.","Richard Verdi","That's great color. And for the second question, I was just wondering if the company is seeing any municipal acquisition competition from the electric utilities? And if so, how that might be impacting the acquisition effort?","Susan Story","That's a great question, Rich. So again, for water investor-owned utilities, I think that, of course, the answer is yes. And predominantly, Eversource with their acquisition of Aquarion, and I'm sure that all of you are keeping up with what's going on with the merger between San Jose, Connecticut Water, and then Eversource's bid for Connecticut Water and Cal Walter's bid for San Jose. So I think that's the main thing that we're seeing. And again outside of that, as we look at our strategy of buying municipalities that are between 3,000, 5,000 and 30,000, those are relatively small for someone to break into an industry. They also typically are in areas contiguous to where we're already located, we have name brands in those areas, we have people in communities. So for that area, we don't see as much because first of all, these acquisitions of distressed municipalities take, as Walter showed in his slides, years to cultivate relationships because when municipalities are buying, yes, price is a big deal, but they also want to make sure that their citizens have the best service possible and are taken care of, and that they don't have to worry about emerging contaminants and that they have professionals running the system. So what we find is, for that particular market that we focus on, it's more difficult for someone who is not in our industry to break into them.","Richard Verdi","Okay. Great. And actually, I have one other question, too, and it pertains to the military front. By our estimates, that's a pretty large opportunity and the majority of those contracts should be awarded between kind of next year and maybe 2025. And so I was just wondering if you could give us an update on the military base and this -- on the military base contract ops in the sense of, is that more focused on pursuing new opportunities? Or is it -- are you guys more focused on kind of pruning and improving the bases you have under the umbrella right now? I mean, are you guys going out and actively looking for new bases to bring in underneath the American umbrella?","Susan Story","That's a great question, Rich. And answer is yes, we are. And so to back up for those that may not be quite as familiar, when you buy a base, there's typically work that goes on, it's mostly -- it's working capital predominantly. Then we have an operating. Once you win a base, you have a 50-year contract to operate on that base water and wastewater. Then as you mentioned, it is buying new bases or doing capital upgrades on the bases. The reason that we've seen the Military Group for us over the past 2, 3 years be a little soft is because of that third category. When the Department of Defense went through 3 or 4 years of sequestration, their budgets decreased significantly. They didn't have as much money for fixed capital upgrades for infrastructure. The money they did have they put in more of the war fighter training and those areas.","With sequestration lifted a year or so ago, we're starting to see a little more flow. It will take a bit of time for that to kind of trickle down to providing money for the infrastructure once they've met the other needs. But you're exactly right, that we have, I think, 8 RFPs outstanding for bases. There is a chance that 3 will actually be awarded this year, and we see the rest of them being awarded over the next 3 to 4 years, as you said. We also -- there are 2 to 3 that we're looking at putting in RFPs. And to remind you, we typically only focus on the medium- to larger-size bases. Those are the ones that are worth more of our effort with our size, and that tends to be $250 million or higher for a 50-year contract value. So yes, we do see opportunity, specifically, in the Army and the Air Force. And we actually last November hired a new President of our Military Services Group, General David Turner, who had recently retired as the General from the Army, and so we're very bullish on that part of our business. We like that it is regulated like, and we do, as you mentioned, see opportunity down the road for that.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Susan Story for any closing remarks.","Susan Story","Thank you, Brandon. And thank you all for participating in our call today.

Mr. Vallejo, you may begin.","Edward Vallejo","Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to American Water's Third Quarter 2012 Conference Call. As usual, we'll keep our call to about 1 hour and at the end of our prepared remarks, we will have time for questions.","Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that during the course of this conference, both in our prepared remarks and answers to your questions, we may make statements related to future performance. Our statements represent our most reasonable estimates. However, since these statements deal with future events, they are subject to numerous risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual performance of American Water to be materially different from the performance indicated or implied by such statements. Such risk factors are set forth in the company's SEC filings, which are available to the public on the company's Investor Relations website.","With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Jeff Sterba, our President and CEO.","Jeffry E. Sterba","Thanks, Ed. I appreciate you all joining us today, and I hope you're warm and dry after the nor'easter that has hit the Eastern part of the country over the last 24 hours, particularly right along the Coast. In fact, let me start by acknowledging the tremendous impact that Sandy had on most of the Northeast last week. As you all know, there's an unprecedented amount of damage and hardship to millions of people in large parts of our service territory, where we serve about 6 million folks. On a personal note, our hearts really go out to all of those folks that have been affected, and I'm going to talk about Sandy in a little more detail in a few minutes. But, particularly to our customers in the area, our investors and our employees, we have 20 employees who lost their homes in the storm. And we have many more who lost property, had damage done to their property or to their family members' property, and they're trying to deal with that as I'm sure some of you all are, too. So our hearts go out to that, and we're certainly committed to aiding the communities in the recovery from this damaging weather.","On a brighter note, we again had very strong quarterly results, driven by consistent execution of the strategy that we've laid out. How we invest capital, the drive for operational excellence through developing a culture of continuous improvement, and focused growth in the markets within and outside of our existing footprint, as we've talked about before, it's all about execution.","If you go to Page 5, you can see that revenues are up 9% or a little over 9% for the quarter. When you couple that with how we've managed our operating costs, for the last 12-month, regulated operating efficiency ratio is 40.9% compared to 44.9% for the prior 12 months. Now as you might imagine, this is impacted a bit by the abnormally hot and dry weather that we had in the summer that drove a greater increase in sales. That impact is probably about 60 basis points. So if you tried to weather normalize, if you will, that operating efficiency ratio, it may be around 41.5%,  still a substantive improvement from the 44.9%.","As you know, we have a goal of a 40% or being below 40% by 2015. Walter and I and the rest of the team will go out on a little bit of a limb and say we're going to beat that date based on the performance that we've had so far.","Earnings per share from continuing operations is up almost 20% for the quarter and more than 30% year-to-date over the same period in 2010. Very strong cash flow from operations, which as you know, feeds our ability to spend capital and reinvest in our system. We're up about $160 million today or about a 27% increase over 2011 year-to-date.","Our return on equity is at the highest level since the IPO, and it's now a little -- about 8.15%. Recall that the $1 billion of debt that sits at the parent level that was left from the RWE ownership where we got that, they took cash. That's kind of referred to as the gift that keeps on giving, that causes about a 100-basis-point drag on that return. So based on where we are after the third quarter and what we see for the balance of the year, we're reaffirming our earnings guidance of $2.12 to $2.22 per share for continuing operations, and the $0.13 to $0.16 per share range that is due to the increased sales from the abnormally hot and dry weather of the summer.","So let me touch on a few other highlights on Slide 6. On growth, we continue to prepare for the introduction of our homeowner services to the New York City market. You'll remember from last quarter that we were selected by the New York City Water Board as the official service line protection provider, and that will be for about 600,000 homeowners. That program will get launched in the first quarter because they are installing a new CIS system, and we want to make sure that, that new system is up and running effectively before we start the launch since it will be going on that bill.","On the shale gas, let me remind you that we're really focused on what I'll call a regionalization strategy. And it is geared around meeting the needs of the gas industry while also bringing water to areas previously not served with clean, treated water. This provides for us the near-term value from sales to the drillers and the long-term value of expanding our retail base while supporting regional economic development without taking on volumetric risk. This quarter, we entered into 2 more agreements -- these are with XTO Energy -- to construct pipeline. Each of them is roughly 1 mile. One is an 8-inch line, one's an 12-inch line, to supply water for shale gas drilling as well as to provide public water service to adjacent residential areas. This approach is similar to the contracts with Rex Energy that we told you about last quarter and you will continue to see more of this kind of expansion, particularly in our Southern -- or our Western systems, both Northwest and Southwest.","On the regulated side, during the quarter and October, we completed 3 more tuck-ins with about 1,200 new customers. It means for the year that we had 8 tuck-ins for roughly about 8,000 people, not including the acquisitions that occurred in New York.","On the regulatory front, you all know about the Illinois rate case decision. While we were disappointed in the return on equity that was granted, frankly, the rest of the rate case addressed all of the issues that we wanted to see addressed and we're comfortable with those outcomes. We remain concerned about the return that was allowed in that state but, quite frankly, you have to look at the case as a totality, and the balance of that case came out reasonably well.","You also know that we had the cost of capital decision in California. Remember that unlike many of the other utilities, the return that was granted in that case is not subject to the adjustment that other utilities are experiencing or will be experiencing as of the first of the year, so it remains next year at the 9.99% rate with the thickened equity ratio.","While it's a small case, let me just mention one decision that came out subsequent to the end of the quarter and that's Tennessee. I want to mention it not because of the dollar value but because of the change in process. About a year ago, or a little over a year ago, we did some changes, Walter made some changes in the management of that state because there were things that we felt we could do better there. In addition, the governor of Tennessee took an active interest in the regulatory process and made changes. The result is that within a 5-month period, we filed a case, reached settlement and had the rates approved. 5 months is a remarkable kind of standard for a rate case proceeding. And it was settled at a 10% return.","So while it's a fairly small territory, we see it as a growth potential territory, and the kind of approach that we saw and the results that we saw in Tennessee give us good reason to thank and recognize why we are in Tennessee and want to stay there.","For the year, we're on pace for a capital spend of approximately $925 million, again with no new equity except for the very small DRIP that exists. And we're also pleased with the new credit facility that was priced at A- spreads, which is above our current formal credit rating.","Let me just close, before turning it over to Ellen Wolf, our CEO (sic) [CFO], who's going to go more details on our financials, to just spend a second on Sandy. We talk about capital investments directly benefiting our customers through improved reliability and quality. But I think what happened last week really proves that out during the hurricane and the follow-on northeaster. If you think about 85-mile an hour winds, 10 inches of rain and a couple of feet of snow in West Virginia, that's impacted our service areas in New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia and West Virginia. We serve about a total of 6 million people in those areas. Through the execution of emergency plans, the use of almost 200 generators due to the massive power losses, round-the-clock staffing and really in-depth coordination with federal, state and local agencies on both prep and recovery. Of those 6 million people, we have less than 2,000 customers that lost water service for any period. We had only minimal damage sustained by our facilities. And most importantly, there were no employee injuries.","Sometimes this stuff gets taken for granted, but to me, it speaks volumes about the strength and capabilities of our company. I really couldn't be more proud of the people that helped make this happen, particularly when many of those employees are dealing with damage and destruction of their own personal property and their families.","So again, we had a really solid quarter. Things continue to move positively forward.","And I want to turn it over to Ellen for some more detail.","Ellen C. Wolf","Thank you very much, Jeff, and welcome to those of you who are joining us on the call today. Let me also add my thanks and praise to those many American Water employees and many other individuals whose actions enabled us to keep the water running throughout the hurricane and its aftermath. Thank you.","Now turning to Slide 9. Let me describe the underlying factors that drove our third quarter results. As Jeff has indicated, for the third quarter, we continued to deliver very strong financial results with increases in revenues, net income and earnings per share, as well as continued improvement in our O&M efficiency ratio.","For the third quarter ended September 30, 2012, we reported operating revenues of approximately $832 million, a $71 million or 9% increase over the revenue reported for the third quarter of 2011. Net income from continuing operations for the third quarter was approximately $154 million or $0.87 per common share, an approximate 20% growth over the prior year.","A portion of the increase in revenues is associated with higher demand, primarily related to the warmer, drier weather in the second and third quarters of this year. We believe the estimated impact of the weather continues to be in the range of $0.13 to $0.16 per share for the 9 months ended September 30, of which $0.06 to $0.09 represents the impact during the first 6 months of the year.","Net cash provided by operating activities for the 3 months ended September 30, 2012, was around $418 million compared to $313 million for the same period in '11, primarily, driven by the increases in operating revenues, changes in working capital and lower pension contributions.","Now I'm going to discuss briefly the various components of our income from continuing operations, starting with revenues. But I'd like to remind you that our 10-Q for the third quarter is on file now with the SEC, and it has a much more detailed analysis of both the revenues and expenses. Overall revenues increased approximately $71 million, with the revenues from our Regulated Businesses increasing approximately $68 million or around 10% from the third quarter of 2011. The increase in revenues was primarily driven by rate increases related to our continued investment in infrastructure and higher customer demand in our Midwest and Eastern states over the prior year.","For the third quarter, the impact of these -- the 2012 impact of these rate increases was approximately $35 million. The increase in revenues associated with higher demand amounted to approximately $18 million for the quarter. In addition, in the third quarter, revenue increases from acquisitions. Primarily our New York acquisition was approximately $12 million. For our market based businesses, revenues for the third quarter of '12 remained relatively flat compared to the same period in '11.","Turning to Slide 11, as you know, our ability to invest in our infrastructure is driven by our ability to earn an appropriate rate of return in our investments. The extent to which requested rate increases will be granted by the applicable regulatory agencies will vary. Slide 11 shows rate increases that have been filed and those that are awaiting final orders, as well as rate cases and infrastructure surcharges that have been recently granted.","Year-to-date, we have been awarded through general rate cases approximately $118 million of annualized rate increase. Additionally, we received another $15 million of annualized rate increases related to infrastructure surcharges. To date, we have filed 2 of the 4 rate cases, which are scheduled to be filed in 2012, Tennessee and Virginia. As Jeff mentioned, Tennessee has been approved. And in Virginia, we are awaiting a final order for the general rate case. A proposed combined settlement of $2.6 million is currently pending approval by the commission.","Also, in July, our California cost of capital application was approved retroactive to January 1, 2012, and provided additional revenues of $4.4 million. And finally, our New Jersey subsidiary submitted a foundational filing for a distribution system improvement charge. The filing was approved on October 23. The benefit from this filing, both for our customers and our shareholders, should begin sometime in 2013.","Turning our attention to water sales volumes. Total company sales increased approximately 8% for the 3-month period ended September 30 from the prior year. This increase in water sales volume was driven, as you can see, by our residential customer class, which is up 9.7%. Both for the current year and year to date, the historic decline we have been experiencing in customer usage was offset by increased usage related to weather, primarily again in our Eastern states and our Midwestern states. Also contributing to the increased volume sold was the additional consumption resulting from our New York acquisition.","The total company operating expenses for 2012 third quarter increased by around $24.7 million or 5.2% from the 2011 third quarter and 2.7% for the last 9 months. For our Regulated Business, O&M expenses increased $11.6 million or by 4% from the 2011 third quarter. However, it should be noted for the year, regulated O&M expenses are relatively flat versus prior year. Overall, we manage our expenses with an eye to total cost, and at times, cost increases in one area -- they will increase in one area, while decreasing in other areas. In fact, year-to-date, regulated expenses versus prior year would have decreased if not for the increase in production and purchased water expenses related to the increase in system delivery, which we've discussed earlier.","We also experienced higher depreciation expense of $7.9 million or 8.9% increase compared to the same period last year due to additional utility plant placement service of over $700 million.","Based on our strong results for the year and attention to cost control, our regulated O&M efficiency ratio continues to improve. For the last 12 months, stripping out the 2012 weather effect, the ratio stands at around 41.5%, a 230 basis point improvement over the year-end 2011 ratio.","Based on that and looking at our outlook for 2012, based on our year-to-date performance, our continued focus on expense control and continuing to receive appropriate returns on our needed investment, as Jeff mentioned, we are reaffirming our 2012 earnings guidance to be in the range of $2.12 to $2.22 per share. This estimate assumes a normal weather pattern for the balance of the year and does not include any impact from Hurricane Sandy.","Based upon our initial review, we do believe the damages from the hurricane are not material to American Water and, therefore, should not have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flow.","Upon completion of the evaluation of the damages and any associated business interruption losses, claims will be submitted to our insurance carriers. We anticipate that expenses, which are not covered by insurance are likely recoverable through the rate-making process on a state-by-state basis.","And with that, I'd like to turn the call back to Jeff for closing comments before opening it up to your questions.","Jeffry E. Sterba","Thanks, Ellen. We always end on Slide 16, which talks about the expectations you can hold us accountable for. I'm not going to go through these in any detail because, frankly, they've either already been achieved, as you know, or significant progress has been made. There are none that I at this time have concern will not be achieved by the end of the year.","So with that, Ellen, Walter Lynch, our Regulated Operations head and myself will be happy to stand for any questions you might have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Kevin Cole with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Kevin Cole - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So I guess, first, with, like, starting with trying to get to a clean 2012. And so we need to adjust the guidance for $0.13 to $0.16 for weather. And is there any other nonrecurring items that we should put into our numbers when we think about the 2013 growth?","Ellen C. Wolf","I would say at this point in time, the only thing really is weather, which is driving the high results for 2012. And yes, when you look at '13, you need to normalize for weather. And I put the word \"normal\" in quotes.","Jeffry E. Sterba","Yes. And that's why we gave you the information on the $0.13 to $0.16.","Kevin Cole - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, there's nothing on the O&M side or anything else that we need to adjust?","Jeffry E. Sterba","No.","Ellen C. Wolf","No.","Kevin Cole - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. Then when do you expect to give 2013 guidance?","Jeffry E. Sterba","Well, we've given it in -- well, last year, we gave it in mid-February, and we'll probably do it in the same time. Although I must say that Ellen has a different theory about when we should give guidance. Ellen, would you care to?","Ellen C. Wolf","All right. You really are going to have me do this?","Jeffry E. Sterba","Yes.","Ellen C. Wolf","All right, so the -- I can't believe -- the theory is that the Mayan calender has the destruction of the Earth in 2012, so at this point, we're not sure we need '13 guidance.","Jeffry E. Sterba","We do have some concern about Ellen believing in the Mayan calendar and hopefully, none of us are going to be the sacrificial lamb as in Mayan culture, but -- sorry, we just had to laugh.","Kevin Cole - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And Jeff, I guess given that you spend a lot of time on policy in Washington. I guess under the Obama administration, do you expect any water rules to be expedited or further -- I guess, further tightened over the next 4 years?","Jeffry E. Sterba","I think there clearly will be -- I think, and it really is not administrative-dependent, there's going to be a continued focus on water. And I think Rule 316(b) on the power plant side, which has a direct impact on water, is still outstanding. It won't come out in a ruling until next year. There is going to be again a focus on infrastructure and the need for infrastructure. There was a great article in Bloomberg just yesterday of the fact that I think that if you didn't see it, that raises this issue again. And the reality is it can't be done by the federal budget. So the more that I talk to folks up there, the more that it seems to be well understood. They've got to do something on infrastructure, and it can't be done by the federal government. So other than that, I honestly, or one good thing that is going to come out, and in fact, it already has come out, is that the EPA is finally, going to allow water utilities to give their -- the quality notices that we have to literally send to every customer, they're going to allow us to do that electronically. And in one sense that's small, and in another sense it's big. It's recognizing that this just isn't a bureaucratic process. It's about giving customers information. I don't think you're going to see major impacts on addition of new contaminants. There's a fair amount of work already being done on the emerging contaminants.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Michael Roomberg with Ladenburg Thalmann.","Michael G. Roomberg - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division","Jeff, I just want to start off. I was particularly interested in your comments on Tennessee. Can you just kind of give us an update or an overview of what the -- I guess the competitive landscape is there? Who are the purveyors of water services in the state? Just I guess in the hopes of getting a better understanding of the long-term opportunity for you guys there.","Jeffry E. Sterba","Yes, the private water supplier is really us. All the rest of both water and wastewater is really done by municipalities, some of which are really starting to struggle, or they're subdivisions of the state, some of which we've got interconnections with and good relations with. Walter, what would you add?","Walter J. Lynch","Absolutely, Jeff that's it. We're largest by far. There's some smaller providers there, but we're the big player within Tennessee. And we do have a lot of interconnections, and we're looking to expand in that area.","Michael G. Roomberg - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division","Got it. Got it, okay. Just kind of some detail on the quarter, if I could. The volume was up and that was encouraging. I'm aware that mostly residential consumers are the most susceptible or kind of affected by weather. But we were encouraged to see that your commercial, your public and your industrial consumption were all up as well for the second consecutive quarter. I'm just wondering if you can kind of drill down into the factors that drive demand amongst those consumers and whether we can kind of chalk that up to weather as well or perhaps some type of some other dynamic, like economy or otherwise?","Jeffry E. Sterba","There's really 2 pieces: one is customer growth and the other is consumption per customer. But frankly, we are seeing an uptick in customer growth, particularly in our commercial area, which is something we really haven't seen for the last 3 years or so. But this year, commercial customer growth has moved up well over 1%, and residential customer growth is also up. So that's a positive sign. Ellen, on the use per customer side?","Ellen C. Wolf","Yes. Again, on the use per customer, that continues to decline, although this time it's been offset by...","Jeffry E. Sterba","Residential customer.","Ellen C. Wolf","Residential offset. On the commercial, industrial and public, most of that, other than customer growth, they're use per customer in those 3 areas of the state is fairly flat. So this is somewhat weather-dependent.","Jeffry E. Sterba","And about 48% of our sales is commercial, industrial and public, other.","Ellen C. Wolf","Yes, other. 56% or so is from residential.","Michael G. Roomberg - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division","Got it. That's very helpful color. Last question, on the XTO contract and kind of just your overall strategy in the shale plays. My understanding is that's part of your Regulated Business, is that correct?","Walter J. Lynch","That's correct.","Unknown Analyst","Okay. And is that part of your rate base then? Or is it customer advances? How do you kind of account for that?","Jeffry E. Sterba","Well, it ends up going into rate base, but customer advances, obviously, is applied against that or is a net to that. But yes, it goes through the regulatory process. And that's why under those transactions, frankly, we really aren't taking volumetric risk. As we add those customers or add those points of interconnection, the costs roll in, they're paying retail price for water. And as I told you all before, that doesn't mean we won't do things off on the unregulated side to serve those customers. But we think we really get a double bang when we can do it under this kind of a structure because we get the long-term benefit of residential growth as well as overall economic development. I mean, that's what going to a position us to serve a big area that's growing in parts of the -- particularly Southwest Pennsylvania, that we'll see long-term economic growth and in the areas that we currently don't serve. So with each of these, Michael, what we effectively do is we then -- we are -- we go into the commission with a -- to get a certificate of territory expansion. And that's the other hidden amount -- I won't call it hidden -- but that's the other locking-up our long-term value that we develop.","Ellen C. Wolf","So the thing to know, Michael, is that the pipe has 2 purposes: it supplies water to the drillers, but it also is supplying water to residents and customers that are there for the long term.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Can you refresh us on where you are with the DSIC","Mechanism in New Jersey? What's left from a regulatory perspective? And when should we assume those impacts?","Jeffry E. Sterba","Walt?","Walter J. Lynch","We filed the foundational filing back in July, and we had it approved on October 23. So it took roughly the 90 days that we anticipated. And right now, we're investing for that foundational filing. And as Ellen said, we're going to be recognizing the benefits of those sometime in '13.","Jeffry E. Sterba","And Neil, we've said that probably there's -- about roughly how much additional investment that will be made in this next year?","Walter J. Lynch","In the filing -- yes, in the filing, we had a 3-year period of about $220 million.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. That is helpful. And then some more modeling-specific question. How do you think about long-term tax rate? You've been tracking around 40%. Is that the right number? And when is the earliest you would be paying cash taxes here?","Ellen C. Wolf","Right now, we've looked at our effective rate of around 40%. Probably we've ranged historically between 38% and 41% or 42%. Right now, we have NOL of around $1 billion and we look at that lasting anywhere out 8 to 10 years.","Jeffry E. Sterba","The only thing I'd add on that, Neil, is who knows what gets done in the next set of years? But one of the areas where there is an agreement between the parties is on corporate tax reduction, rate reduction. And that would extend out the 8 to 10 years.","Ellen C. Wolf","Right. That's correct.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then finally, on pension here, how should we think about the drag of pension post-2012, both from a cash perspective and then also from an income statement perspective?","Ellen C. Wolf","A couple of things have happened. As you know, the  [indiscernible] rules are changing as it relates to calculating that liability and, therefore, will have an impact on that cash flow for us beginning in '13. So we are taking a look at that. If you could predict the market for the next 2 months, I might be able to answer that question with a little more certainty. It was doing fine for a while, but we really don't know what's going to happen in the last 2 months. And we do assume these cap rates will continue to decline.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Tim Winter with Gabelli & Company.","Timothy M. Winter - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","A really good quarter. Ellen, I didn't really understand the comment about 2013 guidance. Do you plan on giving guidance at some point for 2013?","Ellen C. Wolf","Yes. Sorry, Tim. We will be giving guidance in probably at the same -- in February as we've done historically.","Timothy M. Winter - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","Okay, great. And then I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about your military base business, the nonregulated part. If you could give us -- is that business currently profitable? Do you see opportunities? Or where are you there?","Jeffry E. Sterba","Yes, that business is profitable. It's a very disciplined business that, frankly, creates some ideas that we are transplanting over into our Regulated Operations. There has been a slowdown in the issuance of RFPs over the last couple of years for base privatization, and we are seeing that dramatically turn. The number of notifications for potential privatization has increased. There are bids outstanding at this stage, but remember these are fairly long processes. They take 16, 18, 24 months from the time that the RFP has left until the time that an award is made. One of the things that slowed that business down was that in the law, the original law, there had been a provision that basically said there had to be a 10% savings to the federal government. The problem is it's 10% from what? And so the way it had been developed was it was 10% from what they were spending. Well, they weren't doing -- they weren't spending appropriately and so that was not a good baseline. We got that law changed in December of last year, and that's what has helped now move forward a new round of RFPs. So we're very bullish on that business. It will be a growth piece for us. There are -- we're the largest provider at this stage, with 10 bases. But there's, obviously others that are in this space and it's -- which is a good thing. It keeps us all on our toes.","Timothy M. Winter - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","Jeff, just one final question on that. Those 10 bases, do you participate in, like, construction of projects there that...","Jeffry E. Sterba","Oh, yes. Oh, yes. And what you typically see is that when a base comes online and is awarded, you have a pretty big chunk of catch-up because of the things that just haven't done and they need to be done and so you end up with capital dollars. So we operate the facilities, but we also manage all of the construction that's done. And so you end up with annual awards for the construction as well as the operation and maintenance. The amount of construction will vary year-to-year based on budgets and based on where those bases stand. And again, the biggest amount of construction that you'll see will be in the first 3 to 5 years of the contract because that's when you're playing catch-up, and then you're going into a more steady state construction environment.","Timothy M. Winter - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","Okay. And then did we have -- I don't know. This will be my last question. Did we have an earning and bottom line impact from that business for either the 3 or 9-month period?","Jeffry E. Sterba","Well, it's included in our earnings from the market based businesses. We don't break them out separately between the businesses because, quite frankly, they're fairly small across-the-board. They add up to a reasonable impact, but we don't give the individual business line detail.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Gerry Sweeney with Boenning & Scattergood.","Gerard J. Sweeney - Boenning and Scattergood, Inc., Research Division","A quick question on the rate cases that are pending and you expect to file. I know you can't necessarily go on the specifics on states. But just taking a look at the number of pending rate cases, probably the smallest we've seen in several years from American Water, any type of thoughts on how many rate cases you plan to file in 2013? Or is it going to be -- are you shifting more towards some of DSIC mechanism so we can see -- may see a little bit more of a lag between rate cases in certain states? Any type of granularity on that would be great.","Jeffry E. Sterba","Yes, Gerry, let me make a few comments, and Ellen or Walter may add something. Remember that one of our big focuses has been to move to single-tariff pricing. And so as we have had success -- and really what that means is that as we used to have to file individual cases for certain territories and states. As we move to single-tariff pricing, that has collapsed those into one filing per state. So that reduces the number of cases that may actually be filed. The second thing is the DSIC mechanisms, which is the major focus because, obviously, it reduces regulatory lagging, et cetera. So you're seeing more focus on those kinds of mechanisms -- this type of mechanisms. And then rate cases, they may need to be less frequent, a little more time in between.","Ellen C. Wolf","Yes. Let me -- to further Jeff's point, in California, for example, we now do one rate filing, where historically we would do about 3 a year. Now we do 1 every 3 years. In addition, on the infrastructure surcharge, the power of that can be seen in particular this quarter, where year-to-date we've had 118 in general rate case awards, but $15 million more in DSIC. So probably about 12% or 13% of our rate increases are now coming through this DSIC mechanism.","Gerard J. Sweeney - Boenning and Scattergood, Inc., Research Division","Okay. That's generally what I thought. Then one other quick question, on the New York Service Line Protection Program. I apologize. I'm not sure how much granularity you have on the Q. I didn't get a chance to get into it. But I think there are 600,000 customers that -- or potential customers, I should say. How big of a market is this compared to the rest of the service line protection that you're currently involved with?","Jeffry E. Sterba","Well, we look at it as it's basically another New Jersey. Because in New Jersey, we have service line protection on the bill. It's about the same number of customers or territory, if you will, and fairly similar characteristics. And New Jersey is one of our very attractive markets for service line protection. We've got a lot of customers that take multiple services, water, sewer, indoor plumbing. And we're also rolling out electric and water.","Gerard J. Sweeney - Boenning and Scattergood, Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then finally, one last question, in terms of Sandy. North New Jersey and I think Long Island, probably 2 hardest hit areas. Obviously, I haven't necessarily seen it. You only see it on the news. But I'm not sure how much damage there was to maybe some of your operating areas. Any potential for the long-term damage that may reduce consumption in the 2013? Or any thoughts on that or is that just still way too early?","Walter J. Lynch","Walter. We're not seeing any long-term issues there with the supply to our customers. And as Jeff said in his prepared comments, our employees did a tremendous job moving generators around to make sure that we continue with our service. But we don't see any impact really long-term in any water supply issue.","Jeffry E. Sterba","The one area Walter, may be like the barrier island, but that's such a small.","Ellen C. Wolf","Yes, on the barrier island, we do believe we may have lost a few customers. Their homes were probably wiped out, but that's a very, very small percentage of our total customer base.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of David Paz with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","David A. Paz - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just a question actually just to follow up on the previous question regarding rate cases. Should we kind of think about the incremental revenue in '13 being effectively from what you were awarded in '12 and of course, the DSICs?","Jeffry E. Sterba","Well, remember, first, we'll go into detail when we're going to give guidance in February. We've got rate cases. As we've said, there'll be 2 more filed this year, and there will be some rate case activity next year, but most of them take a bit of time to get processed. So I think as you look at that, you can kind of time out. Because any case that's going to be filed in April or May next year, is not -- you're going to have minimal, if any, impact on 2013.","Ellen C. Wolf","And also to remind you, we will continue to do the DSIC filing, which we will have in Pennsylvania, Missouri and other states. As well as for the first time, we will have that filing in New Jersey.","David A. Paz - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And speaking of the DSICs, how it relates to CapEx, I think in your -- maybe in your release, you said for '12, you expect $925 million of CapEx. But in '13 still your typical $800 million to $1 billion range, is that correct?","Ellen C. Wolf","That's correct, and we'll give more guidance on that number when we do our guidance for 2013. But it will be within that range.","David A. Paz - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","It will be in that range. Okay. Oh, and the last question, just on sales. I apologize if you gave this earlier, but do you have a sense of how weather-adjusted sales were on a percentage basis, excluding the New York acquisition, so if we were just looking year-over-year, particularly residential?","Ellen C. Wolf","Yes, the New York acquisition would not have impacted that by quite a bit. New York, as a whole, is in that other category, when you look at somewhere below probably 3% or even less of our revenue as a company.","Jeffry E. Sterba","And that's all of New York.","Ellen C. Wolf","That's all of New York.","David A. Paz - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. So then weather-adjusted sales in the residential?","Ellen C. Wolf","It's not that much. It wouldn't impact that percentage increase by very much at all.","David A. Paz - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. But I'm sorry. So what is the actual percentage increase weather-adjusted at residential level?","Ellen C. Wolf","We talk about it on a total. And if you'll remember what we talked about was the impact on EPS, is between $0.13 to $0.16.","David A. Paz - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And so you're -- and in terms of customer usage it's still, excluding weather, you're still about 0.5% and 1.5% annual decrease, is that fair?","Ellen C. Wolf","Yes, it varies by state. But that's the correct. That's an average.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Heike Doerr with Robert W. Baird.","Heike M. Doerr - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I wanted to go back to this topic of regulation. Jeff, when you first joined American Water, you had talked about on a more macro level changing kind of the fundamental structure. I wonder if you could give us an update on how you see the receptiveness of commissions regarding some of these mechanisms like addressing declining consumption. And as you a look out into 2013, '14, are there states that you have targeted to expand, things like DSIC?","Jeffry E. Sterba","Well, I think, by and large, there has been receptivity, and it's the different kinds of things. I mean, we've filed in virtually every proceeding, and in some cases, it shouldn't be in a rate case it needs to be in a different type of proceeding to address declining use. Or to address mechanisms to encourage the investment of capital without a regulatory lag so that we can do the things that's needed on the infrastructure side. So I think, by and large, they're always -- there's hesitancy about doing something that they haven't done before, even if it's being done somewhere else. We are seeing improvement in people thinking about future test years. We had legislation passed, so that's facilitated in Pennsylvania. We have good success in that in Illinois. So I -- it's never what you want it to be, Heike, but it's I think most commissions are moving in the right direction. Let me put it that way. And are there certain jurisdictions that we have targeted for different things? Yes. That's something that we talked to the commissioners about first, but that's -- we certainly have a plan about the next set things that we want to get done.","Heike M. Doerr - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And is there any way for you to quantify for us what kind of opportunity exists in the Marcellus for additional projects like the one you announced this quarter?","Jeffry E. Sterba","What gas price? I mean, that's the problem.","Heike M. Doerr - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","It can't hurt to ask, right?","Jeffry E. Sterba","Yes. Right. I wish that we knew the answer. I mean, what we're pleased about is that we have not one but multiple drillers that are interested in working with us on the kind of approaches that we -- these regionalization approaches, as well as ongoing discussions on more directed specific kinds of projects that will either be associated with cleanup of produced water or on the provision of significant water for drilling. But it's a very difficult one to predict.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question is a follow-up from Michael Roomberg.","Michael G. Roomberg - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to touch on the Allentown contract. You guys were recently approved as bidders, and I think that they've gone ahead and are allowing bids to be submitted. I'm just wondering, first of all, when the kind of timeline that you expect this to play out. Obviously, it's not exactly clear, I'm sure even for you. And then secondly, I just wanted to kind of pick your thoughts a bit about what will be the key criteria that you think the city will be looking at and how you are competitively positioned to win that bid.","Jeffry E. Sterba","Well, frankly, those are great questions, Michael, for you to ask them. It's the schedule -- they have a -- there's a form of contract, but they haven't issued the RFP beyond the qualification stage. So until you get that, it's a little difficult to understand the schedule. I think in their eyes, it's a value question. It's what are they're going to get as cash upfront for the system for someone to operate those systems? We see some opportunity to improve operations in those systems, but they're not terrible systems. They've done a reasonable job. They've got a capital constraint. So I think prices, as you would expect, is going to be a significant issue. But that's about all I can say at this stage as we're still working through our strategy, and part of it is depending on what the criteria are that are in the RFP.","Michael G. Roomberg - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division","Right. I mean, just not to belabor, I mean, but do you think that other criteria, being a public company or having a certain credit quality or capitalization structure or even just your local regulated footprint, will kind of be a factor?","Jeffry E. Sterba","I have no doubt that other criteria will be taken into account. I don't think that -- these decisions are -- they are multi-faceted because it's a long-term decision. How they will weigh those factors, we can't really judge or comment on because it's they're waiting. But I do believe that they will be cognizant of the other factors.","Walter J. Lynch","And we're great guys.","Michael G. Roomberg - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division","Right, right. okay. From a bigger picture perspective, does this represent a potential model, if you will, of course, if it's successful to kind of realize the long elusive dream of the water utility industry to kind of grow the privatized footprint?","Jeffry E. Sterba","Well, Michael, it is a model. It is one of a couple that we are seeing more frequently in the market. And I really think that we're going to see some diversity in the models that can be applied to the municipal side. This is one that we do believe in. We think it's got some power. I think there's been some challenges, for example, the city originally felt that the state was going to regulate price. They've now been advised by the General Counsel that the state will not do that because the ownership of the system is still with the city. So I think that changes a little bit of the emphasis about who will play and who's got what, just because of the business strategies. So it will vary by state to state. But I think it clearly is a model that will have some legs.","Operator","And I'm showing no further questions. I'll turn the call back to Mr. Sterba for closing remarks.","Jeffry E. Sterba","Well, I just thank you all again for joining us, and I know you joined us in thoughts and concerns for the folks affected by the hurricane. And we look forward to seeing you. If we don't see you before Thanksgiving, have a great holiday.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our conference for today. We thank you for your participation.

Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us for today's call. As Gary said, my name is Greg Panagos, and I'm the new Vice President of Investor Relations for American Water. Before I read you our forward-looking statements, I would just like to say I'm happy to be here and excited about the opportunity with American Water. Before I read you our forward-looking statement I'd like to say I'm happy to be here and excited about the opportunity with American Water.","While I haven't had the chance to meet most of you yet, I look forward to working with all of you. We'll keep the call to about an hour and at the end of our prepared remarks, we'll open it up for your questions. Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that during the course of this conference call, both in our prepared remarks and in answer to your questions, we may make statements related to future performance.","Our statements represent our most reasonable estimates. However, since these statements deal with future events, they are subject to numerous risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause the actual performance of American Water to be materially different from the performance indicated or implied by such statements. Such risk factors are set forth in the Company's SEC filings.","I encourage you to read our 10-Q on file with the SEC for a more details analysis of our financials. Also reconciliation tables for non-GAAP financial information discussed on this conference call can be found in the appendix of the slide deck located at the Investor Relations page of the Company Web site.","We'll be happy to answer any questions or provide further clarification if needed during our question and answer session. All statements in this call related to earnings per share refer to diluted earnings per share from continuing operations. And now I would like to turn the call over to American Waters President and CEO Susan Story.","Susan Story","Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us. With me today are Linda Sullivan, our CFO, who will go over the second quarter financial results and Walter Lynch, our COO and President of Regulated Operations, who will give us key updates on our regulated business. I would also like to officially welcome Greg Panagos to our team as Vice President of Investor Relations. Greg has more than 20 years of corporate finance and investor relations experience, including several years in the energy industry. He has served in a number of senior investor relations and communication roles including Barrick Gold Corporation, Transocean, Nobel Energy, and Pennzoil.","His knowledge and experience are a great fit for American Water and we're happy to have him join our team. And now for the quarter, once again, our employees delivered solid operational and financial results. We continue to execute our strategies through ongoing investment into our infrastructure, a sharp focus on operational efficiency, and growth in our regulated and market-based customers.","Turning to Slide 5, we reported earnings per share of $0.68 for the second quarter. Excluding the impact from the Freedom Industries chemical spill in 2014, this is about an 8% increase compared to second quarter 2014 and a 9% increase year-to-date through June. Based on our performance through the second quarter and also including our known July weather impacts, which Walter and Linda will discuss shortly, we are reaffirming our 2015 earnings guidance to be in the range of $2.55 to $2.65 per share.","On Slide 6, you see that we continue to deliver on our strategies in both regulated and market-based segments for the quarter and year-to-date. The capital investments we make in our regulated segment continue to be the foundation of our consistent growth. So far in 2015, we've made about $474 million in infrastructure investments to ensure safe, clean and reliable water services for our customers.","We plan to invest 1.2 billion to 1.3 billion in capital in 2015, with over a billion dollars of that to improve our water and waste water systems. About $200 million is allocated to regulated acquisitions and strategic investments. Through the second quarter, we invested $41 million in acquisitions, which does not include the Keystone Clear Water acquisition, which closed on July 9th. This is our last quarterly call. We\u2019ve completed the purchase of water and wastewater systems in Haddonfield, New Jersey and Mishawaka, Indiana and in both Arnold and Redfield, Missouri officially adding 19,000 customers to our regulated segments.","We also have 17 pending acquisitions which ones approved and closed will give us the opportunity to serve an additional 14,000 customers in several of our states. The largest of these acquisitions is the environmental disposal corporation, which serve 5,300 wastewater customers in Northern New Jersey. This acquisition is a great example of executing on our long-term strategy to focus on wastewater acquisition in areas where we already serve water. Our marketing base segment had a strong second quarter. ","Homeowner Services entered into an exclusive contract with the City of Rialto, California to offer service line protection programs to home owners. We\u2019re also recently notified by Wilmington, Delaware of its intent to award an exclusive contract to offer our programs to its residential customers pending city council approval. If approved we expect both of these programs to launch by year end. ","As you know our long-term growth triangle includes a market based share component which we have shown could contribute from 0% to 2% of our long-term earnings growth. This is our last call we announced and closed on the acquisition of Keystone Clearwater Solution.","Keystone is a water services provider to oil and gas companies in Appalachian Basin which includes the Marcellus and the Utica. Keystone\u2019s leadership which we have left intact has over 30 years of experience in addressing water solutions for Appalachia\u2019s oil and gas market. The tam of 350 employees has a strong reputation for meeting their customers need with a priority on safety and protecting the environment. These values are consistent with American Water\u2019s value and they matter deeply to us and critically important. ","Keystone\u2019s offering are aligned with America Water\u2019s core competencies supplying, transmitting, pumping and storing water and developing the infrastructure that goes along with those services. Despite this fact that keeps on a relatively small part of our overall business portfolio we know it faces somewhat different risk than American Water\u2019s traditional lines of business. ","As a result we set up legal structure to Keystone. For example we\u2019ve established it under a holding company separate from our existing regulated segment and separate from our market based American Water Enterprises entity. As a reminder American Water Enterprises is the subsidiary that includes our military contract and homeowner services lines of businesses.","We expect the shale market will continue to grow for many years given the critical role it plays in energy security and economic prosperity of the U.S.","In addition we believe Keystone\u2019s turnkey business model is repeatable in other areas of this industry creating opportunities for expansion in this sector. It\u2019s important to note that over the past few years our non-regulated segment has averaged around 11% of our revenues and 9% of our earnings. We are not going to fundamentally change the risk profile of the company going forward and our long-term plan is that our non-regulated segment in total will not contribute more than 15% to 20% of earnings over the next five years.","Additionally the upper part of that range will occur only if the meaningful part of the earnings is lower risk regulated like such as our military services business. ","Looking forward we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our long-term earnings per share growth of 7% to 10% through 2019 anchored from our 2013 earnings. Walter will now give an update on our regulated segment.","Walter Lynch","Thanks Susan. Good morning everyone. As Susan mentioned our regulated business has delivered positive results year-to-date and I\u2019m especially proud of our progress on our efficiency ratio which I\u2019ll talk about in a moment.","Let me start by providing you with an update on California on Slide 8. California continues to experience the worst drive in the last 100 years. Based on an overall 25% state mandated reduction our California American Water customers have been asked to reduce water usage anywhere from 8% to 32% depending on their level of water use in 2013. ","One of our districts are exceeding those reduction goals. California American Water has launched ambitious conversation outreach programs to reduce water use. This includes mail, radio and social media and door to door efforts on programs such as Turf Rebate, replacement rebate, freely detection devices and water wide surveys.","Our conversation stat is active at community events reaching after customers and equipping them with the tool they need to conserve water. As a reminder California American Water has rate decoupling so we do sale volumes do no result in reduced earnings. The other move in California is our water revenue adjustment mechanism or rent filing. As of June 30th we had an under collected rent receivable balance of about $50 million of which almost $45 million related to Monterey district. In order to assist with the impact on our customer bills in that area and to limited future accumulations we files the application with the California Public Utility Commission requesting recovery of the existing Monterey balance along with a return over a 20-year collection period.","We also requested that the WRAM account be trued up annually going forward. We expect a decision on the Monterey WRAM Filing in mid to late 2016. As reminder, California American Water is approximately 8% of our total regulated revenue; however, we put a tremendous amount of focus there because issues the state faces offer us an opportunity to fully deploy our numerous water supply and service solution.","Many of these, such as our AMI Customer Alert Pilot in Monterey, could apply in many other states where we operate. On July 31st Missouri American Water filed a request with the Missouri Public Service Commission for a general increase of about $51 million. This request includes about $25 million of new revenue and about $26 million of infrastructure surcharge revenue, known as ISRS in Missouri, which gets rolled into base rates at the end of the case.","Consistent with our growth strategy, the filing includes $436 million in new infrastructure investments since 2012 to ensure reliable service to our customers. The Company's last filing was more than four years ago, and since then the Company reduced its operations and maintenance expense by about $7 million, which means we're able to invest over $40 million of capital with no impact on customer bills. We estimate that for every $1 of own and expense reduction allows a capital investment of about $6 with no impact on customer bills.","I commend our team in Missouri for their disciplined approach to managing costs. The reprocess in Missouri takes approximately 11 months to complete, so we anticipate a decision in the second quarter of 2016. Lastly, in the second quarter we saw wet weather in the Midwest that was offset by dry weather in the northeast. However, we have seen above normal rainfall through much of our footprint in July, which resulted in modestly lower sales.","Linda will talk about the known financial impact of this in a moment. Moving to Slide 9, we continue to make steady progress towards achieving our O&M efficiency ratio stretch goal of 34% or less by 2020. We achieved 35.9% for the last 12 months ended June 2015, which is a result of a disciplined approach to cost management by our employees.","These efforts, of course, are driven by our focus on the customer and our commitment to clean, safe reliable and affordable water services. This is fundamental to our business. When we achieve smart O&M reductions, we can invest in our water and waste water systems, while mitigation the impact on our customer's bills. Now, I'll turn the call over to Linda for more detail on our second quarter financial results.","Linda Solomon","Thank you, Walter, and good morning everyone. In the second quarter we continue to deliver strong financial results. As shown on Slide 11, revenues were up almost 4% quarter-over-quarter and up 3% year-to-date. We reported earnings per share for the second quarter of $0.68, up about 8% over adjusted earnings for the same period last year. Year-to-date earnings were $1.13 per share, up about 9% over adjusted earnings in the same period last year.","On the right side of the page, we show each business segment contribution to 2015 earnings per share. For the quarter, the regulated segment contributed earnings of $0.68 per share or an increase of about 6%. Our market-based segment contributed $0.06 per share in the second quarter, an increase of about 20%. Parent interest in other, which is primarily interest expense on parent debt, was a negative $0.06 per share for the quarter flat to the prior year.","Now, I'll go over the different components of our second quarter adjusted earnings per share growth on Slide 12. 2014 adjusted earnings were $0.63 per share. The second quarter of 2015 came in $0.05 above 2014 adjusted earnings at $0.68 per share. Reflecting increases in both our regulated and market-based segments.","Our regulated segment benefited from both increased revenues and lower cost of $0.03 each. The higher regulated revenue was primarily from authorized rate increases and higher infrastructure charges. The lower operating and maintenance expense was mostly due to three factors.","First, lower transportation expense as a result of lower fuel prices and leased vehicle costs. Second, lower uncollectible expense as we continue to bring collections back toward historical levels after implementation of our customer information system. And third, savings in employee related costs from lower wages, salaries and severance expense.","For the market-based segment, earnings per share was up $0.01 due to additional construction projects under our military contracts and the addition of two new military bases in the second half of 2014. We also had contract growth and geographic expansion in our homeowner services business.","Partially offsetting these improvements were higher depreciation, taxes and other costs of about $0.02 per share, mainly from growth associated with our capital investment programs at the regulated segment. In the appendix of this slide deck we have included our revenue and expense bridge slides to provide more detail to the variances I just discussed.","Now let me cover regulatory highlights on Slide 13. We have three ongoing general rate cases in New Jersey, West Virginia and Missouri for a combined annualized rate request of $127 million. As Walter mentioned, these rate cases continue to reflect our disciplined approach to investing. For rates effective since July 1 of last year through today, we received a total of $55 million in additional annualized revenues from general rate cases, step increases and infrastructure charges.","These are the highlights of these cases, and we encourage you review the footnotes in the appendix for more information. Slide 14 is a summary dashboard of our financial performance, which showed improvement across the board. During the second quarter of 2015, we made total investments of $348 million, primarily to improve infrastructure in our regulated segment and for regulated acquisitions.","As Susan mentioned earlier, we expect to invest $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion for the full year of 2015. For the quarter, our cash flow from operations increased approximately $14 million, primarily from earnings growth. Our adjusted return on equity increased by approximately 40 basis points over the past 12 months compared to the prior year.","We also paid a $0.34 quarterly cash dividend to our shareholders in June which represented about a 10% increase compared to last year, and on July 24, the board of directors approved a $0.34 per share dividend payable in September. As Walter mentioned in his comments related to the California Water Revenue Adjustment Mechanism or WRAM, we requested recovery of the Monterey WRAM balance over a 20-year period along with a return.","Based on long-standing precedent in California, we expect to collect the entire WRAM balance; however, due to extending the recovery period, we will recognize a immaterial non-cash, timing-related adjustment to earnings in the third quarter. This adjustment has been factored into our reaffirmed 2015 earnings guidance. ","We have now closed the Keystone acquisition for a purchase price of about nine times the trailing 12 months EBITDA. Under our purchase agreement, we will have small purchase price adjustments for changes in working capital, capital investments, and the results of operations through the July 9th closing date. Once we record the acquisition in the third quarter, we will provide additional details. For segment reporting purposes, we will include the operating results of Keystone as part of our market-based business segment. The market-based segment will be comprised of American Water Enterprises and Keystone Clear Water Solutions. Keystone, as Susan noted, is a legally separate entity.","Keystone has about 20 EMP and other large corporate customers in the Appalachian region. Today its business is relatively asset light. Its costs are largely variable, and we believe it will be able to capture synergies with American Water. We expect the acquisition to be earnings neutral in 2015 and accretive to earnings per share in 2016. We will provide you additional detail on Keystone during our Analyst Day presentation on December 15th.","And, lastly, we mentioned earlier we experienced wet weather in July, which for the month is estimated to unfavourably impact net income by about $4 million. We will be updating you further on the third quarter earnings call. Building on our solid financial performance year-to-date and despite the wet weather in July, we are reaffirming our 2015 earnings guidance to be in the range of $2.55 to $2.65 per share, and with that I'll turn it back over to Susan.","Susan Story","Thanks, Linda. Before taking your questions, I would like to take just a couple of minutes to highlight American Water's sustainability leadership. Our Company treats and delivers over a billion gallons of water a day to our customers, and this is just a start of our environmental focus.","We have some of the best people in the water industry, and they choose to work here because environmental leadership is a core value at American Water. When you marry great minds with a passion for innovation and sustainability, you can accomplish some pretty exciting results. Let me give you just a couple of examples.","Reclaiming and reusing water is an imperative in the face of water supply and infrastructure challenges for future generations. And this isn't just a California issue as some believe. In fact, 40 of 50 state water managers say they expect water shortages in some portion of their state in the next ten years.","It will take bold strategies including public\/private partnerships to address these challenges. This year Illinois American Water was selected by the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of greater Chicago, or MWRD, to partner on a beneficial water reuse project. The agency is partnering with us to reclaim, treat and distribute waste water to large water users like manufacturing plants.","Through this partnership, Illinois American will build the distribution infrastructure, very many the customer base, buy water from MWRD and resell the water. Once fully operational, this water reuse project will significantly reduce fresh water withdrawals from the Great Lakes. This project has already been recognized by the American Society of Civil Engineers as a game changer in its recent report regarding innovative infrastructure solutions.","Let me giving you one other example where we're using water in smarter ways. Geothermal heat pump technology is not new, but an innovative American Water R&D pilot could transform traditional geothermal HVAC systems and introduce a new application in renewable energy. American Water is piloting a geothermal innovation to heat and cool a 40,000-square-foot school on Long Island, New York.","Our pilot geothermal system transfers ground temperature from a water main using a heat exchanger, allowing the same system to cool during the summer and heat during the winter. Once unable to have community events or classes during the summer months due to lack of air conditioning, this school has been fully utilized this year with a geothermal installation. This pilot project was actually highlighted at the NARUC Conference in New York City just last month.","These exams are just two of our numerous sustainability efforts. We're proud to note that we have already reduced our greenhouse gas emission by 17% since 2007, exceeding our initial target of 16% reduction by 2017, a full two years early. Additionally, our water pump efficiency efforts to date are expected to produce energy savings of 12 million kilowatt hours per year.","These are just some of the reasons that American Water was ranked No. 24 of the almost 500 companies listed in Newsweek Magazine's top green companies for 2015, one of only two utilities in the top 25 and the only water utility. We are proud of this recognition because we believe being green is not just good for the environment; it's also good for the bottom line. We believe our company cannot only do well, but we can also do good and with that, we're happy to take any questions you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from the Daniel Eggers with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Daniel Eggers","Susan, you kind of talked about Keystone. Obviously, it's an interesting opportunity but the trailing earnings contribution that you guys showed when you bought it wasn't particularly all that large. Is that number of earnings contribution, has that changed since '14 in some appreciable way? And then you kind of look out over forward, what's going to drive that business, you know, with or without an improvement in drilling activity in the region?","Susan Story","We are going on December the 15th, at our Analyst Day, we're going to be providing a deeper look forward in all parts of our growth triangle include Keystone and the shale area.","Daniel Eggers","Is that Southern for you're not going to answer the question?","Susan Story","Yes, it is.","Daniel Eggers","On the growth triangle, you guys said that -- you said non-reg is not going to be more than 15% to 20% of contribution from roughly 10ish % today. Is it that the correct messaging?","Susan Story","That's correct. Currently, over the past three years, our earnings from the market-based business has been around 9%. So that puts it in context. In the past, Dan, we've talked mainly from revenue numbers, so we've actually added more transparency in talking about earnings from that segment as opposed to just revenues.","Daniel Eggers","Okay. I guess we didn't really get into what all is going on with the core of that business these days, but just can you give an update on government contracting and the home businesses and kind of where you're seeing the opportunities right now or where the action's been this year so far?","Susan Story","Sure. You know, one thing because we won the two military bases last year, we're starting to see the revenues as well as some of the working capital we're putting into some of the projects on those bases. There are currently several outstanding RFPs, you know, as we've mentioned before, when they will be awarded is, you know, we never can predict with a tremendous amount of accuracy.","There's a chance maybe one could be awarded this year, maybe two to three next year that we're involved with. But what's important on military, and I think it's important and you asked that in your question, on military, it's not just the new bases but the continuing projects that are on the existing bases beyond just O & M contract that we have -- the money we get paid each year for running the water and waste water systems.","So I will tell you that we currently have on the books I believe another $200 million of backlog of existing projects to do on the bases that we already have. So for military services, we continue to ensure that we're providing the best water and waste water services for those military men and women who serve our country.","On the homeowner services, as we said, you know, we had mentioned about Orlando. We have launched it this year, so we're starting to get customers signing up in Orlando. Orlando also presents for us the first place that we have a much deeper service offering beyond just water and sewer line but also HVAC and in-home plumbing.","So that's another opportunity there, and as I mentioned in my comment, we were awarded an exclusive contract that has been signed for Rialto, California, which is about 55,000 potential customers. And then we won the bid for exclusive contract with Wilmington, Delaware, but the City Council still needs to approve that. And we're hoping to launch both of those by the end of the year. So in those two areas, that's what we're seeing from that market-based business.","Daniel Eggers","I guess just one last one too. When you think about moving into these new cities, is there a start-up cost associated with trying to recruit customers and acquisition-wise where you is more expense on the front end as you push into these towns as you get people and it pays off over time, or are you guys amortizing that expense over a longer period?","Susan Story","Dan, we love that you listen to us when you talk to us. Yes. The answer is yes. We have the upfront marketing expenses, and because we have to let people know that we're there and one thing that's important, we put a lot of emphasis on these exclusive partnerships. That's important because in an exclusive partnership, our billing is typically on the city or the municipality or whatever the governmental entity or the entity is that's on their water and\/or waste water bill, so for us that tends to be a higher take rate. And that's why those are so important for us as opposed to just we do have areas where we just generally market and we provide separate billing, but the exclusive contracts are really much more effective for us financially.","Operator","The next question comes from Ryan Connors with Boenning and Scattergood. Please go ahead.","Ryan Connors","A few questions this morning if I might, first, just on the guidance, it seemed like I noticed weather is still a $0.07 plus or minus swing point in the guidance, even here kind of midway through the third quarter I guess, so just wanted to get some color on that. That seemed like it was a little, you know, large in terms of a swing factor there at this point in the year, so I just want to get some flavor on why that's such a large wild card at this point.","Susan Story","Ryan, the chart that we have in there shows the major variabilities as of February 26th, so that's the full year variability. In terms of the impact of weather that we've seen thus far in July it's about $4 million net income. And it's due to wet weather across our system.","Ryan Connors","So it's safe to say that that gap has closed then at this point and we're largely -- that gap has tightened up.","Susan Story","That's right. And this variability chart is the one that we provided to you at the December 15th call.","Ryan Connors","Got it, okay.","Susan Story","One thing as we look at this too, you know, the reason we put multiple items up there is as we establish a range, we understand there's going to be variability. Some of the variability offsets each other. So you don't take each one in isolation, but as you remember, we started in 2013 saying, so why do we have a $0.10 range? Why do we have the range we do? Here are some factors, ups or downs, puts or takes. So it's important to look at all in context [indiscernible].","Ryan Connors","I wanted to talk a little bit just get some color on this WRAM application for the extension there. Now, you mentioned Walter, that the decision there is expected mid to late 2016. It seems like a pretty straightforward, filing and a pretty good deal for the rate payers. So I'm just wondering what the key points of debate are on that filing and where the push back is, if any, on the way that that's structured.","Walter Lynch","Yes. Thanks for the question, Ryan. I think two things. One is the length of time over which we're going to be able to recover it. And the other is the return that we're asking for. It will take time to work through that and that's why we say it will take to mid 2016 to get that decision.","Ryan Connors","And it's my understanding that the application seeks to establish the WRAM balance itself as a regulatory asset. Is that correct? And if so, can you give us a very brief Cliff Notes version of how that works?","Susan Story","Yes, it's essentially setting it up at an accounts receivable from the customer, which would be a regulatory asset.","Ryan Connors","And then, Susan, you mentioned that, you know, that the NARUC summer meetings, some of your sustainability initiatives were highlighted and that's great. Good you also kind of give us any take-aways from those meeting in terms of what's around the corner just looking ahead at the big regulatory developments, any big topics there about, you know, what might be next in terms of policy developments or regulatory, you know, evolution in the water space?","Susan Story","Sure, I'll start it and then Walter may have a couple things since he was at the meetings also. One of the things that we're very excited about that was launched at the summer NARUC meeting is a step forward in terms of not just water energy nexus but to look at -- in most state utility commissions they look separately at electric, gas and water.","One of the things that President Edgar rolled out was an effort at NARUC to start looking at where all utilities could come together on common items such as, for example, critical infrastructure, cyber security, looking at how we could work together, looking at the fact that now that things like the mechanisms for infrastructure replacement.","There are a lot of issues at state utility commissions that really cross the boundaries of electricity, gas and water, and so there's an effort to create this project or this task force at NARUC to look at what those are and where commissions can work with utilities in a state to find the areas that we can find some common ground and some common efforts. An example for us in California is the Monterey pilot, the AMI pilot that Walter mentioned.","What that is, is that we actually partnered with specific gas and electric and we're using some of their backbone to put the water meters there so we can send alerts to those customers they have a very steep tiered pricing structure for water in Monterey, so we can actually send, as part of the customers on the pilot, signals when they're about to enter a new tier of pricing or they've set a budget and we can send them messages when they're getting close to the budget. That's just one an example.","We're very involved and actually American Water, we adopt the electric utility industry missed standards for cyber security. We're very involved with the Department of Homeland Security and DOD in those things. So there's a lot efforts like that, and we are very excited at NARUC where we're looking at cross utility-type projects that can benefit all of us.","Walter Lynch","I think Susan did a great job recapping the meeting. I mean the four areas again that she mentioned, water energy nexus and opportunities for us to look for the electric and gases, cyber security in the same way, regulatory mechanisms that are going to be continued to incentivize us to invest and upgrade our water and waste water systems and where can we partner with electric and gases to drive better customer service. Those are the key themes that I saw coming out of NARUC.","Operator","The next question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Michael Lapides","One question on the Clear Water acquisition, Keystone Claire Water acquisition, keeping in a separate legal structure, how do you think about the optionality that creates if this business continues to grow in terms of potential revisions to the corporate structure, in terms of whether this is a business that, and I don't know if legally it could, is this a business that could eventually wind up in an MLP structure? And if you don't mind addressing that first and then I may do one follow-up.","Susan Story","Okay, sure. We did look at that and I will tell you that just a little more color around the legal structure. So there's separate holding company, that Water Solutions Holding, that actually is the holding company for Keystone Clear Water, and that holding company is 95% owned by American Industrial Water, which is also a separate LLC, and 5% from Sand Hills Management, which is the founding members, which includes the current CEO and President and COO. So we're glad they not only are staying to run the business, they continue to have an equity ownership. So that's how it's structured legally.","We did actually, Michael, get -- we took a look at MLPs. A few things just to let you know, so we are constantly monitoring it, the EBITDA last year of Keystone Clear Water was around $15 million. Even some of the smaller MLPs are between $50 million and $70 million EBITDA, so scale-wise, it's just not quite large enough. No. 2, you know, we've just purchased Keystone. You have to have a predictability of the cash distributions. We're continually looking at that as we get into looking at this business.","And, of course, the big thing you've got to have really pretty clear visibility into the future growth potential. You know, kind of people talk about the feed the beast issue. So in terms of the future, we're always open to all options that make sense to our shareholder interest, and we are looking at those variety of things. At this point, it doesn't make sense to do a MLP.","Michael Lapides","One follow-up, actually, on the core regulated business and really an M&A question. You all have been excellent over the years in terms of doing kind of small bolt-on acquisitions. What's your thought process around, or what's your market dynamic and opportunity set around, kind of more larger scale M&A. It's, obviously, a far more fragmented business than the electric and gas, but just trying to curious when you look at the landscape of publicly traded or kind ever larger private or municipal owned ones.","Susan Story","I will start and then I want Walter to fill in because he and his team have done a lot of work on this. In terms of looking at other IOUs, you're always looking at the marketplace, but the fact is it's a pretty well valued space out there, but we're always looking at all options. Where I think our sweet spot is, though, something that Walter and his team have put a priority on, so Walter, do you want to talk about kind of the focus going forward on the regulated [indiscernible].","Walter Lynch","Yes. We still pursue the smaller acquisitions but our focus is really on the five to 25,000 customer systems, and we see a number of opportunities. I've been in this business many years, two decades, and this is the best environment for acquisitions that I've seen. I think because municipalities are looking for options, and we, as the largest water and waste water company in United States, have tremendous expertise that we can share with these municipalities.","So the opportunities are huge. They're also with some of the fiscal issues that they're facing. It's a tough environment for some of these municipalities. I think the other thing is we work very closely with the legislatures to provide enabling legislation that allows us to pay a fair market value and really reduce the bureaucracy and some of these acquisitions. So that's our focus. We have great people out in our state that are focused primarily on growing the business, from the state leadership teams to the growth teams, and we've -- I think we've been doing a very good job and more to come.","Operator","The next question comes from Spencer Joyce with Hilliard Lyons. Please go ahead.","Spencer Joyce","Just one real quick one here from me, I want to jump back to keystone. Correct me if I misheard, but I believe the purchase may have been qualified as asset light earlier in the call. And when we think about water service, I mean trucks, pipes, tanks asset light is not what comes to my mind. And then to kind of follow-up, if it really were an asset light business, why you would you all have looked an at MLP structure? Can you speak to any of those points?","Linda Solomon","Absolutely, Spencer, let me start and then I'll ask Susan if she has anything to add. In terms of the asset light, you're right. The things that are owned by Keystone are really the pumps, the pipes, the valves and a temporary storage tank. We also see vehicles as part of the assets as well.","Susan Story","And so the current model includes both permanent pipelines as well as temporary pipelines that are owned by Keystone. So that's one element of it today. The assets are -- or the business is very asset light. The audited financials were about $36 million in assets at the end of December. So that gives you a feel for the size of it.","As Susan mentioned on the MLP structure, I mean this is one of the things that we look at is what are the future growth potential and can you continuously have a transparent pipeline for growth in the business. And that's one of the key elements to look at from a MLP structure. And Spencer, to add to that when we talk about asset light, we do it in terms of our business overall, which we're so capital intensive in utilities in some spaces that may not seem as capital light. For us it does. However, one of the things we are looking at is the potential remember that as part of [indiscernible] as a 60% owner, there were capital constraints.","One of the things we are looking at strategically is the possibly or potential of actually deploying more capital to build longer-term pipelines as opposed to having the ENP fund them. What if we now have the capital, Keystone has the capital to actually fund some of those constructions and entertain things like take or pay contracts or those type things.","So the good news is you've got Keystone, which is an outstanding company. And I will tell you just to add to this, I spent a day with those folks out there before we closed, and after we announced the acquisition, and, culturally, they are -- it's been such an easy transition. They are from Pennsylvania. They grew up there. The CEO actually has a background in water, environmental remediation compliance. It's just an outstanding group of people, but they've had a certain suite of services that now with the purchase by American Water, we can maybe can broaden some of those suite of services, which could include more capital.","Spencer Joyce","Just to kind of recap here, so when we think kind of asset light in air quotes, you know, we're maybe drawing a comparison versus the utility, which would be perhaps more capital intensive. And then also from the standpoint of the business maybe a little bit lighter on assets versus what it could be given some of the constraints that [Rex] had previously.","Susan Story","You know what? I could not have said it better myself.","Operator","The next question comes from Jonathan Reeder with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Jonathan Reeder","I'll start out with the an easy point of clarify question. The $4 million net income headwind from weather that you mentioned, does that include July's impact as well? I might have missed that.","Linda Solomon","That is the impact in July and it's across all of our regions.","Susan Story","Yes. Jonathan, one thing we try to do, typically, we don't talk about the month outside the quarter. But because we were able to get the information, we wanted to go ahead and share that. That was not from the second quarter.","Jonathan Reeder","Okay. So for the I guess the first half of the year, what was the weather impact?","Linda Solomon","In the first half of the year, we had an increase in demand, or in the second quarter we in an increase in demand, of about $2.7 million. Over half of that was associated with an increase in our commercial customers, and then the remainder of it was weather related. And what we saw was on the residential side, we had hotter or dryer weather in the northeast, and given our geographic diversity, that was offset somewhat by the wet weather that was in the central region.","Jonathan Reeder","So, pretty much if we if through July, I mean you're kind of at break even or so from a weather impact and everything, nothing too major?","Linda Solomon","So we are negative all the way through July from a weather standpoint because we had that $4 million approximate net income impact in July, the month of July.","Susan Story","But yes. But January through June you could say it was break even.","Jonathan Reeder","Yes. Okay. And then\u2026","Walter Lynch","One can offset the other, right.","Jonathan Reeder","Yes. Okay. Then the military bases that you mentioned, you might get awards for this year that they might announce, are these just the ones that you're involved with, or is that kind of encompassing the whole RFP space?","Linda Solomon","We're only tracking the ones we're involved with, Jonathan, and we only -- the ones that we're involved with typically are medium to larger size. We don't get involved with the smaller ones. So there could be.","Jonathan Reeder","Okay. And then do you expect a pickup in the pace of RFP awards going forward, or, you know, maybe you can talk about how many are open right now that you're actively bidding on?","Linda Solomon","There are numerous ones that are open. You know, pretty much probably high single-digits that are open. They're in varying stages. We have best guesses, and they're pretty spread out over the next two or three years, so but you know, you never know. It depends what's going on in Washington, what they're going through. I will tell you that we have this year seen more interest from the air force. In the past the army has been the service that has been most interested, and we still are seeing some RFPs from the army, but we're really seeing a lot of interest in the air force. And Jonathan, what we have disclosed previously is that we are active in several RFPs today with a gross revenue value of $1.5 billion to the extent that we would be successful in all of them.","Jonathan Reeder","You said $1.5 billion gross revenue and that's for the 50 years?","Linda Solomon","Correct.","Jonathan Reeder","Walter, I didn't know if you could give any kind of update on the New Jersey and West Virginia rate cases, how they're kind of progressing and how you would handicap the prospects for reaching settlements?","Walter Lynch","Let me start by saying they're both progressing on schedule. So, typically, New Jersey, it's 9 months to 12 month to get a rate order. We filed in early January. That's going according to plan. In West Virginia, there's a 11-month rate case process, and again it's moving according to schedule so nothing to be concerned about for both of those.","Jonathan Reeder","Okay. How about on West Virginia? I mean it's been a bit of a challenge, you know, your past few cases there. You know, you, obviously, had the challenges last year that, you know, weren't necessarily your fault but you needed to respond to them. You know, how is the outlook there? It was a pretty large, you know, ask in part because you haven't gotten what you've needed in the past. What's kind of been the response in West Virginia?","Walter Lynch","Well, our team's doing a great job working through, the rate case process and talking about the value that we provide to our customers. And, we're confident that we're going to continue to make that case and we're hopeful to get a fair outcome.","Jonathan Reeder","Okay. And then what would be the timing on the outcome 11 months would put us into is it early 2016?","Walter Lynch","Around April 1st of 2016.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Brian Chin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Brian Chin","Just piggybacking on the last question, I know it's really early on here, but for the Missouri rate case, just thoughts on possibility of a settlement there. That would be great.","Susan Story ","So this we have just filed a rate case in Missouri on July 31st, and so we are going to be working through the process as we normally do in this case.","Walter Lynch","Yes. And, typically, in Missouri it takes 11 months, and we are working through that process and, you know, it's right on schedule even though we just filed.","Brian Chin","Can you remind me again, historically, have you guys gotten settlements in Missouri or not?","Walter Lynch","Yes, we have.","Brian Chin","Great, and roughly at what point in the process does most of the leg work on that settlement and an agreement typically get reached?","Linda Solomon","You know, it really depends on rate case by rate case, company by company. It's really hard to predict that, you know, you go through the process and it can happen as we work together.","Brian Chin","And then one last question for me, because most of my other questions were asked and answered, any update on sort of the corporate headquarters move? I would love to get an update there.","Susan Story","We are in the beginning stages of that. The latest information is that we have received approval of the tax credit in New Jersey, which if we determine that we would move to the Camden location, we would be able to effectuate those tax credits. We are currently in the process of looking for location, and so we are working through that. And to the extent that we can find a location in the Camden area, we are very excited about seeing part of the revitalization in that city.","Brian Chin","Is there a sense of timing as to when you guys will make a decision on what you want to do there?","Susan Story","The credits are for a three year period where the clock started in June. And then we have the opportunity to have an extension of six months automatically and a request of an additional six months that would be due -- that would be met with approval requirements, so a three to four year period.","Operator","The next question comes from Barry Klein with Macquarie. Please go ahead","Barry Klein","This might be a little bit in-depth, but in the pyramid that you always put onto the slides in the presentation, you added -- it looks like you added a new area entitled Other. And I was just wondering if you could please explain what it meant for that portion of the period -- the pyramid.","Susan Story","Well, Barry, that's a great question. We have actually included Other in the past couple of years, but we have not -- you are correct. We have not talked about it a lot. We put that in there because one of the things, one of the advantages we have at American Water with our size and scale, we have our own R&B group and we have 20 scientists. And most of their work is dedicated to finding better ways to do our business, bring efficiency, water quality. We work along with the EPA. We work with foundations, actually, all over the world including Israel as opposed to Europe on new technologies in the water industry.","What happens when we do that while the focus of making our business more efficient, we also, at times of opportunity with partnering up with starter companies where out of our deployment in testing we're able to get small interests in some of these businesses. So, you know, not a big thing, but it's called our -- and we have an innovation development process. We actually came up with the process called TNT Express that is used in wastewater plants that reduces the energy of aeration by 50%, and it -- carbon edition by up to 100%. We actually did an international license agreement with Abengoa on that, which, you know, last year maybe was a $0.5 million, not a lot of money.","But this other is almost a [holding] category for lots of smaller things like that, that may or may not be something down the road. There's no, in the long-term triangle, we don't assign any weight to it in terms of how much of the growth is going to provide, but we put it up there because there could be some things like that that come up. And, again, this is not big investment into things for the purpose of creating new business. It's investment into opportunities that help our base business be better, but, potentially, could result in some income.","Operator","The next question comes from David Paz from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","David Paz","Just on the regulated acquisition strategy, I know there have been some companies [indiscernible] on to expand their water business, you know. And they are seeking to buy small water companies. Have you seen competition pick up, or noticeably picked up, for your regulated acquisition?","Walter Lynch","You know, we have -- we operate in 16 states, so we have varying levels of competition in each of the states where we operate, but by far we are the biggest and we have the biggest footprint. It gives us an opportunity to expand out, get to know different municipal leaders, so I think we have a competitive advantage there. I think the other huge competitive advantage we have is that we worked on legislation that allows us to buy wastewater systems and share those costs with our water customers. And, for example, in New Jersey, we have 650,000 customers. When we buy a system, we can spread the cost across that huge customer base and minimize the impact on those customers that we just acquired. So we use that for our advantage. We use that for advanced of our customers and providing great customer service for them.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks.","Susan Story","Well, thank you so much, Gary, and thanks to everybody for joining us today. We had a good quarter, and I just want to remind you that, you know, all of this happens because of the 6700 employees that we have out there every day. We talk about the facts, you know. We talk about the numbers, but these are our employees out there serving one customer at a time every day. And I tell you we are very fortunate in our industry to have some of the best people anywhere, making sure that we are able to be up here today talking about the numbers that we were able to accomplish. So I want to give a shout out to them and thank them for all their hard work. And thank you for all of your questions and for supporting our company.","Operator","The conference is now concluded.

Mr. Vallejo, you may begin.","Edward Vallejo","Good morning, everyone, and welcome to American Water's 2012 Year End Conference Call. As usual, we'll keep our call to about an hour and at the end of our prepared remarks, we will have time for questions. But before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that during the course of this conference call, both in our prepared remarks and in answers to your questions, we may make statements related to our future performance, and our statements represent our most reasonable estimates.

Good morning to you, all, and thank you for joining us today. I'll be joined in the presentation by Ellen Wolf, our Chief Financial Officer; and in addition, Walter Lynch, who heads our Regulated Operations this year to help with your good questions that I'm sure you'll have.","Before delving into the results of 2012, let me just make an opening comment. As you know, Ellen announced her retirement from our company in January. And I just want to take this opportunity to thank her for her tremendous dedication, expertise and leadership during the 12 years that she has served our company. On a personal basis, it's been a true pleasure to work with you and to really see the caliber and commitment that she has brought. Her direction of our financial objectives and obligations has helped us deliver strong results year-over-year, and she is about as red as the shirt that she's wearing right now. I also want to thank her for helping to ensure a smooth transition. As you know, Susan Story will join us on April 1 as our new CFO. I believe a number of you know her, and personally, I'm thrilled to bring someone with her diverse background to our company. Her experience and breadth of skills make her an excellent fit for this position and for American Water, and we look forward to introducing her to those of you who may not have had a chance to get to know her in the past at our next earnings call in May.","So today, we are pleased to present the very strong results that we achieved in 2012, really the outcome of sound execution of our business plan on many fronts.","So if you go to Slide 5, for 2012, we reported an 8% increase in revenue, an 18% improvement in cash flow from operations, a 22% increase in net income and a 20% increase in diluted earnings per share from continuing ops. Our return on equity, adjusted for the abnormally hot and dry summer, improved about 49 basis points over 2011. And remember that we've got about $1.2 billion of debt at the parent. And given the cost of that, when you take that into account, that means that our Regulated Operations earned a return on equity of just about 9% last year. And in the midst of this strong year of performance, our board authorized an 8.7% increase in the dividend in -- or for the dividend in 2012. So as a company, the challenge we laid out for ourselves in 2010 to build a culture of continuous improvement and excellence is firmly taking root and providing a pathway to sustainable and profitable growth.","Now let's turn to Slide 6, and let me talk about the other goals that we accomplished in 2012 that led to strong -- that lead to the strong prospects that I believe we have for the future. 2012 was a year of optimizing and enhancing our business portfolio to ensure that we're operating in areas that maximize value to our customers and shareholders. We acquired a total of 16 water and wastewater systems through accretive transactions, adding more than 55,000 customers to our base. We also closed on the sale of our Regulated Operations in New Mexico, Arizona and Ohio, which generated over $560 million in cash proceeds. That cash is now being more effectively deployed in our other Regulated Operations. We also saw growth through agreements with shale gas developers to build pipelines to support drilling operations in the Marcellus Shale area, which also enable us to provide the public with much-needed clean treated water service.","In 2012, we doubled the revenue from hydraulic fracturing contracts to about $3 million with a 74% increase in sales to in excess of 430 million gallons. Our homeowner services business expanded into 10 more states and has partnered with New York City to provide service line protection programs to its 650,000 eligible homeowners. This program, which was just launched last month, has seen a very strong response rate, already in excess of 7%.","Now in recognition of the investments we make in infrastructure in our Regulated Operations to ensure our quality service to customers, during 2012, we resolved 10 rate cases, bringing in annualized revenue increases of over $120 million, and we also filed 4 rate requests. An important regulatory tool, the DSIC mechanism, was approved in New Jersey. We responded by putting forward a plan to incrementally invest $220 million over the next 3 years in New Jersey, and that's in addition to the base level of about $20 million a year or $60 million for that 3-year period. With the inclusion of DSIC in New Jersey, we now have 6 states with such a infrastructure recovery mechanism, and that includes all of our 5 largest states, enabling the timely recovery of about 30% of our total CapEx spend.","The Regulated Business continued to increase efficiency and manage costs resulting in an O&M efficiency ratio adjusted for the midpoint of the estimated weather impact of 40.7% for 2012. So even adjusting for the weather, we drove 170 basis point improvement in this ratio, approximately the same reduction we saw in 2011 from 2010.","The investments we make into our infrastructure and systems, which have amounted over $1.8 billion in the last 2 years, is key to our commitment to provide safe and reliable service. If you think back about 2012, extreme weather highlighted the importance of long-term planning and appropriate investment to ensure sustainability and resiliency of our operations. During the summer drought, for example, we saw the benefits of our water supply investments in our Southern and Midwest service areas. And when Hurricane Sandy slammed into the East Coast, our dedicated employees, the preparation that they had done and our system enhancements kept the water flowing even through widespread and sustained power outages. It's also worth noting that as we build resiliency into our systems to help withstand weather volatility, one of the key tools that we use is the leveraging of technology and innovation. Let me just give you an example.","As you know, most utilities use GIS systems to locate on maps their facilities relative to other pieces of infrastructure, roads, curbs, gutter, those kinds of things, so you have a sense of where your equipment is relative to other equipment that may exist in the right-of-way. We've expanded beyond that to -- in some of our areas, we're starting to use GPS facility mapping, which means that we have the ability to locate it just through GPS coordinates and the satellites. And let me tell you how handy that came in. When Hurricane Sandy hit and the New Jersey barrier island was in the midst of devastation and you had 2 to 4 feet of sand and piles of debris and moved houses, some moved as many as 7 blocks, and boats littered every place, you couldn't find traditional landmarks. You couldn't find a curb, you couldn't even find the street. And so with our GPS coordinates, we are able to locate every one of our facilities, our valves, be able to control our valves so we can bring water back safely. And we are also able to help communities find their equipment that they could not find, like roads. So when they're trying to clear a road, they don't know where the [indiscernible] plows go. And so we were able, based on finding our equipment, then be able to map for them where the boundaries for those roads were. This will help -- this is the kind of tool that will help us with resiliency as we move forward.","In 2012, we also took Phase I of our conversion to SAP, and this included the financial and human resource modules, we took it live. Now while there are always struggles in implementing these complex systems, as I'm sure you have talked to many companies that have been through this, an independent review we had done concluded that this was an above average implementation compared to more than 100 similar projects. And at this stage, we are on the schedule and budget that was established almost 4 years ago for this project. While we did incur some higher O&M costs at the end of last year with implementation, these costs were relatively small compared to the overall $320 million project cost, and that number includes AFUDC, you may recall.","Turning to Slide 7, our long-term EPS growth target has been and continues to be 7% to 10%. And our history over the last 3 years demonstrates our capacity to achieve that long-term target. Given our past performance and the strategy we are implementing for the future, we're confident we will continue to meet that long-term goal. For 2013, we announced our guidance range of $2.15 to $2.25 per share, which puts our annual growth from a weather-adjusted 2012 between 8% and 13%. Interestingly, our EPS in 2008 was $1.10 per share. So at the midpoint of our guidance range for '13 of $2.20 per share, in a 5-year period through 2013, we will have doubled earnings.","And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Ellen, who will provide details on our financial performance.","Ellen C. Wolf","Thank you very much, Jeff, and good morning to those of you who are listening to our earnings conference call. Let me take a few moments now to describe the underlying factors that drove our 2012 results. More details will be available when our 10-K is filed.","Turning now to Slide 9. As Jeff indicated, 2012 was another year of solid financial results with continued increases in revenue, net income and cash flow. For 2012, we reported operating revenues of approximately $2.9 billion, a $211 million increase over the revenue reported for 2011. Net income from continuing operations for '12 was approximately $374 million or $2.11 per common share, an approximate 23% growth rate over the prior year. This is driven mainly by higher revenues in our Regulated Businesses of around $196 million and our continued focus on expense control. As we have mentioned previously, we believe the estimated impact of the hot, dry weather in the summer of '12 was around $0.13 to $0.16 per share for the year. Net cash provided by operating activities for '12 was around $956 million compared to approximately $808 million for 2011, primarily driven by the increase in operating revenues, changes in working capital, lower pension and postretirement health care contribution and long-term tax planning.","Now I'd like to discuss briefly the various components of our income from continuing operations starting, of course, with revenues.","Turning to Slide 10. Overall, revenues increased approximately $211 million, with the Regulated Business increasing around $196 million or 8.3% from 2011. The increase in revenues was primarily driven by rate authorizations related to the needed maintenance and updating of our water systems and higher customer demand in our Midwest and Eastern states over the prior year. For 2012, the impact of these rate authorizations, including investment surcharges, was approximately $129 million. The increase in revenues associated with higher demand over the prior year amounted to approximately $39 million. Also, in 2012, revenue increases from acquisitions was approximately $27 million, primarily driven by the acquisition of systems in New York in the second quarter. For our market-based businesses, revenues increased approximately $3 million, with continued growth in homeowner services and our military contracts.","Turning to Slide 11. As you know, our ability to invest in our infrastructure is driven by our ability to earn an appropriate rate of return on our investments. The extent to which requested rate increases are granted by the applicable regulatory authorities varies. This slide shows rate cases that have been filed and we are awaiting final orders on, as well as rate cases and infrastructure charges that have been recently granted. Annualized revenues from general rate cases effected in 2012 were $120.5 million. After year end, an additional $4.9 million in step-increases authorized in previous rate cases became effective. For 2013 through February 26, we were granted $24.9 million or about $25 million of annualized revenues related to infrastructure surcharges.","We are currently awaiting final orders for general rate cases in 2 states where we are requesting around $37 million in total additional annual revenues. And as Jeff mentioned, in 2012, our New Jersey subsidiary submitted and had approved a foundational filing for a distribution system improvement charge. The benefit of this filing for our customers and our shareholders is not expected until later in 2013 as we ramp up our infrastructure investment spend in New Jersey.","Turning our attention now to water sales volumes. Total sales volumes increased 4.1% in 2012. As you can see, this increase in water sales volume was mainly driven by our residential customer class, which is up 5% from 2011, mainly as a result of warmer, drier weather in our Eastern states through July and Midwestern states into September; and also, our customers -- our commercial customer class, which is up 4.1% for the year. Also contributing to the increased sales volume was our increase in customers mainly from our New York acquisition.","Turning now to Slide 13. Total operating expenses for 2012 increased approximately $89 million from 2011, driven by our increased consumption, acquisitions and a $7 million donation to the American Water Charitable Foundation. Let me take a minute and discuss the main categories on this chart. Production cost in the Regulated Business increased $12.2 million, driven mainly by an increase in purchased water cost, particularly in California and Illinois, which was a result of higher consumption. Our employee-related costs decreased almost $18 million, primarily due to higher capitalization and reduced headcount as a result of vacancies. Conversely, operating supplies and services did increase around $23.7 million for the year, primarily due to incremental contractor costs related to backfilling the vacancies that I just mentioned and incremental costs relating to the stabilization of our ERP conversion.","Additionally, in 2012, there were also costs involved in projects to improve processes and operating efficiencies over the long term. As we've discussed previously, for 2013, our business transformation project will be rolling out the enterprise asset management system, which will manage an asset's life cycle, and our customer information system to better serve our customers. We will continue to keep you posted on our progress in these areas.","Maintenance, materials and services, which includes emergency repairs, as well as cost for preventative maintenance increased $8 million. This is mainly attributable to increased preventative maintenance expenses throughout our regulated subsidiaries, including tank painting; meter testing; pump, tank and well maintenance; and paving costs.","Operating expenses for our market-based business decreased slightly in 2012. This, combined with their revenue growth, produced an over 16% increase in our market-based pretax income from continuing operations.","And lastly, we also experienced higher depreciation of around $30 million compared to the same period last year. This is due to our continued investment in needed infrastructure for our utilities.","Finally, based on these strong results for the year and attention to cost controls, our regulated O&M efficiency ratio continues to improve. For 2012, stripping out the weather impact, the ratio stands at 40.7% compared to 42.7% for 2011. This is due to the great efforts of the employees throughout all of American Water.","And with that, I'd like to turn the call back to Jeff for any closing comments before we open it up for your questions.","Jeffry E. Sterba","Thanks, Ellen. Going to Slide 15, so besides EPS of $2.15 to $2.25 per share, what can you expect from us in this next year? First and foremost, we will maintain the same customer-centric dedication to providing safe, reliable water and wastewater services. We'll also continue to stay very active on the public policy and regulatory front, promoting constructive regulatory frameworks and continuing to address regulatory lag that impacts our return on investment. We plan to resolve 3 rate cases in the course of the year and file up to 4 general rate cases, as well as infrastructure surcharge filings. We will also continue our focus on operational efficiency and bolstering a culture of continuous improvement, effectively managing costs and leveraging processes and technology to create value. So the implementation of the SAP platform is an example. That is going to provide us greater transparency into our cost drivers. And the impact of the best practices that we will be able to study and understand that we have in one state and be able to transfer that to the rest of our operations. This will help us approve our regulated O&M efficiency ratio and meet our 5-year goal of having it below 40% in 2015, 1 or 2 years early.","You can expect that we'll also continue to invest approximately $900 million to upgrade our systems, with the goal always being to balance these needed investments to ensure reliability with our concomitant rate impacts. Realizing savings and efficiencies from our supply chain initiatives will help us achieve greater efficiency of capital spend so we generate more dollar for each -- more value for each dollar invested. And there's just a fascinating array of examples that we have on the supply chain side of where we're finding opportunities.","On our market-based businesses, we're focused on new offerings in existing markets and product and market line extensions. For example, we have now successfully piloted a program to provide gas and electric line protection programs, and we'll be rolling these out to existing customers of our water and service line protection products. We've also expanded homeowner services into more states and expect to have operations in 39 states by the end of the year. And we have a growing pipeline of additional military bases slated for privatization, though we recognize that this is not a fast process, as it usually takes 18 to 20 months for anyone to go from a bid to contracting stage. Finally, we also anticipate additional extensions in our regionalization strategy to help serve shale gas development in the Marcellus area.","We will also continue to leverage technology and innovation through our innovation development process, which we've talked about in the past, and we'll look to commercialize these offerings. Recall that this innovation development process effectively creates a testbed where we can look at taking emerging technologies, allow them to be demonstrated in the hands-on environment of an operating utility. In return for doing that, and obviously, we control it through its process, we will have the opportunity to take an interest in that business and also to help ensure that we can deploy that technology effectively through our regulated and market-based operations.","So in 2012, we did a lot of work leveraging the interdependency between water and energy. Earlier this year, we signed a joint development arrangement with a company that developed a standardized communications platform that creates interoperability among any meter manufacturers. In addition to seamlessly integrating different types of meters, this platform is able to receive many kinds of data from the water distribution network, including pressure, water quality, leak detection and flow, and not just meter data. This creates a powerful tool for meter reading and billing but also for the collection of real-time system data so that we can better manage and operate the distribution network, detect leaks and the like. Now this is just an example of the prospects we see coming from the innovation development process.","We will also continue to offer the scale, scope and efficiency of American Water's operational water resource, environmental, supply chain and capital management expertise to other utilities through tuck-ins and acquisitions, as well as well-structured long-term market-based arrangements. All of our 2013 targets will anchor our long-term EPS growth range goal of 7% to 10%. We're pleased with the performance that we achieved in 2012 coming on the heels of also another great year in 2011, and we look to continue that momentum in 2013.","With that, we'd be happy to take any questions you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Kevin Cole from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Kevin Cole - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Ellen, congrats on your retirement and finding a worthy successor.","Ellen C. Wolf","Thank you.","Kevin Cole - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I guess, Jeff, just on, I guess, this process. I guess given your holdco structure, you obviously had an abundance of qualified internal candidates. And so what new skill set do you believe that Susan will bring to the organization, and how do you expect her to evolve the CFO position?","Jeffry E. Sterba","Yes. Very good question. What Susan brings to the table is, one, senior roles in a much larger company that has strong multistate experience. And her breadth of experience goes from everything, from all of the fundamental services that have financial impacts like supply chain and IT, et cetera, to the running of a business and the reporting of a CFO to her through that process, to being part of that management team and the financial acumen that she developed both through her school, through schooling, as well as through the roles that she had, which included oversight over a number of different functions, everything from the marketing and the derivative issues associated with that to rates. And what I think you'll find with Susan is that she is a very well-known commodity in the regulatory community with exceptionally high marks. And so it's that breadth that she brings, and I would say that, that breadth we're able to utilize because of the strength of the financial team that we have inside the company. Bill Rogers and Mark Chesla highlight really that -- our 2 key folks, bring enormous capacity and capability in the controllers function, and Mark is moving to be the Principal Accounting Officer. And in Bill's case, not just capital markets but also -- because that's second nature to him because of his background, but he also brings a strategic acumen. So I don't think about finance as a functional, narrow silo. I think about finance as a resource that enables the business to be the best that it can be. And the broader base the experience of the people that are in that area, the better able they are able -- they can provide that value while we also make sure that we've got the necessary and appropriate controls, accounting mechanisms and visibility, transparency into the financials of the company.","Kevin Cole - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","All right. That's actually a very good answer. And then should I also view this as it's CFO position today but likely evolving into maybe succession plans for you as well, your successor, sorry?","Jeffry E. Sterba","My succession plans are not even my subject, that's the board's. So what my objective is to ensure that when we have the opportunities to expand our skill sets, strengthen our bench, that we exercise those opportunities because they don't come around very often. And I think through a number of the hirings that we've done in the last 1.5 years, 2 years, probably with the exception of maybe them deciding to hire me, we've had great success. From Bill Rogers coming in as Treasurer, to a person that we hired, brought in recently to head supply chain who's got a wealth of experience as VP of supply chain in many companies from pharma to telecom, to the individual we've got running our continuous improvement in process excellence, Lean Six Sigma, to a new head of HR. In each of these cases, we have, I believe, enhanced our bench strength that gives us the ability to look at succession in a different way for a lot of positions. So I had the luxury of never being able to hold a job for about more than 18 months because I just kept getting moved to different things. And the result was I learned a lot about a lot of different pieces. That makes an executive much more effective, I think, particularly at the senior level. So to have people that have that broad-based experience, for Walter that have operated in the competitive world and now operate in the regulated world, that gives great exposure and experience to both of those markets which are different. So anytime we have the opportunity to enhance and strengthen our bench, I'm all for it.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Weisel from Macquarie Capital.","Andrew M. Weisel - Macquarie Research","Just one question on behalf of Angie Storozynski. Regarding the flow through tax accounting for repair cost in Pennsylvania, why haven't you changed your tax accounting for that?","Ellen C. Wolf","Thanks. Let me -- if I could just step back and give a little history on this. Let me start with the fact that we adopted this in 2008 on a system-wide, total company-wide basis. So we have had and will continue to have the cash benefit of this since 2008.","Jeffry E. Sterba","And really that goes back to 2005, right? Because...","Ellen C. Wolf","Right, right. To the extent we could identify any of those generated losses to prior years, we were able to do that. We have created out of this, plus other things that have happened over the years such as bonus depreciation, we have an NOL on our books of about $1 billion. And our goal is around maximizing cash. So what we wanted to do, my run to the normalization is really match when the benefit is given to our customer with when we actually receive the benefit on our taxes. And because we have NOLs, most of that benefit will be in the future, and that's when we are matching it with when we give the benefit to our customer.","Jeffry E. Sterba","Let me add just one thing. If you think about -- the way I look at it, obviously, I weren't around, when they had the foresight to take this action as early as they did, so we've picked up the benefit of this for our customers for now really going back to 2005, so 8 years. If you think about it, when you flow through something, yes, it flows through your income statement but it also flows through the rate-making treatment for that year. When you normalize it, it goes over time to the shareholder and to the customer, so it links the 2. For us, given that NOL position, if we flowed through, yes, you may get a bump in earnings in 1 year, but then you're going to reduce in the following year when you have the rate case occur. And for us, we operate in 16 states having a policy that works across all states, has worked well. We'll always take a look at new approaches. But what doesn't sound very attractive to me is to give the cash back to customers when we can't get the cash from the IRS for another 10 years because we've got the NOL carryforwards that are already keeping us from being a cash tax payer except for AMT. So for me, that's the real issue. If we were in a different tax position and didn't have the benefit of that NOL position, I may have a different approach to it.","Ellen C. Wolf","I'd also add, you can see the benefit of our doing the repairs and maintenance in our cash flow, it continues to grow stronger every year. And that's important to us as a company. It's important to our customers because it allows us to invest more in the infrastructure. It's important to our shareholders and customers in the sense of it's very low-cost financing.","Jeffry E. Sterba","Well, and it's what keeps us from having to issue other instrument that would be dilutive to your earnings.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Leslie Rich from JPMorgan.","Leslie Rich - J.P. Morgan Asset Management, Inc.","I wondered if you could go into a bit more detail on the New Jersey DSIC spending. I think you said it was $220 million of spending, and I'm just wondering over what period of time and how that actually rolls through your rates in terms of the timing of the true-ups and things.","Jeffry E. Sterba","Yes, let me ask Walter to answer.","Walter J. Lynch","Yes. In our foundational filing, we said we'd spend up to $220 million, that gets us to the 5% of revenue cap that we have. And that's over and above the $20 million each year of base spending. So that $220 million, we'll invest, and every 6 months, we'll do a filing, and then the commission wants 60 days to look at it, and then allow us to put it on the bills.","Jeffry E. Sterba","And that's over 3 years.","Leslie Rich - J.P. Morgan Asset Management, Inc.","The $220 million is over...","Walter J. Lynch","That's over 3 years, that's correct.","Jeffry E. Sterba","And I will tell you, we are looking at whether some of that should be advanced into a tighter period but it will be $220 million over no more than 3 years.","Leslie Rich - J.P. Morgan Asset Management, Inc.","And then you -- I'm sorry, could you go through the timing of how that actually rolls through rate?","Ellen C. Wolf","Sure, well, what happens is you file a filing with the commission, so similar to New Jersey where -- to Pennsylvania where you have a surcharge on the bill, you would have a surcharge on the bill for every 6 months for your filing and what you're authorized to spend and approved to spend. And then when you file your rate case, that surcharge rolls up into the normal rates.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Subbing in for Neil a little bit right now. Real quick, just a question on the dividend. How are you thinking -- I know you've kind of talked about the dividend increase, but how are you thinking about long-term dividend payout ratio policies? And can you put that in conjunction with your view on kind of credit metrics, target credit ratings and how you're thinking about managing capital overall over a multiyear period?","Jeffry E. Sterba","Let me address the dividends and have Ellen address that relative to the credit metrics. From the dividend side, our philosophy and belief is that -- because it's always a trade-off between what are you -- how you can invest that cash and how you can return that cash and the balance between the 2, is that we have targeted a payout ratio in the 50% to 60% range and to have the dividend grow at something close to what our rate of increase in earnings per share is. If you look at the early years after the company came back into the public markets, the dividend probably lagged a little bit. And so we took a step of an additional increase last year. We're now frankly a little below the 50% payout ratio and the yield has gone down as our stock has been bid up. We view that positively but we also will look at that long-term philosophy of paying 50% to 60% relative to how we go about dividend decisions in 2013 and forward.","Ellen C. Wolf","A couple of things to note. Our cash flow continues to get much stronger. That has helped contribute to covering our capital and also our dividend. Our shareholder base looks at a combination of both growth in the stock and growth in the dividend, and we'll continue to look at dividend growth in terms of the right balance for our shareholders, as well as for the company so that we can reinvest that money back into the business. I'd also like to add that because of the strong cash flow that we've had and our known dividend policy, both rating agencies have put us on positive outlook. So we continue to see the benefit of our focus around this area.","Jeffry E. Sterba","And just to reinforce what Ellen said, our focus there is on cash, not cap structure. It's not that we don't look at cap structure, we do, but it used to be that you had to really focus on cap structure and think about getting to a 50-50 or what have you to be in the BBB+ or to move up into the A category. I think the rating agencies in one sense are more focused and smarter about what they really ought to be looking at is cash flow and the security of that cash flow, while you have boundaries around the cap structure that probably aren't as tight as they were before. So we're not focused on thickening the equity ratio for the sole purpose of getting an increase in rate. It's just that there's just not value there. But all the things we're doing to drive cash flow improvement, those will have the same impact, we believe, with the rating agencies.","Ellen C. Wolf","And if I could also add, just our equity ratio continues to strengthen based upon the strength of our earnings. So as of year end, we're a little bit above 44% equity where we started much lower 3 years ago.","Jeffry E. Sterba","Yes. I think there used to be some analysts who are always nervous that we're going to issue equity to thicken the equity ratio, and that's just not -- we see no need to do that.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Gerry Sweeney from Boenning.","Gerard J. Sweeney - Boenning and Scattergood, Inc., Research Division","[Audio Gap]","on your retirement. A quick question for you, Jeff. Obviously, with the hiring of Susan Story, she's got a lot of services experience, and you've talked about in the past always looking for some regulated-like programs. Are we going to see a little bit more additional focus in coming years on this, and maybe to rephrase it or to put a different way, what's your vision and strategy for this, the market-based opportunities? How is that going to develop and I sense there's stuff percolating under the surface, but I wanted to see what your thoughts were.","Jeffry E. Sterba","Relative to our market-based businesses, it's a small but important and growing part of our business. We demonstrated 16% increase year-over-year to '12, and I think it was higher than that in '11 to '12 -- I mean '10 to '11. So it's an important part of the business but it's not going to grow to be 30% of the business. It would have to grow exceptionally rapidly to just double its impact on our bottom line. We're focused on red light kinds of things. So certainly the businesses that we're in, which include the military services, the homeowner services, a revamped contract services group as we've talked about how we are not going to participate in the old traditional kinds of short-term based contract services groups, plus doing more frankly on the waste management side. As we expand in wastewater, we see more opportunities in solid waste management, and I don't mean trash, I mean the solid that come from wastewater, as well as reuse, which is effectively using the liquids that come from wastewater. So those we view -- I think about it in terms of logical business line extensions. At the same time, one of the things that we went out and said very early on was we're going to make sure that we get very good inside before we ever try to take anything outside. Because otherwise, it's a great recipe to get bad bigger -- bigger bad, and not get better. And so as we've increased, for example, our supply chain capability, is that something that we could also bring to the benefit of customers that are utilities, municipal utilities, that don't have access to the things we do, does it open other doors for us? Those are things that we'll explore, but I wouldn't -- I don't expect there to be any dramatic change in our risk profile, in the way that we think about the balance of our Regulated Business versus our competitive business. But do expect that, that focus on excellence will give us -- will open doors for what I'll call business line extensions, where you have adjacent opportunities rather than completely new opportunities.","Gerard J. Sweeney - Boenning and Scattergood, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And any comments on the revamped contract business? Obviously, there's always talk about 50,000-plus water systems in the U.S. There's pension issues, there's health care issues, in terms of payment of liabilities. Another thing that's sort of percolating under the surface, you see it now in town, thoughts on how that's developing?","Jeffry E. Sterba","I think from day 1, or at least when I came, I kind of expressed the sentiment that a number of my senior level cohorts here had, which is this is a slow market to develop. It reminded me of the old fuel cell issue, that fuel cells will be here in 5 years, but it's always another 5 years. But I do believe that it's changed some because of the persistency -- the persistence of the financial issue. And whether it's driven by pension, whether it's just driven by the lack of revolving fund access from the federal government, the shrinking of that pot, the almost complete dearth of grants from the federal government, and states being in the same situation, I think communities are having to face a different set of challenges. And if they're interested in having someone like us operate their systems and be a part of their community, we're going to be very interested in doing that, whether we do that under a acquisition, which is generally a preference on our side because it fits with what we do well, or it's done under a longer-term contract, we're willing to look at that. So I think there are more cracks. I mean, even in last year, we acquired some municipal systems. I expect that, that will happen this year. And so I think we'll see more, instead of the private tuck-ins, we'll see a little more on the municipal side. But it's still not going to be farm gates get opened.","Gerard J. Sweeney - Boenning and Scattergood, Inc., Research Division","Sure. I mean from my perspective, I would look at it as an incremental growth avenue, 1%, 2% in a good year, or something like that.","Jeffry E. Sterba","Absolutely.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Reeder from Wells Fargo.","Jonathan Reeder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Ellen, congrats on the upcoming retirement. I am truly jealous but you've done some great work, since [indiscernible] you came back to the public market in 2008, so it's well deserved.","Ellen C. Wolf","Well, thank you, and I also want to thank you and everyone on the phone for their continued support for American Water. It's a great company.","Jonathan Reeder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Most of my questions have been asked already this morning but, Jeff, are you targeting any sort of improvement in the O&M ratio in 2013? I know you have the 2015 goal that you said you may even hit 2 years early, which would be by the end of this year. But do you have any sort of kind of internal target that we might want to build into the model?","Jeffry E. Sterba","Well, until you said the last phrase, it was a one-word answer. And so there's 2, the answer is yes, but no, I'm not going to tell you. Well, I don't mean to be funny or flip about it, but we do obviously have a number of targets that we focus on internally. They're not, they all -- they have caveats and they've got ties, and so it gets too complicated to try to explain all of those to the external market. But rest assured, we do have targets, and I feel good about the progress we'll continue to make on that front. And that we will beat the 40% by the end of '15 by 1 or 2 years.","Jonathan Reeder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then I don't know if you can talk about the usage that you saw in 2012 absent the weather, was it similar to what you were forecasting going into the year, which I think was a decline of 0.7% to 0.8% on the residential side?","Ellen C. Wolf","Historically, what we've seen in terms of decline is about 1.5% to 2.5%. It's difficult to pull that out in any time frame, but in the off months, we do continue to see some decline.","Jeffry E. Sterba","Although it is -- we may see some leveling of that.","Jonathan Reeder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So your expectation for 2013?","Jeffry E. Sterba","It builds into it.","Ellen C. Wolf","It builds into the '13 number.","Operator","And I show no further questions in the queue at this time.

I want to thank Ellen again for everything that she's done for the company. And I'm going to give her the last word.","Ellen C. Wolf","All right. With that, this is a first. I just, again, I want to thank each and every one of you who are listening to this call for your continued support of American Water, for your in-depth questions -- they've kept us on our toes -- and your continuing to push us as we become each year a better and better company, so thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the American Water Fourth Quarter 2012 Results Conference Call.
